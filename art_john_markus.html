      <i>John Markus, in his own words:</i> "I started playing around with computer graphics when I was about 12 years old or so (I'm currently 27). Unfortunately I didn't see many career opportunities in it and pursued science instead. I got my BS is Engineering Physics, and am currently working on my MS in computer science. I've gotten into computer graphics again fairly recently when I had an opportunity to do some web development at work. Between work and school I don't have much free time, but spend most of it learning CGI. Hopefully one of these days I'll have enough time to work up a killer demo reel. Although I do thoroughly enjoy my current job, the idea of being paid to do this kind of stuff sounds really really cool!"<br>
      <br>
      John's personal web site is at <a href="http://members.xoom.com/Jmarkus/" target="_blank">http://members.xoom.com/Jmarkus/</a>.<br>
      <br>
      All of John's 3D artwork was created using a reasonably priced but professional 3D animation tool called Martin Hash Animation Master. It is available for Microsoft Windows PCs or PowerPC-based Macintosh. If this interests you, visit their <a href="http://www.hash.com/" target="_blank">home page</a> and check it out.
