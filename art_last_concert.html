      <br>
      The concert we saw went quite well that dark night;<br>
      Mystic Spiral had played perfectly.<br>
      But the highlight came when Trent gazed in my direction<br>
      And dedicated a song to me.<br>
      <br>
      His deep baby blues met my own windowed frames,<br>
      And the lights had turned soft and dim.<br>
      I sighed and I flushed, and my poor heart burst<br>
      With the love that I felt for him.<br>
      <br>
      I wished that the song would continue for years<br>
      But, sadly, it came to an end.<br>
      Then the concert was over, and Jane and I went<br>
      to meet with my new more-than-friend.<br>
      <br>
      We all had decided to go celebrate<br>
      At the diner for a job well done.<br>
      We talked and we laughed the whole night away-<br>
      I was actually having some fun.<br>
      <br>
      After we'd all had our fill of the food<br>
      And Jessie had his fill of beer,<br>
      We all headed out to the stoic old Tank,<br>
      With me hand in hand with my dear.<br>
      <br>
      Trent was exhausted and not fit to drive,<br>
      So Jessie sat behind the wheel.<br>
      I didn't think it was safe to go with,<br>
      But Jane said it was no big deal.<br>
      <br>
      So I trusted her judgement and climbed in the back,<br>
      And Jessie backed out on the road.<br>
      It started to rain, which would be quite ironic<br>
      If we'd seen what was to unfold.<br>
      <br>
      We rode for an hour, Trent asleep in the front,<br>
      And I stared at him all of the way.<br>
      Jane noticed and gave me a questioning look,<br>
      So I explained the events of the day.<br>
      <br>
      She began to respond, when I glanced at the dashboard<br>
      And saw we were going 83.<br>
      Jessie was laughing, and the lights of the car<br>
      Heading toward us was all I could see.<br>
      <br>
      I yelled and Jane screamed as Jess swerved to the right,<br>
      And the other car bounced off our rear.<br>
      We spiraled, screaming, and the last thing I saw<br>
      Were Trent's sleepy eyes widened with fear.<br>
      <br>
      We ricocheted off a large tree, and I<br>
      Was thrown out of the window, which broke.<br>
      I hurtled through the air, scared out of my mind<br>
      And choking on thick, black smoke.<br>
      <br>
      I skidded in glass, and when I came to a stop,<br>
      I heard some one give out a small moan.<br>
      Jane was 3 feet away, and I realized the blood<br>
      I lay in was not all my own.<br>
      <br>
      By a miracle, I lived, so like any scared fool,<br>
      I ran despite all my pain.<br>
      I was thrown to the ground as the van ignited,<br>
      Exploded, and burst into flames.<br>
      <br>
      I couldn't go back, for fear I'd be burned,<br>
      So I watched as my closest friends died.<br>
      And, disconcerted, out of options, I turned<br>
      Away, sat down, and I cried.<br>
      <br>
      So I sit in this pew dressed in black head to toe<br>
      And stare at the caskets of white.<br>
      Lined up in a row, closed, and covered with flowers,<br>
      Three friends bask in eternal light.<br>
      <br>
      As  I walk by the first, bitter hate burns my tongue.<br>
      Second, sorrow for the friend I will miss.<br>
      As I get to the third, I drop to my knees<br>
      And upon it bestow my first kiss.<br>
