      <b>Current Vocation:</b> Graduate of Lawndale High<br>

      <b>First Appearance:</b> <i>Esteemsters</i><br>
      <p align="justify">
      Andrea (pronounced <i>ahn-DREY-ah</i>) is, quite simply, the "goth chick." Little is known about her, but her manner of dress (dark eyeliner, gray shirt, long gray skirt, fishnet glove on one hand... that is, when she's not working as a stock clerk at her parent-enforced job at the local warehouse store) and her quiet demeanor all scream "dark." In fact, if her poetry is any indication, she could give Daria a run for her money in the "bleak outlook on life" department. She is in several of Daria's classes and has developed something of a cult following among the fans, with many of them hanging on her every non-syllable.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Status at end of series:</b>
      Graduated from Lawndale High. Last seen in the company of Upchuck, after accepting one of his typical come-ons at Jodie's graduation party.<br>
