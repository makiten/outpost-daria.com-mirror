      <b>Full Name:</b> Brittany Taylor<br>
      <b>Current Age:</b> 18<br>
      <b>Current Vocation:</b> Freshman at Great Prairie State University<br>
      <b>Season One Age:</b> 16<br>
      <b>Season One Vocation:</b> Sophomore at Lawndale High<br>
      <b>Parents:</b> Steve, Vivian (mother), and Ashley-Amber (stepmother) Taylor<br>

      <b>First Appearance:</b> <i>Esteemsters</i><br>
      <p align="justify">
      Brittany is Lawndale High's resident "airhead blonde." She is the head of the varsity cheerleading squad, which is practically the only thing she's good at since she's about as bright as a three watt light bulb. (Thinking is definitely not her strong suit; whenever she's confused, her usual response is a pathetic "Eep!" as her brain seizes up.) Her favorite activities include cheering, parties, shopping, her boyfriend Kevin, twirling her hair around her finger with a vacant look in her eyes, and listening to the soothing sound of the wind blowing between her ears. She and Daria are acquaintances, though Daria would probably hesitate to call her a "friend."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Status at end of series:</b>
      Graduated from Lawndale High. Accepted into the freshman class at Great Prairie State University. Still going out with Kevin, though that might not last for long since Kevin was held back at Lawndale High.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Daria on Brittany:</b>
      Kevin's main squeeze. Sugar and spice and <i>Cosmo</i> advice.<br>
