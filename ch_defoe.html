      <b>Full Name:</b> Claire Defoe<br>
      <b>Age:</b> Late 30's to early 40's<br>
      <b>Vocation:</b> Art teacher at Lawndale High<br>
      <b>First Appearance:</b> <i>The Invitation</i><br>
      <p align="justify">
      Ms. Defoe teaches Art, and appears to be the most normal of all the
      Lawndale High faculty. She is very down-to-earth, pleasant to a
      fault, and patient with all her students (even the talent-challenged
      Brittany).  She is also a great admirer of Jane's artwork. (Ms.
      Defoe elicits a rare compliment from Jane -- "she's nice" -- even
      though Jane didn't appreciate Ms. Defoe guilt-tripping her into
      participating in a lame PTA poster art contest.) Her giving nature
      tends to come at a price, however, as in the case of her not having
      the heart to throw her freeloading ex-college roommates out of her
      studio apartment, thereby causing her to lug around a sleeping bag
      and to shower at a truck stop (using her own homemade soap, of
      course).<br>
