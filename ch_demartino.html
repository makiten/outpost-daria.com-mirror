      <b>Full Name:</b> Anthony DeMartino<br>
      <b>Current Age:</b> 51<br>
      <b>Season One Age:</b> 49<br>
      <b>Vocation:</b> History teacher at Lawndale High<br>
      <b>First Appearance:</b> <i>Esteemsters</i><br>
      <p align="justify">
      Mr. DeMartino teaches History, and is stressed out to the point of
      being taken away in a straight-jacket (he makes Jake look like a
      master of Zen meditation). Mr. DeMartino is not unlike Jake in the
      fact that he suffered a bad childhood at the hands of uncaring
      parents. This undoubtedly accounts for most of his current
      psychological problems, the rest of which are caused by
      intellectual giants such as Kevin and Brittany. He has an annoying
      habit of shouting every fifth word or so, which causes one of his
      eyes to bulge out of his head, and if all that weren't enough, he's also
      saddled with a gambling addiction (which at one time cost him his
      car).<br>

      <b>Daria on Mr. DeMartino:</b>
      Thinks teachers' editions are for wimps. Beneath his gruff
      exterior, he's a puppy dog. A rabid puppy dog.<br>
