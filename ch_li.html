      Ms. Li is the tyrranical Principal of Lawndale High. She has many facets to her personality, one of them being an entrepeneur: she is quite adept at, and quite obsessed with, raising money for the school. Another is an image consultant: she is always concerned about the school's image and reputation. A liberal sprinkling of paranoia and megalomania round out the mixture. Among her priorities is the education and well-being of the students in her charge, though it's not exactly at the top of her list (or in the middle, for that matter). As a principal, she makes a wonderful dicator.<br>

      For the longest time, there was speculation that Nora Laudani was actually a pseudonym for former <i>Saturday Night Live</i> cast member Nora Dunn. This sepculation was put to rest when a contestant on ABC's <i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</i> on May 30-31, 2000, brought his cousin as a guest. That cousin was Ms. Laudani, and she definitely was <i>not</i> Nora Dunn. (And yes, she did a little Ms. Li for host Regis Philbin and the audience.)<br>
