      <b>Full Name:</b> Michael Jordan MacKenzie<br>
      <b>Current Age:</b> 18<br>
      <b>Current Vocation:</b> Freshman at Vance University<br>
      <b>Season One Age:</b> 16<br>
      <b>Season One Vocation:</b> Sophomore at Lawndale High<br>
      <b>First Appearance:</b> <i>The Invitation</i><br>
      <p align="justify">
      Mack (whose middle name was James until his father changed it after attending a Chicago Bulls playoff game) is, like his girlfriend Jodie, intelligent and popular, despite the fact that he's a jock. He is the captain of the Lawndale High varsity football team, which means he constantly has to put up with Kevin's stupidity. He and Daria get along well -- it helps that he's almost as cynical as she is -- and he's an all-around cool guy... but do <i>not</i> call him "Mack Daddy!"<br>
      <br>
      <b>Status at end of series:</b>
      Graduated from Lawndale High. Accepted into the freshman class at Vance University on a scholarship. Still going out with Jodie, who was accepted into Turner University. Was instrumental in convincing Jodie's parents that she'd be a lot happier at the predominantly African-American Turner than at the more prestigious, but less culturally diverse, Crestmore University.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Daria on Mack:</b>
      Jodie's boyfriend and captain of the football team. Has to tolerate Kevin, who has taken a few too many hits to the head.<br>

      <b>Voice:</b>
      Mack's voice is performed by Delon Ferdinand (episodes #102-105), Paul Williams (episodes #110-113 and season 2), Kevin Daniels, Jr. (season 3), and <a href="cast_and_crew.html#amir_williams">Amir Williams</a> (season 4 onward).<br>

        <li>Mack's full name is revealed in <a href="ep113.html">"The Misery Chick" (#113)</a>.
        <li>"Mack Daddy," the nickname that dimwitted Kevin insists on using for Mack, was likely taken from the Sir Mix-a-Lot album of the same name. That album contains what is arguably his most well-known song, "Baby Got Back" (a tongue-in-cheek ode to the female posterior).
