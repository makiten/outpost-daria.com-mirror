      <b>Full Name:</b> Timothy O'Neill<br>
      <b>Age:</b> Early to mid 40's<br>
      <b>Vocation:</b> English teacher at Lawndale High<br>
      <b>First Appearance:</b> <i>Esteemsters</i><br>
      <b>Nickname:</b> "Skinny" (from Ms. Barch)<br>
      <p align="justify">
      Mr. O'Neill is the English teacher (with an occasional stint as the teacher of Lawndale High's self-esteem class). The most charitable description of him would have to be "complete and total wuss." He's a "sensitive new-age type" who is always talking about one's feelings; unfortunately, he doesn't have a very good grip on his own emotions, as he's almost always upset or distressed about something. His blood is 100% chicken (he's easily frightened by the most innocuous of things), and he can't remember a person's name to save his life. Strangely enough, he tends to have an occasional fling with Ms. Barch -- always her idea, of course, as he's the type that would never even think of having a wild night with a woman, much less with the ultra-intimidating Ms. Barch.<br>
