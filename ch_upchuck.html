      <p align="justify">
      Upchuck is a person that raises being a geek to an art form. He's also sleazy to the <i>N</i>th degree, and is thoroughly convinced that he's God's gift to women. Upchuck's standards are only slightly higher than his success rate (which is at absolute zero); he'd be sued for sexual harassment if he weren't such a waste of effort. His catch phrase is "Rrrrrrr, feisty!" Listen for it, and be afraid... be very afraid...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Status at end of series:</b>
      Graduated from Lawndale High. Last seen in the company of Andrea, who had accepted one of his typical come-ons at Jodie's graduation party.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Daria on Upchuck:</b>
      Would be the love child of Jerry Lewis and James Bond, were such a thing possible.<br>
