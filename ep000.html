      <b>Summary:</b>
      Daria regrets borrowing a pencil from Kevin when the dim-witted quarterback becomes convinced that she likes him.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Full Synopsis:</b>
      When Daria accidentally breaks her pencil and borrows one from Kevin, the dim-witted Q.B. becomes convinced that she likes him. Daria decides to deflate his massive ego by pretending that she really <i>does</i> like him: she leaves "love notes" in his locker, gets affectionate with him at the pizza place -- much to Brittany's chagrin -- and brings him a batch of homemade cookies. He finally asks her out (if you can call it that;  he announces to the school at large that he and Brittany are through and that it's now "her turn"), but true to her plan, she turns the jerk down cold. Undeterred, Kevin shows up at Daria's house, flowers in hand, only to switch gears and take Quinn out instead. Daria and Jane reflect on the ordeal over pizza, with Daria explaining that having Kevin deal with the stuck-up, self-absorbed Quinn is the best revenge she could ever get on him.<br>

      This animated short was created to give the executives at MTV a rough idea of how the show would "look and feel." Since it was basically intended as a "sampler," not a production episode, it has a very unfinished feel: it uses simple black and white drawings, animatic-style, with voices and sound but no music. Karen Disher, production designer for <i>Daria,</i> was tasked with creating the overall look and feel of the show, which would evolve a great deal by the time the show premiered with <a href="ep101.html">"Esteemsters" (#101)</a>.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Differences from the regular series:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Daria is drawn with longer legs and a more pronounced figure.
        <li>Helen, Jake, and Quinn sound slightly different.
        <li>Quinn wears a different outfit (a short-sleeve collared shirt, shorts and knee socks).
        <li>Brittany and Kevin also sound slightly different: Kevin is more smarmy than stupid, while Brittany sounds more like the episodic Quinn.
        <li>Daria's personality is <i>much</i> more animated (no pun intended), even moreso than it was in <i>Beavis and Butt-head</i>.
        <li>The school is called "Modern Day High School," as the town does not yet have a name.
      </ul>
      <p><b>Where it can be seen:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>The first <i>Daria</i> VHS video
        <li>The <a href="daria_the_complete_series_dvd.html"><i>Daria: The Complete Animated Series</i> DVD box set</a>
        <li>Snippets were shown on MTV's <i>Daria: Behind the Scenes</i> special
