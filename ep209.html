      <b>Summary:</b>
      When Daria is hospitalized with a mysterious ailment that covers her face with a bright, red rash, she finds out just how many friends she really does have at Lawndale High.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Full Synopsis:</b>
      When Daria and Jane attend a Mystik Spiral gig at the Zon, Daria gets two unexpected surprises: she meets an incognito Brittany in the bathroom, and she discovers that she's developed a mysterious rash on her neck and face. Not wanting Jane and the band (especially Trent) to see her like this, she ditches them and gets a ride home in a cab. In the morning, Daria discovers (to her relief) that the rash has disappeared, then has to fend off an overly concerned Jake, who's become convinced that Daria may be taking drugs. At school, Daria's rash returns while she's in Mr. O'Neill's class, and when an uncharacteristically helpful Quinn is unable to do anything for her, Daria is forced to see the school nurse. The nurse sends her to her family doctor, who's equally stumped as to the cause of the rash, so he admits her to the hospital for tests and observation. Helen is freaking out over Daria's condition, Jake is freaking out over his suspicions of drug use, Quinn is freaking out over the <i>very</i> cute doctor that's treating Daria, and Daria just wishes the whole ordeal was over. To that end, she asks Jane not to tell anyone where she is, but Jane accidentally lets it slip to Brittany, who then tells Kevin, Jodie, and Mack. After a bad night's sleep (complete with requisite nightmare), she gets a visit from Jane, and when she figures that no one else at school even knows she's gone, she's shocked to see Brittany, Kevin, Jodie, and Mack arrive, all of whom are concerned about her and wanting to see how she's doing. Daria is finally sent home after the doctors determine that her rash was caused by anxiety, and when Helen and Jake tell her how proud they are of how well Daria handled the situation, she comes to realize that, despite their less-than-stellar parenting, they really <i>do</i> care about her. Jane then arrives to pick up Daria for another evening out, and when she informs her that Trent (who's standing next to her) will be giving them a ride, Daria's rash returns at lightning speed.<br>

      <b>Continuity:</b><br>
      <ul>
        <li>This episode marks the first appearance of Brittany's trademark "eep!", which would eventually become a standard exclamation of surprise by many characters (including Stacy, Mr. O'Neill, and even Daria).
        <li>The name of the hospital, Cedars of Lawndale, is visible on the building's entrance but is too blurry to make out clearly. A mention by Daria in <a href="ep304.html">"Daria Dance Party" (#304)</a> confirms the name. The hospital would be seen again in <a href="ep309.html">"Jake of Hearts" (#309)</a>.
      </ul>
      <b>Miscellaneous:</b><br>
      <ul>
        <li>"Mary Jane" is a slang term for marijuana.
        <li>In the so-subtle-you-may-have-missed-it department, Mr. O'Neill's discussion of William Shakespeare's <u>King Lear</u> leads him -- in a rare fit of backbone -- to compare the tyrannical king to Ms. Li.

      <font size=2 face="Arial">
      Jane - The band's going over to Cluster Burger. You're not going to act like a complete nitwit, are you?<br>
      Daria - Define complete. Um, I just need to go to the bathroom.<br>
      Jane - Good idea. Check your lack of makeup.<br>
      <br>
      Jake - Oh, my gosh, Helen, you don't think Daria...<br>
      Helen - Jake, she was never happy, vibrant or involved. Besides, she's a straight-A student.<br>
      Jake - That could be her cover! Her pupils -- we should check her pupils. What did I do with that pamphlet?<br>
      Helen - Jake, please.<br>
      Jake - For all we know, she's dealing Mary Jo out of the rec room.<br>
      Helen - That's Mary Jane, and we don't have a rec room.<br>
      <br>
      Daria - "Is Your Teenager Using Drugs? Ten Warning Signs." Yes. Yes. No. Maybe. Sometimes. Hmm. About three times a week. And not if she can possibly avoid it. In my opinion, Quinn's clean.<br>
      Quinn - What?<br>
      Daria - Although you might want to check her pupils.<br>
      Jake - (laughs nervously) I, uh, was thinking more about <i>you</i>, Daria.<br>
      Daria - Oh, then you're not supposed to let me read this. You're supposed to sneak around, spying on me and looking through my sock drawer.<br>
      (doorbell rings, Daria leaves)<br>
      Jake - Oh. Kiddo, which one is your sock drawer?<br>
      Quinn - I can show you, Daddy.<br>
      <br>
      Daria - Look, I'm sorry about last night<br>
      Jane - Aw, forget it. It was a rare opportunity, getting to hang out with Brittany in a grunge club. Although her hair did leak onto my shoes.<br>
      Daria - You're sure that wasn't her brain?<br>
      Jane - No, there was too much of it.<br>
      <br>
      Jane - Anyway, the important thing is that instead of going to your friends for help, you ran screaming into the night.<br>
      Daria - Basically.<br>
      Jane - Perfectly logical response.<br>
      Daria - I thought so.<br>
      <br>
      Daria - I don't get it. You're really helping me?<br>
      Quinn - Skin-care crises transcend personality conflicts, Daria. It's in the Fashion Club bylaws.<br>
      <br>
      Daria - Hey, what are you doing with all that stuff? Your skin's fine.<br>
      Quinn - And it's going to stay that way.<br>
      <br>
      Brittany - Have you seen... (whispers) ...Daria?<br>
      Jane - Why would you want... Daria?<br>
      Brittany - What makes you think I want her? I don't want her! Who said I want her?<br>
      Jane - You asked me if I'd seen her.<br>
      Brittany - She hasn't told you anything... interesting... about me, has she?<br>
      Jane - No one's ever told me anything interesting about you.<br>
      Brittany - That's a relief!<br>
      <br>
      Brittany - Just ask her if she remembers our deal.<br>
      Jane - What deal?<br>
      Brittany - What deal?<br>
      Jane - The deal you just mentioned.<br>
      Brittany - I didn't say anything about a deal. Forget I said anything about a deal.<br>
      Jane - Forget I said anything about a hospital.<br>
      Brittany - Okay!<br>
      Jane - Hey! Now <i>we</i> have a deal.<br>
      Brittany - What deal?<br>
      Jane - Later. (leaves)<br>
      <br>
      Daria - So then, what did you want to ask me?<br>
      Dr. Phillips - Nothing in particular. I just thought you could use a break from your parents for a while. You play gin rummy?<br>
      Daria - Sure.<br>
      (Dr. Phillips begins dealing cards)<br>
      Dr. Phillips - Actually, I did want to ask you one thing.<br>
      Daria - Yeah?<br>
      Dr. Phillips - What <i>is</i> it with your mother?<br>
      <br>
      (Daria is dreaming about being in Heaven)<br>
      Guy #1 - Oh, man, what'd you do? Bring us another brain?<br>
      Mrs. Sullivan - Look, I just go where they tell me.<br>
      Daria - Um, is there a problem?<br>
      Guy #2 - This is Heaven, sweetheart. What would we want with a brain?<br>
      Daria - I don't...<br>
      Mrs. Sullivan - Sorry.<br>
      (Daria falls through clouds, screaming)<br>
      <br>
      Jodie - Brittany, I'm sure if it was serious, Daria would be in the hospital.<br>
      Brittany - Um...<br>
      Jodie - What? She <i>is</i> in the hospital?<br>
      Brittany - Eep!<br>
      Jodie - She's <i>not</i> in the hospital.<br>
      Brittany - (squeals, then non-stop) I promised I wouldn't say anything about the hospital because I made a deal with Daria and she kept her part and I kept my part but then I made another deal with Jane and I didn't even know I was making it and now I didn't keep my part because I told about the hospital so now Jane's going to tell about the deal and I didn't mean anything by it I just wanted to see what other kids do at night who don't do sports and he didn't mean anything to me, Kevvy, I swear it!<br>
      Kevin - So... she <i>is</i> in the hospital.<br>
      <br>
      Daria - Jane, this is Dr. Phillips.<br>
      Dr. Phillips - Pleased to meet you. Friend, not family, right?<br>
      Jane - How can you tell?<br>
      Dr. Phillips - Daria seemed happy to see you.<br>
      <br>
      Jane - Ooh-la-la! Doctor, I have a pain...<br>
      Daria - Please. The man is a butcher. Look what he's done to my face.<br>
      <br>
      Daria - Like I need this.<br>
      Jane - What?<br>
      Daria - A big, bright, mysterious rash covering my skin.<br>
      Jane - I know! And here you were, perfectly capable of alienating people on personality alone.<br>
      Daria - You know, you could have just sent flowers.<br>
      <br>
      Daria - I'm probably okay...<br>
      Mack - So that's cool.<br>
      Daria - ...for a human lobster.<br>
      Jodie - Oh, so you're a little red. It could happen to anybody. (looks at Mack) Well, it could happen to lots of people.<br>

      <b><i>Trent Watch:</i></b>
      This is the first time we get to see all of Mystik Spiral (I figured that one of them would be bald). It also wasn't that surprising that Trent was one of the causes of Daria's mystery illness (he does produce anxiety for Daria, after all [anyone that doesn't know this hasn't been watching]). Even though part of the cause was predictable, it didn't take away from the story.<br>
      <br>
      <b><i>Super Rash:</i></b>
      What was the cause of that mysterious illness? A burger? A dirty night club? Drugs? Anxiety? Well, it could have been any or all of these things, but I've never seen (or heard of) any rash that comes and goes that quickly. I guess I can accept it, though, since it would be hard to wait too long for something like this to develop naturally (it would take at least two or three episodes just for it to start to emerge; this is an animated program, not a soap opera.<br>
      <br>
      <b><i>Running Gags of the Week:</i></b>
      Anyone who is familiar with me may know that I'm not a big fan of repeated jokes in an episode. However, I think that they were handled quite well here. Mrs. Sullivan provided us with a vivid dream sequence where Daria thought she was dead, and I for one didn't expect to see her alive. Brittany's hair was... never mind that now! The running gags as a whole flowed well in the story and didn't fell like an afterthought. They didn't seem tacked on and I guess that's good.<br>
      <br>
      <b><i>Jake's Road Rage:</i></b>
      If the man has a heart attack, it will be sooner than later. I have to say that Jake's scenes made this episode for me, I laughed out loud at almost everything Jake did (he's living up to the "flying off the handle" description), especially his mad rush to the hospital and watching the drug tape.<br>
      <br>
      <b><i>Drug Dealers:</i></b>
      Maybe it <i>was</i> Brittany's brain that dripped onto Jane's shoes. Her first deal with Daria was out of the fear that she would tell Kevin about Terry (or Jerry or whoever). The second deal was much more sinister since Brittany didn't know she was making a deal "until it was made" (Jane didn't even remember why they made their deal). Her strategic intelligence, as seen in "The Daria Hunter," was short lived; I don't see her mastering hostage negotiations any time soon.<br>
      <br>
      <b><i>Dealed:</i></b>
      No, Daria is not on drugs. She isn't happy, vibrant, or involved, either. Is she not well adjusted? Possibly, but right now this is the best way for her to deal with everything around her. Will she change? Probably, because everyone does. But this is what works for her now.<br>
      <br>
      Even though this episode was somewhat fast paced, it flowed together nicely. It showed, to me, that Daria has some friends, or at least people who care about what happens to her (see the scene where everyone is in Daria's hospital room; I know it was <i>Saved By the Bell</i>-ish, but it was touching). Some of them may be misguided, but they do care. "Ill" is one of the best episodes of the second season.<br>
      <br>
      <b><i>Grade:</i></b>
      A<br>
      <br>
      <b><i>Daria as a Whole (Bad Pun Alert):</i></b>
      The clock in the Morgendorffer's kitchen still is missing its hands, I guess no one had the time (oooh) to fix it. This could also be a continuity check since most of the time (oooh) the clock is hand-less. Maybe it's not really a clock.<br>
