<h1>Grandfather Freud’s look on Daria</h1>

<h3>By Bacner (<span class=MsoHyperlink><a href="mailto:Olgak531@home.com">Olgak531@rogers.com</a></span>)</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In my last essay I showed <i>how</i> the characters tick
in the show “Daria”. In this one I’m giving my explanation <i>why</i> they tick
in this way, and the esteemed grandfather of psychology, Sigmund Freud, has
agreed to help.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><i>The <b>oral character</b> who is frustrated at the oral
stage, whose mother refused to nurse him on demand or who truncated nursing
sessions early, is characterized by <u>pessimism, envy, suspicion and sarcasm</u>.
The overindulged oral character, whose nursing urges were <u>always and often
excessively satisfied, is optimistic, gullible, and full of admiration for
others around him</u>.</i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>All right, here’s Freud’s description of the oral
character. Does Daria match the following characteristics? Pessimism – yes, no
one is going to argue with me about this, right? Envy – unlikely, although she
sometimes may resent the attention and the good luck Quinn’s seems to be
getting, like with a bridesmaid dress in “I Don't”. Suspicion – you’ve got to
admit that Daria isn’t the most trust person in Lawndale. And sarcasm – no one’s
is going to argue about <i>that</i> characteristic of Daria, will they?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Now Quinn. Always and often excessively satisfied – duh!
She has everything that she wants. Optimistic – check, most of the time at
least, gullible – yes, Daria and Jane demonstrate that in “Fat Like Me”, and as
for being full of admiration for others around her – yes, the others mostly
being Sandi and the Fashion Club.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Personally, I find this completely natural. Helen and Jake
married in the 60s or early 70s, I believe, and were very uneducated in being
parents. It's quite possible, I believe, that Helen decided to cut Daria’s
nursing short. Considering that in my previous essay I pointed out that Daria
may have a hard personality via genes, the sudden or maybe even premature
cut-off from nursing would not do wonders to her. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Quinn, on the other hand, is the youngest daughter and complete
opposite of Daria, as we often observe. To me, it is natural to suppose that
Helen and Jake, having learned (in some way) from their troubles with Daria something
about parenting, decided to go the other way with Quinn.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Then again, Helen and Jake aren't alone at fault with the
way Daria and Quinn turned-out to be. In “Boxing Daria” we are shown that by
ages six for Daria and four for Quinn, the two sisters have already realized
how things tick in their family. Thus, as Daria continued to be obstinately
determined to go on in her way despite her parents’ efforts, Quinn, quite possible,
went the other way in order to win her parents’ favour over Daria. Thus, Daria’s
actions influenced Quinn too.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>As for Jane, her personality matches Daria’s quite
closely, because of the reasons I spoke in the previous essay. Of course, the
causes for this effect would be different, but I'm not surprised that Jane
turned-out this way: Vince and Amanda do not strike me as the most reliant of
the parents, I'll say this again. But it is slightly different with Trent.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><i>If the parents are too lenient and the child manages to
derive pleasure and success from this expulsion, it will result in the
formation of an <b>anal expulsive character</b>. <u>This character is generally
messy, disorganized, reckless, careless and defiant.</u> Conversely, a child
may opt to retain feces, thereby spiting his parents while enjoying the
pleasurable pressure of the built-up feces on his intestine. If this tactic
succeeds and the child is overindulged, he will develop into an <b>anal
retentive character</b>. This character is neat, precise, orderly, careful,
stingy, withholding, obstinate, meticulous, and passive-aggressive.</i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Now if Jane’s an underindulged oral character, like Daria,
then Trent’s an anal explusive character. Let’s check. Generally messy – just
ask Jane. Disorganized – ditto. Reckless – yes, he is irresponsible, as the
episode “Jane’s Obsession” shows. Careless – the same ep. Defiant – you’ve got
to admire Trent’s determination not to do any work but his music, at which he
simply sucks. So, apparently, this means that when Trent was potty-trained, he
didn't enjoy it. But what would you expect from a boy who tried to live in a
tent outside his house for no specific reason? ‘Course, this may be the norm
for the Lane family, or at least the Lawndale branch of the Lane family, but
this doesn’t make them any more sane than in my previous essay.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><i>The phallic stage is the setting for the greatest, most
crucial sexual conflict in Freud’s model of development. Fixation at the
phallic stage develops a <b>phallic character</b>, who is <u>reckless,
resolute, self-assured, and narcissistic—excessively vain and proud. The
failure to resolve the conflict can also cause the person to be afraid or
incapable of close love;</u> As well, Freud postulated <u>that fixation could
be a root cause of homosexuality</u>.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Sandi. What do we know about her? In most fanfics the
author make her the arch-nemesis of Daria and Jane as well as Quinn’s greatest
rival; is it not because of the reasons above? Reckless and resolute? – she is
rather irresponsible and unyielding, especially in the Fashion Club;
self-assured, narcissistic – duh, thought after “Fat like me” this seems to be
changing; Quinn’s actions did her good. And as for vain and proud – nobody’s
going to argue with me about this, right?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>As for the possible root of homosexuality, what can I say?
Personally, that’s too deep for me, but I think I could find one or two fanfics
in the “Outpost Daria” connection in which Sandi <i>does</i> turn to an
alternative lifestyle.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>What can I say in Sandi’s defence to make her appear
not-so-bad? Just like with other characters of the show the roots of her
problem lie in the family; in “Daria Dance Party” we see a flashback of Sandi
and her mother Linda and get an inkling that with homosexuality issue aside,
Sandi may’ve grown this way because her mother’s ‘helpful’ influence. On the
other side, Quinn’s actions in “Fat like me” may remedy some of that damage.
After all Quinn is a good person deep inside, just as Daria may not be one.
(See my previous essay.)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><i>The resolution of the phallic stage leads to the
latency period, which is not a psychosexual stage of development, but a period
in which the sexual drive lies dormant. Freud saw latency as a period of
unparalleled repression of sexual desires and erogenous impulses. During the
latency period, children pour this repressed libidal energy into asexual
pursuits such as school, athletics, and same-sex friendships. But soon puberty
strikes, and the genital once again become a central focus of libidal energy.</i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><i>In the genital stage, as the child’s energy once again
focuses on his genitals, interest turns to heterosexual relationships. The less
energy the child has left invested in unresolved psychosexual developments, the
greater his capacity will be to develop normal relationships with the opposite
sex. If, however, he remains fixated, particularly on the phallic stage, his
development will be troubled as he struggles with further repression and
defences.</i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Now what? You may ask me? This is basically the end,
believe me, you won't suffer from me and Dr. Freud for much longer. I merely
want to point-out that while most of children in Lawndale High are in their
latent stage, like Quinn, Daria, Jane, and Tom seem to have gone-on into
genital stage, and seem to be functioning normally at last. Thanks god for
that.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The end.</p>
