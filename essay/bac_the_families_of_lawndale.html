<p class=MsoNormal>In my number #1 essay, I talked about the personality of
Daria Morgendorffer and the Barksdale-Morgendorffer family dynamics. Now, in my
number #3 essay, I’m going to talk about other families we see on the show.
Note: under “family” I mean a pair of parents and at least one child. Thus, I
won’t be talking about Ms. Barch or Mr. O’Neill any time soon – certainly not
in this essay. If you’re disappointed, drop now; if not – go ahead. Now then:</p>

<h1><span style='font-family:Arial'>The Families of Lawndale by Bacner (</span><span
class=MsoHyperlink>olgak531@rogers.com</span><span style='font-family:Arial'>)</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoHeader><b>The Griffins (&amp; the Fashion
club)</b>. We all know Sandi Griffin: the president of the Fashion Club (Quinn
Morgendorffer is the Vice-President), and the oldest child of the Griffin
family. (It is curious to note that they’re named after a flying-lion like
mythical monster if anyone is in that sort of trivia.) She has two younger
brothers Sam and Chris – who are probably no more than half her age (or maybe
she’s exceptionally tall, but I doubt it.) Now then, what do we know of Sandi
Griffin?</p>

<p class=MsoHeader>Well, basically, she’s a pain in
the butt – of generally everyone. Quinn and her lock horns every-so-often,
other students (those who are in the intellectual group like Daria, Jane and
Jodie Landon) also don't rate her very high. And the reason why?</p>

<p class=MsoHeader>Sandi Griffin is a control freak.
She controls the Fashion Club – not that it is too hard to do something like
that. Tiffany seems to be growing dimmer and dimmer as time passed in Lawndale,
while Stacy and Quinn are not quite sure in their own abilities. </p>

<p class=MsoHeader>Oops. Wasn't it mentioned in the
Morgendorffer-based essay that Quinn is insecure in her abilities – just like
Stacy? Well, admittedly, it’s not that extreme (nobody can be that extremely
insecure as Stacy). But Quinn too isn't quite secure in her thinking abilities
– partially (at least) due to Daria’s influence. Whatever else one could say
about Daria Morgendorffer, she <i>is</i> a straight-A student, and a bit
smarter than an average person and possibly Quinn knows that she can’t compete
in that area, so she tries to be perky and popular instead. Just like Stacy,
too. </p>

<p class=MsoHeader>But Sandi… Sandi isn't quite secure
in her abilities herself. The Fashion Club is rather like “in the land of the
blind, the one-eyed man is king”. Sandi’s overzealous control may come from the
fact that she isn't totally sure about her capability to lead and got along
only with the fact that Stacy is even less sure of herself (considerably less)
and Tiffany seems indifferent to the “attraction of power”. That girls just
doesn't like to think.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader>Then along comes Quinn
Morgendorffer, and the situation changes. Quinn is also insecure and so she
fits-in into the Fashion club quite nicely – to a limit. The limit is because
both she and Sandi are on equal footing, and the two naturally begin to elbow
and manoeuvre around each other almost immediately. And when Brooke (who is a
naturally suck-up and almost as bad as Stacy) re-appears on the scene,
naturally Sandi almost gets rid of Quinn.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader>But why would Sandi be so “bad” as
a person? Well, the popular opinion (and I don't see why it must be wrong – in
this case) is because of her mother, Mrs. Griffin. In the “Prom” episode we see
a flash-back of Sandi’s, how she is “tutored” by her mother, and how she uses
her advice on Quinn. Adding the facts that Sandi’s brothers are too young and
too spoilt (though they got nothing on Brian Taylor) and her father Tom Griffin
(don't confuse with Tom Sloane, Jane’s and Daria’s ex-boyfriend) is mostly a
back-ground figure, it’s possibly quite safe to state that unlike with the
Morgendorffers (well the Barksdale part of the Morgendorffers, and Quinn does
seem to take more after her mother Helen), the insecurity stain runs quite deep
in the Griffin family. According to “Daria Diaries”, Linda Griffin once held a
job as a TV news anchor – very briefly, though. Now, as the president of
Lawndale Businesswomen Association, Linda Griffin is possibly richer than she
was before but quite possibly that she is <i>still</i> resentful about losing
the more-glamorous job on the TV. She probably needs help herself, and so does
Sandi now, ‘cause she models herself after her mother, and Linda Griffin isn't
a very good role model, if you ask me. However, Tom Griffin, who seems to be
too much like Tiffany Blum-Deckler, is an even worse one.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader>And so, the verdict for the Griffin
family (&amp; the Fashion Club) is insecurity, mixed with indifference or
uncaring. This does not bode a healthy future.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoHeader><b>The Landons.</b> A different
case from the Griffins. Although parallels can be made (five people in the
family, business-oriented, etc), this is nothing more but coincidence (or the
lack of imagination of the script-writers). Although, while Jodie may also
appear to be insecure from time to time (more about it a little later), that is
<i>so</i> not the case with Andrew and Michelle Landon. </p>

<p class=MsoHeader>Now what can be said of them?
Deeply ambitious people. So’s Linda Griffin, of course, but the Landons have
more power – Michelle, for instance, was the vice-president of the Woman’s
World till she had baby Evan and left. Now I don't want to be the one to step
onto a sore foot, but why hasn’t she returned? I'm sure that a baby-sitter
could be managed for Evan and Rachael now – so why Michelle Landon still a
housewife (certainly not the role she fancies herself in). Personally, I
suspect Andrew Landon, who is as bad as a control freak as Linda Griffin is.
But if Linda’s (and Sandi’s) overzealous control comes from insecurity,
Andrew’s control <i>comes from security</i>. The man is obviously used to
getting his own way – and doesn't like independence in his family members. One
bit. The trouble is that Michelle also used to bossing than to serving and I
daresay likes to spite him every once in a while. But not much, for whatever
reason of her own. Maybe she really loves him, maybe there’s some other reason
why she can't come back to her old job – who knows? But because of this frustration
Michelle Landon is such a crusader of black-peoples’-right – and Helen
Morgendorffer seems to start every time the two meet. The cause for tension
between two women is that Helen is everything Michelle isn’t – a mother and a
careerist. (Keep in mind that the Landons never seen the Morgendorffer family
in private.) And all of the resentment that Michelle Landon caries “under her
belt” instantly gets a natural external catalyst – one never sees a more
business-oriented person than Helen Morgendorffer.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader>But onwards to Jodie. What about
her? Like her mother she too moulds herself to her father’s plans – but with
the not-too-subtle friction from her mother. Both of the Landon parents want to
see their dreams realized via Jodie – and never mind what Jodie’s own plans
are. Naturally Jodie is disgruntled – and Daria doesn't make things too easy
for her now. The two girls are closely matched in their IQ scale (even Jane
isn’t as smart as Daria), and naturally Jodie feels competition. Of course,
Daria’s social skills better only than Tiffany Blum-Deckler’s, but Jodie isn’t
a social queen herself. She’s the vice-president of the school council instead
and dates Michael Jordan Mackenzie, the captain of the football team. Their relationship
is something else again, for Jodie is currently too busy to have a social life
of her own. Adding the fact that Daria Morgendorffer who is everything that
Jodie isn't gives her the run for her money, makes Jodie very viable for a
serious social break-down – unless she finds a way to blow-off steam (like not
go to college when she graduates, but hitch-hike her way through Europe
instead).</p>

<p class=MsoHeader>As for Jodie’s younger siblings –
Rachael and Evan, well, Evan’s too little to be off any importance, while
Rachael is the mirror-side of Jodie – and the two girls are like Daria and
Quinn, reversed. If Quinn can at least rely on her appearance and personality
(or persona) to find a niche where she is better than her sister, Rachael is
currently lacking such escape route, and may grow-up to be a Daria-like person
yet. (That’s something to think about!)</p>

<p class=MsoHeader>Now about Andrew Landon. Quite
naturally he was put in a rather unflattering light so far, and for good
reason. But he too has personal problems – though they seem to have found a solution
lately. You see, it is possible, that Andrew Landon – just like Jake
Morgendorffer – was much domineered by his father in his teenage years. But
unlike Jake, who know feels a mixture of fear and hate towards his father,
Andrew probably learned all he needed from his. And now – feel his pain: until
recently, he had only daughters to pass his father’s wisdom along. Naturally
Evan is his favourite: “I'm proud of my girls, but hey! – Evan is my <i>son</i>,”
he tells proudly to Jake (who probably wouldn't mind having a boy child as
well. Oh well.). So, quite possible, the control will be eased-of Jodie (a
bit), and Rachael may not have the type of problems like her sister faces (then
again, neither she does now).</p>

<p class=MsoHeader>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoHeader><b>The Taylors.</b> Now there’s a
break in the pattern. The Taylors are a step-family – namely, the Taylor kids –
Brittany and Brian – have a father, Steve, and a stepmother, Ashley-Amber.
Well, how does it affect them?</p>

<p class=MsoHeader>Not favourably (it appears that <i>all</i>
of “Daria” characters have problems). As anyone can see, Ashley-Amber isn’t
quite the motherly model, everyone seems to think her as Brittany’s older
sister. Unfortunately, Brittany herself doesn't seem to get it, and so patterns
herself after her stepmother to if not the letter, then at least the word.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader>And Steve Taylor himself. Not a
very good father model again. One wonders, why did his first wife – Brittany’s
and Brian’s mother – divorce him in the first place. Quite possibly because
he’s a smug bastard – almost like Charles Ruttheimer the III – aka Upchuck.
Only if Upchuck can be knocked some sense into – literally – then Steve Taylor
is quite safe from such treatment. And that affects his kids. Brian Taylor,
according to the popular consensus, is semi-sadistic and may need therapy even
in “Daria”-world – something to be considered. And Brittany will probably
grow-up into her <i>step-mother</i> – a giggly blonde bimbo, most likely to
marry a man like her father (or Kevin Thomson, though Mrs. Thomson may have
another view on that matter) – somebody who may not be quite “me-me-me-me”, but
getting there most probably. Not a good fate to look-up for. ‘Course, it is
hinted through some episodes, that Brittany is smarter than she looks and not
quite “spoilt” by her father and stepmother’s example – like in the episode
with the paintball park. For all we know, she may be the “wild card” in “Daria
deck” yet. </p>

<p class=MsoHeader>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoHeader><b>The Thomsons.</b> And last but
not least (except in brains) Kevin Thomson. Again a break-in-the-pattern – he’s
the youngest child. Well, that explains some things. The Thomsons – they aren't
the smartest people themselves, of course, and poorer than other families we
see on “Daria” but they can probably afford to spoil Kevin – not that it is
terribly hard. Also, judging from the college episode Kevin’s brothers – who
are mentioned but never ever seen on the show – have IQs of about Kevin’s level
or ever-so-slightly higher. That doesn't bode good for Kevin. He is a
good-natured idiot – but an idiot all the same. However, the other Thomsons,
again, don't see him that way – for what the rest of the world seems as idiocy,
the Thomsons seem to see as norm. And so, if Kevin wasn't “the QB”, he probably
wouldn't be such a ladies’ man and/or Brittany’s boyfriend. Their relationship
reserves a special mention and be treated fully in another essay. But it is
safe to disclose at this point that the two of them initially were attracted
not by the physical attraction (though it is obviously/blatantly there) but
because the head cheerleader and the QB are supposed to be a couple. And given
their respective nurturing environments… theirs is an odd relationship. But the
relationships will be discussed in a separate essay.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoHeader><b>The conclusion.</b> As it was
mentioned above in this essay, no one of the “Daria” characters doesn't have
problems of some sort. Some of them have them more openly, others hidden. I’m
not even willing to go in Upchuck’s rampant libido yet, for an example of a
more open one. However, that was adds <i>realism</i> to this show, because hey!
– that <i>is</i> real life. No one is <i>perfect</i>, every one is flawed,
unlike various TV shows where you can spot the good guys and the bad guys and
the rest of character clichés right away. </p>
