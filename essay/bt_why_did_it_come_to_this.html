Lots of you know me from Paperpusher&#146;s message boards You know, the
freak who quotes <I>Re-Animator</I> off-and-on, and just showed up one week
and now can&#146;t be gotten rid of? I&#146;ve been engaged in a few good
debates with some of you regarding the nature of the interrelationship between
Daria and Tom, as well as whatever possible futures might exist for Daria
and Trent. And I&#146;m getting to be known through my fiction, which these
days takes a rather realistic and somewhat critical eye (within a humorous
context, at least thus far) towards the nature of the relationships on the
show. Or tries to, with the notable exception of any of the crossovers I&#146;ve
begun, or any of the assorted bizarrities that I&#146;m writing (most of
my output, but that's another story). But I&#146;m not here to talk about
me; I&#146;m here to talk about <I>Daria</I>, where it&#146;s coming from,
and where it&#146;s probably going.
<P ALIGN=Left>
As Jeffrey Combs (Herbert West) says in the immortal <I>Re-Animator</I>,
&#147;Birth is always painful.&#148; Considering that the true parent of
what the show has become is episode #313, &#147;Jane&#146;s Addition,&#148;
this is indisputably true. Is this an on-canon episode? It sure as hell is,
thanks to the fact that it is an official, recognized episode of the show.
That&#146;s all it takes. But it&#146;s not really <I>Daria</I>, and here&#146;s
where the problem pops up. Simply put, while I am all for character development
and change and growth, this was not the proper way to go about it. It takes
the angst from &#147;See Jane Run,&#148; expands it a thousand-fold, and
then runs with it. And the worst thing is that they just kept going with
it, throughout the fourth season and into the movie. Probably into season
five, as well, but I&#146;ll come to that in time.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Point number one - if Jane and Daria were really friends, this should not
have happened the way it did. Daria should have at least been able to accept
the fact that things were going to be different from now on, without (A)
turning into a vindictive, whining bitch, or (B) actually holding a grudge
about it. It&#146;s one thing to see Tom being put down by Daria <I>out of
the episode&#146;s context</I>, where he may seem like just another mindless
jerk, and another thing entirely to see this generally nice guy get verbally
slammed by his girlfriend&#146;s best friend for no other reason then that
he is his girlfriend's date. (Awkwardly phrased, no?) The only possible
explanations I have been able to come up with at all - and these have not
been beared out at all, as near as I can tell, by evidence at that juncture
of the series - is that Daria had her eye on Tom first, and was annoyed when
Jane hit it off with him; alternately, that Daria has a crush on Jane and
is disappointed in seeing her take up with a guy. Is there any proof for
this at all? No, but it&#146;s the only thing I can come up with that
doesn&#146;t make me want to create a &#147;Slap-the-Hell-Out-Of-Daria&#148;
java game.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Daniel Suni suggested that <I>Daria</I> is going down the tubes because they
are moving her away from her own cynical behaviors in the first two seasons.
I suggest, rather, that <I>Daria</I> is going down the tubes because the
characters really have lost that cohesion they once had, as a result of character
development that feels forced rather then natural. That Daria and company
are being dragged kicking and screaming into development, and not going in
that direction of their own volition.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Point number two - Tom&#146;s own behaviors in this episode, I feel, are
perfectly acceptable within the context of the episode. In fact, I&#146;d
say he was more than acceptable in being so polite and civil towards Daria
despite the barrage of sarcasm. It&#146;s extremely hard to dislike the guy,
especially when OH (Our Heroine, for those not in the know) is behaving like
a spoiled little brat. It&#146;s reasons like this why I actually like Tom
as a character, and feel that there is a lot of potential for an interesting
guy here. When we learn more about him, which will happen.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Point number three - the sudden, abrupt shift from more parodic/satiric/fantastic
episodes into something closely resembling pure teen melodrama. No real warning,
no indication. Just <I>bam</I>! I wish there was some sort of satire here
that I could see, but it looks to me like an episode of <I>Dawson&#146;s
Creek</I> merged into <I>Daria</I>. At least, regarding the friendships and
opposite sex relationships, anyway. And since most of the series&#146; charm
came from the somewhat more realistic (at least, initially) discourse between
characters...
<P ALIGN=Left>
However, there is one part of &#147;Jane&#146;s Addiction&#148; that is worth
mentioning, that is completely within character, and is completely believable.
That aspect? The way they handled the Daria/Trent subplot. Kudos to the writing
crew for not changing Trent into yet another unbelievable character. Flaking
out on the school assignment - much like Daria says - is completely believable,
as is his response to her carping. Does this pretty much kill the Daria/Trent
romance thing? Depends on how much of a &#145;shipper you are, and how much
you want to read into a faint smile and kiss on the cheek. In a not-so-subtle
address to the audience, paying attention to the D/T conversation post-project
indicates that they&#146;re (the writers) done with it. Probably for all
times, but there is a chance that (A) it will resurface at the end of the
series, or (B) that the crush itself merely switched sides. Both of those,
however, make up another essay. That&#146;s it for quality characterization
in #313, so far as this fan is concerned. The rest is a bunch of absolute
hogwash - and completely illogical - in regards to our main character. And
without her behaving logically, it&#146;s not really <I>Daria</I>. The multimedia
project itself was a horrendously unrealistic manner of bringing things to
a head, but it was kind of amusing to behold.
<P ALIGN=Left>
And then I come to the great conceptual abortion that is &#147;Partner&#146;s
Complaint.&#148;
<P ALIGN=Left>
Rather then - say - improving the melodramatic nature of the series, and
finding its way back onto believable character grounds, this actually makes
things worse. Now we have a Daria who is (apparently) holding a grudge against
Jane for dating, to the point where she actually goes and works on the economics
project with Jodie, leaving poor Jane with Brittany. Let&#146;s face it -
this is plain wrong. Does Daria harbor a secret crush on Tom, or does she
harbor a secret crush on Jane? Either one of these might account for her
behaviors, as said above, but there&#146;s just no proof this early on. What
is actually worse is the fact that this show gives hypocrisy a good name.
This coming from the guy who believes that every man, woman, and child is
a born hypocrite and can do nothing to change this. Jodie&#146;s behaviors
in regards to acquiring the loan are questionable at best, and Daria selling
her own beliefs short are even more questionable. Everyone looks like a
hypocrite, and in fact everyone <I>is</I> a hypocrite by the end.
<P ALIGN=Left>
But where &#147;Partner&#146;s Complaint&#148; really loses me is the fact
that, at the end, Jane accepts Daria&#146;s apology, but rather then coming
across as magnanimous, it comes across as... well... condescending. Admittedly,
Daria does have a lot to be sorry for (I wish I was kidding here, but I&#146;m
not), but Jane shouldn&#146;t seem so smug about this. Some of you may really
love this episode, but both me and my brother thought that this one was a
great big fat enigma right off the bat. Possible questions to the writers
- Why do this to us? Why do you feel that splitting Daria and Jane apart
over Tom is such a great idea? Why did you turn Daria into a sniveling whiner,
moping about how no one lives up to her standards? (Admittedly, no one does,
but I don&#146;t need to hear Daria whining about it all of the time.) I
really would like to have these answered some time. I would also really enjoy
slapping this incarnation of Daria upside the head.
<P ALIGN=Left>
&#147;The F Word&#148; is not quite as bad as it looks on the surface. In
fact, Kara Wild pretty much nails it on the head in her examination of it.
This is (upon closer examination) a rather critical look at the nature of
popularity. Besides, the scene where Trent tells Tom not to abandon Jane
has me cracking up every time I see it. I&#146;m not going to touch this
one, which might seem odd. But I see nothing here that really contradicts
what we know of Jane, because we really don&#146;t know a whole lot about
Jane (I am in agreement with Ms. Wild over this point, as well) outside of
little bits here and there, and a few different inferences we can make about
her from what we do know. Daria - well, after seeing her get so worked up
over the Tom debacle, there is (unfortunately) nothing much that contradicts
her here, either. Or at least, the &#147;new&#148; her. By the way, I&#146;d
also like to say that I enjoy this one because of the brief Jane daydream,
which proved to be eerily prophetic in one way. Hmmm....
<P ALIGN=Left>
&#147;I Loathe a Parade&#148; is the next episode I&#146;m going to mention
here. Simply put, this is the big kahuna, the point where things really go
into Never, Neverland and don&#146;t come back. Daria and Tom - bonding.
And the ending truly suggests (but does not really predict) the inevitable
turn of events. It&#146;s not bad, really, although I find it somewhat bothersome
that it only took an hour or two for Tom and Daria to bond. Sure, they knew
each other for months, but for a good portion of this time Daria was being
a really frigid &#147;icebox woman.&#148; Tom really is way too nice, considering
the way Daria had/has been treating him up until this point. Other then that,
I have no problems with it. It was nice to see the Guptys back in action,
and the scenes with O&#146;Neill as the Lion provide me with moments of
hysterical laughter. Mostly, a throwback to the pre-drama days of the show,
back when the realistic absurdity of the situations were enough to carry
things through to the end. And this one - along with &#147;Fire!&#148; represent
the only two really outstanding episodes in season four, in my opinion. Most
of the rest were weakly conceptualized, poorly-executed, thinly-plotted excuses
to get to &#147;Dye! Dye! My Darling&#148; and &#147;Is It Fall Yet?&#148;
&nbsp;
<P ALIGN=Left>
&#147;Fire!&#148; works because it at least seems realistic. It does have
some of the old humorous approach, in particular the trip to Le Grand Hotel
and Quinn&#146;s involvement with Bobby the Cyber-Stalker. It has the Daria/Trent
&#145;shipper fan&#146;s wet dream, and yet does not play up the romantic
angle (but does drop a few hints...). It finds Daria and Jane more in their
old modes then usual, and it finds us empathizing more with Daria then we
have in a long while. And even the ending here is less melodramatic, and
somewhat more realistic, then a lot of the Daria/Tom plots have been. &#147;Dye!
Dye! My Darling&#148; would work better, except for the fact that what ends
up being the catalyst for everything else is just so damned stupid. Hair
dye? Are they starting with the titles now, and working from there? That
might explain some of the weak plots and episodes they're churning out.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Consider it carefully - how many things do you really remember from season
four? Forget about the four or five episodes that have really sparked a
controversy (#401, #405, #406, #412, #413), what about the other eight? I
don&#146;t remember a whole lot, to tell you the truth, at least not regarding
our two main characters. &#147;Murder, She Snored&#148; and &#147;Legends
of the Mall&#148; were, quite frankly, complete wastes of time, as was &#147;A
Tree Grows in Lawndale.&#148; And most of the others (notable non-controversy
episode - &#147;Mart of Darkness,&#148; which was fun in the old style more
or less) have been somewhat less than memorable. More and more, I find myself
remembering the little subplots rather then the main plots. Or an isolated
scene here or there, but never the whole thing. The Jane-Cam in &#147;Psycho
Therapy.&#148; Brian Taylor&#146;s brief appearance in &#147;Groped By an
Angel,&#148; as well as the Mystik Spiral song &#147;Every Dog Has His
Day.&#148; DeMartino going over the cliff and ending up with Helen and Jake
in &#147;Antisocial Climbers.&#148; But never the full episodes. I know I
saw &#147;Of Human Bonding,&#148; but I don&#146;t even remember it. Not
a good sign. &nbsp;On the other hand, a lot of fan fictions I have read that
take place during the fourth season have been very memorable, funny, and
a lot more interesting and (dare I say it) on-character then the show itself
has been. I would have loved to see them try out Yui Daoren&#146;s
&#147;Consequences of a Parade&#148; instead of, say, &#147;Dye! Dye! My
Darling,&#148; because the evolutions explored within are somewhat more
convincing (despite being a lot more controversial and bizarre as far as
subject matter) - for some reason - then the route they eventually took.
Forget about the fact that the episode would spark a huge amount of fallout
from a lot of people, who'd find it heretical in a lot of ways. I'm not going
to spoil it for you; just read it and find out for yourself.
<P ALIGN=Left>
As far as &#147;Is It Fall Yet?&#148; goes, it&#146;s nowhere near as good
as it could have been. There are some good scenes here - the van ride scene,
the increased knowledge of Tom and his family, the pieces with Dotson, and
the Quinn/David sections which brings out a previously-alluded to side of
Quinn for good. Otherwise, it seemed like a stitched-together melange of
ideas as opposed to an actual episode. I have a hard time visualizing Jane
as a lesbian, for one. Not because it would offend me, but because it
wouldn&#146;t quite meld with what we really know of Jane as a character
(which is, as I said before, not much). Daria&#146;s behavior again is bordering
on the truly annoying at times, and is at complete odds even with the Daria
we should be getting used to by now. Link - what can I say except that I
think the character was ill-advised (much as I happen to approve of his attitude
towards O&#146;Neill and the O.K.-To-Cry Corral), and the sort of thing that
may well never come up again in regards to Daria&#146;s personality. I view
it as Daria trying to alleviate the guilt she feels over the Tom incident,
not as anything else.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Frankly, this lack of memorable episodes scares me. Most of these seem quickly
tossed together, and those that weren&#146;t were either (A) too melodramatic
to be funny, or (B) fell flat on their faces when it came to the humor level.
Maybe it&#146;s just me, but I can still look back at episodes like &#147;It
Happened One Nut,&#148; or &#147;The Road Worrier,&#148; or &#147;The Daria
Hunter,&#148; (or, especially, &#147;Lane Miserables&#148; and &#147;The
Lawndale File&#148;) and laugh at what I see. I can&#146;t do that with a
lot of these new ones, despite the fact that the series is still supposed
to be a comedy. &nbsp;So where will season five lead us? I&#146;d like to
hope that things will begin the process of returning to a more humorous,
less overly melodramatic style. I&#146;d still advocate turning to some of
the high-tier fan fiction out there for ideas - let&#146;s face it, people
like Peter Guerin, Canadibrit, and C.E. Forman have a lot of rather high-quality
ideas that could be adapted into great season five episodes (a modified &#147;No
Nudes is Good Nudes&#148; would be fantastic, but fat chance of that). Lew
Richardson, too, could write one hell of a humorous episode that would really
make a lot of people smile (and probably go ballistic with laughter... go
read &#147;Heroes&#148; now for proof that this man is the master of knee-slapper
humor!). Or, should they desire to continue to maintain dramatic elements
in the show, Kara Wild&#146;s stories tend to be among the highest quality
in terms of both plotting and characterization. Never mind the fact that
they are (as the others above are) uniformly well-written, and in many cases
("That Thing You Say," "An Uneasy Marriage," pretty much every other one)
better then a lot of the episodes that get made. But, thanks to that whole
copyright thing, it won&#146;t happen. Instead, what we&#146;ll end up with
is another chain of melodramatic episodes in which Daria gradually loosens
up (thus becoming even more removed from her original self, but at least
this time things will hopefully seem natural, not forced), and Lawndale begins
to look more and more like Daria&#146;s Creek until the inevitable breakup
episode. That, too, is another essay that will stem from one of the
afore-mentioned debates.
