<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
<em>Daria</em> was a spin-off from MTV's earlier animated series
<em>Beavis and Butt-head</em>, in which Daria Morgendorffer was
introduced as a minor recurring character.  From the perspective of a
<em>Daria</em> fan, this essay reviews Daria's appearances in
<em>Beavis and Butt-head</em> to see how her character evolved.
</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>
Since we had little prior exposure to <em>Beavis and Butt-head</em>,
our research began with several previous essays on Daria's appearances
in the <em>Beavis and Butt-head</em> series&nbsp;[<a
href="#pollard">1</a>, <a href="#cincgreen">2</a>, <a
href="#larissa">3</a>].  Our aim was to merge and extend this
information to provide the most comprehensive analysis possible of
Daria in <em>Beavis and Butt-head</em>.
</p>

<p>
Guided by the earlier authors' episode synopses, we purchased ten
<em>Beavis and Butt-head</em> video tapes containing episodes
featuring most of Daria's major speaking roles&nbsp;[<a
href="#rescue">4</a>-<a href="#improvement">13</a>].  For the
remaining episodes we relied on an online digital recording&nbsp;[<a
href="#monde">15</a>] and other essayists' transcripts&nbsp;[<a
href="#blog">19</a>, <a href="#foodgod">20</a>, <a
href="#dariawiki">21</a>].  Combining information from all of these
sources allowed us to review all of Daria's speaking
appearances in <em>Beavis and Butt-head</em>.
</p>

<h2>A Matter of Appearance</h2>

<p>
Within the context of their different animation styles, <em>Beavis and
Butt-head</em>'s "Daria" is clearly the same girl as in the
<em>Daria</em> series.  Daria in <em>Beavis and Butt-head</em> has all
of her usual physical trademarks:
</p><ul>

<li>
she is shorter than the other students at Highland High School, just
as she would later prove to be shorter than her Lawndale High
classmates (and even her younger sister, Quinn);
</li>

<li>
she wears prominent glasses;
</li>

<li>
she doesn't smile (but see the discussion of her
<a href="#nonspeaking">non-speaking appearances</a> below); and
</li>

<li>
she has shoulder-length auburn hair, parted on the left.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
She appears stockier in <em>Beavis and Butt-head</em> than in
<em>Daria</em>, but this can be attributed to the fact that the
fifteen-year-old Daria has not completed her pubescent growth spurt.
(<em>Daria</em> designer Karen Disher states in the documentary
<em>Behind the Scenes with Daria</em> that there was a conscious
decision to make Daria taller and slimmer in her spin-off series.)
</p>

<p>
<em>Beavis and Butt-head</em>'s animation is rather inconsistent.
Earlier episodes are drawn more crudely than later ones, and this can
even provide a rough guide to the age of episodes.  It also has some
impact on Daria's physical appearance, sometimes within individual
episodes.  For instance, Daria looks quite different between the long
shots and close ups in <a href="#babes"><em>Babes 'R Us</em></a>.
</p>


<h2>Highland High Fashion</h2>

<p>
Daria's wardrobe is more varied in <em>Beavis and Butt-head</em> than
in <em>Daria</em>.  Through the course of the series she wears three
distinct outfits.
</p><ol>

<li>
<a name="outfitone">
Pale yellow jacket, orange-ish pleated skirt, gray shirt, bare legs,
brown boots, and a small necklace.
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="outfittwo">
Yellow jacket, tan skirt, gray shirt, black leggings, brown boots,
and a small necklace.
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="outfitthree">
Black jacket, red skirt, white shirt, black leggings, dark brown boots,
and a small necklace.
</a>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
This last outfit defines the "classic" <em>Beavis and Butt-head</em>
Daria look.  It was used after the character was firmly established
and started to appear regularly.  The distinctive black jacket and red
skirt make Daria easy to spot in classroom or crowd scenes.
</p>

<p>
The necklace Daria wears throughout her time at Highland High appears
to hold a quartz crystal.  Her attachment to it is interesting, given
that she never wears any kind of jewelry at all at Lawndale (with the
short-lived exception of her navel ring in <em>Pierce Me</em>).
</p>

<h2><a name="thename">The Name's Morgendorfer, Daria Morgendorffer</a></h2>

<p>
In most <em>Beavis and Butt-head</em> episodes our heroine is referred
to merely as "Daria."  However, her surname, "Morgendorffer," is
confirmed in the episodes <a href="#stuff"><em>Scientific
Stuff</em></a> and <a href="#water"><em>Water Safety</em></a>.  Also,
in <a href="#sporting"><em>Sporting Goods</em></a> we see Daria's
byline on an article in the school newspaper, "by Daria Morgendorfer
[<em>sic</em>]."  Presumably the animator's misspelling of Daria's
surname was not deliberate&nbsp;- her name is spelled "Morgendorffer" in
<em>Beavis and Butt-head</em> merchandise&nbsp;[<a href="#sucks">23</a>].
</p>

<p>
Beavis and Butt-head both delight in teasing Daria about her uncommon
name, calling her "Diarrhea."  However, in a rare display of respect,
Butt-head makes an effort to avoid calling her this to her face on
many occasions.  (Beavis, who is even stupider and less sensitive than
Butt-head, always does so.)
</p>

<h2><a name="voice">That Daria Voice</a></h2>

<p>
Tracy Grandstaff was Daria Morgendorffer's speaking (and singing)
voice throughout the <em>Daria</em> series.  Therefore, it's pleasing
to note that Ms. Grandstaff also supplied Daria's droll monotone in
most <em>Beavis and Butt-head</em> episodes.
</p>

<p>
However, Daria's voice is noticeably higher and more expressive than
usual in the <em>Beavis and Butt-head</em> episode <a
href="#walkathon"><em>Walkathon</em></a>.  It has been strongly
rumored&nbsp;[<a href="#tvtome">16</a>] that Janie Mertz (a.k.a. Lisa
Collins), later to be the voice of Brittany Taylor, Sandi Griffin and
Andrea in <em>Daria</em>, played the part of Daria Morgendorffer in
this episode.
</p>

<h2>Beavis and Butt-head in <em>Daria</em></h2>

<p>
Before examining Daria's appearances in <em>Beavis and Butt-head</em>,
we consider two <em>Daria</em> episodes that legitimize her prior
existence in the <em>Beavis and Butt-head</em> universe (even though
Beavis and Butt-head themselves never appeared in, and were never
mentioned in, the <em>Daria</em> series).
</p>

<h3><a name="esteemsters">Esteemsters</a></h3>

<p>
In <em>Esteemsters</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#daria">14</a>], the first
regular <em>Daria</em> episode (March 3rd, 1997), we learn that the
Morgendorffers have just moved to Lawndale from Beavis and Butt-head's
home town of Highland.  While trying to encourage Daria to be less
judgemental of her fellow students and increase her chances of making
friends, Daria's mother Helen says, "You don't want it to be Highland
all over again," thereby establishing the link with the <em>Beavis and
Butt-head</em> series.
</p>

<p>
Also noteworthy is that, in describing her first day at Lawndale High,
Daria says, "There are some interesting idiots in my class."  This is
consistent with her appearances in <em>Beavis and Butt-head</em>,
where she seems to have been entertained by the pair's stupidity.
</p>

<h3><a name="boxing">Boxing Daria</a></h3>

<p>
<em>Boxing Daria</em>, the final regular <em>Daria</em> episode (June
25th, 2001), is also relevant, but in a much less obvious way.
Although a number of <em>Daria</em> episodes, e.g., <em>Pinch
Sitter</em> and <em>Camp Fear</em>, feature flashbacks to Daria's
pre-Lawndale experiences, none of these contain any detail about the
Morgendorffer's home.  However, in <em>Boxing Daria</em> we see
extensive flashbacks to an event that took place when Daria was six
years old.  At this time the Morgendorffers lived in a single-story
house which the teenage Quinn later refers to as "<em>the</em> old
house [<em>emphasis added</em>]."  Since Daria's sister remembers
living in only one house prior to Lawndale, the residence shown in
this episode must be the Morgendorffer's Highland home (which was
never shown in <em>Beavis and Butt-head</em>&nbsp;[<a
href="#pollard">1</a>]).
</p>

<p>
The other important point made in <em>Boxing Daria</em> is that Daria
had considerable trouble making friends from a very early age.  As we
will see below, this may explain her willingness to associate with
Highland's other social outcasts, Beavis and Butt-head.
</p>



<h2>Daria in <em>Beavis and Butt-head</em></h2>

<p>
<em>Beavis and Butt-head</em> follows the misadventures of its
eponymous heroes, two brain-dead, hormonally-driven students at
Highland High School.  Their only goals in life are sex, drugs and
heavy metal music, but they only ever manage to score the last of
these, and even then only on television.  Their extreme stupidity
makes them outcasts among their fellow students and drives their
teachers insane (sometimes literally).  Although they frequently annoy
the people around them, as often as not Beavis and Butt-head wind up
the victims of their own backfiring schemes.
</p>

<p>
For a <em>Daria</em> fan, Highland High School has much in common with
Lawndale High.  Highland's Principal McVicker is just as rabid as his
Lawndale counterpart, Angela Li.  Highland's Coach Bradley Buzzcut
shouts at his students even more often than Lawndale's Anthony
DeMartino, and he has not one, but two, bulging bloodshot eyes.
Highland's hippy teacher, David van&nbsp;Driessen, is virtually
indistinguishable from Lawndale's sensitive new-age guy, Timothy
O'Neill.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise, however, the two series are very different.  <em>Beavis and
Butt-head</em>'s stories are only 5&nbsp;minutes long (excluding
commercials and music clips), compared to <em>Daria</em>'s
20&nbsp;minutes, thus providing little time for character development.
Where <em>Daria</em> relies on skillful wordplay, <em>Beavis and
Butt-head</em> uses slapstick and vulgarity to achieve laughs.
Finally, where <em>Daria</em>'s Lawndale is depicted as a pleasant,
but dull, middle-class town, <em>Beavis and Butt-head</em>'s Highland
is decidedly impoverished and bleak.
</p>

<p>
Most of <em>Beavis and Butt-head</em>'s screen time is dedicated to
the duo themselves and their long-suffering teachers.  Surprisingly
little time is given to other students, although regular victims of
Beavis and Butt-head's antics, such as classmate Stewart Stevenson,
appear occasionally.  Thus, even though she features in only a small
number of episodes, Daria Morgendorffer stands out among Highland's
students as someone seen frequently with Beavis and Butt-head.
</p>

<p>
Below we describe all of Daria's major appearances in <em>Beavis and
Butt-head</em>, in order of their original broadcast dates&nbsp;[<a
href="#wikipedia">22</a>].  Full transcripts of Daria's speaking roles
are given and Daria's attire is documented, where known.
</p>



<h3><a name="stuff">Episode 6. Scientific Stuff (May 17th, 1993)</a></h3>

<p>
<em>Scientific Stuff</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#monde">15</a>] marks Daria's
first televison appearance&nbsp;[<a href="#wikipedia">22</a>], and is
also notable as the <em>Beavis and Butt-head</em> episode that gives
her more screen time than any other.
</p>

<p>
At the episode's beginning Beavis and Butt-head's recreation of the
Challenger space shuttle disaster so offends their science teacher,
Mrs. Dickie, that she tells them they must do another science report,
this time with Daria.  In an unsubtle piece of exposition she also
introduces Daria to the television audience.  (Daria is wearing <a
href="#outfittwo">outfit&nbsp;2</a>.)
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Dickie:</strong> And this time I want you to work with Daria
Morgendorffer, our straight-A student who won the science
award last year.
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> But Mrs. Dickie, Beavis and Butt-head
are complete imbeciles!
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> Yeah, she's right!
<br>
<strong>Dickie:</strong> Now, Daria, I'm sure this will be
a learning experience for all concerned.
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> Oh no, we have to work with
Diarrhea!
</blockquote>

<p>
Daria's eyes widen with horror when Mrs. Dickie mentions her name and
her whiny protest reveals that she is really upset at being paired
with Beavis and Butt-head.
</p>

<p>
Later, she arrives at Beavis and Butt-head's house and knocks on the
door.  (Butt-head is gainfully occupied kicking empty cans around the
floor while Beavis watches.)
</p>

<blockquote>
[Knocking]
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> It's her.
<br>
[Daria enters]
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Hey, Butt-head.
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> Hey, Dia ... I mean, Daria.
<br>
[As Daria walks in past the pair she looks heavenward with exasperation]
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> You guys think of any new science
projects?
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> Yeah.  If you pour salt on a snail a lot
of scientific stuff happens!
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> [holding a magnifying glass]
We could burn some ants!
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> How does a person <em>learn</em> a skill
like that?
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> Everything I know, I learned from my
dad.
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> Yeah, me too!
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Really?  You both have the same dad?
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> Er, we're not sure.  It's possible!
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> [thinking]  Hmmm ... I think I have
an idea for a science report!
</blockquote>

<p>
Back in class, Daria presents her report, using Beavis and Butt-head
as guinea pigs.  Beavis demonstrates his ability to play "Yankee
Doodle" by rapping himself on the forehead with his knuckles, while
the class looks on in slack-jawed amazement.
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> By changing the shape of my mouth I
create different vibrators&nbsp;...
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> [whispering behind her hand] Vibrations!
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> Uh, vibrations ... that can be used to
play a song.  My uncle taught me this trick, only he used a bat!
<br>
[Everyone applauds, including Daria]
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> Thank you.
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> Here's something my dad taught me.
If you, like, take three deep breaths and then you blow on
your thumb, sometimes you pass out.
<br>
[Butt-head begins to demonstrate, while Beavis resumes his "song"]
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> And so we raise an age-old question:
Idiocy - Genetic or Environmental?  I think our examples of
Beavis and Butt-head indicate that both are contributing factors.
<br>
[Butt-head passes out]
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> I rest my case!
</blockquote>

<p>
Afterwards, sitting primly on the couch in between Beavis and
Butt-head&nbsp;[<a href="#pollard">1</a>], Daria congratulates the
boys on their effort.
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Daria:</strong> You guys were great!  I don't know
anyone else who'd be willing to make such fools of themselves.
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> Hey, Diarrhea!
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> [cautiously] Yeah?
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> Do you, like, get periods?
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Butt-head, why don't you try this
experiment?  Analyze the friction caused by digitally
oscillating your weiner!
<br>
[Beavis and Butt-head laugh]
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> That was cool!
</blockquote>

<p>
This first appearance by Daria is extraordinary in that her character
emerges fully defined.  Years before her "debut" in <a
href="#esteemsters"><em>Esteemsters</em></a>, her academic credentials
are firmly established, and she already displays her trademark sarcasm
and cunning.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, later <em>Daria</em> episodes seem to borrow from
<em>Scientific Stuff</em>.  In <em>The Lab Brat</em>, Daria is
similarly forced to undertake a science project with a mental midget,
but manages to turn the situation to her advantage.  Also, episodes
such as <em>Pinch Sitter</em> again show how she will shamelessly
exploit others for the purposes of a school report.
</p>

<p>
The relationship between Daria and Beavis and Butt-head is much more
antagonistic in these early episodes than in their subsequent
encounters.  In later episodes Beavis and Butt-head seem to develop
some (small) respect for Daria and she is (slightly) less rude towards
them.
</p>


<h3><a name="babes">Episode 25. Babes 'R Us (June 23rd, 1993)</a></h3>

<p>
In <em>Babes 'R Us</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#partone">6</a>], Beavis and
Butt-head see an advertisement for a female mud-wrestling bar and
decide to practice by wrestling each other in a mud puddle in their
front yard, while wearing bikini tops.  (The aim of the game is to
remove the tops.)  Daria comes walking by (wearing <a
href="#outfitone">outfit&nbsp;1</a>), on her way home from school.
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Daria:</strong> What are you guys doing?
<br>
<strong>Beavis and Butt-head:</strong> [chanting]
Diarrhea, cha-cha-cha.   Diarrhea, cha-cha-cha.
Diarrhea, cha-cha-cha.
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Get a life!  What exactly do you
call this?
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> We're gonna be cool!  Like the
American Gladiators!
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> Yeah!
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> What's with the bikini tops?
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> We're gonna get a real woman!
Down at Babes 'R Us.
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> Yeah!
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Oh, they're gonna love you guys!
<br>
[Daria walks away quickly]
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> That was cool!
</blockquote>

<p>
Daria found this early encounter with Beavis and Butt-head
so memorable that she refers to it much
later in <a href="#dead"><em>Beavis and Butt-head Are Dead</em></a>.
</p>


<h3><a name="sign">Episode 28. Sign Here (July 6th, 1993)</a></h3>

<p>
In <em>Sign Here</em> we first see Daria in David van&nbsp;Driessen's
class&nbsp;[<a href="#blog">19</a>].
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>van Driessen:</strong> Now people, do you know what I mean
when I say that animals are sentient creatures? Daria?
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> They think and feel just like us?
<br>
[Beavis hits Butt-head with a ruler, Butt-head fails to hit Beavis
with a book, and there is much scuffling, shouting and laughing
from the pair]
<br>
<strong>van Driessen:</strong> Well, just like most of us, anyways.
</blockquote>

<p>
It then transpires that van Driessen is trying to keep a furrier out
of town and seeks to elicit sympathy from the students.
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>van Driessen:</strong> Who can tell me how they kill these
poor little animals that they use to make those furs? Anybody?
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Anal electrocution?
<br>
<strong>van Driessen:</strong> That's correct.
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> What's that mean?
<br>
<strong>van Driessen:</strong> Tell the class, Daria.
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Fifty thousand volts up the butt!
<br>
[Daria smiles, as the rest of the class gasps and Beavis and Butt-head
giggle]
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> That'd be cool!
</blockquote>

<p>
On this occasion Daria's fascination with morbid subjects proves to be an
advantage.  She is also characteristically pleased with the discomfort her
graphic description causes&nbsp;[<a href="#pollard">1</a>].  Butt-head
is amused by Daria's comment.  In fact, although he doesn't always
understand what she means, Butt-head often laughs at Daria's sarcastic
remarks and calls her actions "cool".
</p>


<h3><a name="incognito">Episode 35. Incognito (September 8th,
1993)</a></h3>

<p>
<em>Incognito</em> is one of several <em>Beavis and Butt-head</em>
episodes which is rarely seen due to its controversial subject matter,
in this case guns in schools.  As the episode opens van&nbsp;Driessen
is lecturing the class on photosynthesis.  When he reveals that the
material is non-examinable the class cheers and waves their
hands&nbsp;- Daria included&nbsp;- which wakes Beavis and Butt-head
from their slumbers&nbsp;[<a href="#dariawiki">21</a>].
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> What's going on Daria?
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> This won't be on the test.
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> What test?
<br>
[Daria sighs, then returns to her notetaking]
</blockquote>

<p>
Beavis and Butt-head then irritate a gun-packing student named Earl
who responds by threatening them.  The next day they arrive at class
in disguise.  As van&nbsp;Driessen continues his (surprisingly long)
lecture, a bullet strikes his blackboard, apparently coming from
outside the classroom.  Daria rushes to the window to investigate.
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Daria:</strong> There's the kid!
</blockquote>

<p>
At this point Earl decides to retaliate.
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Earl:</strong> You shooting at <em>me</em>, punk?
<br>
[He breaks a larger hole in the window and fires a warning shot in the air]
<br>
<strong>Earl:</strong> Mr.&nbsp;van&nbsp;Driessen don't like people
firin' at him when he's diagrammin' photosynthesis!
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Earl, you don't like Mondays, huh?
<br>
<strong>Earl:</strong> I don't like <em>any</em> day.
<br>
<strong>van&nbsp;Driessen:</strong> Well, I guess he won't be
disrupting <em>this</em> class anymore.
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Not running away from warning shots, he won't. 
</blockquote>

<p>
The episode ends with van&nbsp;Driessen confiscating Earl's gun and
adding it to his large collection of such items.  Given the state of
Highland High's educational environment, it's little wonder that Daria
doesn't look back fondly on her time there.
</p>



<h3><a name="sporting">Episode 44. Sporting Goods (October 4th,
1993)</a></h3>

<p>
<em>Sporting Goods</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#jocks">5</a>] is by far the
best of the <em>Beavis and Butt-head</em> episodes reviewed for this
essay.  Not only does Daria play an important part in the plot, but
the episode is genuinely funny.  At the beginning Beavis and Butt-head
are seen sitting on the doorstep of their house.  Daria walks up
(wearing <a href="#outfitthree">outfit&nbsp;3</a>) with a large camera
on a strap around her neck&nbsp;[<a href="#phill">17</a>].
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> Hey, Dia ... er, Daria.
Where'd you get the camera?
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> Yeah!  You look like one of those
"papa-nazis" [paparazzis].
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> My parents made me join the school paper.
The paper made me fashion reporter because I'm a girl.
I hate fashion!!!  There's no fashion in this town!
I want to be an enquiring photographer.
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> Yeah, yeah!  Then you can take pictures in
the girls' locker room.
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> Yeah, and <em>enquire</em> about how they'd
like to please Big-Daddy Butt-head.
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> God, you're gross!
<br>
[Daria raises the camera and takes their photograph]
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> Hey, why'd you do that?
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> You never know, National Geographic
might call!
<br>
[Daria walks away quickly]
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> She thinks we're cool!
</blockquote>

<p>
This exchange is important because it mentions Daria's parents in the
<em>Beavis and Butt-head</em> universe, and it shows that even at this
stage Jake and Helen were pressuring Daria to become involved in
extracurricular activities.  Daria's attitude to being made fashion
reporter obviously foreshadows her later obsessions at Lawndale High.
Her little diatribe is also animated in an amusing way - she shakes
her head violently as she rants against sexism and fashion.
</p>

<p>
Later, in gym class,
Coach Buzzcut learns that Beavis and Butt-head are not
wearing regulation athletic supporters.  (He discovers this by
delivering Beavis a crippling blow with a medicine ball.)
They are therefore sent to "Buddy's Sporting Goods" to buy
appropriate equipment.  However, when it is found that even the
smallest available supporters are too big, Buddy gets the idea
of giving Beavis and Butt-head racketball eye patches to use
as supporters.  They retire to the changing rooms to try them on.
For reasons unknown, they decide to both use the same booth, even
though others are free, so there is much commotion as they struggle
to change in the confined space.  At this point Daria enters the
store with the camera and a clipboard.
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Buddy:</strong> Hi, can I help you?
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> I have some questions about active-wear.
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> [in the changing room] Cool!
<br>
[Daria does a double-take]
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> Snug 'nads!
<br>
[Daria does a double-take]
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> [in the changing room] The family jewels
are secure!
<br>
[Beavis and Butt-head emerge wearing nothing but T-shirts and
the eye patches]
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> How do we look?
<br>
[Daria does a double-take]
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Wow!  Even smaller than I thought!
<br>
[Daria takes a photograph as Beavis and Butt-head pull their
T-shirts down to their knees]
</blockquote>

<p>
This sequence is hilarious thanks to
Daria's responses to the noises coming from the changing room.
She does three eye-popping, jaw-dropping double-takes in rapid
succession and then delivers her final line with gusto.  For
viewers familiar with the older, more reserved,
Daria these reactions are extremely funny.
</p>

<p>
Daria is not seen in the episode again, but at the end Coach
Buzzcut humiliates Beavis and Butt-head by brandishing a copy
of the school paper, <em>The Highland Herald</em>.  The front
page has Daria's picture of the near-naked Beavis and Butt-head,
with the headline "Highland High Fashion: The Thong Has
Arrived!"  (As noted <a href="#thename">above</a>, the byline misspells
Daria's surname.)
</p>


<h3><a name="citizen">Episode 47. Citizen Butt-head (October 18th,
1993)</a></h3>

<p>
<em>Citizen Butt-head</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#citizens">11</a>] is a
double-length special in which Bill Clinton visits Highland High.
Daria is one of several honor students chosen to ask him a question.
Through a series of misadventures, Beavis and Butt-head get a pass
to the gymnasium where the students are waiting.
They sit next to Daria (who is wearing <a href="#outfittwo">outfit&nbsp;2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href="#phill">17</a>].
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Beavis and Butt-head!
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> Hey, it's Diarrhea!
<br>
[Beavis and Butt-head laugh]
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> They picked you guys to meet the President?
<br>
[Beavis and Butt-head stare blankly]
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> The President of the United States!
<br>
[Beavis and Butt-head stare blankly]
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> The guy who runs the country! ... Who's here
to talk to us right now on national television!
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> Er, we got a pass.
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> Yeah!
</blockquote>

<p>
After Clinton arrives he asks for questions from the students.
Daria walks up to the microphone&nbsp;[<a href="#law">18</a>].
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Mr President, in your campaign you promised to
help every young person get a college education.  Did you mean that or
were you just jerking us around?
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> Daria's cool!
</blockquote>

<p>
Daria's question displays her usual bluntness, and
impresses even Butt-head.
While Clinton is giving his answer, Beavis and Butt-head get
an idea.
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> Hey, Beavis, that microphone makes your
voice real loud.
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> Yeah, loud, loud!  Let's try it!
<br>
[Butt-head snatches the microphone from Daria]
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Butt-head!
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> [into microphone] Whoa!
</blockquote>

<p>
Beavis and Butt-head then suggest that the
U.S. President should
use his position as leader of the world's most powerful
military force to launch unprovoked attacks on other countries.
Angry secret service agents converge on Beavis and Butt-head as they
continue to mock the President.
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> The streets will flow with the blood of the
non-believers!
<br>
[Daria grabs the microphone back]
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Uh, forgive them Mr President.  Um,
Beavis and Butt-head are emotionally, er, you know, special.
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> Yeah, we got a pass!
</blockquote>

<p>
Whether Daria intervenes to save Beavis and Butt-head's skins or
the reputation of Highland High is unclear.  Nevertheless, her
tactic works and
Clinton praises Beavis and Butt-head for coping so well despite their
apparent handicap.  He awards them Students of the Year.
As he does so, he
stands directly in front of Daria, completely upstaging her.
</p>



<h3><a name="water">Episode 71. Water Safety (April 7th, 1994)</a></h3>

<p>
In <em>Water Safety</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#improvement">12</a>]
Coach Buzzcut is supervising swimming lessons at the
Highland High School Natatorium.
Daria is in attendance, wearing a red one-piece bathing suit.
(This seems to be Daria's preferred style of swimwear.  She wears
a one-piece suit in the <em>Daria</em> episode <em>Camp Fear</em>
and the opening credits of the movie <em>Is It Fall Yet?</em>)
At one stage she is practising staying afloat when Beavis starts providing
a manic version of the <em>Jaws</em> theme as accompaniment.
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Shut up, Beavis!
<br>
<strong>Buzzcut:</strong> Thank you, Miss Morgendorffer!  Next!
Butt-head!
</blockquote>

<p>
However, Butt-head is found lying on the bottom of the pool and,
after Beavis makes a pathetic rescue attempt, Coach Buzzcut is
compelled to dive in and save them both.  Before he does so he
entrusts Daria with the equipment he is carrying.  (To attract
her attention, Buzzcut puts his hand on Daria's head.  She doesn't
flinch at this condescending gesture.)
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Buzzcut:</strong> Miss Morgendorffer, please commandeer my
clipboard and whistle!
</blockquote>

<p>
As Daria takes the items she
looks wide-eyed with alarm at the whole situation.
</p>

<p>
Following the inevitable rescue, Coach Buzzcut decides that Beavis
and Butt-head can be put to some useful purpose after all.
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Buzzcut:</strong> OK, class!  Beavis and Butt-head have
volunteered to serve as CPR dummies for our emergency lesson!
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Oh, gross!
</blockquote>

<p>
Daria's reaction sums up that of all the students, and Buzzcut is
ultimately forced to perform the loathsome duty himself.
</p>

<h3><a name="art">Episode 80. Butt, Is It Art? (May 9th, 1994)</a></h3>

<p>
Daria gets only one line in <em>Butt, Is It
Art?</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#pupils">9</a>], but it's a classic.
Mr. van&nbsp;Driessen is taking the students on a field trip to
an art museum.  (Daria is wearing <a href="#outfitthree">outfit&nbsp;3</a>.)
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>van Driessen:</strong> Now, works by the master painters
of the centuries!
<br>
[Beavis and Butt-head break into laughter.  Daria enters]
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> He said master <em>painters</em>!
<br>
[Daria exits]
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> Oh!
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> Yeah, master painting is cool.
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="cornholio">Episode 92. The Great Cornholio
(July 15th, 1994)</a></h3>

<p>
This episode introduces Beavis' amusing alter ego, The Great
Cornholio, who emerges whenever he overdoses on sugar.  On this
occasion Beavis and Butt-head raid the sugar supply in Stewart
Stevenson's kitchen.  Beavis completes the transformation to Cornholio
in van Driessen's class, his antics giving Daria her only line in the
episode&nbsp;[<a href="#foodgod">20</a>].
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>van Driessen:</strong> Beavis! Please sit down.
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> Are you threatening me? I am Cornholio!!!
<br>
<strong>van Driessen:</strong> Come on, Beavis. Take your seat. 
Now, technically America is not a democracy but a republic&nbsp;...
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> [to Daria] You have T.P.?  T.P. for my bunghole?
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Get out of here, Beavis.
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> Um. Okay. Heh heh&nbsp;...
heh heh&nbsp;... [walks out of class]
</blockquote>


<h3><a name="walkathon">Episode 100. Walkathon
(December 10th, 1994)</a></h3>

<p>
In <em>Walkathon</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#pupils">9</a>], Beavis and
Butt-head are sitting outside a convenience store drinking
"slurpees" when Beavis suffers from brain freeze.
Daria (wearing <a href="#outfitthree">outfit&nbsp;3</a>) walks into
the scene carrying a clipboard.  (As noted <a href="#voice">above</a>,
Daria's voice sounds odd.)
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Hello boys.  Er ... learning how to
drink from a cup, Beavis?
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> Shut up! ... Diarrhea.
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> How come you guys aren't out collecting
pledges for the walkathon?
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> Errr ... pledges?
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> [sighs] The way you raise money in a
walkathon is you get people to pledge money for every mile you walk.
<br>
[Beavis and Butt-head stare blankly]
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> People give you X amount of money if you
walk Y number of miles.
<br>
[Beavis and Butt-head stare blankly]
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> You get people to pay you to walk.
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> Cool!  Why didn't you just say so?
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> So, will you guys pledge for me?
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> Er, OK.  Like how much?
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> How's a quarter a mile sound?
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> Er, two quarters a mile?
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> Seventy-five cents!
<br>
[Butt-head elbows Beavis in the face]
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> Aaagh!
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> I just said that, dumbass!  OK, a dollar!
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> Ten!
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> [writing] "Beavis and Butt-head, ten dollars
a mile, each!"
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> Hey, er, don't you have to, like,
do something for us now?
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> OK, fair's fair.  For every mile you walk,
I'll pledge a nickel for you guys to split.
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> OK.
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> <em>Great!</em>  See you at the walkathon.
<br>
[Daria exits, while Beavis and Butt-head laugh]
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> Um, what's so funny?
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> We just totally ripped her off!
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> Oh, yeah!  Cool!
</blockquote>

<p>
Daria is not seen again, and Beavis and Butt-head's attempts to take a
short cut in the walkathon end in disaster.  (Daria does not get her
money; Beavis and Butt-head cannot pay their pledges and are forced to
walk off the debt.)
</p>

<p>
This is a typical encounter between Beavis and Butt-head and Daria,
with the moronic pair barely able to comprehend what she is saying.
Daria is quite happy to take advantage of their stupidity,
demonstrating the same mercenary attitude she would frequently display
in <em>Daria</em>'s early seasons.  The only surprising aspect of the
episode is Daria's uncharacteristic willingness to enter into the
spirit of the walkathon.
</p>


<h3><a name="career">Episode 104. Career Day (December 16th, 1994)</a></h3>

<p>
In <em>Career Day</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#rescue">4</a>]
Mr. van&nbsp;Driessen offers his students the chance to get a day off
school to observe a vocation of their choice selected from the Career
Day displays.  Wandering around the displays, Beavis and Butt-head
find Daria (wearing <a href="#outfitthree">outfit&nbsp;3</a>) standing
at a booth labelled "Publishing&nbsp;- A Future for Those Who Read."
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Man in Booth:</strong> We do mostly educational and
technical manuals.
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> Who's gonna buy that crap?
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> Yeah, really!
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Beavis!  Butt-head!  You're supposed to
be exploring career opportunities.
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> These jobs are stupid!
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> Yeah!  Everyone, like, works in a booth.
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> These people don't work in booths!
They're here to answer questions and help you plan your future.
<br>
[Beavis and Butt-head stare blankly]
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> ... Your life <em>after</em> graduation ...
<br>
[Beavis and Butt-head stare blankly]
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Well, if you guys don't pick a career,
van&nbsp;Driessen won't let you skip a day of school next week.
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> Er, skip school?
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> Yeah, it's cool!
</blockquote>

<p>
As usual, Beavis and Butt-head have a difficult time understanding
Daria.  The most interesting aspect of this brief appearance
by Daria is her choice of Career Day booth.  Even at Highland High
it seems she was thinking of a career as an author, as confirmed in later
<em>Daria</em> episodes such as <em>Write Where It Hurts</em> and
<em>The Story of&nbsp;D</em>.
</p>


<h3><a name="wet">Episode 112. Wet Behind the Rears
(January 29th, 1995)</a></h3>

<p>
In <em>Wet Behind the Rears</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#pupils">9</a>] Coach
Buzzcut and Principal McVicker embarrass Beavis and Butt-head by
arranging a fire alarm while the duo are changing after gym class.
They are forced to go outside in their underwear, where
Daria (in <a href="#outfitthree">outfit&nbsp;3</a>) and
the other students are assembled.  As they emerge, Daria ensures
that the pair do not go unnoticed.
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Daria:</strong> [offscreen] Hey, look, it's
Beavis and Butt-head!
</blockquote>

<p>
Daria is not usually so vocal, but evidently this opportunity was too
good to miss.  (Actually, since the shout comes from offscreen, there
is no conclusive evidence that Daria speaks this line, rather than one
of the other girls in the group.  Nevertheless, the voice sounds like it
<em>could</em> be hers, so it is widely assumed to be so, especially
since she is shown to be among the crowd beforehand.)
</p>



<h3><a name="spare">Episode 136. Spare Me (September 12th, 1995)</a></h3>

<p>
In <em>Spare Me</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#lucky">10</a>], Beavis and
Butt-head are offered the chance for "a ride" with two "babes" whose
car has a flat tire, provided they can fix it.  As the duo struggle
hopelessly to get the wheel off, Daria walks upon the scene (wearing
<a href="#outfitthree">outfit&nbsp;3</a>), just as Beavis and
Butt-head have convinced themselves that no-one will notice the tire
is still flat.
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Flat tire, huh?
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> Damnit!
<br>
[Butt-head throws the tire lever which bounces back and knocks
him out]
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> You guys are <em>so</em> stupid.
<br>
[Fast forward to Daria finishing changing the wheel]
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> I hope you two paid attention because
this <em>will</em> come up again.
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> Errr ... yeah.  So, like, er, if
you'll excuse us there's, er, still work left to be done.
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> Yeah!  Go away ... Diarrhea.
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> This is gonna be cool!
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> We're gonna score!
<br>
<strong>Babes:</strong> Thanks guys!
<br>
[They drive off, leaving Beavis and Butt-head behind]
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> You guys are never gonna get any!
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="history">Episode 145. U.S. History
(November 20th, 1995)</a></h3>

<p>
When <em>U.S. History</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#pupils">9</a>] begins we
see Daria (wearing <a href="#outfitthree">outfit&nbsp;3</a>) standing
in front of Mr. van&nbsp;Driessen's history class concluding a
presentation on John&nbsp;F.&nbsp;Kennedy's assassination.
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Daria:</strong> [pointing to a diagram on the blackboard] And
when this "magic bullet" went into the President's chest it had to
make a sharp turn in order to exit his body from the neck.  Then
it would have had to turn right, then left, and somehow have enough
energy to hit the Governor in the front seat.  Clearly the
assassination was a conspiracy.
<br>
[Daria sits down]
<br>
<strong>van Driessen:</strong> Thank you, Daria, that gave me the
chills.
</blockquote>

<p>
Unfortunately, Beavis and Butt-head are less well prepared for their
oral reports.  Mr. van&nbsp;Driessen explains to them that they will
be left behind if they don't give presentations.  (Beavis and
Butt-head are sitting in their usual seats, in the rear of the
classroom, with Daria several rows ahead.)
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Daria:</strong> [turning around] You guys'll never graduate.
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> Never masturbate?
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Graduate!  It's when you're all done with
school.
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> Er, you mean, like, school ends?
</blockquote>

<p>
Following this revelation, Beavis and Butt-head give rather pathetic
impromptu "history" presentations.
</p>

<p>
Daria shows off her usual academic prowess in this episode and, from
her choice of subject matter, again reveals the morbid interests she
would display frequently in <em>Daria</em>.  (She also refers to JFK's
assassination in the <em>Daria</em> episode <em>Gifted</em>.)
</p>

<h3><a name="sprout">Episode 153. Sprout (January 17th, 1996)</a></h3>

<p>
Daria's encounter with Beavis and Butt-head in
<em>Sprout</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#partthree">7</a>] is brief, but
especially amusing and revealing.  Van&nbsp;Driessen has assigned the
class a project to grow food plants, to help the students reconnect
with nature.  Beavis and Butt-head decide to grow corn because they
want to make nachos.  They dump the packet of seeds on the ground in
their backyard and are standing around waiting for something to happen
when Daria walks up (wearing <a
href="#outfitthree">outfit&nbsp;3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href="#law">18</a>].
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> These seeds suck!
<br>
[Daria enters]
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> I knew you guys would screw this up.
I just had to see for myself.
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> What do you know about nachos,
Daria?
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> Yeah ... Diarrhea!
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Not much, but I do know you're
supposed to plant the seeds&nbsp;...
<br>
[Beavis and Butt-head stare blankly]
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> ...&nbsp;in the ground!
<br>
[Beavis and Butt-head stare blankly]
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> I know it sounds crazy, but I've seen
it work.  Then you have to give them water and then some plant
food.  And it helps if you talk to them too.  In the meantime,
I hope you guys don't starve to death!
<br>
[Daria leaves]
<br>
<strong>Beavis:</strong> Stupid Diarrhea!
<br>
<strong>Butt-head:</strong> Really!  Well, you heard her, dude.
Let's get 'em in the ground!
</blockquote>

<p>
(Tracy Grandstaff's delivery of Daria's lines is excellent, with just
the right degrees of sarcasm, frustration and resignation, in that
order.)  Beavis and Butt-head then attempt to follow Daria's
instructions, but their technique of stomping the packet of seeds into
the ground, smothering them with junk food, and then yelling at them
doesn't have the desired effect.  (Amazingly, a sprout does appear,
but Beavis and Butt-head fail to notice.)  Interestingly, Butt-head
once again avoids using Daria's insulting nickname and he respects her
advice.
</p>

<p>
Daria's arrival on the scene is also curious.  She openly states
that she has gone out of her way to see what Beavis and
Butt-head are up to.  Lacking any friends, the younger
Daria seems willing to seek out the company of Highland High's
other misfits, even though she and they are clearly at opposite ends
of the intellectual spectrum.
</p>

<p>
The episode ends with another fascinating detail.
Mr. van&nbsp;Driessen displays all the students' plants on his desk,
in paper cups with the students' names printed on them.  Daria's
effort stands out from the rest of the plain green seedlings&nbsp;-
it's a small red rose-bud.  Perhaps the Misery Chick has a romantic
streak after all?
</p>


<h3><a name="dead">Episode 200. Beavis and Butt-head Are Dead
(November 28th, 1997)</a></h3>

<p>
As its name suggests, this is the final <em>Beavis and Butt-head</em>
episode&nbsp;[<a href="#death">8</a>].  In it Beavis and Butt-head
are presumed dead, and the teachers celebrate, although Mr.
van&nbsp;Driessen is a little more sensitive.
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>van&nbsp;Driessen:</strong> Does anyone have something to
share about Beavis or Butt-head?
<br>
[Silence from the class]
<br>
<strong>van&nbsp;Driessen:</strong> Anyone?  Um, Daria, I've
seen you talking with them.
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> Well, I guess it's kind of sad that they're
dead and all.  But it's not like they had bright futures ahead
of them.  I mean I remember this time I was walking home from
school ... there they were ...
<br>
[Flashbacks are shown from
<a href="#babes"><em>Babes 'R Us</em></a>,
<a href="#art"><em>Butt, Is It Art?</em></a> and
<a href="#history"><em>U.S. History</em></a>]
<br>
<strong>Daria:</strong> I rest my case!
</blockquote>

<p>
(Many other flashbacks are shown in this episode.
Notably, Daria also appears in a <a href="#nonspeaking">non-speaking role</a>
during Coach Buzzcut's flashback to the events of <em>No
Laughing</em>.)
</p>

<p>
The importance of this episode is that van&nbsp;Driessen singles
Daria out of the whole class when looking for someone who
regularly associated with Beavis and Butt-head.  Indeed, as we've seen
in other episodes, not only is Daria the only student who talks
voluntarily to Beavis and Butt-head, but she even goes out of
her way to do so.  Furthermore, Daria is never shown interacting
with any other students.  Given Daria's well-known difficulties
in making friends, the sad inference is that Daria, a misfit
due to her high intelligence, is forced to seek companionship with
Beavis and Butt-head, two outcasts due to their astonishingly low
intelligence.  With such a past, it's no wonder that Daria
values Jane Lane's friendship so highly in <em>Daria</em>.
</p>

<h3><a name="nonspeaking">Non-Speaking Roles</a></h3>

<p>
Daria appears in numerous episodes as a background character
in crowd and classroom scenes.  Documented examples include
<em>Premature Evacuation</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#pupils">9</a>],
<em>Steamroller</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#partthree">7</a>],
<em>Head Lice</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#partthree">7</a>],
<em>Generation in Crisis</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#citizens">11</a>],
<em>Sexual Harrassment</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#citizens">11</a>],
<em>Crisis Line</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#rescue">4</a>],
<em>Just for Girls</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#jocks">5</a>],
<em>It's a Miserable Life</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#larissa">3</a>],
<em>Party</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#larissa">3</a>],
<em>Substitute</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#larissa">3</a>],
<em>Tainted Meat</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#larissa">3</a>],
<em>The Trial</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#larissa">3</a>],
<em>Animation Sucks</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#pollard">1</a>],
<em>Bride of Butt-head</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#pollard">1</a>],
<em>Bus Trip</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#pollard">1</a>],
<em>Candy Sale</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#cincgreen">2</a>],
<em>Cyber-Butt</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#cincgreen">2</a>],
<em>Evolution Sucks</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#pollard">1</a>],
<em>Manners Suck</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#pollard">1</a>],
<em>The Miracle That is Beavis</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#pollard">1</a>],
<em>The Mystery of Morning Wood</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#improvement">12</a>],
<em>No Laughing</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#pollard">1</a>],
<em>P.T.A.</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#partthree">7</a>],
<em>Scared Straight</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#pollard">1</a>],
<em>Temporary Insanity</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#cash">13</a>],
<em>Let's Clean It Up</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#cincgreen">2</a>],
<em>Held Back</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#cincgreen">2</a>],
<em>I Dream of Beavis</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#cincgreen">2</a>], and
<em>Womyn</em>&nbsp;[<a href="#lucky">10</a>].
Some of these appearances are extremely brief.  For instance,
only the back of her head is visible in
<em>P.T.A</em> and <em>The Mystery of Morning Wood</em>.
She is also glimpsed in van&nbsp;Driessen's class in
the 1996 feature film <em>Beavis and Butt-head do America</em>.
<!-- December 20th, 1996 -->
</p>

<p>
Surprisingly, given the brevity of these appearances, they provide
some unexpected insights into the younger Daria's character.
They include numerous instances of Daria
unquestioningly following the actions of her classmates, although in
the later <em>Daria</em> series she frequently criticizes
conformity.  For instance, in <em>Generation in Crisis</em>
(episode&nbsp;90; July 14th, 1994)&nbsp;[<a href="#citizens">11</a>],
Mr. van&nbsp;Driessen asks his class to settle down when they
start throwing things at each other.  Daria is among the miscreants.
Daria raises her hand along with the other students in response to a
leading question from a substitute teacher in <em>Substitute</em>
(episode&nbsp;158; March 5th, 1996)&nbsp;[<a href="#larissa">3</a>].
She poses for the class photo in <em>Tainted Meat</em>
(episode&nbsp;108; December 29th, 1994)&nbsp;[<a href="#larissa">3</a>].
She joins her classmates in buying merchandise from "Mr. Candy" in
<em>Candy Sale</em> (episode&nbsp;116;
April 8th, 1995)&nbsp;[<a href="#cincgreen">2</a>].
Overall, while attending Highland High School Daria seems to have been
more willing to join in with others than she would later be at
Lawndale High.
</p>

<p>
Even more surprising is her willingness to display emotion in public.
For instance, in <em>No Laughing</em> (episode&nbsp;18; June 2nd,
1993) Coach Buzzcut threatens to send Beavis and Butt-head to "Hope
High School for delinquents" where they will have their "asses kicked"
on a daily basis.  At this remark, all the students, including Daria,
laugh out loud&nbsp;[<a href="#death">8</a>].  This early appearance
by Daria (she is wearing <a href="#outfitone">outfit&nbsp;1</a>) seems
strange when compared to the opening scene of <em>Daria</em>'s
credits!  Daria also laughs at Butt-head's incompetent comment, "I
rest on your face," at the end of his testimony in <em>The Trial</em>
(episode&nbsp;54; November 4th, 1993)&nbsp;[<a href="#larissa">3</a>].
The older Daria never allowed herself to be so demonstrative at
Lawndale, even in private.  It seems that while Daria was growing up
in Highland, and still constructing her cynical world view, she was
less guarded than she would become later.  (Of course, a less
appealing explanation is that <em>Beavis and Butt-head</em>'s
animators, in response to broad directions in the script such as "the
students laugh", simply drew Daria doing the same things as the other
animated characters!)
</p>

<p>
Indeed, Daria's experiences at Highland High School evidently helped
shape the strong opinions about society she held by the time the
Morgendorffers moved to Lawndale.  This point is made explicitly in
<em>It's a Miserable Life</em> (part of the 1995 Beavis and Butt-head
Christmas special, December 19th, 1995), which provides the series'
only direct comment on Daria's personality.  In a fantasy sequence
showing a world in which Butt-head never existed, Daria is shown
smiling, singing Christmas carols and holding hands with a
boy&nbsp;[<a href="#phill">17</a>].  The inference is that Beavis and
Butt-head played a major part in forging Daria's low opinion of her
fellow man.  Although we cannot place too much significance on this
alternate reality, the brief scene showing a truly happy Daria is
curiously poignant.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
As we have seen, the complex and fascinating character of "Daria
Morgendorffer" emerged almost fully formed in the <em>Beavis and
Butt-head</em> series long before <em>Daria</em> went to air.
Although her appearances in <em>Beavis and Butt-head</em> are
disappointingly brief, Daria was already shown to be smart, cynical,
acerbic and alienated.  In addition, her academic talents and desire
to become an author were already in evidence.  She was also shown to
be a little less guarded and withdrawn than her older self.
Nevertheless, her mercenary actions in <em>Beavis and Butt-head</em>
episodes such as <a href="#stuff"><em>Scientific Stuff</em></a> and <a
href="#sporting"><em>Sporting Goods</em></a> are "classic Daria."
Therefore, in this author's mind at least, Daria's adventures at
Highland High School are a worthy addition to the <em>Daria</em>
canon.
