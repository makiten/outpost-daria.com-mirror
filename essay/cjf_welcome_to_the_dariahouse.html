<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>

This essay explores the extraordinary similarities between the
television series <em>Daria</em> and the motion picture <em>Welcome to
the Dollhouse</em>.  Is our favorite TV show just a cheap rip off?

</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>

I just switched off my television set after watching the story of a
high school girl struggling with more than her fair share of teenage
problems.  Her plain face dominated by a pair of oversized glasses,
and with absolutely no fashion sense, she is shunned by the popular
students and excluded from their social events.  At home her overwound
mother and weak-willed father totally fail to understand her.  Even
worse, her sickeningly cute little sister gets all their attention.
And to top things off, she has an irresistable, hormonally-driven
crush on an older guitar-playing layabout with delusions of future
musical success, but he remains oblivious to her attentions.

</p>

<p>

In other words, I was watching an episode of MTV's animated sit-com
<em>Daria</em>, right?  Wrong!  I was watching Todd Solondz's motion
picture <em>Welcome to the Dollhouse</em> which was released the
year before <em>Daria</em> premiered.  This essay explores the
seemingly intimate relationship between the movie and the subsequent
television series.

</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>

When the movie <em>Ghost World</em> was released in 2001, fans of the
television series <em>Daria</em> were quick to point to the
similarities between <em>Ghost World</em>'s protagonists Enid Coleslaw
and Rebecca Doppelmeyer and <em>Daria</em>'s Daria Morgendorffer and
Jane Lane.  Certainly there are striking superficial similarities
between Daria and Thora Birch's portrayal of Enid.  (There is even a
very brief scene in the movie in which Enid is dressed in Daria's
trademark colors of a green top, black skirt and black boots, which
may be a deliberate homage to <em>Daria</em>.)

</p>

<p>

Ultimately, however, the comparison does not hold water.  Apart from
glasses and a smart mouth there is little similarity between Enid and
Daria, and the situations portrayed in the movie are unrelated to any
that occur in <em>Daria</em>.  (It's hard to imagine Daria
Morgendorffer going to a sex shop and buying a rubber Catwoman mask to
parade around in!)  Furthermore, <em>Ghost World</em> has its origins
in a comic book which predates <em>Daria</em>, so suggestions that the
movie borrowed from the TV series are on shaky ground.

</p>

<p>

Having been thus misled once, I expected to find a similarly tenuous
relationship between <em>Daria</em> and <em>Welcome to the
Dollhouse</em>, the other movie that is often mentioned in connection
with the TV series.  However, when I finally got a chance to see
<em>Welcome to the Dollhouse</em> recently it made me wonder seriously
about <em>Daria</em>'s origins.

</p>

<h2>What is <em>Welcome to the Dollhouse</em>?</h2>

<p>

The motion picture <em>Welcome to the Dollhouse</em> is a (very!)
black comedy which presents the daily humiliations of Dawn Weiner, a
7th grade student at Benjamin Franklin Junior High School.  In a
series of vignettes it shows her total alienation from everyone around
her, teachers, classmates, parents and siblings.  The film's language
is extremely coarse (do 7th graders really swear like this?)  and the
numerous indignities heaped upon Dawn are painful to watch.

</p>

<p>

Dawn's Daria-like status is made explicit early in the movie.  Her
locker is covered with insulting graffiti.  The other students
nickname her "Weiner Dog" and "Dog face".  Bullied by another student
she asks, "Why do you hate me?"  The answer is simple, "Because
you're ugly."  Later, reflecting on her problems, she openly says, "I
want to be popular."

</p>

<p>

Dawn is usually portrayed as a self-pitying victim, but occasionally
she tries to do what she thinks is right.  She intervenes to help a
boy named Troy who is threatened with a beating for being a suspected
"fag".  Her attempt is unsuccessful, however, and he insults rather
than thanks her.  The movie's climax revolves around a desperate and
foolhardy attempt by Dawn to earn her parents' approval (which they
ultimately don't even seem to notice).

</p>

<p>

The one bright spot in Dawn's life is her brother's friend Steve
Rodgers.  She is smitten by this guitar-playing layabout at first
sight.  The only time she smiles in the film is in his presence.  She
tries desperately to win his favour, but ultimately to no avail.

</p>

<p>

Interestingly, the overall effect of the live-action <em>Welcome to
the Dollhouse</em> is far more "cartoonish" than the animated sit-com
<em>Daria</em>.  The cruelty of Dawn's classmates, the viciousness of
her teachers, the lack of understanding of her parents, the cloying
cuteness of her little sister, and the indifference of her idol Steve,
are all so extreme that they are unbelievable.  Indeed, this is part
of the movie's appeal.  It is not realistic, but depicts the world as
Dawn sees it [<em>Silver Screen Reviews</em>, 2004].

</p>


<h2>What's the same?</h2>

<p>

As already noted above, the overall setting and tone of <em>Welcome to
the Dollhouse</em> bears a strong similarity to that of
<em>Daria</em>.  However, it's important to note that <em>Daria</em>
presents Daria Morgendorffer's experiences at high school whereas
<em>Welcome to the Dollhouse</em> depicts Dawn Weiner's life in the
first year of junior high school.  Therefore, we should think of
<em>Welcome to the Dollhouse</em> as equivalent to Daria
Morgendorffer's pre-Lawndale&nbsp;- and hence pre-Jane Lane&nbsp;-
experiences in Highland (i.e., at the time of <em>Beavis and
Butt-head</em>).

</p>

<p>

In this context, Dawn's misanthropic approach to life is much like
Daria's.  She is a total outcast at school, where the other students
are all shown to be stupid bullies.  Her teachers and parents make no
attempt to understand her.  Her mother, Marjorie Weiner, sums her up
by saying, "She's got no friends.  She's a loner."

</p>

<p>

One of the few things that makes Dawn happy is being near Steve
Rodgers, her unrequited love, who plays guitar in her brother's
otherwise geeky band The Quadratics.  The parallel with Daria
Morgendorffer's crush on Trent Lane is obvious.  Steve even drives a
battered car like Trent's.  Like Daria, Dawn doesn't smile much, but
that's simply because the movie's events don't give her much to smile
about.  She grins broadly on the rare occasions when she is alone with
Steve.

</p>


<h2>What's different?</h2>

<p>

Despite the obvious similarities, there are many differences between
<em>Welcome to the Dollhouse</em> and <em>Daria</em>.  For instance,
Dawn's parents, Harvey and Marjorie Weiner, are not upwardly mobile
professionals like Jake and Helen Morgendorffer.  Steve Rodgers is
shown to be a thoroughly unpleasant and dishonest character, unlike his
lazy, but caring and perceptive, counterpart Trent Lane.

</p>

<p>

More importantly, Dawn Weiner's character is quite different from
Daria Morgendorffer's.  Although she watches <em>Junior Quiz Bowl</em>
on television, Dawn is not intellectually gifted like Daria.  She
receives a D- for a test, albeit under very stressful conditions.
More revealing, the essay on "dignity" that unsympathetic teacher Mrs
Grissom forces her to write is entirely vapid (and is one of the
cleverest parts of the movie since it's exactly the sort of thing a
7th grade student would produce).  Whereas Daria is clearly "smarter,
deeper and funnier than anyone around her", Dawn is a "hopeless geek"
[Joyce Millman, <em>MTV's Women: They're 'Toons</em>, Media Circus, 10
March 1997].

</p>

<p>

The biggest difference in the format between <em>Welcome to the
Dollhouse</em> and <em>Daria</em> is the existence of Dawn Weiner's
older computer-geek brother Mark.  His presence acts as a constant
reminder of Dawn's intellectual shortcomings.  (Unlike
<em>Daria</em>'s Jodie Landon, who serves the important role of making
Daria Morgendorffer a more believable character by showing that she is
<em>not</em> necessarily the smartest girl in the school.)

</p>

<p>

Moreover, where Daria's actions earn the viewer's respect, Dawn is an
unsympathetic, vindictive character.  She swears at her little sister
and saws the heads off her dolls.  She smashes her parents' treasured
videotape of their wedding anniversary party (because it shows her
being embarrassed).  Life seems unfair to Dawn, but she is equally
cruel to others.  In particular, she consistently belittles her
younger schoolfriend Ralphy in ways that are obviously hurtful to him.

</p>

<p>

Overall, where Daria fights back at an unfair world with cunning and
sarcasm, Dawn employs much cruder methods, especially picking on those
weaker than herself.  In turn, Dawn gives in meekly to bullying and,
in an odd plot twist, forms a naive romantic attachment with Brandan
McCarthy, a student who had previously threatened to assault her.

</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>

So what's the verdict?  Was <em>Daria</em> based on <em>Welcome to the
Dollhouse</em>?  At first it may appear so, given the many strong
similarities between the two.  Combining <em>Beavis and
Butt-head</em>'s smart and cynical Daria Morgendorffer with the
situations and attitudes presented in <em>Welcome to the
Dollhouse</em>&nbsp;- suitably sanitized for television&nbsp;- would
inevitably seem to produce <em>Daria</em> as we know it.

</p>

<p>

However, before jumping to any conclusions, consider the following
timeline:

<ol>

<li>
March 19th, 1993: Daria Morgendorffer's first appearance in <em>Beavis
and Butt-head</em>, in the episode <em>Sign Here</em>.
</li>

<li>
August 11th, 1995: <em>Daria</em> pilot <em>Sealed With a Kick</em> is
completed, introducing the characters of Jake and Helen Morgendorffer,
Quinn Morgendorffer, and Jane Lane.
</li>

<li>
May 10th, 1996: The motion picture <em>Welcome to the Dollhouse</em>
(copyright 1995) premieres at the Philadelphia Festival of World
Cinema, introducing the characters of Dawn Weiner, Harvey and Marjorie
Weiner, Missy Weiner (portrayed by <em>Daria</em> Kalinina!) and Steve
Rodgers.
</li>

<li>
June, 1996: <em>Welcome to the Dollhouse</em> enters general release in
the United States of America.
</li>

<li>
March 3rd, 1997: The television series <em>Daria</em> debuts with the episode
<em>Esteemsters</em>.
</li>

<li>
March 10th, 1997: <em>Daria</em> episode <em>The Invitation</em>
introduces the character of Trent Lane.
</li>

<li>
November 28th, 1997: Daria's final appearance in <em>Beavis and
Butt-head</em>, in the episode <em>Beavis and Butt-head Are Dead</em>.
</li>

<li>
June 16th, 2001: The motion picture <em>Ghost World</em> premieres.
</li>

<li>
June 25th, 2001: The final regular <em>Daria</em> episode, <em>Boxing
Daria</em>.
</li>

<li>
January 21st, 2002: Daria's final canonical appearance, in the
telemovie <em>Is It College Yet?</em>
</li>

</ol>


</p>

<p>

Importantly, this sequence of events reveals that all of the essential
characters in <em>Daria</em>&nbsp;- bar one&nbsp;- were introduced in
the pilot <em>Sealed With a Kick</em> long before <em>Welcome to the
Dollhouse</em> premiered.  It is thus impossible, for instance, for
Quinn Morgendorffer to have been inspired by Missy Weiner, or for
Daria's parents to have been based on Dawn's.

</p>


<p>

The one exception is the slim possibility that Daria's weakness for
Trent Lane was inspired by Dawn's crush on Steve Rodgers.  Trent is
not mentioned in <em>Daria</em>'s universe until after <em>Welcome to
the Dollhouse</em>'s release, so there is a chance that
<em>Daria</em>'s creators were influenced in this particular detail by
the film.  However, given the long development times for animated
programs, even this seems unlikely.

</p>

<p>

In conclusion, therefore, despite their many remarkable similarities,
<em>Daria</em> and <em>Welcome to the Dollhouse</em> (and <em>Ghost
World</em>) seem to have evolved independently.  For whatever reason,
the angst-ridden 1990s appears to have inspired a whole crop of black
comedies about unhappy teenaged girls with glasses.  I'll leave it to
future social historians to figure out why!
