<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having been born in 1990, I was fairly young
when "Daria" first appeared on MTV.&nbsp; Since I was only seven years
old, I was busy running amok and watching Loony Toons like so many other seven
year olds at the time.&nbsp; Because of this, watching MTV wasn't exactly at the top
of my list of things to do.&nbsp; To this day I thank God for that.&nbsp; Who knows how
screwed up I would be if I was raised on MTV.&nbsp; However, I missed out on
watching "Daria" in its full unedited glory.&nbsp; Sure, I did catch an
episode from time to time.&nbsp; I still have faint memories of watching
"Daria!" the musical episode.&nbsp; The one part I remember is arguably
the greatest song ever performed in an animated TV show, "Gah, Gah, Damn
it!"&nbsp; But, other than that, I can't recall anything from
"Daria's" run on MTV.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Years passed, and the summer of 2005 rolled
along.&nbsp; Late one night, through the magic of satellite TV, I discovered a show
on The N called "Daria."&nbsp; Recognizing the name, I decided to watch
it.&nbsp; That night, after watching "Legends of the Mall," I instantly
had a new favorite show.&nbsp; I stayed up until 3:00 AM every night just to watch it (and for that matter, tape every episode The N aired).&nbsp; However, I later
found out that I wasn't receiving the full "Daria" experience.&nbsp; While
looking at the episode guide on outpostdaria.com, I realized that The N wasn't
showing all of the episodes.&nbsp; And, the episodes that they did show were hacked
to pieces by the monster that is censorship.&nbsp; The reasoning behind this
unnecessary editing I have yet to figure out.&nbsp; If The N shows the
"Degrassi" series unedited during daylight hours, why did they censor
a much less intense show that was only aired at 3:00 (and later 1:00) in the morning?&nbsp; My theory:&nbsp; they needed the time to play the music videos they placed in
between shows.&nbsp; That or the network bigwigs didn't have anything more that hot
air between their ears.&nbsp; They say that The N is focused at my general age
group.&nbsp; If this is true, it gives me even less respect for my generation that I
had already (if any at all).&nbsp; But, I can't hold a grudge against The N.&nbsp; For,
if it wasn't for them, I along with many others wouldn't even know what
"Daria" is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Becoming part of the fan community so late
creates other problems as well.&nbsp; I missed out on the original releases of the
"Daria" VHS', DVD's, books, and the pc game.&nbsp; Now, they are almost no
where to be found.&nbsp; The only thing I have found (outside of eBay and
amazon.com) is the "Is it College Yet" DVD.&nbsp; Though, I am glad that I
found it, those who own the IICY DVD will agree that MTV didn't let the DVD
reach its full potential.&nbsp; I'm not sure if this lack of availability is the
same everywhere.&nbsp; But, if it is, it would explain why MTV doesn't seem to think
there is a market for "Daria" products.&nbsp; I mentioned this same exact
thing when writing my comments to MTV while signing the DVDaria petition.&nbsp;
Hopefully, it will get through to them that there <b>is</b> a market out
there.&nbsp; It's supply and demand.&nbsp; We are doing our part on the demand end of
things.&nbsp; MTV just needs to keep up on its responsibility for supply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I take my leave by saying that through this
essay, I hope to speak for all the other fans that came on board the
"Daria" fan train a little behind schedule.</p>
