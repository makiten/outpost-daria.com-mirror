<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Looking back retrospectively on the
tastes that we cull and cultivate over time often produces a heady
sensation of nostalgia and embarrassment.  I know for myself
personally that with American network television, it's always been
slim-pickings, even in my more tolerant years.  I've usually taken
the Winston Smith approach of eschewing whatever oozes from the
telescreen of our household, and intend to maintain that status quo,
at least until <I>National Enquirer TV</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
and </SPAN><I>The X-Files</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"> cross
over into one program and I can  mimic the watching habits of our
animated heroines.  In my sophomore year of high school when I was a
not-quite-as-evolved  Guy Wheatley, I cheerfully indulged in the
trivial histrionics of the nation's most infamous thirtysomething
crowd, </SPAN><I>Seinfeld,</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"> which
I thought celebrated those idiosyncratic endearments that we love
each other for, called our &quot;human faults.&quot;  Needless to
say, I soon had my fill of the malaise of that sitcom, and in my
senior year of high school, as a rather-more-evolved Guy Wheatley, I
moved yonder into </SPAN><I>Frasier</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
domain, the droll and high-brow antics of the psychiatric Crane
brothers fitting my palate better; it certainly seemed to me to fit
the slogan of &quot;the smartest show on TV&quot; at the time.  But
eventually that comedy too wore on my nerves, as I had my limits of
endurance of the fastidious hypocrisy of these overgrown bachelors
who might as well have taken cues from the life and times of British
novelist Henry James.  Today, as a fully-evolved and Y2K compliant
Guy Wheatley, I suddenly find myself a sophomore again, and am now
head over heels with the cynical and deadpan ubermensch Daria and the
wry send-ups of high school existence that her animated existence
delivers, experiences that I thought were, at least chronologically,
behind me.  It's an odd little cycle, if one thinks of it:  From
thirtysomething to fortysomething and now snapped back to teen-dom.  </SPAN>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">Have I come full
circle?  I know something has happened, that much was apparent in all
its Pavlovian glory when I had first witnessed Daria all of two times
of late October this year during the last twilight days of the daily
dose era, and then that weekend was standing in a video store and
literally salivating over the prospect of two Daria videos shelved
inconspicuously in the &quot;TV Series&quot; section, wondering if I
should damn the torpedoes of reservation and take the plunge.  But
even as I was gripping the shrink-wrapped video cassette, gazing upon
folded, green-sleeved arms of that uncompromisingly wry girl, I knew
that I was going straight over, surely as the hapless river-rafter
coming upon the waterfall around the bend.  Much as the saying
applies to  Glenn Eichler and Susie Lewis first pitching the concept
of <I>Daria</I> to MTV Networks, the rest is history.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">In the
two months since then, I've rapidly fetishized my discovery of Daria,
and have become as accomplished a scholar on the show as the rest of
you.  I've seen every episode, either through television airings or
filtered via Real Audio courtesy of the excellent &quot;Depths of
Shallowness&quot; and &quot;Sounds of Cynicism&quot; web-sites.  I've
meticulously overseen the recording of said episodes into my video
collection and suffered and slings and arrows of outrageous MTV
scheduling following the end of Autumn's Daily Dose in order to
secure those tapings (with still ten to go at the time of this
writing).</SPAN>  I've read a myriad of fan-fics and have sampled
just about every reputable author featured on &quot;Outpost Daria&quot;.
 Like a sponge I've absorbed and filed obscure facts about character
backgrounds, Lawndale locales, running puns and media-consciousness
of the show, and trampled all over the Daria trivia on MTV's webpage
like a drunken St. Patrick's Day parade thoroughfare.  Besides the
Season One Daria videos, I've also bought the <I>Daria Diaries </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">and
the Simon and Schuster Interactive product Drama's</SPAN><I> Sick Sad
Life Planner</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">, unpolished
features and all, and load it up daily if nothing else but to learn
&quot;what made this day sick and sad.&quot;  I've endured one
pugnacious blow-out about the show's merits with one friend, while
I've proceeded to convert another into its grip for our own
Daria-themed get-togethers around the VCR (he also happens to be an
artist </SPAN><I>and</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"> a runner,
making the rewards all the more sweeter when the art has imitated the
life).  And naturally, I've lurked on the Outpost Daria and
Paperpusher message boards in circulation, leading that oddly
vigilant and soft-spoken life of the lurker who, despite his immense
interest in the community, somehow feels disinclined to interrupt
with his own amateurish contributions.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">In the course of
this fanatic consummation, that has been advancing at warp speed
compared to the dilatory pace of other long-time fans who have
actually had to wait <I>years</I> for screenings of seasons two and
three and have seen sites, people, and interest come and go, I'm
forced to ask if I've gone mad.  I haven't fallen for a show quite
this hard, paraphernalia and all, since I first saw <I>Doctor Who</I>
in middle school.  I, Guy Wheatley, who had recently been touting
that he no longer indulged in wicked little obsessions, but instead
settled for the more diplomatic <I>moderated passion</I>.  I set the
neat silver dining set of this declaration on the tablecloth to see
it effortlessly yanked out from under me.  What's even more peculiar
about this gem is that it's the offspring of television's ultimate
set-piece of the adolescent male imbecile, <I>Beavis and Butt-head</I>,
and furthermore makes its home on the most shamelessly philistine
network in existence, which never deters from regular screenings of
such asinine fare as <I>The Real World</I>, <I>Undressed</I>, and <I>Say
What? Karokee</I>.  How would Daria react to this?  Perhaps revealing
it as ongoing cosmic payback for being too ironic.  Maybe MTV's
programming department requires at least one show on its bill to
skewer the pop culture it represents.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">However, the
question still remains about how Daria has reeled me in so.  After
all, the satiric comedy and dialogue isn't necessarily more clever or
poignant than similar fare in <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><I>Futurama</I>
and <I>Dilbert</I>, shows that I don't venerate nearly as much.  When
we as fans are confronted about our love for the show, I'm certain we
all have our autopilot stock answers that we deliver, about the
ironic and dry disposition of our heroine and how relevant it is to
our culture, how much we identify with Daria, the self-conscious
stereotypes that the show uses to as a vehicle for parody, etc, etc,
ad infinitum.  However, as I've been descrying for myself, Daria's
many parts are more than the sum of this simple whole.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
<BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
Daria's characterizations definitely go beyond what is represented in
most prime-time fare, and certainly in its cartoon cohorts.  And in
some cases, it is the <I>lack</I> of characterizations,
paradoxically, that also feeds its fire.  The best example is the
title character's duchess of droll, Daria.  The deceptively sarcastic
and trenchant commentary that she responds to everything with can be
interpreted in a wide spectrum, everything from the defense
mechanisms of a pseudo-intellectual smart-ass drifting through life
and trying to shoot down as many people as possible along the way to
counter her own insecurities, to the reactions of a brilliantly witty
and deadpan modern cynic whose criticism cuts to the root of our
disaffected nature, with a soul two sizes too old for its body.  
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
<BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
Naturally, I'm more inclined to the latter, considering that her
bookish tastes range from Brooks Hansen to Jean-Paul Sartre to Allen
Ginsberg, and all the way into the ultra-metafictional realm of (much
to my approval) David Foster Wallace in C. E. Foreman fanatic, a
literary diet destined to forge an earnestly alienated, jaded soul. 
We are also allowed into more vulnerable moments of Daria's psyche
from time to time to controvert any idea that she's entirely callow
or self-absorbed, moments that are sought after because of how
inscrutably cynic Daria comes across.  Helen summed it up succinctly
in &quot;Write Where it Hurts&quot; when she commented on how
difficult it was for Daria to honestly acknowledge what she wanted in
life: &quot;<FONT SIZE=3>What's hard for you is being honest about
your wishes. About the way you think things should be, not the way
they are. You gloss over it with a cynical joke and nobody finds out
what you really believe in.&quot;  Daria's heart-to-heart with Jodie
at Grove Hills in &quot;Gifted&quot; is perhaps the most revealing
scene in which we are privy to the whys of Daria's behavior.  Other
g</FONT>ood examples of more sentimental or sympathetic behavior in
Daria would be her willingness to elaborate on single-point
perspective long enough for Brittany to understand (&quot;The
Invitation&quot;), assuage Quinn's image-centric fears about her
cuteness, however reluctantly (&quot;Too Cute&quot;), deciding to
make amends to what she believed was too brusque a brush-off of the
good intentions of a young man (&quot;The New Kid&quot;), restraint
from humiliating Quinn in a documentary (&quot;Monster&quot;),
instances where she feels the fabric of her identity threatened by
temptations of vanity (&quot;Through a Lens Darkly&quot;) or
shadowing by Quinn (&quot;Quinn the Brain&quot;), a moral obligation
to volunteer work (&quot;The Old and the Beautiful&quot;), and even
moments when she allows a little insidious closeness to creep in
'twix Daria and her parents, whom she usually keeps at arm's length
(&quot;Ill,&quot; &quot;Write Where It Hurts&quot;).  And the entire
shipper tension in the Daria cannon (&quot;Road Worrier,&quot;
&quot;Pierce Me,&quot; &quot;Lane Miserables&quot;) is a whirlwind of
Achilles' Heel exploration in itself, considering how asexual Daria
comes across.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
<BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Then
on the other side of the coin, someone with as dry and intelligent an
outlook as Daria certainly can't refrain from exploiting it with
interactions of  people around her.  She charges inept college
students for writing their papers (&quot;College Bored&quot;) and
does the same with Quinn, both with school and indulging in her
set-ups or schemes (&quot;Quinn the Brain,&quot; &quot;The Pinch
Sitter,&quot; &quot;The New Kid&quot;).  She even compromises with
Helen (&quot;The Invitation&quot;) and takes advantage of Jake's
well-intentioned naivet&eacute; in rewarding Quinn with money (&quot;Quinn
the Brain&quot;).  Even with her back against the wall she twists her
duties into quite unorthodox results (&quot;Cafe Disaffecto&quot;). 
Then of course there are the infinitely numerous instances where she
uses her deadpan wit to make an ironic statement or cut people down
to size, prose tactics that are the staples for the majority of
comedy during the show, examples of this at its zenith are Daria's
disdainful deconstruction of Val's happy-go-lucky mindset of teen
contrivances and pop-culture sponsorships, (&quot;The Lost Girls&quot;)
and when pressed, her equally scathing critique of the  annoying
presence of </SPAN></SPAN>Lawndale High's visiting radio DJs (&quot;Jake
of Hearts&quot;).  This juxtaposition of the two sides of Daria is a
balanced one, and we are allowed glances long enough into her softer
side to be reminded of her humanity while not portraying her
character as meek or unnecessarily angst-ridden, while the rest of
the time her cynical heroism is upheld and always tastefully done.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Speaking of character developments,
Daria may be at the top of the pyramid, but she's merely the tip of
the iceberg as far as interest in the cast goes.  Just about every
member of the Lawndale entourage has his/her place, history, and
moments in the sun, even down to the odious Upchuck (&quot;The
Invitation&quot;), the catatonic yes-woman Tiffany (&quot;It Happened
One Nut&quot;), and the oft unheard Andrea (&quot;Cafe Disaffecto&quot;).
 There is of course Jane, the Thelma to Daria's Louise and partner in
crime, who complements Daria's ironic and sarcastic front with her
own wry, artsy style, while having several unique traits of her own
to set her apart from her friend, most apparent being her willingness
to engage in school activities when the price is right (&quot;Daria
Dance Party&quot;), the price is academic (&quot;Jane's Addition&quot;),
or the price is personal pride (&quot;See Jane Run&quot;).  Then
there is Daria's sibling polar opposite, Quinn, and her continuing
struggle of be Queen-of-the-Hill in popularity, fashion sense, and
keeping guys yapping at her heels, who yet from time to time has the
Morgendorffer gene interrupt her usual routine of shallow
self-absorption and instill moments of depth or sensitivity (for
Quinn), i.e. Sisterly concern when duty falls on Daria to bail her
friends out (&quot;Speedtrapped&quot;), concern that she's turning
into something of a &quot;phony&quot; when she affects an
intellectual persona (&quot;Quinn the Brain&quot;), and a rare moment
of humility admitting about the frivolity of her nature, though it's
what she does best (&quot;Monster&quot;).  Next up is the inner
psyche of the ultimate starving slacker musician Trent, the poster
child for the inner bit of disaffected Gen-Xer in all us, who
nonetheless manages to be fleshed out beyond his first few cameos
(&quot;The Invitation,&quot; &quot;This Year's Model,&quot;) in the
classic &quot;Road Worrier,&quot; and beyond, proving that despite
his ultra laid-back rock-and-roll lifestyle he's not the poseur
musician that we might have first assumed.  And this analysis of the
show's main characters wouldn't be complete without mentioning our
vaudeville parenting duo Helen and Jake.  In Helen we see her
tireless efforts episode in, episode out to be the perfect working
wife and mother to her children,  husband, and career (after all, she
sings out those intentions to us in &quot;Daria!&quot;).  A few times
she's even able to break down those generation barriers 'twix she and
Daria and act as consul (most notably in &quot;Write Where it Hurts&quot;
and &quot;Through a Lens Darkly&quot;).  And practically every
on-screen moment with Jake is an exercise in hilarity, whether he's
trying to be hip (&quot;College Bored&quot;), parent conscientiously
(&quot;Ill&quot;), act heroic, (&quot;Daria!&quot;), or engage in
male-bonding (&quot;The Lab Brat,&quot; &quot;Lane Miserables&quot;).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the more minor characters manage
to pique us.  I've always found Sandi Griffin's sanctimonious
righteousness about making the Fashion Club both a moral and a
physical standard to be an absolute riot, because she actually
believes it to be so (&quot;Road Worrier,&quot; &quot;The New Kid,&quot;
&quot;The Old and the Beautiful&quot;), as well as her cool,
faux-polite obeisant interchange with Quinn in her absurdly deep
female baritone.  Jodie seemed to be a cut-and-dry model of the the
perfect extra-curricular and academic student before she was first
really explored as an individual in &quot;Gifted.&quot;  Anthony
DeMartino's bilesome temper, eye-bulging enunciations, and scathing
derision of his students and his lot in life always gave me (whilst
steadily grinning) the impression of watching a bomb about to go off,
and yet there is even room for exploration of his character and his
faults (&quot;Cafe Disaffecto,&quot; &quot;The Daria Hunter,&quot;
&quot;Just Add Water&quot;).  Even apparently cardboard characters
like Brittany and Stacy have moments of lucidity (Brittany's advice
to Daria in &quot;Through a Lens Darkly&quot; and her battle tactics
in &quot;The Daria Hunter&quot;) and empathy (Stacy wailing her heart
out to Daria and Jane in &quot;Fair Enough&quot; and attempting to
stand up for Quinn in &quot;Daria Dance Party&quot;), making the
viewer wonder if there is more of the like to come.  The wide variety
of character appeal in Daria explains the celebration of these
personalities that abounds in fandom, with such oddities as the
Brittany-Stacy Supporters Society, essays on Fashion Club dynamics,
Jane\Jesse debacles in fanfic, and Daria websites themed around
Quinn, Jane, and Trent.  Several episodes in fact treat the usual
Daria/Jane dynamic as more a subplot on the sidelines compared to the
antics of the more minor characters (&quot;Too Cute,&quot; &quot;The
Daria Hunter,&quot; &quot;Fair Enough,&quot; &quot;Just Add Water&quot;).
When I catch the odd episode of <I>The Simpsons</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
these days, mostly it's to amuse myself with the folly of oblivious,
dreamy doe-boy Homer Simpson.  In Daria, I get that, and more, out of
Jake Morgendorffer.  One show's star attraction for me is merely
icing on the cake in Daria.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria herself is definitely a twisted
little cruller, as Jane puts it, which is undoubtedly why we are
proud to be her fans.  There is enough enigma about the constructs of
her character to continue to be explored fruitfully in future
episodes whilst giving us a good idea of what makes her tick, and
thus relate too.  Daria has mass appeal; anyone who has felt the
least bit like an island unto him/herself, at odds with society, or
over-qualified for life's turns will recognize this with the show,
which certainly catches the zeitgeist of our modern alienation.  The
fact that it's set in high school makes it all the more ubiquitous,
being a compulsory experience that one will be hard pressed to find
lost on someone, as opposed if the show's background was a law firm,
a hospital, the editorial offices of a magazine, or other workplace. 
There are a multitude of reasons why we watch this show and keep
coming back for more: Some fans are concerned primarily with shipper
developments, others for bouts of character growth vis-a-vis Daria
and Jane, some for the shenanigans of the minor characters, i.e.
Waiting for Jodie and Mack to break out of their background roles,
some for the satiric plotlines, others merely because Daria always
has a incisive witticism on the tip of her tongue, or a buffet of all
of the above.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daria's animated status, far from
creating less of a serious impression or coming off as an ineffectual
show, actually enhances it.  These days, my postmodern, jaundiced eye
is nary able to tolerate more than several minutes of typical
American network fare, drama or sit-com, before the personal gaffe of
the actors starts to get to me.  In other words, a program's cast is
personified by actors that you know have been hired outside the
studio, speaking with their inflections and their idiosyncrasies, who
may in fact ham it up.  All an uncompromising situation.  With
animation, the cast are excused from the demons of bad acting
(Kevin's daft and dumb antics are certainly easier to digest in this
format then by the portrayed imbecility of an actor) or the rigid
typecasting of an actor filling the roll, distancing we-the-viewer
from identifying with the character if the actor/actress wasn't quite
what we envisioned for the roll (a formidable problem in creating
movies based off of books).  To get an idea of the most abysmal sort
of example if we were to personify Daria's likeness in the
flesh-and-blood, check out the wickedly parodic Unofficial Daria
Movie Rumor Page maintained by Aaron Solomon (there is a link at the
Paperpusher's site).  The caricatures of everything in animation,
from the people to the places depicted, allow a direct and effective
medium in depicting emotions and stances from the cast by a slight
rearrangement of a line or two, as well as ability to utilize more
hyperbolic elements, such as Mr. DeMartino's bulging right eye, Daria
blushing, flurries of paint-balls, and dream sequences.  I've long
believed that animation was fast becoming a modern mythology for our
lives; <I>The Simpsons</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"> and
</SPAN><I>Beavis and Butt-head</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
proved that a cartoon could break out of its saturday-morning
superhero and loony tune mold into something with a little more
depth.  It has inspired and spawned a number of successful
successors, including </SPAN><I>King of the Hill, Dilbert, Futurama,
</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">and of course our beloved Daria.
 Along the wayside there have also been a few other well-conceived
attempts, <I>The Critic, Family Guy, </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">and
MTV's </SPAN><I>Downtown</I> that have now unfortunately joined the
mists of time and fallen programs.  Animation as a whole has gone
from being a gimmicky phenomenon to accepted genre, and the satiric
vehicle of choice.  I doubt that animation will ever entirely
overthrow its real-life counterparts, however it's definitely here to
stay.  Even the popularity of the comparatively base </SPAN><I>Celebrity
Deathmatch</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">, which uses clay
animation, a close cousin to classic animation, is worth noting as
indication of the collective public's changing and adaptive palate.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">I'm foremost
attracted to Daria as a satire, as undoubtedly most fans are.  In
fact, when I first started watching the show, it hearkened me back to
my days of watching the BBC's <I>Blackadder</I>, which chronicled the
antics of one Edmond Blackadder surrounded by the hapless in
different parodic stages of British history, who, much as our
heroine, used his dry wit and cunning in order to manipulate those
around him and maintain his sanity.  Daria strikes me as a more
deadpan heir apparent to Blackadder, in female adolescent form in the
American suburban heartland.  However, Daria is a multi-leveled
genre.  More than a satire, is also has the talent to act as a drama.
 This is most evident in the now traditional season closer which
deals with some personal tension 'twix Daria and those close to her;
with &quot;The Misery Chick&quot; it was the purportedly &quot;dark&quot;
psychological make-up of Daria that made her so callously impervious
to the stark reality of death and how that in turn disconcerted Jane.
 &quot;Write Where It Hurts&quot; dealt with Daria's private feelings
for her immediate family, which she had until then kept under wraps,
before they were reified in a short story that indicated a secret
desire for one day all of them to reconcile and co-exist with each
other.  Then the most recent &quot;Jane's Addition&quot; forced
Daria, something of a green-eyed monster in a green jacket, to deal
with her feelings of jealousy over her formerly uncontested rapport
with Jane, now complicated by the oldest of conventions, a man.  That
also wasn't the only instance of a friendship on a rocky road,
evidenced in &quot;See Jane Run,&quot; which has competitive strife
similar to &quot;Jane's Addition&quot; in how Jane explores new
priorities and how Daria reacts to it.  Daria is also one of the few
TV characters I've come across who, despite her cynical and
unembellished realistic outlook, also has integrity and values that
she won't compromise, displayed in her stanch refusal to edit her
contributions in the PTA art contest in &quot;Arts N' Crass,&quot;
and the lambasting she gives Jane when she uses her elevated athletic
status to smooth over tests in &quot;See Jane Run.&quot;  If Daria
feels she's in on the verge of hypocrisy, she wrestles with it
internally instead of shrugging it off, evidenced in &quot;Through a
Lens Darkly&quot; with questions of her identity wrapped up in public
images.  Basically, with Daria, there is a principle involved--if you
need further enumeration of this fact, just watch Daria say it for
herself as she tells off consumer researchers in &quot;Malled.&quot; 
Daria also dabbles in the romantic realm somewhat, most prominently
in the shipper classic of each season (&quot;Road Worrier,&quot;
&quot;Pierce Me,&quot; &quot;Lane Miserables&quot;), without
devolving into a soap opera.  The show's writers even dabble in the
realm of whimsical fantasy by the third season, with both clever
(&quot;Daria!&quot;) and sour (&quot;When Depth Takes a Holiday&quot;)
results.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">However, 95% of the
show's canon is still solidly grounded in reality (or what passes for
reality in animation), which is one of the most important dividing
points when Daria is compared to other toons.  The plot is as
important as the comedy in Daria, with a set beginning, middle, and
end, with rising tension and resolutions apparent throughout the
course of the episode.  This collectively gives a more tactile sense
of what we're watching and allows us to actually care about what's
happening to the characters, and posit what may be in store for them
in the future.  So, as I mentioned earlier in this essay, the satiric
wit of other efforts such as <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><I>Futurama</I>
and <I>Dilbert</I> may be equal to that in Daria, but the fact that
they exist more as a collage of clever scenes than a cohesive plot
doesn't lend to it the same sense of far-reaching depth that Daria
achieves.  Which is why I believe such an active and faithful
community of Daria-philes exists today, and a long arm of compiled
fan fiction from numerous talents and degrees of homage, efforts
tapping into everything from the unexplored nuances of Aunt Amy's
relationship to Daria to bizarre crossovers with other television
shows.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
<BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
In summation, Daria is definitely something special (or as Daria
herself might wryly put it, &quot;A pearl in a bed of oysters&quot;).
 I'm certainly glad that I fortuitously stumbled upon it when I did,
and apparently not a moment too soon, since I'm sure I would have
never located it amid the early-morning weekend marathons taking
place these days.  In a perfect world I would have discovered Daria
on its inception when I was a Junior in high school back in March of
'97, but I've been making up for lost time so I can wax with the best
of the old-timers now.  I know I'm certainly in this for the long
haul, and even after Daria itself as a program one day reaches its
natural expiration (unless Glenn Eichler and Susie Lewis pitch the
idea of <I>Daria: The College Years</I> to the MTV bigwigs; we fans
can only hope) I can see the Daria community continuing to go on and
flourish, finding new ways to engage themselves in the pathways of
Daria history, much the same as the <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><I>Doctor
Who</I> community spun on once BBC finally axed the venerable sci-fi
program, and continues to, 10 long years after the last airing of the
original series.  I know that one day in the distant future if I'll
be lying catatonic in a fetal position in my room, my clammy hands
still gripping my copy of <I>The Daria Diaries</I> while my body is
wrapped in the celluloid of my Daria tapes, I'll have preserved this
point.</SPAN></P>

Now as I sit in hibernation this winter, laying in wait for Season
Four's debut in February with the rest of ye, only one thing remains:
To find an acceptable pizza place in my city for my own &quot;Jane&quot;
and I to hang out our wee lives at...</P>
