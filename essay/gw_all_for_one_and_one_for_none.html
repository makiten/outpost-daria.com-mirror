Camus's ubiquitous quote also apply to self-proclaimed misanthropes
never at a loss for a glib, ironic remark, whilst harboring a
penchant for gauche fashion sense?  Recently browsing through my copy

my eyes over the trenchant remarks written in the upper-right hand

home is her castle.  Excuse me while I go raise the drawbridge,&quot;
&quot;Does watching television isolate us from one another?  God, I
hope so,&quot; and &quot;I never forgot a face, but I keep trying.&quot;
 Seems to send a clear message that beyond a certain distance into
personal space, trespassers will be violated.  After all, it can't
all be cool disdain and caustic bluster on Daria's part, considering
her zero participation in extra-curricular activities, or functions
outside the home, interest groups, or social activities at all.  She
doesn't fraternize at school unless steered into it, and her routine,
well, take it from an early journal entry on her days at Lawndale,
that remains remarkably up to date: &quot;Go to school, avoid making
eye contact with teachers, get called on anyway.  Walk halls between
classes, be ignored by other students </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>[</B></SPAN><B><I>and

course, the sole, and flashing with almost neon intensity, exception
is Daria's friendship with Jane, which interjects into her above
routine trips to the Pizza King, Sick Sad World viewings at one abode
or the other, and other miscellaneous errands in tandem.  Daria may
socialize with Jane, though what happens most often is that the two
amalgamate into a weird vaudevillian duo and simply be alienated
together, complementing each other's differences and remarks like
pieces of a puzzle, observing the life that goes on by like
biographies in the process of making an update of <U><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Don't

high school existence.<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">  The thing
is that both girls had existed apart before acquainting with each
other as entities in a clique of one, removed from usual vestiges of
high school life.  They forged a bond because in light of each
other's sardonic sensibilities, it was the most natural thing in the
world, like a soldier lost from his company wondering the battlefield
then sighting another in his own uniform.  In &quot;It Happened One
Nut,&quot; Jane comments about keeping Daria company at her tedious
cashier job at It's a Nutty Nutty World: &quot;Want me to drop by for
a visit?  Misery loving company, and all?&quot;  &quot;You don't have
to tell me that, it's the basis of our entire friendship.&quot; 
Eviscerate the masochistic elements of codependency from such a
remark, in that they aren't depressed, and it's pretty apt.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=3>By Season Two Jane had graduated from her more
lugubrious, languid artsy persona (as well as the low alto voice), to
someone more upbeat, flippant, and not above a little fraternization,
and eventually a boyfriend.  But has Daria changed in the same way? 
Camus's &quot;living precisely for relations with other people&quot;
has Daria as no exception, true.  She and Jane aren't exactly
soul-sisters, but Daria has gone through withdrawal when she's gone
through trying times with Jane.  In &quot;The Misery Chick&quot; she
tries repeatedly to get in contact with an alienated Jane, in &quot;See
Jane Run&quot; she speaks to herself in lieu of company with her
partner-in-crime, and wonders if she was hypocritical in chastising
Jane for accepting Gym perks.  On a lighter note, Daria drags Jane
along in &quot;Cafe Disaffecto&quot; to lighten the weight and tedium
of fund-raising and the equally eerie circumstances of baby-sitting
the Gupty children in &quot;The Pinch Sitter.&quot;  However, isn't 
Daria putting all her eggs into one basket with her sole friendship
(&quot;your only friend Jane&quot; as Val curtly puts it in &quot;The
Lost Girls&quot;)?  Aren't they're other potential characters that
have been exposed in the course of the show, outcasts and brains
alike, that might have the ability to extend a rapport of friendship
with Daria?  Here are some of the possibilities:</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Jodie</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">: For
awhile, Jodie seemed to be the most natural pick for Daria as a
secondary friend.  After all, Jodie was very intelligent, came from
an affluent family, had upstanding standards for herself, was capable
of making perspicacious remarks and sounding them off to Daria, all
the while being extremely popular with her extended resume of
extra-curricular activities.  Jodie may have been the girl able to
make the crossover into Daria's walled off domain and bringing her a
little out of her shell.  Wasn't the most illuminating scene
showcasing the bonding potential 'twixt these two during the
disclosure of their respective high school experiences in &quot;Gifted&quot;?
 Both made concessions as to the advantages of each other's mentality
and way of going about things.  A natural match to aid each other and
alter perspectives?  However, the deterrent reality check to such a
scenario came in &quot;Partner's Complaint,&quot; when Jodie's moral
sensitivity became ruffled when Daria inferred at her hypocrisy in
their economics project, and a harsh rebuke was delivered.  Though
they reconciled at the end of the ep, it seems that a very noteworthy
difference in their dispositions was revealed; Jodie had a wider
pragmatic streak about accomplishing goals, even if it meant
sacrificing a little ethical  credibility, while Daria was more
unyielding and critical about such actions.  These moral approaches
grated gravely on each other in the ep, giving the impression that if
they spent a considerable amount of time together, more arguments of
the sort would ensue.  Nor would Daria be very interested in
straddling both sides of the outcast brain/popularity queen fence as
Jodie does, in fact, Daria would viciously chide Jane for even daring
to flirt with the enemy's grass.</SPAN></FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Andrea</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">:
Personally, I've never quite understood the rather portentous support
and cultish following for this extremely minor character on <I>Daria</I>.
 I always viewed her as the token goth character in the teenage
ensemble at Lawndale High, meant to chime in with an overtly maudlin,
comic relief comment from time to time, as a goth stereotype would. 
However, she sticks around, and apparently will continue to do so
with her recent exposure on &quot;Mart of Darkness&quot; (and a whole
paragraph of speech to herself, toping the &quot;Cafe Disaffecto&quot;
poetry reading!).  Though such mono-cameo characters such as Luhrman
and Erin from &quot;I Don't&quot; (and probably even Ethan from &quot;That
Was Then, This is Dumb&quot;) have technically had more dialogue than
Andrea, she remains an organic object d'or, and has quite a reign in
numerous fan-fics expounding on her character in ways her brief
appearances on <I>Daria</I> can only dream.  And there are some
legitimate reasons for this, as Andrea is, well, <I>ultra</I>-alienated,
always downcast and going about her brusque and singular way. 
However, though Daria and Andrea may both be outcasts and eschew the
popularity games of Lawndale High, the way they bear the marks of
such social status are quite different.  The way that Andrea bitterly
invites Daria to proceed with the belittling remarks that she and
Jane indulge with in judging other people in &quot;Mart of Darkness&quot;
is a caustic and conscious awareness of this.  If there was anything
like an informal &quot;Outsider&quot; clique at Lawndale high, a
cadre of the geeks, brains, social outcasts, and general &quot;in&quot;-crowd
undesirables, Daria and Jane would be something like the &quot;Outsider
Elite,&quot; not because their so socially inept and have no choice
to be trapped to such a popularity purgatory, but by personal choice
and proclivity, as well as an ability to sarcastically hold their own
against anyone, to never be cowed by the advances of any of the more
popular cliques.  Andrea is more like an &quot;Outsider Drone&quot;
or otherwise lower-ranking outcast, not there by choice, and
entertains lifestyle choices more out of frustration and rage than
anything else.  Additionally, Andrea seems far more emotional than
Daria ever is, and considering how assiduous Daria is in avoiding
personal disclosure, demons, or extended intimacy with anyone (and
even things with Jane are kept on a flippant level most of the time),
this is bound to create a rift.  So, while Daria and Andrea are both
technically &quot;Outsiders,&quot; their individual customs are as
different as two people sharing the same religion but of different
ethnic background.</SPAN></FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Stacy</B>: Stacy seems to be the other significant
&quot;underdog&quot; favorite in the <I>Daria</I> community after
Andrea.  Though she is a very different girl than our aforementioned
goth, I feel that a lot of the fixation that she garners is based on
the same reasons: There is something vulnerable, misplaced, and
unexplored about her character which gleans pity.  After all, Stacy
seems to be the odd girl out in the Fashion Club, and a little too
nice to play all the dirty games in being the most superficial and
judgmental clique of the school, condemning others by the rigid
commandments of ever-ephemeral fashion trends.  Though Stacy has
gotten far more exposure than Andrea in the show, her most revealing
moment is still her paroxysm of broken-hearted anguish in &quot;Fair
Enough,&quot; when she wails out her woe to an indifferent Daria and
Jane on the ferris wheel.  Stacy may be the most amiable and
open-minded of the Fashion Club, and would probably come in last on a
&quot;most disdained Fashion Fiend&quot; list that Daria and Jane
compiled on a lazy afternoon, but that doesn't mean that they have
warmed up to her in any way.  Stacy still fraternizes with the
&quot;enemy,&quot; harbors no backbone, and exists merely to be
emotionally manipulated to the whims of Sandi and Quinn as she
continually fishes for validation.  Until some drastic changes in her
attitude arise, I can't imagine the slightest change in how Daria
regards her.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3><B>Tom</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">: On first
glance, Tom as a friend for Daria seems to be a more logical shoe-in
than the other three listed above.  After all, he shares Jane's sense
of affable, offbeat wit, has always been congenial around Daria,
makes an effort to be friendly, has Jane's stamp of approval, and
more.  There isn't some (in)conspicuous foible about his disposition
that keeps him out of the league like it does with Jodie, Stacy, or
Andrea--what's not to like about this perfect guy?  Well, Daria found
plenty, as we saw over the course of &quot;Jane's Addition&quot; and
&quot;Partner's Complaint.&quot;  Daria spurned and insulted Tom at
every opportunity until she finally felt she'd played the jealous
bitch long enough and anted up an apology to Jane, and accepted Tom
as here to stay.  Jealous was exactly what Daria was, for Tom was the
character who had the potential to suddenly render, in the
magnanimous paranoid scheme of things, Daria a third wheel, for Tom
offered not just intellectual, but romantic, interest to Jane.  No
doubt Daria felt like she was in danger of getting out-classed by the
number of sheer &quot;qualities&quot; she was up against. 
Co-existence with Tom wasn't a possibility Daria wanted to consider;
Daria probably romanticized her rapport with Jane, she only friends
with Jane, Jane only friends with Daria, partners up against the
world and impenetrable to the whims of others, particularly the
unique complications of a man.  In fact, this desire for Daria having
a lone bond with Jane and visa versa could be an added qualm against
extending her hand to any of the other candidates above.  Daria's
relationship with Tom would improve throughout the season from her
stand-offish position at the end of &quot;Partner's Complaint,&quot;
even conceding to enjoying herself in his sole, gentlemanly company
in &quot;I Loathe A Parade,&quot; however to say that she's active
friends with Tom would be too much of a stretch.  Additionally, Daria
still resents being usurped by him when it comes to Jane organizing
social plans, i.e. Daria's tonal displeasure on learning that Jane
had already scheduled to go bowling with Tom in &quot;Of Human
Bonding.&quot;</SPAN></FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Jane, on the other hand, has come quite a ways from her
low-octane, heavy-lidded, crooning self from Season One.  Daria may
still be her cardinal friend, true, however she is more extroverted
and accommodating then her cynical counterpart.  In &quot;Arts N'
Crass&quot; Jane allows herself to be flattered into partaking in, oh
the horror, a school-sponsored art fair and the politics that go with
it.  With a little nuisance fee, she also partook in managing a
Lawndale dance in &quot;Daria Dance Party&quot; as a medium for her
creativity.  She becomes more actively involved in her charity
project in &quot;The Old and the Beautiful&quot; than Daria, actually
<I>enjoying</I> the chance for tutoring and culling expression in the
children she works with.  And most notably of all, she flirts with
the realm and camaraderie of school sports in &quot;See Jane Run&quot;
and &quot;The F Word.&quot;  The notion of Daria hooking up with her
brother during the days of shippery tensions never irked Jane for a
moment, in fact, it encouraged her in some spots for spontaneous
matchmaking, from &quot;The Road Worrier&quot; onward.  That this
begat her whole yenta role in many a shipper-fic has generally led
her to be perceived as more outgoing and accepting than the obstinate
Daria.  Essays by Kara Wild have delved into the posited commonalties
of her character with other extroverts Jodie and Helen, and
conjecture on what vulnerabilities lie beneath her cool-headed and
flippant exterior, vulnerabilities explicated on in many of Jon
Kilner's Jane-centric prose fics.  Lastly, she made the final step in
moving on with her romantic life, adroitly clicking with Tom with
expedient pace and chemistry, whereas by comparison, Daria's
short-lived crush on Trent just meandered for three seasons before
finally fizzling out.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT SIZE=3>It
is these differences in disposition by our two sarcastic protagonists
than I think speak to how the <I>Daria</I> fan base respond in turn
with their own feelings.  In all &quot;favorite character&quot;
surveys that I've come across on sites pertaining to <I>Daria</I> on
the net, Jane supersedes Daria by a slight to substantial lead, a
character that, as vital to the show as she is, is still second seat
in focus to our title heroine.  Now why is that?  I think the answer
lies in how accessible Jane makes herself.  As a friend, Jane would
be more willing to accommodate our faults, twist them into looking
more like cute idiosyncrasies, supporting us while we were down,
encouraging exploration into personal domains and dilemmas unknown to
us before (&quot;Through A Lens Darkly,&quot; need I say more?). 
Jane also actively solicited Daria for her contributions in school
projects in eps &quot;Arts N' Crass&quot; and &quot;Jane's Addition,&quot;
and sought out validation for her own &quot;Outsider&quot; breaching
of code during her fling with conventional school activities in &quot;See
Jane Run.&quot;  Jane also tried her damnedest to reconcile Daria's
contempt for Tom in &quot;Jane's Addition&quot; and &quot;Partner's
Complaint.&quot;  Hell, she even cut Quinn some slack when she came
running and pleading in voluntary exile from the Fashion Club in
&quot;Gifted.&quot;  Daria is more likely, and has been, more
critical of these scenarios in these eps concerning Jane's &quot;deviant&quot;
behavior.  And most friendships aren't based on such exaggerated
candor and need to hold up such ethical standards in the eyes of our
comrade; we'd far prefer to be flattered and accepted for who we are,
and wherever we may roam.</FONT></SPAN></SPAN></P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Now, here's a novel suggestion, maybe sacrilegious to
some: Daria may have more in common with <I>Sandi Griffin</I> than
any other character on the show.  A stretch would be an
understatement you say?  Austin Covello has already written an essay
challenging the demonic status of our cardinal Fashion Fascist.  What
about beyond that?  From what I've observed, Daria has quite a bit in
common with Sandi, especially compared to her genetic counterpart and
other significant Fashion Club fiend, Quinn.  The main differences
that place them worlds apart are intelligence and priorities, however
traits in their respective character may render that border thinner
than presumed.  Both are snide and sarcastic, never at a loss at a
disparaging remark.  Daria speaks in deadpan, Sandi in a level,
monotonous valley-girl tone.  Both are judgmental of the behavior of
their company, Daria in the realm of ethics, ideas, writing and
literature, Sandi in decorum with fashion sense and how <I>au fait
</I>her members are with trends.  Sandi doesn't have so much friends
as glorified lackeys that she keeps in line with threats and
intimidation, and goads them (namely Quinn) on the flimsiest codes of
fashion transgression.  Daria's bond with Jane is far more genuine
and generous that that, however at times it seems almost conditional
to Daria's standard for proper &quot;Outsider&quot; mores.  Both
Daria and Sandi keep the doors of their respective company closed
from the contamination of outsiders, or would like to have it that
way.  And as a bonus bit of trivia, both maintain an enmity with
Quinn (and Daria even has a past as Highland's fashion reporter).</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT SIZE=3>In fact, there's no evidence that Daria was pining for
companionship when she was driven up to Lawndale High for the first
time.  She didn't mumble or brood about her loneliness, or go around
introducing herself to whoever she could.  She behaved very much in
the same manner pre-Jane as she does post-Jane, all the way up to the
point when she was fortuitously introduced to Jane via a whisper in
Mr. O'Neill's self-esteem workshop.  It seems to me that Daria can be
comfortable both as a lone wolf or with company, but only has the
vitality and interest to sustain <I>one strong friendship at any one
time</I>, which is the only sort she is interested in, being not one
for superficial aquaintanceships.  I feel like Daria's disclosure she
makes to her psychologist Dr. Phillips in &quot;Psycho Spa,&quot; and
to Helen towards the ep's end, were of prodigious importance to this
personal stance.  She admits to keeping most everyone at arm's length
to avoid rejection when they finally get to know the inner Daria and
do it on their own instinct, however, to me she makes little effort
to be tactful in the presence of most people, so the outer Daria
pretty much resembles the inner Daria.  I also think this extends
only to individuals outside her immediate family; for Helen and Jake,
she addresses Helen's concern about neglecting her eldest daughter:
&quot;I know you'd hang on to my every word, and who could handle
that sort of responsibility?&quot;  Here Daria is saying that she
precisely can't, and has never been comfortable with intense levels
of emotional intimacy, and would prefer playing her games of wry
badinage to get her feelings across, though her medium renders her
feelings no less genuine.  With minimal emotional needs in such a
fatalistic cynic, I could have realistically seen scenarios where a
strained friendship with Jane finally reached a breaking point, i.e.
Not reconciling with Jane after all in &quot;See Jane Run&quot; or
deciding to ditch her in turn in &quot;Partner's Complaint&quot;
after Jane had gotten involved with Tom, and then gone about her
merry, deadpan way.</FONT></P>
