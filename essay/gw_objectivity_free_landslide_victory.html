may be 20/20, unless we're <I>still</I> busy musing over the latest
star attraction that deters it to 20/40.  As I write this, in the
last days of the lull 'twixt Season Four's end and the premier of &quot;Is
It Fall Yet?&quot;, take a wild stab in the dark over which eps in
question I'm talking about, and their irrevocable effects on our
perspectives.  I'm not speaking about shippery terrain here or
Daria's capacity for fault or fornication, mind you, I'm pining about
our gestalt retrospective about the series and its peaks and valleys.
 In particular, the dubbed and derided &quot;valley&quot; known as
Season Three.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Now,
in the course of community reaction to this most volatile powder-keg
of all seasons, Season Four, it wouldn't be too generous to call it
bipolar, split 'twixt the Season Four's first &quot;sad&quot; half
and then its flip &quot;happy&quot; latter half.  During February and
March of Season Four's initial march (no pun intended), we chewed the
collective fat of such provocative fare as &quot;Partner's
Complaint,&quot; &quot;Murder She Snored,&quot; and &quot;The F Word&quot;
with a grimace (the indignant upstarts anyway, who had a sense of
self-righteousness about what the show is about...including moi). 
Even less toxic eps like by-the-numbers ensemble fare of &quot;Antisocial
Climbers&quot; and the entirely self-effacing whimsy of &quot;A Tree
Grows in Lawndale&quot; irritated the char-dev crowd who's palates
were still sweet with remembrance of such classics as &quot;Arts N'
Crass&quot; and &quot;See Jane Run.&quot;  It was the Season's half
that gave birth to such works of contention as Daniel Suni's &quot;Cynic's
Complaint&quot; and &quot;On Comedy, Drama, and Emotional
Involvement,&quot; long-winded, meticulous diatribes about how the
show had gone astray all in the swoop of six eps, and two essays
which rebuked this old-school conservative stance, Kara Wild's &quot;It
Happened to Jane&quot; and C. E. Foreman's caustic satire &quot;This
Show Sucks!&quot;  There were grumblings from lessor quarters too, on
the message boards from Major and Indie-Fan alike about what in the
hell was going through Glenn Eicher and co.'s collective mind. 
Accusations flew about Daria's character selling out her traditional
cynical, pessimistic integrity, deviant exploitative liberties being
taken in Jane's character, overexposure of school spirit poster boy
and girl Kevin and Brittany respectively, pandering to the lowest
common denominator, and basically scriptwriting that showed it had
yet to get over its &quot;filler&quot; and &quot;fantasy&quot;
obsession.  These are not nontrivial gripes.</FONT></P>

</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Though
I wasn't around personally, I imagine the spirit of this fatalistic
conjecture was a repeat of what happened in the <I>Daria</I>
community a year before during the first half of Season Three.  The
show ventured to the far side with a tongue-in-cheek broadway musical
parodic crossover and just plain weirdness with holiday avatars
visiting Lawndale.  Then there were those dreaded &quot;filler&quot;
eps ruining all the char-devvers' fun with the likes of &quot;The Old
and the Beautiful&quot; and &quot;The Lost Girls.&quot;  I imagine
even some people thought &quot;Through a Lens Darkly&quot; was too
slight to be considered serious <I>Daria</I> fare, and in the process
was already making a few of the hardcore Season Oners irate.  I
imagine vis-a-vis to Season Four's dissection, there was similar
speculation about where the show was headed, particularly after its
zenith of the venerated Season Two.  Season Three's new emphasis on
whimsy, send-ups of pop iconography, and middle-of-the-road eps not
concerned with making a Major Character Revelation every 21 minutes
was quite distressing for a few people; Michelle Klein-Hass's &quot;From
Now On, Keep it Real!&quot; rant encapsulated this revulsion for
those in the community.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Then
all of a sudden, as swiftly as the downpour didst rain on Season
Four's parade, the clouds did part and in shone the light of
redemption.  Who would have thought that neo-shipperism was come to
bail out Season Four's reputation from critical purgatory?  After
all, in the drought following Season Three shipperism was considered
acutely pass&eacute;; the faux-breakup scene 'twixt Daria and Trent
at the end of &quot;Jane's Addition&quot; pretty much settled the
matter, at least for the anti-shipper punditocracy.  Nonetheless,
this didn't stop &quot;I Loathe a Parade&quot; paving the way for
Season Four's reassessment.  We got a couple of breaks in the season
with char-dev would-be classics &quot;Psycho Spa&quot; and &quot;Groped
By an Angel,&quot; finally coming to a head with the season's
&quot;triumph&quot; of the double-hitting &quot;Fire!&quot; and &quot;Dye!
Dye! My Darling.&quot;  Come back Glenn, all is forgiven.  This
attitude was evident as much with my end-of-season probing of the
<I>Daria</I> commune's collective judgment about the Season; all of a
sudden it was on the top of everybody's list, the best thing to hit
since Season Two--maybe ever.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Actually,
this doesn't bother me as much as the perceived cretinous attitude
that all of a sudden, in the wake of Season Four's
behind-the-music-styled comeback of its later half, the season wasted
no time in burying the program's previous mediocre-at-best effort,
Season Three.  A season that, in the context of retrospective posts I
find the board when discussing <I>Daria </I>as a whole<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">,
seems condemned with associative cringe-inducing embarrassments such
as &quot;When Depth Takes A Holiday&quot; and &quot;Just Add Water.&quot;
 Such a myopic remembrance of the season is tantamount to referring
to Season Four exclusively on the merits of &quot;Murder She Snored&quot;
and &quot;Mart of Darkness.&quot;  For all the accusations of how
much Season Three was a &quot;poseur&quot; and &quot;filler&quot;
season, let me tell you, if we were judging the two seasons be the
merits of their aforementioned lows alone, Season Three would </SPAN><I>bury</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
Season Four hands-down.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
<BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>Let's
start with the the dirtiest piece of laundry for both seasons, the
fantasy-themed &quot;When Depth Takes a Holiday&quot; and &quot;Murder
She Snored.&quot;  Now it's something of the norm to denounce both of
them for trivializing the reality-based format of <I>Daria</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
which sets it apart from the majority of another animated shows which
generally specialize in satire or humor alone, with no nod to
char-dev (&quot;The Simpsons,&quot; et al).  I abide by this critical
norm, but as a case for the lessor of two evils, I definitely have to
go with &quot;When Depth Takes a Holiday,&quot; ironic considering
that &quot;Murder She Snored&quot; is </SPAN><I>technically</I> the
&quot;realistic one&quot; of the two!  Here, it was about stylistic
basis.  Despite &quot;Murder She Snored&quot;'s slick disclaimer of
having the majority of its events take place in a dream and thus
making sparing it from being &quot;fantasy&quot; I couldn't shake the
impression that the ep was a facetious waste of time.  It seemed more
like an excuse in retro-gumshoe kitsch for television trivia pursuit
fans than anything else--even</FONT></SPAN></SPAN> the &quot;test
leak&quot; plot went unresolved.  By comparison, &quot;When Depth
Takes a Holiday&quot;'s events, bizarre as they were, were less
intrusive as the plot unfolded.  Yes, there was a <I>plot</I>, and
queer as the events were, it was cohesive and pretty damn witty. 
There was also an air of self-conscientiousness about the silliness
of the ep itself, with a lot of self-referential dialogue about how
much none of it made any sense.  I give the writers credit for owing
up to that.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next up it's the battle of
the ensemble eps (sounds like a catchy pugilist round-up, doesn't
it?), namely, Season Three's &quot;Daria Dance Party&quot; and &quot;Just
Add Water&quot; against &quot;Antisocial Climbers&quot; and &quot;Mart
of Darkness.&quot;  Mart of Darkness of Season Four's claim is easily
the most throwaway ep of <I>Daria</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">,
all of its recycled jokes and routines unraveled in all their frayed
and redundant glory; as far as its rank goes, on most personal lists
it's not much higher than &quot;Murder She Snored.&quot;  I think
it's a lot worse than Season Three's counterpart &quot;Just Add
Water,&quot; which as Mike Quinn succinctly summed up may have been
&quot;Fair Enough&quot; on a boat, but it didn't come off nearly as
stagnant, probably on the strength of the little enjoyable subplots
(I don't know if there was a main plot in &quot;Just Add
Water&quot;...Daria and Jane's intrepid quest for uninterrupted
shut-eye?).  Jake putting on his marketing expertise spiel and
Helen's half-hearted support at least made a subtle expose of the
friction in there marriage, and who didn't get a rise out of Mr.
Demartino down to the felt at the poker table, a hyperactive
personality who epitomized the very nature of the &quot;bad beat&quot;?
 I don't even think that &quot;Antisocial Climbers&quot; (&quot;The
Daria Hunter&quot; on a mountain, without the Apocalypse Now, Full
Metal Jacket, and The Dear Hunter allusions, to its detriment) can be
called superior to &quot;Just Add Water&quot;; nothing in &quot;Antisocial
Climbers&quot; really seemed to stand out to me, sans the
faux-make-your-peace scene with Daria and Jane braving the worst of
the blizzard.  And Season Three's other noteworthy ensemble (or
border ensemble) piece, &quot;Daria Dance Party,&quot; dwarfed them
all with its funniest expose of Sandi and her whip-cracking exploits
to date and Jane's Jackson Pollock tableau in the school gym.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">I also
think Season Three has dibs on the superior &quot;Ep of the
Beholder,&quot; or what I call the season debut which typically sets
the tone of the rest of the season, and usually focuses on
image-perception (assuming we're talking about &quot;Through A Lens
Darkly&quot; and not &quot;Daria!&quot;, of course).  &quot;Partner's
Complaint&quot; had good intentions in aiming to show that Daria was
not the Lawndale's Greatest Authority on everything, and could be at
fault with her judgmental tendencies.  However, it was marred by
making Daria look sanctimonious and foolish, all the while condoning
Jodie's behavior in hypocritically backtracking on her own morals in
order to curry favor with their economics assignment.  Then with an
extra relish Jane gives Daria a window to &quot;apologize&quot; for
her bitchy reproach towards Tom with a bunch of bewilderingly
scatterbrained, patronizing verbiage.  By comparison &quot;Through A
Lens Darkly&quot; was not as toxic as an affair while still providing
Our Heroine with a moral dilemma.  She had to come to grips that her
behavior was not entirely in her altruistic, outcast milieu, even a
little vain, wrestled with the ethical implications of flirting with
contacts, and made her peace with the issue in the end without coming
off as overly meek.  It's been alluded as to being a &quot;fanfic in
action&quot; quite a bit, but whether or not we thought it too slight
isn't really the point; for Daria it was significant.  As far as
char-dev forays go, I don't think it could have been much more
succinct, or tender for that matter.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">Following
this there is the other significant batch of eps that constitutes the
body of the season, those that aren't easily classified as
&quot;Ensemble,&quot; or &quot;Ep of the Beholder,&quot; or
&quot;Fantasy,&quot; &quot;Shipper,&quot; or &quot;Char-Dev.&quot; 
They may either failed attempts at char-dev or situation based eps,
material that most of the Daria canon is based on, sometimes rather
sweepingly and derogatorily referred to as &quot;filler.&quot;  Now
I'm able to enjoy a good ep of <I>Daria</I> as long as it flows well,
provides a few laughs, and is in-character.  It's not mandatory for
me to see a major epiphany striking one of the characters or my
preconceptions of the characters.  But, I think that on the most
part, Season Three outstrips Season Four here as well.  I enjoyed &quot;A
Tree Grows in Lawndale,&quot; one of the &quot;whimsy&quot; eps
without being outright fantasy for its self-depreciating vibe, and it
was one of the few eps that was able to not grate on my nerves with
an over-exposure of Kevin and Brittany; their shenanigans as Kevin
the martyr and Brittany the maiden hung out to dry were pretty
hilarious.  Unfortunately, the whole &quot;loser town&quot; slant I
thought was overplayed, and thus, the ep didn't hold a candle to
Season Three's underrated &quot;The Lawndale Files.&quot;  A return
of Artie, Fashion Club solidarity, Trent's &quot;hell music,&quot;
serious business for the indie set, and a McCarthy episode of
hysteria in Jake.  For humor, what more could you want?  &quot;Of
Human Bonding&quot; was a serious char-dev disappointment.  On an
otherwise tedious telemarketing conference where Daria's antsyness
mirrored my own boredom, the only thing going for it was the promise
of some breakthroughs with Daria and Jake's relationship, which
instead came to naught, and a Fashion Club subplot that was, well,
<I>another</I> Fashion Club subplot.  Contrasted with Season Three,
it's cousin &quot;Jake of Hearts&quot; comes off as profound with
Jake's attempted heart-to-heart on his &quot;deadbed.&quot;  It's a
wittier affair all the while with Quinn and Helen affecting the roles
of perfect wife and daughter, whilst Daria gets to shoot down two
very annoying DJs in a superior (to &quot;Of Human Bonding&quot;)
subplot.  &quot;Groped By An Angel&quot; was the best of Season
Four's median terrain, after all, it showcased the empathic
&quot;spiritual&quot; side of Quinn, who working against type, was
entirely selfless in this ep, for her anyway.  Unfortunately 'twas
not as strong as it could have been, mainly because the subject
matter was trivialized by substituting the new age pap of Guardian
Angels in place of organized religion and god, rendering the plot
conflict puerile at times, as well as a disappointing cop-out by
Daria revealing her own &quot;beliefs&quot; at the ep's end. 
Therefore it wasn't the deserving heir apparent of either Season
Two's &quot;Quinn the Brain&quot; or even Season Three's
&quot;Speedtrapped,&quot; quasi-Quinn-centric eps which many
Pro-Quinnites use as evidence of her sympathetic side.  Both were far
funnier, and plausible, adventures than Quinn's crisis of faith over
celestial cherubs.  Still, none of these thematic disappointments
were the atrocity that was &quot;The F Word.&quot;  The main plot
catalyst of Mr. O'Neill's &quot;Succeed to Fail&quot; assignment was
dubious enough; it was a goal which seemed more suited for
asphyxiating romantics or artsy nihilists than pop-psyche pollyannas
like O'Neill.  The downbeat results weren't surprising, how could
they have possibly surprised him?  Of course, the real salt in the
wound was Jane's contrived lapse into conventionality of <I>cheerleading</I>
of all things, on the flimsiest of pretexts &quot;Being
unconventional was too easy.&quot;  It would have been less toxic to
opt for some other activity with better reasoning, as was done in
this ep's precedent, &quot;See Jane Run.&quot;  Unfortunately, &quot;The
F Word&quot; wasn't worthy of that ep's tradition.  This was even
before things got <I>really</I> ugly at the end of the season with
two noteworthy eps chronicling Jane's tailspin into a jealous,
overemotional, whiny, philistine over the oldest of all complications
that they program had done a good job of eschewing thus far, a <I>man.</I>
 Nevermind Daria all of sudden justifying Jane's mistrust in the
bargain.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">But, I
won't go into that just yet.  I do think Jane's character has been
Season Four's biggest casualty thus far, but Daria herself has
started to fray around the edges.  Or more to the point, those edges
have been sanded over to make her character less intimidating.  When
Daria is speaking on the phone to Jane in &quot;Mart of Darkness&quot;
about going along on a shopping trip and Daria answers &quot;I don't
know, I'm in the middle of a golden stretch of my sitting-on-my-ass
project,&quot; or something to that effect, it could also reflect her
lackadaisical involvement in Season Four.  She seems to be revolving
elliptically around whatever conflict in happening with a secondary
character.  Though this is typical of ensemble eps such as
&quot;Antisocial Climbers&quot; and &quot;Mart of Darkness,&quot;
it's also applied to outings like &quot;A Tree Grows in Lawndale,&quot;
she mostly acting as token cynic commenting blithely on Kevin and
Brittany and faux-lamenting about the newly dubbed &quot;loser town&quot;
of Lawndale.  In &quot;Of Human Bonding,&quot; barring the failed
attempt of real-life bonding 'twixt Daria and Jake, it instead
centered on Jake trying to oil up to Jerry Larry Carload and show off
his marketing expertise, while bringing out the Dictator-Maddog
rant-card again.  In &quot;Psycho Therapy&quot; most of the
issue-airing came from Morgendorffers other than Daria, and in
&quot;Groped By Angel,&quot; just like in &quot;A Tree Grows in
Lawndale,&quot; she acts the token cynic observing and commenting on
Quinn's new-found, and lapse, in faith.  If she's taking an active
role in presenting her side of a story, she's often depicted as
curmudgeony, unrealistically uncompromising, or na&iuml;ve and
foolish, as the way she was shot down in &quot;Partner's Complaint,&quot;
conversely leaving Jodie with little to answer to, and her say in
personal beliefs at the end of &quot;Groped By Angel,&quot; which
sounded like a public service statement for community service or
Barney lesson-of-the-day motif.  The only real eps I can think of in
which she has a role in the forefront that's meaningful are the
shipper eps.  I think Daria as a character is starting to be
processed within an inch of her life; all of the writers have penned
her dialogue to sound &quot;sarcastic and cynical,&quot; but it has
no real bite.  All of her quips must fall into place and play off
other people's comments with prompt timing before anything worthy
char-dev-wise is done with her character, which is often nothing at
all, considering the limiting 21-minute format on the show and the
suffusion of cameo characters that have been dragged out.  Daria
often seems riding second shotgun in her own show.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">Sure,
these apathetic roots were starting to surface back in Season Three,
but at least in that season Daria was still able to take on bloated
convention and institution in &quot;The Lost Girls&quot; (perfect
title, by the way).  That was en ep that the program was made for, a
swipe at the MTV marketing demographic and youth-centric culture in
general, managed by people out of that 15-24 aged set anyhow.  &quot;The
Old and the Beautiful,&quot; the ep that secured my fanaticism for
<I>Daria </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">and is nowhere as bad
as most people claim,</SPAN><I> </I>showed a Daria that was able to
make amends with her allergic reaction to engaging in community
service, a char-dev characteristic, while still maintaining her droll
persona; she would have to in order to bring Allen Gingsburg and Lord
Byron as reading material for the elderly.  Even efforts like &quot;It
Happened One Nut&quot; that could have served as a wake-up call for
Daria assessing her future before solely playing the comedic angle of
Daria-gets-a-job-and-it-sucks were better efforts than most of Season
Four's filler pool.  Most of all, Season Three was a reminder that
the writers had a sense of humor and weren't afraid to shy away from
pop culture send-ups or eps that were purely tongue-in-cheek, but
they didn't shy away from meaningful char-dev for <I>Daria</I>
either, after all, this season pissed Season Oners off too.  The
joyous parody and celebration that was &quot;Daria!&quot; didn't try
to justify itself in the continuum like &quot;Murder She Snored&quot;
did, with its disclaimer that all but said, &quot;It was all a
dream.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">To be
fair, I'll concede to some high points of Season Four that struck a
chord with me.  &quot;Psycho Spa&quot; had no peer in the char-dev
terrain it ventured into; I thought it was the crown jewel of the
season.  Jake and Helen had some needed exposure, but it never got
too heavy-handed while Daria kept her own shrink at bay with wry
self-diagnosis.  &quot;I Loathe a Parade&quot; was my favorite of the
shipper triumvirate; the shipper tension 'twixt Tom and Daria was
kept ambiguous so nothing could be pined down for certain, whilst
hilarity ensues with the Lawndale parade.  For a purely guilty
pleasure, I think &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; has no peer
either--unfavorable Simpson Halloween special comparisons aside, I
thought it had a very good, very witty glimpse into anachronistic
slices of what Daria could be in different eras.  Still, all of these
I find exceptions of the norm; I don't find Season Four giving me
that same consummate satisfaction that previous Seasons have.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">Still,
all of this tat may not matter.  Conceivably, you could cede to all
the points I've just made about filler-to-keeper ratio 'twixt the two
seasons, or at least about overall writing quality, but be still
hiding behind the monolithic power of those twin pillars &quot;Fire!&quot;
and &quot;Dye! Dye! My Darling.&quot;  The eps that &quot;saved&quot;
Season Four, exonerated it from past sins, or at least ensured a
cycle of maturation for most waiting viewers.  For some the best
thing sense sliced bread, or when Daria exited her family Lexus in
&quot;Esteemers&quot; uttering &quot;I'll try to help her (Quinn)
through this difficult period of adjustment.&quot;  Now,
interestingly enough, &quot;Lane Miserables&quot; and &quot;Jane's
Addition&quot; were also the shipper eps of Season Three, but they
didn't bail the rest of the season out the way that Season Four's
shipper-eps did.  Or maybe they did, briefly, but since then
acknowledgment about that Season's peaks has been glossed over, and
it's now the black sheep of the Daria canon.  Whether or not you
liked the direction of &quot;Fire!&quot; and &quot;Dye! Dye!
Darling,&quot; however it piqued you, I thought that &quot;Lane
Miserables&quot; and &quot;Jane's Addition&quot; were <I>superior</I>
eps.  &quot;Fire!&quot; and &quot;Dye! Dye! Darling&quot; were
one-note affairs, all about the tension and triangulation between
Daria, Jane, and Tom (well, there was the Morgendorffer Hotel subplot
of &quot;Fire!&quot; which no one cared about).  In &quot;Lane
Miserables,&quot; the shipper tensions 'twixt Daria and Trent were
underplayed; the subplot of the avalanche of visiting Lanes was just
as relevant, not to mention hilarious, and showed the writers had
memories of these then-esoteric character references, first mentioned
in &quot;The Teachings of Don Jake.&quot;  &quot;Jane's Addition&quot;
was about the fracture in Daria and Jane's friendship, just as much
as it centered around Tom, and how Daria's friendship for Jane
sometimes comes off as conditional.  Daria got to fire off her
perspective on the matter in no uncertain terms, before an uneasy
truce commenced, which finally seasoned into acceptance by Season
Four, without portraying Daria as weak or flaccid.  No, Season
Three's shipper affairs weren't as &quot;heavy&quot; or dramatic as
Season Four's, they aren't muddled in teenage awkwardness and
helplessness, and Season Four's will probably have weightier
complications.  But they weren't humorless, they didn't sabotage Our
Heroine's milieu,  they had char-dev credit, and they even introduced
Tom.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Eps
like &quot;Fire!&quot; and &quot;Dye! Dye! My Darling&quot; tend to
bring out the worst in the message boards.  I could empathize with
Rey Fox's reasons for his board departure, he quoting he never liked
&quot;Oh My God!&quot; type eps which pique such a overflowing
reaction.  Even as I write this three weeks after &quot;Dye! Dye! My
Darling&quot;'s initial premier the trickle of new, daily threads on
the dynamics of Tom, Daria, and Jane that were unstrung before us
never end  It's dead horse that won't be spared flogging anytime soon
either, as I'm sure many of these infinitesimal debates will segue
into the ones following &quot;Is It Fall Yet?&quot;, since the promos
seem to give every indication of continuing to milk these
relationship developments 'twixt Tom and Daria, and the estrangement
of Daria and Jane.  One might as well rhetorically ask why didn't
&quot;Legends of the Mall&quot; get as much attention with lengthy
harangues about the dramatic structural changes the program would go
through in presenting a 50s or 60s styled Daria, or &quot;The Lost
Girls&quot; with discussion about the pathetic inability of some to
let go of the excess or hipness of their youth, and the real-life
irony of <I>Daria</I> making such a statement, being hosted on such a
gonad network as MTV.</SPAN>  The child is more mature than the
parent, apparently.  Eps like the shipper ones don't, or shouldn't,
deserve the lavishing attention they get.  I feel they do because
they speak out to the gossipy, self-styled, 101-izing relationship
expert in all of us, ready with pat deconstructions of
Daria/Jane/Tom's actions, what they mean, and what they should do. 
It's fun and an easy way to speculate, but I think it belies an ugly
side.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most of the Majors and
Indie-Fans on the boards alike seem to approve the direction of
<I>Daria</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">'s last two eps, or at
least condone them, nevermind the emasculation of Our Heroine and her
partner-in-crime, nevermind the overexposure of Kevin and Brittany
earlier in the season, nevermind the lowest common denominator
panning with this love-triangulation.  Few have openly spoken against
them.  Those who do I feel have something of an unspoken judgment
passed on them, that they are churlish, retro-minded, unrealistic
folks and less than well-bred.  Fans living a Season One pipe dream,
and
why-can't-they-just-leave-us-char-devvers-the-hell-alone-and-take-up-chess-or-something.
 There seem to be a lot of apologists for &quot;Fire!&quot; and &quot;Dye!
Dye! My Darling!&quot;, using all sorts of glib euphemisms about what
transpired: &quot;It's not betraying its roots, Daria is partaking in
character development!&quot;  &quot;Daria isn't pandering to a more
salacious audience, she's coming to terms with her feelings and
letting down those pesky barriers!&quot;  &quot;Daria was never
asexual or purposely, ironically abstinent, she's voyaging yonder as
only a wide-eyed, wondering, horny virgin can!&quot; (ooh la la...)
This has never really bothered me, as I'm a passionate fan of a show
with a protagonist who makes a point in being nonconformist. 
Obviously, I'm </SPAN><I>not</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"> a
fan of &quot;Fire!&quot; and &quot;Dye! Dye! My Darling&quot; and
feel they are counterproductive to what the show has traditionally
tried to represent and champion.  </SPAN>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">I won't
bore you with an in-depth chicken-little expose of EXACTLY when wrong
in these last two eps and WHY that is so, or shell out tiresome
&quot;sell-out!&quot; attacks or &quot;soap opera&quot; derision,
which admittedly, as many have pointed out, is hyperbolic.  However,
I liked my <I>Daria</I> with some boundaries; note that &quot;boundaries&quot;
need not be synonymous with &quot;stagnating&quot; or &quot;stifling.&quot;
 After all, my favorite Season is Two, not One, and the fact that I'm
making a sympathetic case here for Season Three means I can't be
entirely conservative.  Nonetheless, I liked my Daria to be an
archetype of sorts, someone who wasn't afraid to call someone on
their crap, to take on the Man, corporate interests, media-pandering
and institutions, a Daria that was hyper-articulate, who <I>actually
read</I>, who had wisdom beyond her years, wasn't insecure in her
cynicism or fell into the traps of many teenage girls, who thought
about greater issues than popularity, fashion, or boys.  A heroine in
an age group with a very real paucity of heroines.  I also liked my
Jane to be lugubrious, flippant, an artsy chick who wasn't afraid to
take a swipe at someone and wasn't bleating about being abandoned by
her boyfriend.  <I>Daria</I> for me has always been about the
underappreciated high school experience for the geeks and the
outsiders, beyond &quot;The storybook fantasy that these are the best
days of our lives,&quot; Jane quoted in &quot;Arts N' Crass,&quot;
beyond the games that girls and boys played with one another, a teen
show than didn't obsess about their budding sexualities for once, but
rather sneered at it.  A show that could appeal beyond the
demographic of its characters, and does.  &quot;You don't get it,
there's a principle involved,&quot; Daria told off middle-aged
customer research specialists in &quot;Malled.&quot;  There really
is.  &quot;Realistic progression&quot; and &quot;char-dev&quot;
specifically for the point of attenuating Daria and Jane's cynical
side be damned.  I really haven't found many of these initial stellar
qualities that made <I>Daria</I> stand out in Season Four, or when
they've been there, they're watered-down.  In &quot;Dye! Dye! My
Darling&quot; when there was that shot of an obseqious and
crestfallen Daria apologizing to Jane for kissing Tom in the middle
of a school hall, with a quiet, porous audience, I had a
freeze-frame, kodak moment in my head: &quot;Is <I>this</I> the <I>Daria
</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">that I knew and loved?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">But I
digress.  I've had my primary point, which was to make a plea against
Season Three's purported lackluster rep, contrasted against Season
Four's enormously inflated one.  I believe that Season Three almost
holds its own with Season One, and if some of its weak links were
strengthened or allowed to develop where the chance was presented,
like in &quot;The Old and the Beautiful&quot; and &quot;It Happened
One Nut,&quot; it could have even rivaled Season Two.&quot;  So
friends, I implore you, if the only reasons you think very highly of
Season Four are named &quot;Fire!&quot; and &quot;Dye! Dye! My
Darling,&quot; please reassess them, and if the only reasons you
denounce Season Three are &quot;When Depth Takes a Holiday&quot; and
&quot;Just Add Water,&quot; please reassess them too.  Mind you I
don't go to bed at night nattering my molars together like Mr.
Demartino in &quot;Legends of the Mall&quot; over how <I>Daria</I>
has betrayed my sensibilities; this is just an opinion piece, I still
love the show enough to religiously tape it, and schedule around
tapings (which will include &quot;Is It Fall Yet?&quot;).  Oh, and
you people who infinitize about the phantom minutia of the <I>Daria</I>
cast's sex life, trust me, it's an exercise in futility.  I also play
chess anyway, so I might as well keep watching <I>Daria</I>. 
Finally, one last good-natured swipe at you Season Four apologists:
Season Three had a <I>whole</I> minute of screen time for Aunt Amy,
our own adult uber-Daria...what do you have to say about <I>THAT</I>?</P>
