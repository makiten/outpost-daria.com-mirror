<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium">What
constitutes the formula for a successful teen sitcom?  Take a batch
of early twentysomething modeling agency upstarts, doctor them up
with cosmetics and airbrushes, give them hackneyed pseudo-hipster
&quot;teen&quot; dialogue to act out various scripted suburban
mini-traumas, add plenty of melodramatic music twinkling in the
background and during crucial facial poses, stir thoroughly into a
24-minute paste, and sprinkle in various corporate sponsorships after
the opening trailer and youth demographic advertisements 'twix each
mini-cliffhanger.  Tack on an extended hour or so of the same with no
need for considering a long-term relationship with the audience
member and you have the silver screen teen comedy version, a
self-contained one-night stand with some liberal profanity and
innuendoes interspersed in, boundaries allotted by whatever it is the
MPAA rating will stand for.  And one cannot forget the sexual
equation amidst all of these teen dreams, lord no.  After all, Eric
Erikson has all made us historically aware of the teenage period in a
person's life, along that tempestuous 13-19-year-old span, that is
fraught with drama and novelty, spiritual staking and sexual
discovery.  Television can be counted on not to downplay this &quot;stage&quot;
in the least, particularly the sex element, where amid the cliques,
proms, parties, courting circles and the games teens play, sparks
will fly, and maybe for an encore, jealous fists too.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium">All of
this sexual glitz and moody shtick in both teen comedies and dramas
is something that our animated heroine Daria tries to stand
diametrically opposite of, or at least skewer, which is no easy task
considering her parent network rules the roost in regards to
hormones.  Any given day of the week in MTV's viewing schedule seems
to resemble a junior high pajama party while the parents are out of
town.  Or at least a marketing executive's wet dreamy idea of it. 
I've found it typically has as much resemblance to actual teen life
as <I>Penthouse Forum</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"> has to
actual sex.  Still, with the non-stop come-hither undulating apparel
of Brittany Spears and Christina Aguileria, immaculately bland
boy-next-door freshness of you-know-who, simian angst-in-the-pants of
Limp Bizkit, Korn, and Eminem, mock-up relationship ruination court

etc, etc, ad naeseum, MTV seems to be on a mission to prove that no
one has the same lease on sexual angst as they.  One of their latest
programming debuts, </SPAN><I>Jailbait</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">,
is another sign of the times (as if the soft-core porn values of
<I>Undressed</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"> wasn't overkill
already)</SPAN>.  The blurb that I'd read about its debut (because I
wouldn't be caught dead condescending to actually </SPAN><I>watch
</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">such an affair) was that it's a
&quot;comedy&quot; about an 18-year-old male and his 15-year-old
hottie girlfriend, the &quot;jailbait&quot; in question I presume,
whom he has sex with and then is promptly arrested for statutory
rape.  Yes, it's supposed to be a comedy.  Are we having fun yet?</SPAN></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">But
MTV's piece of the gonad pie is just a slice of the sex-saturated
media whole.  If sexuality were a fad, it'd be long past it's prime
and overdue for retirement into a rusty attic chest with leisure
suits, corduroy, and vinyl records.  However it's endlessly recycled
in our icons and our entertainment, particularly with female
celebrities who have to go to greater lengths at selling their sex
appeal than men do.  Michelle Pfiffer is reborn as Sarah Michelle
Gellar.  Mary Tyler Moore is resurrected as Calista Flockheart,
Farrah Fawcett's willowy-haired, milk-fed descendent Heather Graham
takes a similar helm.  In music, Joni Mitchell begets Ani Defranco. 
Kate Bush begets Tori Amos.  Proto-punk soloist Patti Smith begets
90s descendent Courtney Love, neurotic grunge-grrl in a kinderwhore
dress.  The pop-diva scene seems to owe a large debt to warmed-over
mid-80s Madonna, while the real thing has undergone a number of
revisions herself in her double-decade career, wearing and tearing
through personas like yesterday's outfits.  And so it goes, celebrity
skin n' sex recycling of biblical proportions.  A recent ABC
docudrama would even make the, at best, dubious suggestion that
Jennifer Love Hewitt is the next Audrey Hepburn.</SPAN></P>

Sexuality seems to be the ultimate medium and cure-all for anxiety,
fatigue, boredom, despair, and, well, plain old vanilla arousal.  Sex
education continues way beyond the rudimentary information about
contraceptives and STDs gleaned in high school; now we have countless
tombs specializing in technique and how to channel your inner Don
Juan, or Sharon Stone as it were, just a quick stroll away in the
sexuality section of <I>Barnes and Noble</I> situated snugly by the
self-help aisle.  Shock-jock humor for the lowest common denominator
ala Howard Stern lurks about the AM radio channels, as well as
soundbite-translated Sex-For-Dummies talk shows ala Loveline.  And is
it just me or are all those jeans and moisturizer ads in newsstand
mags the same ones, with merely the names and places changed,
recycled over the past 20 years, proffering models with skin so
absurdly immaculate you could eat off it?  Yes, sex is smeared
unceremoniously everywhere you trod, and you don't need me to tell
you.  I could tag on a pithy contrast with violence in the media and
this essay would morph into one of those redundant late-night
punditry think-pieces lamenting over the Orwellian effect of the
media on our elastic psyches.  You know it, I know it.  Chances are a
significant portion of your time concerns your love life, or pining
over the lack thereof.  It's probably impossible to even be a prude
in the Victorian sense today in any progressive urban Western
environment; unless you're willing to settle down in an idyllic
old-fashioned countryside or Amish community the most you can settle
for is being repressed.  We're inundated with this sexual awareness
to a degree that congressional and executive infidelity hardly raises
an eyebrow anymore, and even previously trangressive lifestyles like
bondage and sadomasochism are considered passe, and uber-risqu&eacute;
classics like <I>The Story of O</I> are rendered tame.  There are
probably few rules left to break in the public sexually-savvy eye,
outside of telecast open-air orgies and Nickelodeon spinning off
<I>Storytime with De Sade</I>.

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">One
of my favorite short stories by my favorite author, J. G. Ballard,
who had quite the knack for incisive psycho-sexuality, penned a short
story entitled <I>Love in a Colder Climate</I>, which chronicled the
logical course of this liberated sexual excess to its jaded extreme. 
That story depicted a future where cases of AIDS and other mutated
STDs had risen to epidemic proportions and threatened the lives of
every sexual active individual on the planet.  In desperation
national governments started regulating congress of any sort 'twix
males and females, segregating them rigorously at the workplace and
in public, and any sort of request for a sexual relationship required
as much bureaucracy as an IRS audit.  Facing a plummeting birth rate
these governments then turned to revitalizing the perpetuation of
their citizens, but not by revoking their restraints on interaction
necessarily, but by mandating sexual &quot;conscription&quot; of all
(HIV-negative) virile men and fertile women into an army of
government-subsidized breeders under the zealous watch of the former
Christian churches, which had morphed into playing matchmaker and
trainer for all the &quot;soldiers.&quot;  In this Huxlian,
totalitarian sex-regime two people dared to fall in love in the
old-fashion sense, and ended up being persecuted for their aberrant
romantic selfishness</SPAN></SPAN>.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now we're hardly to the
extremist measure in that story, where all of the &quot;soldiers&quot;
felt condemned to a life of empty, clinical copulation and would
dodge the &quot;draft&quot; if given the chance.  Nor was the story
an attempt at wholly realistic near-future sci-fi, but rather a
satirical allegory about the dangers of sexual revelry to the point
of exhaustion and implosion.  Now, I hardly lead an ascetic
lifestyle, and I'm not making an elaborate pitch glorifying the days
of conservative yore when chastity was a virtue.  Rather I'm just
trying to paint a backdrop of what sort of lifestyle the media
presents, which shows like <I>Daria</I> are a participant on, like it
or not.  Nor do I live in an ivory tower of pure and untainted
intellectual pursuits; I have the common sense to acknowledge that
man can't abide by PBS, National Public Radio, and the New York Times
alone.  We all need a little fluff in our passive entertainment, but
that doesn't mean we can't be a discriminate fluff-picker.  I'm still
a young man, but I make a point to vigorously eschew the glam-sex
culture that I've been outlining above, in the way I expect Daria
does.  I don't tune in for <I>Two Guys and a Girl</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">,
<I>Friends, </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">or</SPAN> </SPAN><I>Everybody
Loves Raymond</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">.  I don't read </SPAN><I>GQ</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
or </SPAN><I>Esquire</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"> magazine,
play <I>Quake</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"> or read John
Grisham</SPAN>.  And don't get me started on </SPAN><I>Ally McBeal</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">,
the worst of the dubiously &quot;critically-acclaimed&quot; shows on
the networks, which despite the chic short skirts, armani suits, 
loquacious cleverness, self-aware sexual sass and authority that
everyone in the cast boasts in-between the ridiculous cases that they
tackle, I get the impression that I'm really watching a bunch of
over(under)sexed high schoolers masquerading as lawyers.  That's one
of the reasons with the very little TV that I intake at all, I always
find <I>Daria</I> a breath of fresh air on many levels.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">It's
hard to sift through this bleak landscape in search of worthy shows
at all, and to find one set during those formative high school years
that doesn't languish in rote melodrama and manipulate its audiences
with the cheap faux-vicariousness of its cast members' sexual trysts
and triangles, <I>and</I> instead opts for original characters over
stereotypes.  A recent sleeper to this end has been NBC's excellent
and under-appreciated <I>Freaks and Geeks</I>.  One of the bigwigs at
that network actually let a great show slip in their line-up, but
don't worry, they've rectified their mistake and canceled it far
before it's time.  Its plight was rather ironic in trying to vie
against more &quot;popular&quot; shows, considering <I>Freaks and
Geeks </I>itself has a coming-of-age motif about the trials and
tribulations of a motley crew of, you guessed it, freaks and geeks. 
Sort of like a certain animated heroine that we know and love, which
we have managed to fall back on.  <I>Daria</I> as a program has
thankfully managed to secure a solid enough viewer base by being--how
would Val put it?  &quot;Edgy&quot; enough to keep it in syndication.
 There are greater eps, there are lessor eps, and sometimes it has to
follow the dynamics of many a sitcom in order to satisfy plot details
and its humor quotient, after all, <I>Daria</I> is still a comedy
meant to entertain.  However, even during some of Daria's suburban
misadventures that wouldn't seem terribly out of place showcased in
shows of its peer group, Daria never loses her sense of wry
self-effacement and deadpan unwillingness to exacerbate her troubles
or generally take herself too seriously.  Also, I enjoy many of
<I>Daria</I>'s smaller quirks, as any sophisticated <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><I>Daria</I></SPAN>
fan, one of which has been the (to me) amazingly steadfast asexuality
of the title character.  Sex?  Spare me.  At least, that's the vibe
I've always gotten from Daria, who treats it with a very cool, candid
disdain, and makes it clear that she strives to be above-it-all.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">Case for
the Devil's Advocate, No. 1: Doesn't the sexual tension 'twix primary
characters enhance the show's effect?  I mean, doesn't that
unexplored, amorphous chemistry 'twix Captain Janeway and Commander
Chakotay on <I>Star Trek: Voyager</I> and between Dana Scully and Fox
Mulder on <I>The X-Files</I> add a little extra spark to the show's
formula and wonder on what's to come?  Sure.  Daria's not made of
stone; we've seen three seasons of shippery tension 'twix Daria and
Trent, and it served its function nicely without reaching a critical
and irrevocable breaking point.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">Okay...Case
for the Devil's Advocate, No. 2: Isn't Daria still a very young woman
with a good gander of self-discovery to still traverse, including her
own sexuality (which Helen quoted as much in &quot;College Bored&quot;:
&quot;Daria is more of a late bloomer.&quot;)?  Hasn't her one-sided
crush with Trent in the first three seasons been an indictment of
this direction?  Well, that's one way of interpreting it, but
personally I doubt it.  From time to time on the Daria message
boards, inevitable threads about sexuality in the show start to
spawn, often with supporters of point No. 2 voicing hopeful choruses
about the paths that Daria could eventually voyage yonder to during
this time of &quot;growth.&quot;  Remarkably, there has been a lack
of serious support for the notion that maybe, just maybe, in her
mind's eye Daria has already come, blossomed, wilted, and judged
without going on so much as a single date.  I think Daria's demeanor
during the show's run has made it quite clear that she has no
interest in partaking in the sham and sharm of the teenage courtship
dance, or compromising herself in any way for the sake of being more
sexually or socially appealing.  And in the name of brains, outcasts,
and non-conformist value systems everywhere, I applaud this cynical
abstinence of Daria's.  Let the heartthrobs on <I>Dawson's Creek</I>
and that show's parallel dimensions wax and whine about their
romantic torment; Daria has already cast it off with the indifference
of so much dead skin.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">Evidence
of this attitude in Daria is evident right from the start.  In &quot;The
Invitation&quot; Daria gives Jane a good ribbing for scooping out
Bobby Bighead and his companion, and when the young men get the gaul
to hit on them, Daria delivers one of her most famous deadpan snubs
in the history of the show, without being unnecessarily cruel.  Later
on when Jane returns from her little adventure in the laundry room
and Jane comments that she &quot;wasn't really interested,&quot;
Daria smoothly retorts with &quot;Too bad...is this your sock?&quot; 
The tone is indicative of everything here.  Note that Daria doesn't
deliver this line while leaning forward with girlish glee, eager to
lap up some juicy details for gossip, but instead is cool and
nonchalant, with a hint of a subtext in her voice beckoning to add
sardonically: &quot;Well, aren't <I>you</I> the randy one.&quot;  On
the social front, and she says it herself, Daria was ready to leave
the party before they stepped in.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">Daria
excels in keeping up stoic appearances, and being very uncompromising
as well.  She wears a skirt, yes--a black pleated knee-length one
that isn't meant to be risqu&eacute; in the least.  If that doesn't
settle the case, then the Doc Marten thrasher-boots will, and the
color-clashing green jacket.  Daria doesn't doctor herself up with
make-up, perfume, or experiment with exotic hair styles.  She wears
glasses instead of contacts, a decision guaranteed to mar her
appearance at least slightly (I know, as a fellow bi-focals wearer),
and one which concerned the entire plotline for one &quot;Through a
Lens Darkly.&quot;  There we where also privy to Daria defense of her
appearance to Helen, off-putting as it is, which I believe
furthermore speaks volumes about her purposeful disinterest in what
the men of Lawndale have to offer.  Her contempt for fashion,
modeling, and plastic surgery is readily apparent in the ribbing that
she gives it in &quot;This Year's Model,&quot; along with Jane, and a
follow-up performance in &quot;The Lost Girls.&quot;  In &quot;Too
Cute&quot; a typical Daria retort to Dr. Shar frowning over Daria
&quot;giving up&quot; on herself on such an early age is &quot;Maybe
you can inject collagen into your lips in the form of a smile.&quot; 
Daria also has little use for running around the topic of sex with
formalities; she openly declares her sexual inactivity to Dr.
Phillips in &quot;Ill&quot; before he can get the opportunity to
broach the &quot;sensitive topic,&quot; and she jumps right into
accusatory mode in &quot;Jane's Addition&quot; as soon as Jane and
Tom get together.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">Now, the
most obvious exception amidst all this sexual scorn on Daria's part
has been her shippery tension with Trent.  But even that can likely
be broken down in logical terms (even if unrequited attraction is by
itself irrational).  Almost all women at a time in their life harbor
a romantic fallacy about overtly artistic or sensitive men, souls
dedicated to lost causes and martyrdom who burn with a soulful flame,
and can only hope that a soulmate could fully understand their
passions.  It's quite touching to believe that you could possible be
that counterpart with a hand in their soul, and that you could reform
the Robert Smith, Kurt Cobain, or Trent Reznor of your choice (case
to point, the follow-up daydream of Daria's in &quot;Lane Miserables&quot;
after the Trent-hell one).  A similar complex often affects men who
believe they can &quot;rescue&quot; a woman from her personal demons.
 Additionally, I think Trent's ruggedly indirect passive-aggressive
stance towards authority and conventionality and his quaint
indie-rocker values come off as cute to Daria's own outsider
sensibilities.  But much of this reasoning in the crush veers more to
the psychological than the libidinous.  It's also underplayed by and
large during the show; Daria doesn't rush over to Jane's house after
every day at school to ogle Trent's sleeping form or spend the late
hours at night holding a vigil at her desk writing bad confessional
poetry about Trent.  In fact, traditionally there is only one
shipper-centric ep per season in <I>Daria</I>, and the latest one,
&quot;Lane Miserables,&quot; had the Daria/Trent repartee play out
more as a subplot.  By and large I think the Trent crush just exists
as evidence that Daria is still human.  Even the most shippery,
guilty pleasure in the canon, &quot;Pierce Me,&quot; doesn't
consummate anything.  Similar miscellaneous exploits have proven
other non-sexual points in the show, notably the quasi-relationship
with Ted in &quot;The New Kid,&quot; which I always thought was a
personal trial for Daria to prove to herself that she can potentially
let down her defenses, if she pleases, to let other people into her
exclusive creed.  Aside from these shippery tensions, Daria remains
remarkably androgynous.  Therein lies a good deal of Daria's appeal;
by not piling on female high schooler clich&eacute;s, like the
Fashion Club do, Daria makes herself more accessible to male and
female audiences.  With very few changes in the show's structure I
could easily see Daria having carried the baton of her pessimistic
career as a male, the crush being carried out on a narcoleptic
basement version of PJ Harvey.  Ditto for the behavior of a male
Jane.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">Speaking
of which, Jane's bona fide relationship with Tom is more veritable
than any of the lingering tension 'twix Daria and Trent, however it's
played out in an even more understated fashion.  Jane is the more
logical choice for an endeavor, besides my &quot;The Invitation&quot;
example above she's been known to flirt a little (&quot;See Jane
Run&quot;) and generally be more open to the idea of boys.  However,
whenever Tom is chewing scenery on the set it's never as &quot;the
boyfriend,&quot; but as Tom.  The scriptwriters have in fact avoided
presenting us any lengthy scenes or eps specific to the context of
their relationship; if we weren't told they were an item, it'd be
hard to verify it at all.  An ep's subplot never focuses on what
happens when they go out on a date or &quot;lover's quarrels&quot;
they may have, or (god forbid) make-out scenes.  Even the most
blatant example, in &quot;The F Word&quot; when Jane greeted Tom at
the door in her, y'know, like, conventional outfit: &quot;Hey fly
boy...want to try out my new lip gloss?  It's kiwi flavored...&quot; 
Tom could have replied with any number of crass, leering come-ons at
the opening Jane gave, like &quot;Sure, it's just the <I>glossing</I>
on the cake,&quot; or &quot;As long as I can work my way down from
there,&quot; or even worse, &quot;Kiwi eh?  So does this mean cherry
is on the menu later on?&quot;  One can almost hear the faux-piqued
&quot;Ooooooooooh!&quot; lifted from a <I>Married with Children</I>
audience track in response to that last one.  However, I inwardly
cheered when Tom sardonically answered, &quot;Well, if I were to kiss
you, at least I wouldn't be looking at you.&quot;  Instead of the fly
boy falling into the flytrap, he smoothly voices his disapproval for
Jane's make-over with a good-natured quip.  In fact, the
scriptwriters have been careful not to color outside the lines with
this at all; each crisis point, from the initial catalyst of
shipperdom in &quot;The Road Worrier&quot; of season one, to &quot;The
New Kid&quot; and &quot;Pierce Me&quot; in season two, to the
animosity arising at the end of &quot;Jane's Addition&quot; in season
three have never dragged the show down to a <I>Dawson's Creek</I>
level.  And I assume that it never will if they continue to deal with
these episodes tastefully, i.e. The latest issue to resolve being the
vague chemistry 'twix Tom and Daria seen in &quot;I Loathe a Parade.&quot;
 Fans who exhaust a significant number of brain cells pondering about
the nuances of the sex lives of <I>Daria</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">'s</SPAN><I>
</I>cast are missing the point--the scriptwriters only use sexuality
so far as a device for advancing their satiric intentions
(particularly Quinn and her menagerie of admirers), as much as they
do with the Fashion Club power struggles.  In the grand scheme of
things, sex is as irrelevant to the show's dynamics as say, religion
is (which hasn't even been brought up).  For the earliest fans of Our
Heroine who cut their teeth on Season One when &quot;Road Worrier&quot;
had yet to be born, did anyone really exclaim after each episode,
&quot;Golly, I hope Daria(Jane) can hook up with a great guy in the
next ep!&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">Finally,
Case for the Devil's Advocate, No. 3: Assuming Daria has already
judged sexuality in the manner which you say, isn't she missing out
prematurely, and stunting her growth as a character?  This is a point
I can't directly attack because even though it's become something of
a buzzword in justifying any sort of aberration in the show's format,
character development (char-dev) is something I support in
moderation, and favorite eps of mine are in fact &quot;Through a Lens
Darkly,&quot; &quot;Lane Miserables,&quot; &quot;Jane's Addition,&quot;
and recently &quot;I Loathe a Parade&quot; which char-dev, or at
least tension, is made evident.  As far as missing out goes, sure she
is.  Daria knows it, after all, she discloses her yielding to this
fact in &quot;Gifted.&quot;  As far as stunting her growth as a
character goes, I think a dichotomy can be made 'twix earnest
personal growth and little &quot;lessons&quot; that are pitched to us
in situational events to remind us that Daria isn't all that bad, she
has feelings and flaws and foibles just like us.  Really!  Among
these preachy &quot;lessons&quot; would be &quot;proving&quot; that
Daria really cares about her family and friends, they care about her,
Daria really has basic moral instincts at heart, Daria can learn to
be tolerant of other people's beliefs, etc, etc, et al.  I mean,
&quot;duh.&quot;  I assume as much, Daria hardly has a heart of stone
or a blatant sadistic streak; these qualities aren't necessarily
synonymous with sarcasm or cynicism.  I don't need to be led by the
hand during an ep and &quot;shown&quot; that Daria is really a good
person--that's not why I watch the show.  And I think Daria embarking
on a romantic relationship would be exercising another one of such
redundant &quot;lessons&quot; thrown to us from the pontiff.  What
exactly would it prove?  That Daria has the ability to love another? 
Spare me the sentimentality, I know Daria would.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">Allow me
to draw a brief analogy with the treatment of sex in <I>Daria</I> and
its treatment in another show I'm a huge fan of, <I>Doctor Who</I> (a
comparison I think you'll be hard pressed to find, well, outside a
Yui Daoren crossover fanfic).  In <I>Doctor Who</I> the title of the
program really said it all.  We knew basic things about this
eccentric renegade who traveled in a deceptively battered old police
box which was a dimensional front to the vast labyrinth of his ship,
the TARDIS, underneath.  We knew that he was of a race of Time Lords
who typically lived to be 1500 and lived 13 lives, or 12
regenerations, his cardiovascular system had two hearts, and he liked
floppy scarves and bohemian jackets.  The Doctor had turned his back
on his academic homeworld content for living in sedentary study and
solitary in favor of adventuring across the cosmos and righting
wrongs like an old-fashioned hero, except this one was a
super-intelligent pacifist who typically thumbed his nose at
authority.  He also usually traveled with a singular young female
companion whose job was to get in trouble and translate to the
audience what was going on (usually by she asking the Doctor that
question herself).  The interesting quirk about this relationship was
that it was wholly platonic, nay, <I>devoid</I> of sexual tension
whatsoever.  A message of abstinence wasn't even delivered in the
form of a public service message, it was just avoided altogether. 
This curious asexuality furthered the enigma of the Doctor, as we
fans, placed in that unenviable position of explaining all the
discontinuity of a series, formed elaborate theories about Time Lord
physiology and an inherently ultra-low libido in Time Lords.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">All this
changed during the BBC's negotiations with FOX in creating a spin-off
<I>Doctor Who</I> TV movie in 1996.  With a little luck this would be
a gateway effort in creating a new, revamped, big budget <I>Doctor
Who</I> for a new audience, continuing the voyages of our beloved
doctor, as much as <I>The Outer Limits</I> was remade from its
sixties origins.  To cut a long story short the TV movie effort was
an overproduced, glossy mess, with too much self-conscious effort in
attempting to condense 26 years of <I>Doctor Who</I> continuity down
into a 90 minute format, while telling an audience-gripping
action-packaged tale in the bargain.  The general audience wouldn't
get it, indeed, the TV movie received anemic ratings in the States,
nor would they care.  At least it could have served as a nostalgia
trip for us long-time loyalists, but in an effort to make the
Doctor's character more accessible, the scriptwriter skewed key
elements of his persona.  One of which was the inclusion of the
Doctor being &quot;half-human.&quot;  But that wasn't the most bitter
pill to swallow--that was the idea to have the Doctor embark on a
romantic sojourn with his newest female companion who he meets in the
movie.  Far from enriching the Doctor's person, this little odious
attempt to humanize the Doctor's previous other-worldly self to a
more general audience totally undermined everything that the Doctor
had stood for before.  In the TV Movie's aftermath follow-up plans
for a new original series came to naught, but the rest of us fans had
to deal with this new &quot;revelation&quot; brought on by the TV
Movie and the responsibility of rationalizing it.  Would the Doctor
now have steamy quickies on the TARDIS control panel?  Would he now
be more discriminating in the &quot;companions&quot; he picks up? 
Would his intentions interacting with other beings he encountered
ever be truly altruistic again?  Would the Doctor think about sex
every six seconds?  The thoughts and the repercussions made us all
collectively groan.  Ultimately, most of us passed a silent decree
disabusing the TV movie any legitimate place in the old <I>Doctor Who</I>
canon (and as far as I'm concerned, there is no Eighth Doctor).</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">A
similar occurrence could serve to undermine what <I>Daria</I> stands
for, if love triangles start to take seed and teen angst starts to
replace teen irony.  What the TV networks need right now is <I>Sex in
the Suburbs</I> like I need a hole in my head, especially when
Daria's values are at stake.  Of course, there is a difference 'twix
purposeful abstinence on Daria's part and being in extended denial. 
I hardly practice Daria's asceticism, though I admire it from afar. 
I can imagine Daria eventually embarking on a relationship in her
future, probably outside the natural life expectancy of <I>Daria</I>,
an angle that two Daria shipper futurists Diane Long and Michelle
Klein-Hass have tackled in fanfic.  However, I don't think it will
take place with a revised personal attitude via Daria embracing a
liberated sense of do-me feminism or sexual actualization, but rather
because she feels she has to interview for a job she really doesn't
want, but knows she has to take it to be a productive member of
society (mannerisms I didn't feel were too off-the-mark in Austin
Covello's &quot;My Date with Daria,&quot; even if it was critically
panned).  A stance that will, paradoxically, make her all the more
attractive.</P>
