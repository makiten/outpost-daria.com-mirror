<P>Forgive my impertinence, but WHY does the question need to be
raised and discussed? "Is Tom
         evil?" He's ink and paper! People are talking like he's
trying to put one over on us!</P>

<P>        I know ... I know ... we talk all the time about "Is Quinn
smart?" "Is Jake really that clueless?" and "Is
         Daria insecure?" But while Glenn can be subtle when he wants
to, he's never so subtle that the
         situation he's trying to portray has to be GUESSED at. That
would just be ludicrous. And in the past
         season + that Tom's been around, there has been NO indication
of "evilness." He's not portrayed as
         perfect, but there's been NOTHING to suggest that his motives
are anything but what he says they
         are.</P>

<P>        More than that, Glenn has taken the show in new and
interesting directions BASED on the
         presumption that Tom is genuine. He's made it the centerpiece
of character development for the
         past year! For him to double-back now, and OOPS! Tom's evil!
It was all a hideous manipulative
         scheme! ... come ON. That would destroy everything he's been
taking such care to build. Give the
         guy some credit!</P>

<P>        I'm amazed that more people don't see this. I think they
are making the very real mistake of
         separating Tom from Glenn ... like some sort of independent
entity, capable of deceit and treachery.
         Well it's wishful thinking on the part of people who have
invested WAY too much of their own lives
         into characters that were never meant to represent them.</P>

<P>        That's right. You heard me. Daria was NOT created for the
purposes of representing you. She's not a
         mirror for your life. She's not a guideline. Tom, insofar as
he actually exists, is not dating you, he is
         dating Daria. They're fictional characters. It's one thing to
identify with them. You're SUPPOSED to
         identify with them. It's another thing to expect them to
identify with you.</P>

<P>        This argument may seem contrary to the whole purpose of
fanfiction, but it's not. I've always seen
         the purpose of fanfiction as exploring the options INHERENT
in the show and its characters --
         whether they lie in parody or homage; canon or off-canon.
What I'm seeing is people trying to
         RE-WRITE someone else's story to the point where it fits
their own comfort-zone. It's a fine line, to be
         sure. But when you introduce a new element -- a "what if?" --
what are your motives? </P>

<P>        Saying "What if?" is all well and good, and it can be a
lot of FUN. There's nothing wrong with
         off-canon, either. But there's a good kind of off-canon and a
bad kind. The good kind starts with
         canon, then poses a "what if." The BAD kind skips canon and
STARTS with "what if?"

         In other words: There's more than one way to get into the
swimming pool ... you can cannonball, you
         can belly-flop, or you can just slip in, but your high-dive's
not going to be very impressive if you don't
         use the *&%$ diving board!</P>

<P>        Here're some examples of what to do/what not to do, as I
define them:</P>
&nbsp
<hr width="25%" align="left">
&nbsp
         <P><b>THE FIC:</b> Band Aid</P>

       <P>  <b>MY MOTIVATION:</b> I had some interesting observations
about H.S. Band that I haven't seen reflected
         in the show.</P>

<P>        <b>WHAT TO DO:</b> Write Daria into band and see how she
reacts to it.</P>

<P>        <b>WHAT NOT TO DO:</b> Write myself into the band and call
myself Daria, because the show is all about
         ME. Become agitated and upset when the show doesn't reflect
my band experiences. Tell everyone
         about it.</P>

&nbsp
<hr width="25%" align="left">
&nbsp
         <P><b>THE FIC:</b> Anti-Tom</P>

         <P><b>MY MOTIVATION:</b> I don't like Tom. (I do, but let's
say for the sake of argument that I don't.)</P>

         <P><b>WHAT TO DO:</b> Find a reasonable explanation. Maybe
*I* never had a relationship, and I'd prefer to
         see Daria go through High School without one, just like I
did. I think the show should stick with
         aiming at an outcast audience, and according to my experience
(right or wrong) outcasts generally
         don't find a romantic relationship in high school. Glenn may
have made a mistake introducing him at
         this point. Maybe not. At least it's a question worth
debating. So I bring it up. But I decide that
         whatever happens, it's NOT worth distracting me to the point
where I can't enjoy all the wonderful
         qualitites of the show ... unless of course, Daria's stale
datelessness was the only thing keeping
         me watching. In that case, see ya.</P>

         <P><b>WHAT NOT TO DO:</b> Hate the show because Daria's life
doesn't mimic mine. Assume that because I
         don't like Tom, Daria shouldn't like Tom either. Daria hasn't
been given a reason not to like Tom.
         There must be something Tom's not telling us! He must be
HIDING something! He must be EVIL!
         Obsess. Manufacture evidence. Rewrite the show. Who's Glenn
Eichler?</P>

&nbsp
<hr width="25%" align="left">
&nbsp
         <P><b>THE FIC:</b> Diane Long's continuum. (apologies to Diane)</P>

         <P><b>THE MOTIVATION:</b> The show has chosen not to explore
this option, but I (Di) think that, given the
         well-established presence of warmth, trust, understanding and
even caring, it follows that there's
         POTENTIAL for a deeper relationship between Daria and Trent
... maybe even passion.</P>

         <P><b>WHAT TO DO:</b> Through a gradual process, show how
INHERENT qualities in these characters can
         be aligned. Introduce story elements that reveal conceivable
new directions for exploration. Set
         many of the fics in the future so I can apply my theories,
and I don't have to worry about nit-picking
         canon to death. And because I'm a bit of a romantic and it's fun.</P>

         <P><b>WHAT NOT TO DO:</b> Re-write the characters, ignoring
the show where necessary. Change their traits
         and alter the subtext to the point so quickly that they bear
no resemblance to their actual
         incarnations. Let it destroy my life when the show fails to
follow suit, pairing Daria with someone
         else.</P>

&nbsp
<hr width="25%" align="left">
&nbsp
       <P>  I mean, I HATE what they're doing with "Star Trek:
Voyager." But there are still elements of Trek that I
         enjoy. And while I may wonder what planet Rick Berman is
from, I don't go stomping around flinging
         accusations at Captain Janeway or Neelix. "It's only a TV
show!" as the great William Shatner once
         imparted. Your involvement as a fan is supposed to be fun! If
it stops being fun, DO SOMETHING
         ELSE!</P>

    <P>     In short, I've been getting real tired of all this
pointless "debating." It's a waste of my time. I know I
         don't have to read it if I don't want to, and I always have
the option of keeping my mouth shut. But it's
         been getting hard to avoid lately, and I couldn't help the
desire to vent my incredulity with an essay.</P>

      <P>   This is just my observation on the state of the fan
community in general. I don't expect anyone to
         conform to my views, nor am I attacking anyone personally. In
fact, I've seen a lot of evidence
         suggesting that as people start thinking about the situation,
they start becoming less recalcitrant.
         And I think that's good.</P>

<P>        Anyway, that's about all I have to say on the subject.
I've already wasted enough time thinking about
         it. Much as with C.E. Forman's retirement essay, it includes
some observations on the community
         that not everyone is going to like. I hope no one thinks I'm
being "mean" or "unfair" or "intolerant" or
         "preachy." I just think I see a problem, and I hope it gets fixed.</P>
