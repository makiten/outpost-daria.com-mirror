 <P>Rape fanfics, like it or not, are very much a part of the
"Daria" fanfic landscape.  They feature scenarios where a major
character (Our Heroine, Jane, or Quinn) has a traumatic experience
that forever changes her life.  While several fic authors have
recently criticized this genre as "cliche," the fact remains that
rape fanfics carry a potency, as seen in such excellent fics as
Martin Pollard's <b>"Sins of the Past"</b> and Michelle Klein-Hass's <b>"So
Turns the Wheel."</b>  Both of these were written some time ago, yet
both, especially "Sins," are mentioned frequently in discussion. </P>

  <P>Although the entire subject of rape fan fiction deserves
examination, I'm only going to cast a critical eye on one area: the
fanfics in which <b>Quinn</b> gets raped.  To me, those are the most
prominent and potent of the fics; the two mentioned above both
revolve around her.  Furthermore, just from general discussion I get
the sense people believe Quinn is on a collision course with such a
trauma. </P>

 <P>Yet what makes Quinn such a target of rape?  When I posed
this question to myself, the answer at first seemed glaringly
obvious.  "Duh, you engage in risky behavior, you lose!"  Quinn's
milk-them-and-dump -them treatment of guys at Lawndale seemed
destined to push a sensitive soul to the breaking point.  But when I
started to examine these assumptions, I felt rather disturbed by what
they implied. </P>

  <P>My assumptions were based on a still-viable notion that it's
a woman's fault if she gets raped.  That is, if she wears revealing
clothing, flirts, or treats men badly, she will eventually pay the
price through violence.  Fan fiction, too, seems to subscribe to this
notion  by often having Quinn's rapists be ex-admirers with wounded
egos, like Skylar Feldman or Jeffy.  For instance, in "Sins of the
Past," Skylar's anger that Quinn used him and tossed him aside drives
him to seek revenge. </P>

 <P>Yet does Quinn <i>really</i> deserve a portion of the blame for
being raped?  Could not a guy who's been treated shabbily have walked
away or gotten revenge on her through rumors?  In the case of Skylar:
did Quinn abuse him <i>that</i> badly when she revealed that she was
planning to dump him in "Pinch Sitter"?</P>

  <P>In fact, we have no strong evidence that Quinn has abused any
of her boyfriends.  We see that she likes to have control over them
(as shown by her treatment of Shawn and Robert in "The New Kid"), but
beyond learning that she drives and frequents bars, we really don't
know what she does on dates.  Yet more than once, fan fiction has
magnified Quinn's offenses toward the male students at Lawndale High,
producing dire consequences. </P>

  <P>That brings me back to the question: why Quinn?  Why not
Sandi, who has been pinpointed as a probable slut and a user?
Perhaps because people see Quinn as redeemable, whereas Sandi has,
until recently, been treated as someone of almost pure malevolence.
(Although Peter Guerin has given her a chance to redeem herself in
his fics.)  Through her traumatic experience with rape, Quinn learns
how damaging and empty her life as a popular person has been.  She
receives a chance to start anew. </P>

  <P>We can see examples of Quinn's newly-gained wisdom in fics
such as Michelle Klein-Hass's <b>"Mazel Tov"</b> and the C.E. Forman-Peter
Guerin collaboration, <b>"My Stupid Date With Destiny."</b>  In "Mazel
Tov,"
Quinn's life-changes following rape are profound; she's gone from
being shallow and self-centered to being a disciplined, serious
person with an interest in helping others.  "My Stupid Date With
Destiny" presents a less dramatic, but still profound change.
Although Quinn managed to avoid being raped by Beavis and Butthead
she tells Daria that that encounter, amongst others, has caused her
to rethink her life.  "I'm going to do my best to be the sister you
should have, instead of the rotten bitch I was."  In these cases and
more, fan fiction presents Quinn as emerging from rape a stronger
person. </P>

  <P>This assumption that she can redeem herself presents two
problems.  One: it implies that Quinn otherwise lacks the ability to
see theemptiness in her life.  Yet episodes scattered throughout
Seasons Two and Three reveal that Quinn does possess this capability.
In "Monster," she confesses that she finds the limits of her
popularity to be frustrating.  In "The Old and the Beautiful,"
Quinn's show of common sense and maturity causes the viewer to wonder
whether she's outgrown the Fashion Club. </P>

  <P>The second problem with the assumption that Quinn could
redeem herself after rape lies with the question of whether she
actually <i>could</i>.  What if, in fact, the opposite occurred?  For
instance, the Quinn we see now -- love her or hate her -- has a
definite zest for life; yet after rape, her inner spark could be
extinguished.  She might spend years depressed and suicidal, never
entirely able to rebuild her life.  Just as the trauma of rape might
transform Quinn into a competent person, it might just as easily
transform her into a shadow -- permanently. </P>

  <P>Now does that mean Quinn shouldn't face any consequences for
her behavior towards guys?  Of course she should, since everyone
deserves to be treated with respect.  But there are other ways to pay
the price than through physical violence.  For example, John Berry's
fic, <b>"My Quinn's Delayed Reaction,"</b> proves that a guy giving Quinn
the brush-off can be an extremely  effective way of making her
rethink her behavior.  Moreover, let's keep in mind that Quinn's not
even sixteen years old.  How many of us at sixteen felt secure enough
about our self-image to be nice to others? </P>

  <P>Quinn still has many years of maturing ahead [no offense to
all of you mature sixteen-year-olds out there : >], and all signs
point to her being able to attain maturity on her <i>own</i>, without a
traumatic event to spur her on.  The fact that many fan fiction
authors are growing tired of the entire rape genre, let alone of
fanfics where Quinn gets raped, is a positive sign.  Perhaps it's an
acknowledgment that in the three years "Daria" has been on the air,
Quinn has already matured tremendously.</P>
