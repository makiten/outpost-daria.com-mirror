<P> To date, she's made exactly two appearances on "Daria."   That's 
several appearances fewer than Andrea.  That's exactly the same 
number of appearances as Artie, the alien-obsessed weirdo, that obese 
woman who likes chocolate, and Brittany's little brother, Brian.  Yet 
Amy Barksdale has managed to capture fandom's imagination in a way 
that <i> no </i> other side character has. </P>

<P> The reason is clear: she's so much like Daria.  She spouts 
one-liners, speaks in flawless deadpan, wears glasses, and seems to 
maintain a cynical outlook on life.  But Amy is more than just 
another Daria -- she's <i> Superdaria </i>.  Not only does she 
possess all of these qualities, but she's also drop dead gorgeous <i> 
and </i> doin' pretty well for herself, judging from her car and her 
living room.  She's so ideal, fans have latched onto her as a sort of 
mentor-saint for Daria.  The line of reasoning goes: "Gee, if she's 
so similar to Daria, then she and Daria <i> must </i> be soulmates!" 
Therefore, fans look to Amy to smooth Daria's path through life by 
offering pearls of wisdom, and assume a closeness between them that 
may not exist.</P>

<P>Fanfiction is no exception.  I can't keep track of the number of 
fanfics I've read where Amy comes to town and completely ignores 
Helen (her own sister!), Jake, and Quinn in order to lavish attention 
on Daria.  Or else she adopts the Daria role and mocks her family in 
exactly the way Daria would -- thereby validating Daria's cynical 
point of view.  I've also read fanfics that assume Daria had a really 
strong bond with Amy when she was younger; so much so, that it was 
<i> Amy </i> who introduced Daria to the pleasures we associate with 
her today: pizza and "Sick Sad World."  I'll confess that even my 
fanfics have been guilty of tightening the bond between Our Heroine 
and her Famous Aunt.</P>

<P> But could it be that Amy's <i> not </i> destined to play the role 
of Daria's "savior"?  That we're reading too much into her 
appearances on the show?  The evidence below suggests that the answer 
to both questions is "yes." </P>


<P> I'll start by looking at segments that address the 
Amy-as-an-early-influence  myth. </P>

<P> <font color=blue> <b> 1) </font> </b> When Amy first arrives at 
the wedding in "I Don't": </P>

<P> QUINN:  Wow, who's <i> that </i>? </P>

<P> DARIA:  Aunt Amy?? </P>

<P> Right away, you get the sense that neither Morgendorffer has seen 
Amy in ages -- certainly if she has changed so much that they have 
trouble recognizing her.  This challenges the notion that Amy played 
an impacting role in Daria's early life.  And certainly the following 
example all but refutes it. </P>

<P> <font color=blue> <b> 2) </font> </b> When Amy and Daria are in 
the bathroom in "I Don't": </P>

<P> AMY:  Let's see, you're in college now, or something? </P>

<P> DARIA:  Still high school, unfortunately. </P>

<P> Here, Amy is <i> way </i> off when she guesses Daria's age -- not 
by one year, but by at least <i> three </i>.  For someone who 
supposedly cared so much about Daria when she was little (as fanfic 
contends), that seems awfully suspicious.  Wouldn't Amy have at least 
<i> tried </i> to keep track of Daria's age if she saw her as a 
little mentee?  For that matter, wouldn't Amy have stayed in touch 
with Daria over the years, rather than completely drop out of sight? 
</P>

<P> You could claim that by her question, Amy is assuming Daria to be 
a genius student who could soar through three grades into higher 
academia, but somehow I doubt it.  Most likely, Amy errs in her 
"guestimate" because she never bothered to learn Daria's age in the 
first place; before "I Don't," Daria never meant anything to her.</P>

<P> That leads into my look at segments that challenge not <i> only 
</i> the idea that Daria and Amy have grown chummy since "I Don't," 
but that Amy doesn't give a damn about anyone <i> except </i> 
Daria.</P>

<P> <font color=blue> <b> 3) </font> </b> In "Through a Lens Darkly," 
when Helen reads Amy's letter aloud, we hear that it has been 
addressed to her "Sis," and that it ends with "my love to all." 
Since Amy makes absolutely no reference to Daria in the letter, we 
can gather that Daria is meant to be one of the "all" -- lumped 
together with Quinn and Jake.   By giving Daria no distinguishing 
features, it's as if Amy's saying that she sees her as nothing more 
than a member of her sister's family. </P>

<P> If Amy still thinks of Daria in those terms, then that means 
their bond could not have been strengthened during the time between 
"I Don't" and "Through a Lens Darkly."  This notion receives more 
support from Daria and Amy's phone conversation. </P>

<P> <font color=blue> <b> 4) </font> </b> Throughout much of that 
scene, Daria seems quite ill-at-ease, as if she expects Amy to just 
blow her off.  Amy's joke ("What's your name again?") catches her 
almost completely off-guard -- unusual for our razor-sharp Heroine. 
And in the beginning, Amy assumes, by her "stroke" comment, that  the 
only reason Daria's called her is to report a problem with Helen. 
There are no shared references, no private jokes (except at Helen's 
expense), nothing to suggest that Amy and Daria have gotten to know 
each other better since the wedding.  Amy <i> does </i> call Daria 
her "favorite niece," but one wonders whether she wouldn't have said 
the same thing if Quinn had called.  (Probably not, but who knows...) 
</P>

<P> Actually, what is most interesting about these scenes is how much 
concern Amy shows for Helen.  <i> Twice </i> she makes comments about 
the amount of stress Helen puts herself under -- the "vacation" hint 
in the letter, the comment about her having a "stroke" to Daria.  And 
although the letter may have been a mischievous attempt to "get under 
[Helen's] skin," the fact that Amy cared enough to <i> write </i> to 
Helen suggests that she has a genuine relationship with her.  If Amy 
were as completely alienated from her family as many fanfics suggest, 
then the last thing she would want to do is spoil her vacation by 
thinking about them.  These scenes in "Through a Lens Darkly" were 
what inspired me to delve into the relationship between Helen and Amy 
in "The Tie That Chokes," "That Thing You Say," and "None in the 
Family." </P>


<P> Now, the evidence above is not meant to show that everything 
we've thought about Amy is a lie.  She clearly <i> does </i> have a 
fondness for Daria, and if they were to interact more, they probably 
would become chummy.  And by phoning Amy in "Through a Lens Darkly," 
Daria obviously trusted that her aunt understood her well enough to 
give relevant advice. </P>

<P> Moreover, fanfiction that portrays a close relationship between 
them shouldn't be scrapped just because we don't have a lot of 
information about Amy.  If we couldn't speculate in fanfic, then half 
of the works (and certainly all of the 'shipper fics!) would not 
exist.  My point in writing this essay was to remind people who see 
Amy as Daria's mentor-saint that the evidence on which they base 
their assumptions is <i> far </i> from rock-solid.  For all we know, 
the next time Amy shows up in a "Daria" episode, we might discover 
that she's actually quite different from Our Heroine. </P>

<P> One thing I'm willing to predict with certainty: Amy will <i> not 
</i> have seen Daria since the wedding.  That means that Amy will 
have never helped Daria recover from a baseball bat injury; they'll 
have never attended a great aunt's funeral together; Amy will have 
never pretended to be Daria's mother; they'll have never conspired to 
get past a bunch of old visitors at Grandma Barksdale's anniversary 
party; and Amy will have never helped try to save the universe from 
the evil Fashion forces. :-) </P>
