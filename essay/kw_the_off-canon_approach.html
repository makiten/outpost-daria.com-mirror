<hr width="50%"align=center>

<P>I'll start by telling you a secret: none of the Featured Authors at
Outpost Daria writes strictly on-canon.  That includes such noted "canon"
writers as C.E. Forman and Paperpusher.**</P>

<P><b>Michelle Klein-Hass and Diane Long:</b>  Both are "'shipper" fanfic
writers -- most of their work is set in the future, and takes a strong
position on the highly-ambiguous relationship between Daria and Trent.</P>

<P><b>John Takis:</b> Besides fanfics that are true to the "canon," he is a
writer of notable cross-overs ("X-Files," <i>A Christmas Carol</i>).</P>

<P><b>Martin Pollard:</b> He wrote about Quinn getting raped in a sober
tone utterly different from that of a typical "Daria" episode.</P>

<P><b>John  Berry:</b> His fanfics are true to the canon, yet have a tone
that is too wacky for "Daria."</P>

<P><b>Austin Covello:</b>  He made Stacy smart and dead <i>and</i> an
Evangelion Pilot, and also gave Quinn depth.</P>

<P><b>Jon Kilner:</b>  He generally stays true to the canon, but also has
used his fanfics to speculate, such as by imagining what Daria and Jane's
future will be like.</P>

<P><b>C.E. Forman:</b> He speculated that Sandi would pick on Daria and
that Jodie would crack under pressure, neither of which has happened and
may never happen.  He also speculated about Helen and Jake's past in
"Fireworks."</P>

<P><b>Paperpusher:</b>  He wrote alternate episodes to "Daria!" and
"Speedtrapped," doing more justice to hurricanes and learning to drive than
either of the real episodes.  He also ventured into writing a
cross-over/parody with "Hearts of Darkness."</P>

<P>And then there's <b>me</b>.  I write in the form of scripted episodes
that adhere to the "canon," yet have taken several small departures, also
based on speculation.  I fleshed out Helen's family history and got her in
touch with her artistic side.  (In a future fanfic, I'll also have her
suffer a nervous breakdown.)  I had Jane run for president, made Sandi
resentful toward her mother, got Jake to take parenting seriously, made
Daria an <i>eensy</i> bit more proactive and idealistic.  Oh, and the
biggest departures: I gave Quinn vision problems, made her president of the
Fashion Club, and suggested she might be smart.</P>

<P>The fact that none of us writes strictly on-canon is significant,
because too often it seems that fans think writing on-canon is the only
<i>true</i> measure of fanfiction greatness.  "Wow, your fanfic is
<i>just</i> like the show!" one typical compliment goes.  Yet is it really
so <i>great</i> to be able to write a fanfic that resembles an episode??
For that matter, what does "writing like an episode," or writing on-canon,
really <i>mean</i>?</P>

<P>From what I can gather, the strictest definition of on-canon writing is
that the fanfic must in no way veer from the conventions established in the
episodes, the <i>Diaries</i>, or the <i>Database</i>.  That means the
fanfic must be in script and it must have three Acts.  It also must have
Quinn acting shallow, Jake stupid, Helen domineering, Brittany vapid, Trent
lazy, Jane sardonic, and Daria cynical.</P>

<P>It must have Quinn always feeling embarrassed about Daria and referring
to her as her "cousin."  It must have Quinn and Sandi struggling for power
over the Fashion Club and always ending in a stalemate.  ("Gee, if Quinn's
so [fill in the blank], maybe <i>she</i> should be president of the Fashion
Club."  "Oh <i>no</i>, Sandi...")  It must have Daria blushing around
Trent, and him being clueless about her feelings.  It must have Jodie and
Mack lurking along the sidelines but not really factoring into the main
plot.  And it must have Daria and Jane mocking something,  more often than
not being justified.</P>

<P>Oodles of references to places or people cited in the
<i>Diaries/Database</i> never hurt, nor some scene-changing music.  And
most of all, <i>every</i> episode must be presented from Daria's point of
view, or risk seeming hopelessly off the mark.</P>

<P>At first glance, these conventions don't seem too strict.  But when you
examine them further, you realize that they don't allow you to focus on
other characters, to make predictions about what will happen to them
<i>or</i> to Daria.  They also don't encourage the introduction of
<i>new</i> main characters.  In other words, you cannot speculate, which is
the primary function of fanfiction.</P>

<hr width="10%"align=center>


<P>Yes, <I>fanfiction</I>.  Now I want you to take a deep breath and repeat
to yourselves: "We are not here to write episodes of the show."  Glenn and
Susie will not read our work (or, at least, not admit to it), which means
they are not going to swoop down on the Fanfiction Message Board one day
and declare that they have selected a Chosen One to be a new script writer.
Firstly, why would they select a perfect novice when they could have their
pick of seasoned veterans, many of whom they might have known for years in
the Biz??  Secondly, there are legal concerns -- MTV will not permit its
members to read unsolicited scripts.  How do I know?  C.E. Forman told me,
after he'd unsuccessfully tried to get his scripts looked at.  And I, too,
had no luck when I took the same course last summer.  (Well actually, my
package came back to me with a big "WHO??" on it, causing me to wonder
whether the MTV clowns even knew who Glenn Eichler <I>was</I>.)</P>

<P>Sorry if that sounded so harsh, but I really wanted to get the point
across.  What we are doing as fanfic writers <i>and</i> readers is
indulging in <b>wish fulfillment</b>.  Our favorite show only makes
thirteen episodes a season, each of which is a mere twenty-one minutes
long.  That means there can only be limited time devoted to important
subjects (like death in "The Misery Chick"), and only limited scenarios can
be played out.  <I>Plus</I>, "Daria"'s generally detached tone has
prevented it, thus far, from delving into serious subjects like rape or
suicide.  So, of course, we fans want to remedy this situation.  Why?
Because we <I>love</I> the characters.  We love Daria, Jane, Trent,
Stacy... and yes, some of us even love Quinn. ; >  So wonderfully have they
been sketched out on the show, we watch them knowing they can be more than
what they are onscreen.  Thus, we free them from the restraints of time, of
the episodes' light dialogue, and, in some cases, of the realistic
setting.</P>

<P>Writers have given the characters vibrant pasts and vibrant futures.
We've added characters, and sometimes <I>subtracted</I> them!, focused on
characters who've received scant attention on the show, and forced Daria
and company to face challenges that would never see the light of day on
MTV.  Most significantly, a good many fanfics have <i>upped</i> the
emotional octane of a Darian experience.  Meaning, they've had "Daria"
characters actually get upset to the point of tears and violence.  This
includes even the proclaimed "wacky" authors....</P>

<hr width="10%"align=center>


<P>I had the option of staying on-canon, and chose not to take it.  My
first fanfic, <b>"Rose-Colored Lenses,"</b> could be described as a typical
canon piece, for not only did it have three scripted Acts, but it also had
a light tone that hardly wavered, even during scenes of self-discovery.
Most significantly, it restored everything to status quo at the end: Quinn
chose poor vision and popularity over the chance to have a new identity
(although she <I>did</I> show greater interest in learning).</P>

</P>From there, I could have just focused on writing situation-based,
self-contained episodes that did not stray too far from the canon.  But the
more I thought about it, the more I realized that Quinn's struggle in
"Rose-Colored Lenses" opened the door for more exploration of her
character.  I could see if she was more Daria's sister than she or Daria
would ever admit; I could examine why she needed to be popular, what she
would do if her popularity were threatened, and whether she couldactually
<I>expand</I> herself enough to be popular <I>and</I> brainy.  To let that
opportunity go to waste would be foolish.  After <b>"The Tie That
Chokes,"</b> I felt the same way: I had not said all that I <I>could</I>
say about Helen, Amy, or the other members of the Barksdale family.  I
needed more episodes to show the changes in their relationship.  So even
though "Daria" has never been a show with strong continuity, I thought:
"Why not create a couple of story arcs that would <I>really</I> explore
this stuff?"  The "couple" of story arcs have since branched off into three
or four, creating the basis for <b>The Driven Wild Universe</b>.</P>

<P>I spoke earlier of fanfic being an exercise in wish fulfillment; The
Driven Wild Universe is no exception.  Specifically, it aims to satisfy
those who want <I>more</I> "Daria" episodes per season (I'm aiming to write
twenty-two, for a "full" season), longer episodes, and ones that correct
some unrealistic dynamics on the show.  By dynamics, I'm thinking
especially of the long-lasting stalemate between Quinn and Sandi.  Now I
just happen to believe that <I>nothing</I> in Real Life is static;
relationships and situations can change dramatically over the course of a
few months.  For Quinn and Sandi to never alter the face of their rivalry,
after a year-and-a-half, to <I>me</I>, seems unrealistic.  I also aim to
bring out dynamics that <I>could</I> exist on the show, but have yet to
take place -- like Helen's relationship with Amy, Quinn's rivalry with
Brittany (see "Cheered Down"), or Jodie's grudging bond with Sandi, which
we will see more of.  My belief is that even if none of these dynamics take
place on the show, they at least represent <I>realistic</I> possibilities
for the characters.</P>

<hr width="10%"align=center>


<P>Now that I've gotten that off my chest, let me emphasize that striving
to write on-canon is <i>not</i> a sin; I just think it's limiting.  It
really only allows for two possibilities: episodes where Daria and Jane
mock something stupid, and ones where an event occurs -- like a dance --
that usually result in Daria and Jane mocking something stupid.  There's
nothing inherently wrong with that -- who <I>wouldn't</I> want to read a
good fanfic in which Daria and Jane nuke a sacred cow?  But if <I>every</I>
work of fanfiction were like that, it would be very, very, very,
<I>very</I> boring.  Boring, and a sign of a serious blindspot on the part
of the community, that we can't recognize the characters' potential.
Sticking to fanfics that never veer off canon would force us to let the
characters stagnate, or even to turn them into parodies of themselves.  If
it's the characters who draw us to fanfiction writing in the first place,
is it really fair that we do that to them?</P>

<P>At the same time, a valid question to ask is where we draw the line with
interpreting characters.  How much can we speculate before our work is
labeled <b>"out of character"</b>?</P>

<P>It depends.  Some believe any fanfic that depicts a character behaving
differently from on the show is "out of character."  Like having Daria
become enraged and violent -- something which she has yet to do in the
actual episodes.  Authors like <b>Peter Guerin</b> have been slapped with
the dreaded label after placing their characters in wild situations (Sandi
attacking Daria with a baseball bat), or after suggesting they have
disturbing pasts (Daria getting molested).</P>

<P>In my opinion, the "out of character" label is risky and highly
subjective.  And too often, it hearkens back to the canon-centric mentality
that if it's not like the show, it's no good.  But that mentality ignores
the fact that there are only a handful of writers on the "Daria" staff, and
dozens upon dozens of <I>fanfic</I> writers.  That means more possible
interpretations of the characters will appear in fandom than on the T.V.
screen.  And <I>most</I> of these interpretations will be valid.  With
regard to Guerin's work: there may not be any concrete evidence that Daria
was molested as a child, but there are <I>some</I> clues in her withdrawn
behavior that suggest she might have been.  By that, I am not saying she
<I>was</I>; I'm merely saying that Guerin did not pull his interpretation
out of thin air.</P>

<P>Overall, my belief is that the best way to judge the validity of an
interpretation is to see whether it progresses logically from the
character's behavior on the show.  Meaning, if we see Daria acting enraged
in a fanfic, we should ask "how did she get this way?" -- instead of
shaking our heads at the writer's poor characterization.  Some of the very
best fanfics I've read have had the characters acting <I>logically</I>
different from how we see them on the show.  In Martin Pollard's <b>"Sins
of the Past,"</b> when Daria trashes her room and attacks Sandi, we know
it's because she's distressed about what happened to Quinn.  And in it's
own strange way, Daria's destructive behavior is a genuine show of love.</P>

<P>My rule of thumb is not full-proof, since -- once again -- we dozens of
fans will each have a different idea of what makes "logical progression."
But if you find someone's work falling a bit short, I'd advise you to keep
calm, and remember once again that we are <I>not</I> writing for the show.
No one from the "Daria" staff will punish us for being off the mark.</P>

<P>All in all, I see that off-canon writing is widespread and
widely-accepted in the "Daria" fanfic community, which is good.  However,
there also seems to be an underlying belief that even the best of off-canon
fics are not quite legitimate enough, that their writers have failed in
some way because their work is not "like the show."  That the ultimate
honor is to create a character or scenario that gets so widely-adopted it
becomes part of <I>fanfic</I> canon (which is another essay altogether).
Well off-canon writers ought to put these feelings to rest.  Multiple
interpretations of the characters and widespread scenarios are a sign of a
flourishing fanfic community.   And if most of you who read this already
feel that way -- great!  I just wanted to write this essay to encourage
those who felt discouraged.  So now, don't worry about making Daria a
lesbian or Trent a werewolf who pilots a starship.  Don't worry about your
interpretation becoming "de-legitimized" if  it doesn't come true on the
show.  We're not <I>supposed</I> to be psychic in fandom, though it would
be nice.  The more interpretations that surface, the more we will have to
talk about in between seasons. ; > </P>

<P><b><H2><center><font color=red>Afterword</b></H2></c></font></center></P>


<P>C.E. Forman wrote in his essay, <b>"Writing Where It Hurts,"</b>:
"Departures from the show's canon seem to be met with little tolerance."
If my words here seem to relate to his statement perhaps it's not so
suprising -- because with his blessing, I'm outing myself as his minor
co-conspirator on that essay.</P>

<P>The story: Three weeks prior to its posting, C.E. wrote to me and told
me that he had burnt-out on writing and reviewing fanfics, and was
dissatisfied with the amount of feedback he'd received for his latest fic
("Fireworks").  Since I was experiencing similar dissatisfaction with
feedback, and since we <I>both</I> knew of others who were, too, I
suggested he write a "reform" essay.  (Actually, I'd considered writing an
essay in that vein, but at the time, I was so swamped with thesis paper
writing, I would have had to put it off until late December.)  He thought
it was an excellent idea, so he wrote it, I beta-read it and made some
small suggestions, and he submitted it.  And the rest is history... </P>

<P>Sorry to have not said anything sooner.  C.E. expressed initial concern
that his essay would get flamed, and I don't think he wanted to drag anyone
down with him.  And <I>I</I> was concerned that I'd look like a
glory-seeker if I went on the MB's screaming, "Me, me!  I helped!"  But
confessing in an essay: oh, that's <I>much</I> different.  Ah well... ; >
</P>

<P>The point is: I, myself, am happy with the response that the essay has
stirred up.People have been giving other people more feedback, and I think
the most helpful avenue toward new fanfics has been a <b>link</b> on the
Message Boards.  I've been doing my best to read more and provide more
feedback as well.  I may not be able to read every link that gets posted on
the Message Boards, but I <I>am</I> willing to offer my services as a
beta-reader.  In fact, the best way to get me to read your fanfics would be
if you sent them to me over e-mail as an <b>attachment</b> (<I>not</I> as a
cut-and-paste document; that takes up too much space on my e-mail disk).
But eap! <I>please</I> don't send me your entire fanfic collection.  One
fanfic will suffice, and then you can refer me to others you've written.
And also, 'cause I'll be busy writing my own fanfics and essays, I may not
be able to return feedback right away.  But still, I'd like to do more.</P>

<P>Anyway, to wrap up: anything that promotes diverse writing and thinking
is <I>good</I>, so let's keep it up as best we can... ; > </P>

<P>** This list is only of active fanfic authors -- ones have produced
something within the last year, or could <I>still</I> produce something,
which is why I did not include <b>Katherine Goodman</b>.  Still, my theory
holds true: "Untitled 1" is off-canon, in that it portrays Jane sick with
leukemia. </P>
