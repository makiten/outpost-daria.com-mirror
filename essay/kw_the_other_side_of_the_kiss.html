<P><I>Daria</I> has been gone for nearly a year, and still we get 
wound up over the Tom Sloane Controversy.  His merits as a character, 
the way he and Daria got together, or whether his mere presence 
harmed key dynamics on the show.</P>

<P>One of the most recent discussions on <b>alt.tv.daria</b> 
concerned the infamous kiss in "Dye! Dye! My Darling."  I have always 
believed that Daria and Tom's attraction to each developed too 
quickly between "I Loathe a Parade" (406) and "Dye! Dye! My Darling" 
(413), making it seem as if they had barely begun liking each other 
before they were sticking their tongues down each others' throats. 
As a result, I could never fully accept that the attraction was 
natural, that it had grown organically instead of being pushed along 
by writers who wanted us to accept Tom Sloane as Daria's boyfriend. 
</P>

<P>Still, I had never wondered until that discussion whether the true 
reason I did not accept the pairing was because there was no 
attraction between Daria and Tom.  You read right: there was no 
mutual attraction between Daria and Tom.</P>

<P>To clarify, let me say I believe Tom was attracted to Daria as 
early as "I Loathe a Parade," if not sooner.  Also, that the show's 
writers and producers wanted us to believe things were heating up 
between them.  During the "Behind the Scenes" special that 
accompanied the Season Four premiere, one of the producers admitted 
that Daria would be in a "relationship."  Then when ILAP came along 
weeks later, the song they played at the end was "I Know There's 
Something Going On."  Nevertheless, Daria was not attracted to Tom, 
at least not until "Fire!" if even then.  She did not think of him as 
a potential boyfriend until after The Kiss.</P>

<P>Still, you might ask: if the writers believed there was a 
relationship, who are we to question them?  They were the ones who 
guided the show.  That may be, but that doesn't mean everything they 
sought to convey came across on screen.  Otherwise, there would have 
been no debate over Tom's merits as a boyfriend, and we would have 
seen Kevin and Brittany as worthy of the attention shoveled at them 
in Season Four.  Since what we see on screen is often so different, 
we can argue that a character displayed behavior that flies in the 
face of what the writers wanted.  In this case, I will argue that 
Daria never saw Tom as a love interest before "Is It Fall Yet?", and 
that themes from Season Four designed to help Daria instead made the 
situation worse.</P>
<br>
<P><b>Past "Romances"</b></P>

<P>By now, to say that Daria did not like sharing her feelings would 
be cliche.  No "I love you"'s passed this cynic's lips during the 
show's five-year run.  Even so, Daria left plenty of clues that 
showed her true feelings.  For instance, in "Too Cute," she put aside 
her animosity with Quinn and told her she looked "perfect" even 
without cosmetic treatment.  In "See Jane Run," she assured a 
remorseful Jane, "You came out of kindergarten knowing more than 
Kevin."  In "Daria!", she feared that her parents were worried about 
her, and in "Ill," she mumbled to them, "Thanks for being there for 
me," before leaving quickly.</p>

<P>Yet during the crucial episodes leading to DDMD, when Daria was 
supposedly feeling her first tingles of attraction to Tom Sloane, we 
saw nothing.  Nothing beyond friendship and good-natured camaraderie, 
that is.  One could argue that this time Daria had something to lose 
by showing she cared: her friendship with Jane.  She was so aware of 
the moral ramifications, she could not admit her crush to Jane or 
herself.  That explanation would make sense, had she not been in 
similar situations where her feelings posed a threat to her 
self-image and worldview, and was rather lesssuccessful at hiding her 
true feelings.</P>

<P>Liking Trent Lane, for instance, may not have jeopardized a 
friendship, but it was hardly a risk-free venture.  As Daria's first 
recorded crush, it put her in a position of vulnerability at a time 
when everything she said and did showed a need to maintain total 
control.  Outright rejection by the older, cooler Trent could have 
been as tough a blow for Season One Daria as losing Jane in Season 
Four; therefore, Daria did not seem especially keen to confess her 
feelings.  Jane and the audience still knew, though, because Daria 
could not help blushing around Trent, or losing track of her words 
around him, or secretly fantasizing about him, or doing stupid things 
in his presence.</P>

<P>In "The New Kid," Daria may not have had anything to lose from a 
relationship with Ted DeWitt-Clinton, but she still told anyone who 
would listen that she and Ted were not going out.  Even so, she 
betrayed her interest in Ted by reading up on Goya after learning he 
was a fan, and speaking of Ted in soft, sweet tones that by Episode 
207, we had rarely heard from her.  "He's just very honest and 
ethical and I shouldn't have been so mean," Daria lamented at one 
point.</P>

<P>Yet with Tom, there was nothing.  No behavior before "Dye! Dye! My 
Darling" to indicate that Daria's feelings toward him were not what 
she said they were: "Okay, I don't hate him so much anymore, but 
that's not exactly an affair to remember."  If The Kiss was supposed 
to show that Daria's true feelings could not be denied, why was there 
absolutely nothing beforehand?  Even if Daria denied everything to 
Jane, to <I>herself</I>, would she really have been able to suppress 
a blush?  A stray thought about Tom?  A slip of the tongue to a 
member of her family about "just something Tom said," prompting "Oh? 
Who's Tom?"  "Just some guy."  Even if Daria tried to fight against 
it, could she have concealed everything when she was so unsuccessful 
in the past? </P>
<br>
<P><b>"I Loathe a Parade" and the Episodes Pre-"Fire!"</b></P>

<P>When people point to signs of Daria and Tom's growing attraction, 
almost all of it seems either one-sided (Tom's attraction to Daria) 
or so ambiguous it borders on wistful thinking.  Take "I Loathe a 
Parade."  Daria at first showed overt hostility toward Tom, narrowing 
her eyes as she said his name.  Then little by little she lightened 
up, trading wisecracks with him as they dodged the parade goers.  But 
it was Tom who seemed to draw heavier, more innuendo-laced 
conclusions from their time together.  Watching a parade float go up 
in flames, Tom told Daria, "Thanks for getting lost in the moment 
with me."  Daria responded, "Um, you're welcome?", which was pretty 
much her reaction whenever Tom made any such statements.  In "Dye! 
Dye! My Darling," when Tom tried to draw some deeper meaning from 
their time at the parade, Dari cut him off and returned the 
conversation to Jane.  Given that their adventure at the parade took 
place mostly in real time, and that much of it was spent dodging 
people, looking for Tad Gupty, and getting stuck on parade floats, 
it's hard to think what meaningful things Daria and Tom could have 
talked about.  Tom tried to get Daria to "embrace the horror" and 
talked of Jane getting too caught up in her artwork, but otherwise 
nothing stood out.</P>

<P>Many have pointed to the end scene, when Tom looked back at a 
miserable Daria covered with paint, as a sign that Daria was falling 
in love with him and sad to see him go.  But then again, maybe it's 
because <I>Daria was all covered in paint and feeling icky</I>.  At 
my high school senior breakfast, I got beaned in the head with a 
quiche, tossed by some careless peer like the ones having the paint 
fight in ILAP.  Even though I knew it was an accident, I still felt 
rotten.  Daria also could have been sad to see Tom go... because she 
had had a nice time, and was sorry for the afternoon to end on this 
sour note.  In any case, this was not the moment where Daria's 
attraction to Tom was as plain as day.</P>

<P>One could argue that it started with ILAP, though, had we been 
given some sign that Daria was affected by the outing.  "Of Human 
Bonding" onward provided many occasions for Daria, alone in her room, 
to have a sudden thought about Young Thomas, or to finger some 
paint-covered piece of clothing that she had salvaged from the 
special day as a reminder.  Or, against her better judgement, to look 
up information on Fielding Prep the same way she consumed Goya in 
"The New Kid."  One of my fellow fans believes that Daria showed her 
attraction to Tom when she watched him wiggle his ass on the computer 
screen in "Psycho Therapy,"  but to me, that moment was too ambiguous 
to count.  In fact, it revealed nothing.  Daria watched Tom with the 
same voyeuristic pleasure/pain as she watched Jane floss her teeth 
and Trent scratch his butt.  "A little wider.  We can't see all your 
fillings," she told Jane.  For Trent: "Don't pick your nose, don't 
pick your nose."  For Tom: "Oh God, this is too painful."  When Daria 
watched Tom, there was no half smile or twinkle in her eye; she 
seemed genuinely embarrassed for him.</P>

<P>In "Mart of Darkness" and "Groped By an Angel," an unexpected 
blush on Daria's cheeks at the mention of Tom's name might have 
revealed that Jane's relationship was in far worse shape than she 
realized.  Still... nothing.</p>

<P>What is clear is that the events in "I Loathe a Parade" had an 
effect on Tom.  Next time they met on screen, in "Fire!," he acted 
almost ecstatic to see her.  "Hi, Daria!" he said, like a puppy happy 
to see its master.  Later, he sought Daria out to talk with her. 
Then in "Dye! Dye! My Darling," after a worried Daria called up Tom 
to ask about Jane, Tom complained about Jane and made the 
afore-mentioned references to the parade.  Whether or not Daria and 
Tom had shared anything, Tom believed they did.  If Tom were always 
so obvious in his attraction to Daria, it's no surprise that Jane 
would pick up on it.</P>

<P>A final argument could be made that Daria <I>did</I> blush and 
show signs of attraction to Tom, but all off screen because showing 
it would have taken too much time or have robbed the story arc of 
needed suspense.  Nonsense.  If we're supposed to accept that, then 
the writers did not do their jobs.  It's one thing to hint at Stacy 
or Helen's background without going into much depth, since they were 
supporting characters whose lives did not carry the show.  But 
Daria's supposed growing attraction to Tom presented <I>major</I> 
challenges to the current dynamics and to the future of the show 
itself.  It should have been front and center, not hidden away in 
some contrived attempt at "suspense."  I would prefer to think that 
the writers were clumsy, that they thought they had left enough hints 
in ILAP, than that they showed such poor judgement.</P>

<P>So what do we have?  Up until "Fire!", we know that Daria did not 
hate Tom.  She may have even liked him.  But anything more is based 
entirely on speculation.</P>
<br>
<P><b>"Fire!" and "Dye! Dye! My Darling"</b></P>

<P>Now let's look at "Fire!"  Jane learned that Daria had had off 
screen contact with Tom, leaving a message on his answering machine 
about an arthouse film which was to her and Tom's taste, but not 
Jane's ("Best nap I ever had.").  Jane became jealous, and displayed 
it by first acting edgy when Daria came over to her house, then by 
pulling Tom out of Penny's room after settling Daria in for the 
night.  In a later scene, Tom came into Penny's/Daria's room where 
Daria was reading and they had a long, enjoyable, intellectual 
discussion that caused both to lose track of time until Jane popped 
in on them.  Daria turned to watch them go with a thoughtful 
expression, perhaps showing interest in or fondness for Tom, or 
perhaps pleasure that she finally found an intellectual match.</P>

<P>Why couldn't it be a sign of budding friendship as much as 
attraction?  Daria at some point must have thought about having 
another friend, and knowing that someone close to her (friend's 
boyfriend) was an intellectual equal could have filled her with 
pleasure and relief.  Tom already had his "place," so she could talk 
with him without worrying about unpredictable results.  She did talk 
and laugh with him and have a good time, but she also did with Jodie 
in "Gifted."  Jodie and Daria even had their own ILAP-like adventures 
at Grove Hills Academy, and came away with a good laugh and renewed 
respect for one another.  Given that Jane was so possessive of Tom in 
the final episodes of Season Four, it is almost surprising that she 
was never more threatened by the idea of Daria having another 
friend.</P>

<P>In any case, Love Triangle convention demanded that Jane see Daria 
and Tom's rapport as an obvious sign that they had designs on one 
another.  Shortly after finding them in conversation, Jane began 
acting jealous of Daria for Tom's attention toward her and her 
supposed reciprocation (via the call on the answering machine).  I 
presume this was the only time Jane had heard of Daria initiating 
something with Tom, since this was the only example she brought up. 
Daria tried to assure Jane that his visit to Penny's room could have 
been for innocent reasons (Jane too busy with a whirring drill), but 
Jane seemed less concerned by what Daria and Tom had done than by 
what they <I>could</I> do.  She told Jodie (paraphrasing), "Then he 
and Daria spend all this time talking about all the stuff they've 
read," indicating that what really bothered her was that they were 
intellectual equals and therefore could be better suited for each 
other than she and Tom.  No sooner did Jane start acting jealous than 
Trent got involved, telling Daria (paraphrasing), "Guys can always 
tell when another guy is into someone."  Daria retorted, "I think I 
would know if Tom were <I>into</I> me, and he's not."  Trent: "Even 
so, nobody ever said you meant for it to happen."  Daria may have 
been mistaken about Tom's feelings toward her, but bottom line: it 
was <I>Tom's</I> feelings for Daria Trent picked up on, not hers for 
Tom.  Between Jane's assumptions and Trent's fatalism, the Tom 
situation came across as out of Daria's control, putting her in a 
position that she never wanted to be in.  That Daria could ever steer 
her own fate seemed irrelevant.</p>

<P>That brings us to The Kiss episode, "Dye! Dye! My Darling."  By 
the beginning, Jane's paranoia was such that she had gone from fuming 
over Daria's message on Tom's answering machine to thinking that 
Daria and Tom were making out behind her back!  "Come on!" Daria 
responded appropriately.  In spite of Daria's reasonable assertion in 
"Fire!" that she shouldn't be blamed for Jane's relationship woes, 
Jane seemed determined to force a confession out of Daria.  What 
followed was one of the chilliest conversations ever between the 
Partners in Crime:</P>
<br>
<P>JANE:  I thought, you know, maybe you were a little jealous of me 
and Tom and you felt like you had to... </P>

<P>DARIA:  What?!</P>

<P>JANE:  Just a teensy little bit, and it's okay. Believe me, I'm 
sure if I were in your position...</P>

<P>DARIA:  What position? What are you talking about? How can you 
accuse me of being jealous of you and Tom? </P>

<P>JANE:  Hey, are we doing the hair here or not? I just mean the way 
you're always... "accidentally" barging in on us and just "happening" 
to find yourself alone with him. I know you don't mean anything by 
it, so don't worry about it. </P>

<P>DARIA:  Don't worry about it?! You accuse me of having some kind 
of designs on your boyfriend and you tell me don't worry about it?</P>

<P>JANE:  Hair! (Daria yanks on her hair.) Ow! </P>

<P>DARIA:  Sorry.</P>

<P>JANE:  Maybe we'd better talk about this later.</P>

<P>DARIA:  There's nothing to talk about. You're delusional.</P>
<br>
<P>A fan once pointed out that in "Partner's Complaint," Daria and 
Jane talked as if they'd known each other for a month.  To me, that's 
how this conversation reads.  Jane ought to have realized that while 
Daria had been jealous of her before, her way of coping was to mope 
and act passive-aggressive, as in "See Jane Run" and "Jane's 
Addition."  Why would Jane suddenly think that Daria would put any 
attraction to Tom ahead of their friendship, when Daria had done 
nothing of the kind before?  What teenage soap operas was Jane 
watching?  It's as if Jane thought Daria had become someone else.</P>

<P>As for Daria's response to Jane's accusation, it was very strong. 
While fans might sift through ambiguous moments to find examples of 
Daria's attraction to Tom, there was nothing ambiguous here.  Daria 
was surprised, shocked, and angry.  She was completely up front with 
her feelings about Jane's accusation.  If anything, Jane seemed to be 
the one who avoided her feelings in the past two episodes -- dodging 
Daria in the school hallway in "Fire!", then coming up with the hair 
dyeing scheme instead of just telling her friend how she felt.</P>

<P>That brings us to The Kiss scene.  Parked out in front of the 
Morgendorffer house, Tom invited Daria into his car to discuss their 
"situation."  Shortly after Daria told him that he screwed up the one 
good friendship she'd ever had, Tom leaned over and kissed her. 
Immediately after, Daria did the: "Dammit!  Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!" 
Tom: "I liked it, too."  Daria: "That's not funny!"  A pause, and 
then this time, Daria and Tom leaned over at the same time to kiss 
each other for several more seconds.  Tom: "That was definitely not 
funny."  Daria: "I gotta go!"  And she left immediately, while Tom 
watched after her with a look that could have been fondness, but 
definitely wasn't shock or regret.</P>

<P>Yet Daria did kiss Tom voluntarily.  Could this have been 
certifiable proof that Jane wasn't wrong and Daria really was 
attracted to Tom all along, only she was in complete denial of it. 
Or...</P>

<P>When Tom kissed Daria the first time, it happened very fast.  No 
sooner did Daria realize what was happening than she was gripped with 
horror.  "I liked it to," Tom said, but in Daria's case, did she even 
have time to like it?  Tom knew he was going to kiss her, but for 
Daria it was completely unexpected.  It could be that the second time 
around, Daria kissed Tom because 1) she had never <I>really</I> been 
kissed by a guy before (Trent's peck included) and wanted to feel 
what it was like, and 2) she knew that having sinned with Tom once, 
there was no going back.  A third reason, a bit shakier, but 
possible, is that Daria was so stunned by the whole thing, she didn't 
even realize what she was doing when she went back for seconds.</P>

<P>Still, Daria going to kiss Tom did put her in the "blame" and 
"betrayal" category.  Jane now had a concrete reason to be upset with 
her.  At the same time, it still was not a positive indication that 
Daria was satisfying emotions repressed since ILAP.  For one thing, 
while Tom may have been pleased by the kiss, Daria did not express 
one bit of happiness.  Never at any time did she appear to savor the 
memory of her first real kiss, only to realize: "Oh my God, he was my 
best friend's boyfriend!"  Nope, from the time Daria left the car, 
through the rest of the episode, it was misery and more misery.  She 
was so acutely aware of her sin that she blurted it out to Jane 
almost at first opportunity.  From there, Daria continued to disavow 
wanting anything to do with Tom, even in a conversation with Helen 
when she made a rare confession of vulnerability.  A talk with her 
mother, a neutral party, would have been the perfect time for Daria 
to admit that maybe she kinda-sorta was interested in dating Tom, and 
had been since the parade, but oh, what a horrible thing to do to 
Jane.  But still, nothing.  Deep denial on Daria's part, or could 
this be how she genuinely felt?</P>

<P>The notion of Daria dating Tom did not even come up until Jane 
mentioned it.  Jane, as if trying to dictate the course of events the 
way Tom did when he told her they were about to break up, practically 
insisted that Daria and Tom go out, because "Tom and you makes more 
sense than Tom and me."  Quite odd: throughout their last scene 
together in DDMD, Daria just reacted to whatever Jane said, like 
someone experiencing a car crash.  <I>Jane</I> told Daria she could 
go ahead and date Tom.  <I>Jane</I> told Daria that she and Tom were 
well-suited for one another.  Jane told Daria that she was the lady 
and the tiger, as though Daria had secretly schemed for all this. 
When Daria asked about the status of their friendship, Jane informed 
her "We're the kind of friends who can't stand the sight of each 
other."  Jane dictated the terms.  Jane wouldn't listen to Daria. 
Jane wouldn't acknowledge that Daria might have been sincere when she 
said there would be no The Kiss, Part Two.  Have I mentioned that I 
don't like Jane very much in this episode?</P>

<P>Because of the way Jane laid it all on Daria, I have trouble 
believing that she was somehow granting Daria's secret wish to date 
Tom.  If anything, this came across as Jane's attempt to avoid any 
more terrible shock or pain.  She undoubtedly viewed The Kiss as a 
confirmation of the fears she'd had all along, whereas Daria might 
have viewed it quite differently.  The Kiss may very well have 
been... a kiss.  A fit of hormones and no more. Except now, Jane had 
announced that her friendship with Daria hung by a thread, that she 
not only "hated" Daria, but that she "[couldn't] stand the sight" of 
her.  So Daria found herself without the comfort of her Partner in 
Crime for the first time in three years.  As a poster on alt.tv.daria 
pointed out, once deprived of friendship, Daria could not do "alone" 
very well.  "See Jane Run" revealed her to be constantly moping and 
talking to herself, and Jane wasn't even upset with her for most of 
that time.  Jane's anger here, partially justified, sent Daria into 
an unprecedented dark place.</P>

<P>The final scene of DDMD showed Daria lying on her bed, staring at 
the ceiling in contemplation.  Only the ringing phone could snap her 
out of it, and the last lines of the episode were "Daria?  It's Tom." 
Duh-duh-duhhhhhh.</P>

<P>Now the thing is, we don't have a clue what transpired in that 
conversation.  Only two things are clear -- that several weeks later, 
Tom was Daria's "guy I'm dating" and that <I>Tom</I> initiated the 
conversation.  This might have been a simple consolation phone call, 
followed by a tough-luck get-together, and the real dating might not 
have begun until a few weeks later.  Jane, herself, might have called 
up Tom and pushed him to talk to Daria, much as she did in reverse 
when she and Daria last got together.  What definitely is not clear 
is whether Tom simply said, "Hey Daria, now that it's okay to date, 
do you want to?" followed by Daria's "Sure!"  Had Tom not initiated 
contact, Daria might have never spoken to him again.</P>

<P>So what <I>can</I> we surmise?  Daria and Tom did have an 
intellectual chemistry.  Daria seemed to enjoy kissing Tom that 
second time in the car.  Tom seemed to really like Daria, while Daria 
did not hate Tom.  Beyond that is nothing more than speculation. 
Certainly before The Kiss, there was no hard evidence that Daria had 
a secret thing for Tom.  It is not even clear that Daria had a thing 
for him <I>after</I> The Kiss, before "Is It Fall Yet?".  All that is 
clear is that she enjoyed it.  But otherwise, kissing Tom might have 
been the equivalent of a one-night stand.</P>

<P>That leads one to ask: if Daria did <I>not</I> have a thing for 
Tom before The Kiss, why else would she have gone out with him? 
Perhaps it was because she did not have Jane as her usual rock of 
support, whereas Tom liked her and wanted to spend time with her.  In 
her vulnerable position, she might have found that a great source of 
comfort.  Furthermore, Daria might have realized that she had a rare 
opportunity to experience a "normal life" through dating.  It was not 
often that guys sought her out, especially intelligent, funny guys 
like Tom.  Even if she and Jane made up, things between them might 
never be the same; why stay in the past when the future looked 
brighter?</P>

<P>These are viable explanations, but looking closely at Season Four, 
and taking into account Jane's, Tom's, and even Trent's behavior, 
another possibility arises.  Daria went out with Tom because she let 
herself be persuaded into thinking she was attracted to him all 
along.</P>
<br>
<P><b>Season Four: Give People a Chance</b></P>

<P>The notion that Daria could be talked into believing anything 
seems absurd.  The girl with the iron-clad beliefs who could spy 
bullshit a mile away?  Yet during Season Three and especially Season 
Four, this happened repeatedly.  Season Four was Daria's season of 
self-questioning and self-doubt, when she tried to see the world from 
other people's perspectives.</P>

<P>It began with "Partner's Complaint," where Daria criticized 
Jodie's hypocrisy for using her dad's name shortly after complaining 
that she wanted to succeed on her own merits.  Jodie fired back with, 
"Hey, our assignment was to get a loan, not save the world.... And if 
I happened to depart from your black-and-white world of ethics... and 
wandered into a gray area, then too bad. Maybe the first guy was a 
racist, maybe not. Maybe I was right. Maybe I overreacted. Hey, you 
wouldn't be working with me if you weren't fighting with Jane. Does 
that make you a racist?"  Obviously not used to hearing an 
intelligent opposing argument, Daria could not stay on offense, and 
instead reacted to Jodie for the rest of the conversation.  Jodie 
presented her behavior as something which could be viewed in many 
different ways, none of them necessarily The Right Way.  She outright 
stated that Daria's point of view was too narrow before finally 
leaving Daria alone to chew on this in her room.  Later, when Helen 
came to check on her, they had the following exchange:</P>
<br>
<P>DARIA:  Do you think I'm a rigid, unrealistic, unforgiving 
self-righteous jerk who can't hold on to a friend?</P>

<P>HELEN:  [Jodie] didn't say anything like that. </P>

<P>DARIA:  But, do you?</P>

<P>HELEN:  Daria, you have strong beliefs and you want to live by 
them. That's not a fault or a character flaw. It's admirable; it's 
what makes you who you are.</P>

<P>DARIA: Jodie didn't think so.</P>

<P>HELEN:  Jodie is a little more pragmatic than you are. She didn't 
appreciate being criticized for it.</P>

<P>DARIA:  I don't blame her. </P>

<P>HELEN:  And since she's pragmatic, she also knows that the fact 
that someone's having a bad day doesn't make them a bad person.</P>

<P>DARIA:  What about someone with a pattern of alienating people 
with her self-righteous pronouncements? </P>

<P>HELEN:  People aren't as easily alienated as you think, Daria. Ask 
Jane. She'll tell you.</P>
<br>
<P>Many aspects of this conversation set the tone for Season Four. 
Daria was tired of sticking to her moralistic point of view, and 
worried that it would cost her any future friends.  Helen 
complimented her conviction, but rather than add that Daria was right 
to criticize Jodie, she described Jodie as "more pragmatic."  By 
doing so, she followed Jodie's lead in painting people's points of 
view and behavior in shades of grey.  She also reminded Daria that 
even when people sin, others are not so rigid that they will hold it 
against them forever.  Daria seemed to take this conversation to 
heart, as shown by her failing to mention Jodie's namedropping in 
their economics presentation, and during the later exchange after 
class.  Jodie: "Listen, I shouldn't have bitten your head off either. 
I'm sorry about that."  Daria : "Don't worry about it. I was tired of 
that head anyway."</P>

<P>Thus began a whole new Daria approach to other people.  While 
there were still the traditional episodes like "Antisocial Climbers," 
where Daria and Jane stood back and criticized everyone around them, 
the majority of Season Four episodes consisted of Daria trying to see 
other peoples' points of view and work with them on their terms.</P>
<br>
<P><b>"A Tree Grows in Lawndale" -</b> Whereas Daria from Seasons One 
through Three might have criticized the town's foolish fixation on 
high school football, Season Four Daria tried to bolster Kevin's 
self-esteem, even though the method would not have directly resulted 
in him playing football again.</P>
<br>
<P><b>"The 'F' Word" -</b> This episode was not strictly about Daria, 
but it carried on the themeof other people's perspectives having more 
weight.  We got to see the trials of Kevin, Brittany, Jane, Jodie, 
and more.</P>
<br>
<P><b>"Of Human Bonding" -</b> Here, Daria took pity on her father 
and accompanied him on a business trip.  We got to see more from 
Jake's perspective and learned that Daria wished she could 
communicate with him better.  The episode climaxed with Daria giving 
in to Jake's pleas to go balloon riding with him, even though she 
knew it would be a bad idea.</P>
<br>
<P><b>"Psycho Therapy" -</b> At the end of this episode, Helen got 
upset and ran out of a therapy session.  Daria found her on the brink 
of tears, then reassured her that she was a good mother and human 
being.  Whether Daria believed her own words, we don't know. 
Certainly Daria from the earlier seasons, in a different setting, 
would have found much to criticize about Helen's uneven parenting 
methods.  In this episode, Daria seemed to acknowledge them, but act 
more accepting.</P>
<br>
<P><b>"Groped By An Angel" -</b> In an episode with a similar outcome 
to "Partner's Complaint" and "Psycho Therapy," Quinn started 
believing in guardian angels, while Daria found the idea foolish and 
narcissistic.  Helen then reminded her that there was nothing wrong 
with Quinn for believing differently, and that Daria ought to 
practice more tolerance.  When Daria found Quinn in tears after her 
angel "deserted" her, Daria did a turn-around and assured Quinn that 
it was okay for her to believe in guardian angels, that people should 
believe in "whatever makes them feel best."</P>
<br>
<P>That brings us to "Fire!" and "Dye! Dye! My Darling."  It is 
ironic that Give People a Chance, a mantra that was supposed to help 
Daria by expanding her horizons, may have led her to do something 
harmful to her friendship.  In the case of "Fire!" and DDMD, Daria 
gave Jane, Trent, and Tom the chance to convince her she felt 
something for Tom when she may not have.</P>

<P>We have already seen how Daria had trouble holding her own against 
opponents like Jodie, who were well-spoken and believed strongly in 
their own arguments.  Jane in the final two episodes of Season Four 
definitely fell into that category.  She insisted repeatedly that 
Daria had a thing for Tom, that Daria and Tom made sense together. 
This was followed by Trent, who insisted that "guys can always tell" 
when there is chemistry between two people.  Daria told him it was 
all horsepucky, but true to Season Four form, seemed to take his and 
Jane's comments to heart, so much so that she looked disturbed in the 
final scene.  Then came Tom, who by The Kiss scene was already 
treating Jane like someone from his past.  He stated emphatically, 
that he and Jane "went out for a while and got bored.  It happens all 
the time," before moving to kiss Daria.  Right after the first kiss, 
he assumed by Daria's reaction that she had enjoyed it as much as he. 
</P>

<P>Against three people confident of their own perspectives, two of 
whom were good friends, anyone would have a hard time.  Yet Daria in 
Season Four seemed especially vulnerable.  After questioning her 
beliefs in a number of episodes, Daria was in no position to 
confidently brush off their assumptions.  Instead, after the initial 
round of denial, she did the same as in other Season Four episodes: 
internalized other people's arguments, questioned her own values, and 
wound up agreeing with or at least appeasing those with whom she 
disagreed.  That would explain why Daria did not insist more strongly 
in the last scene of DDMD that she had <I>no</I> interest dating Tom 
and would not do so no matter what Jane thought.  "I thought we were 
going to talk about you!  At least I think that's what I thought," 
she told Jane weakly.  Yes, The Kiss alone was enough to shake Daria 
up and make her doubt herself, but had no one said anything about 
Daria liking Tom beforehand, she might have recovered more quickly. 
Instead, we had the scene at the end of DDMD where a confused and 
guilty Daria let Jane dictate what was what.</P>

<P>That does not mean Jane, Trent, and Tom were correct.  Jane may 
have been projecting her own impulsive tendencies when she accused 
Daria of swooping down on Tom.  After all, in "Jane's Addition," Jane 
and Tom had talked for barely two minutes before Jane agreed to ride 
with Tom in his car.  Soon after, Tom was Jane's boyfriend.  As for 
Tom, post after post has pointed out his numerous blindspots in 
Seasons Four and Five.  Among them, his inability to see Daria's 
lingering guilt over The Kiss and his presumption that Daria should 
turn down a scholarship because of its impure moralistic origin 
("Prize Fighters") when he, himself, was unwilling to turn down a 
legacy ride into Bromwell ("Is It College Yet?"). </P>
<br>
<P><b>Conclusion</b></P>
<br>
<P>To sum up: unlike with Trent and Ted, Daria displayed no overt 
signs of romantic interest in Tom prior to The Kiss, or even after 
The Kiss until "Is It Fall Yet?"  Tom, however, displayed more overt 
signs of interest in Daria from "I Loathe a Parade" onward.  Tom and 
Jane's relationship was in trouble, and when Tom mentioned Daria, 
Jane jumped to the conclusion that something romantic was going on 
between them, in spite of no strong evidence.  Daria denied it, but 
since she was learning to consider other people's perspectives, she 
was feeling less certain of her own point of view, and thus of her 
own motives.  She eventually began dating Tom in "Is It Fall Yet?", 
possibly because she did grow to like him, or because she needed 
companionship in Jane's absence, or because her experiences in Season 
Four made her just <I>believe</I> she liked Tom.  The fact remains, 
though, that she exhibited almost no interest in him as a romantic 
crush prior to The Kiss, which seems very strange even if you accept 
the theory that she was in total denial of her feelings.  At most, 
Daria showed a liking for Tom... but those few instances do not 
necessarily point to romance.  If they were supposed to, that risks 
the stereotype that men and women with common interests can never be 
<I>just</I> friends. </P>

<P>Daria continued to go out with Tom through Season Five.  She may 
have done so because she enjoyed his company, but another reason 
seemed to be self-blame.  A subtle message laid on her in "Is It Fall 
Yet?" was that if her relationship failed, it was <I>her</I> fault 
because she and Tom were oh-so compatible and only Daria's closed-in 
nature could botch things up.  But that's for a Daria the Bad Puppy 
essay sometime off in the future. </P>

<P>A part of Daria may have known, though, that she and Tom were not 
meant to be, because in Season Five their relationship never seemed 
to shift out of first gear.  In fact, by Episode 9, Daria and Tom's 
relationship seemed to be in as poor shape as Jane and Tom's was by 
Episode 9 of Season Four. </P>
