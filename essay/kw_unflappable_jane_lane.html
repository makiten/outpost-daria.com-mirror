<P>She's Daria's best friend. I can't remember an episode where she hasn't
appeared. And yet, I
feel as though I've never really met Jane Lane. </P>

<P>The thought first struck me as I was writing <b>"Outvoted,"</b> when I
found myself struggling with
how to portray Jane's reasons for running for president. Finally I chose to
portray her as
semi-vulnerable, wanting to prove to the student body that she was more
than what she seemed.
Yet I kept asking myself: "Would Jane <i>really</i> act that way? Does she
<i>really</i> have those kinds of
insecurities?" </P>

<P>Most of the time, we only see Jane in the role of "Daria's sidekick."
Whenever Daria makes a
cynical comment, Jane usually follows with one that's equally cynical, and
vice-versa. For
example, in <b>"This Year's Model"</b>:</P>

<P><b>DARIA</b>: Isn't modeling about dropping out of school to pursue a
career based solely on your
youth and your looks, both of which are declared over by age 25? </P>

<P><b>JANE</b>: And don't fashion people squander their lives <i>loudly</i>
worshiping all that is superficial and
meaningless while the planet keeps riding the roller coaster to hell? </P>

<P>Or <b>"The Old and the Beautiful"</b>:</P>

<P><b>DARIA</b>: They may be shallow, but that doesn't mean they should be
executed. </P>

<P><b>JANE</b>: Yes it does. </P>

<P><b>DARIA</b>: Very well, I'm sold. </P>

<P>Jane is Robin to Daria's Batman. She even aids Daria in the love
department, coupling her with
Trent when the opportunity arises. </P>

<P>At the same time, we get a lot of evidence that Jane is much more
tolerant and open-minded than
Daria. In <b>"See Jane Run,"</b> she's willing to try out for the track
team, not feeling, as Daria does,
that the mere act of participating in a sport is selling out. (Rather, it's
only after she's crossed
over the line of corruption, accepting a "by," that she feels she's done
wrong.) In <b>"Through a
Lens Darkly,"</b> Jane can't understand why Daria is so uptight about
admitting she's vain. "You're
not Mother Theresa," she says. Oftentimes, Jane's tolerance causes Daria to
open her eyes a little
wider and see the big picture -- that the world is not black and white.

<P>Yet in spite of this evidence, I still feel as though I don't really
know Jane. The reason, quite
simply, is that no episode yet has explored her flip side: her
vulnerability. At most, we've seen
that Jane is capable of making mistakes -- such as when she gets swayed
into accepting the "by"
in "See Jane Run." Her overall persona, however, is one of unflappability:
she's always calm,
assured, at peace with herself. She never succumbs to the pressure of
fretting about grades, as
do most high school students. (But, to be fair, neither do most of the
teens at LHS.) Jane is
someone we all wish to be like, and the ideal friend for a rigid person
like Daria. Yet, ironically,
while Daria is presented as someone who never likes to reveal her inner
feelings, <i>she</i> is
emotionally more accessible than Jane. </P>

<P>Those vulnerable feelings <i>must</i> exist, though, if we are to accept
Jane as a three-dimensional
character. And several works of fan fiction have done an excellent job
trying to "fill in the
blanks" of Jane's personality. In Michelle Klein-Hass's Lawndale, CT
Continuum, Jane comes
across as her usual light-hearted self, but also as someone with palpable
insecurities. She's not
ready for a committed relationship; she's vaguely jealous of Trent's
success in the music
industry; and she's unsure of what her future career will be (in <b>"Best
Served Cold,"</b> she drops
out of college to pursue a career in animation). Yet Jane tends to keep
these feelings inside, so
people rarely get a chance to acknowledge them. </P>

<P>Similarly, Jon Kilner presents Jane as light-hearted on the outside,
angst-ridden on the inside in
his fanfic, <b>"The Last Days of Solitude."</b> There, we see Jane
struggling to hide the fact that she's
deeply depressed, even suicidal. Daria's coming to Lawndale High (the story
chronicles the
events in <b>"Esteemers"</b> from Jane's point of view) represents the life
preserver Jane needs to stay
afloat. </P>

<P>Both of these works, in my opinion, show what a <i>real</i> -life Jane
might be like. Not always
carefree, not always secure. Now I just wish the writers on "Daria" would
follow suit by giving
us an episode or two in which we see that side of Jane. Coming into the
second half of Season
Three, I had high hopes for <b>"Jane's <i>Addiction</i>"</b> -- as I
assumed it was called at the time. What
better way to showcase Jane's insecurities than to have her be obsessed
with a guy? As many of
us know, obsession with another person says a lot about how we see
ourselves. Yet, of course,
the episode turned out to be <b>"Jane's <i>Addition</i>,"</b> in which Jane
forms a perfectly healthy
relationship with a guy who is nearly as unflappable as she. (Don't get me
wrong: I think Tom is
a cool character. But I question whether he has the sort of influence that
would allow Jane to
show her vulnerability.) </P>

<P>So at this point, I guess all I can do is wait until Season Four to
learn whether my portrayal of
Jane in "Outvoted" was correct. I <i>really</i> hope to find out, because
Jane has so much potential as a
character. She could conceivably have her <i>own</i> show (as she so often
hints during "Daria Day"
marathons). Until then, I and other fic authors will continue to "fill in
the blanks" of her
personality... </P>
