      </b>As all of you know, I am as big a fan of <i>Daria</i> as any one out there.&nbsp; However, there is something about the recently aired episode, <i>Just Add Water</i> (#312, aired in the U.S. on 11 August, 1999), that has me worried about the future of <i>Daria</i>.&nbsp; The thing that has me worried is the recent trend of recycling past ideas, including the near duplication of an entire episode.&nbsp; Mind you, it's not a large trend (the only other season three episode that this phenomenon jumps out at you is <i>The Old and the Beautiful</i>) and I'm sure that I can find something like this in nearly all season three episodes if I look hard enough. However, when something as blatant as <i>Just Add Water</i> occurs; there is a problem.</font>

      What is the point of all of this, you ask.<i> Just Add Water</i> in itself wasn't a terrible episode.&nbsp; Daria wasn't the central victim of the &#034;plot&#034; but that isn't a problem (<i>Daria Dance Party</i> proved that).&nbsp; There wasn't a whole lot of plot and most of the events didn't mesh together very well.&nbsp; This was balanced out by some of the laugh out loud moments.&nbsp; The problem is that it seemed to me (and I don't think I'm the only one) that <i>Just Add Water</i> was
      lifted wholesale from season two's <i>Fair Enough </i>(which itself was sort of a rehash of <i>The Daria Hunter</i>).&nbsp; The parallels are staggering; Miss Li makes participation in some school event mandatory; Mr. DeMartino goes more nuts than usual; the struggle for control of the fashion club is intensified and ... well you get the point.&nbsp; Even some very minor things like the ending that involved just Kevin and Brittany are too similar not to arouse suspicion.&nbsp;</font>

      Except for a few scenery changes, minor tweaks and new dialog, <i>Just Add Water</i> and <i>Fair Enough</i> are the same episode.&nbsp; With the few amount of episodes of <i>Daria</i> that are produced, it's a shame that an entire episode was more or less replicated.&nbsp; Dare I say it, but I would almost rather sit through stuff like <i>Depth Takes a Holiday</i>.&nbsp; At least it was a somewhat original idea.&nbsp; Or, if episodes must be redone, at least remake episodes better than <i>Fair
      Enough</i> which, by almost all accounts, was remarkably average.</font>

      In closing, here's to hoping that the next time this episode comes up as a possible idea for a &#034;new&#034; episode, someone with creative control promptly puts it in the trash... or has it rewritten.&nbsp;</font>
