<br>
<br>Attempting to discern the time frame of the series and/or individual episodes can be difficult because time references within the show are often contradictory.  This occurs for either trying to tell dates within the confines of the episode, or to place it into the wider world.
<br>
<br>Conventional dating for seasons 1-4 has each season roughly representing half a year.  Thus, Season 1 is the fall of Daria's sophomore year and Season 4 the spring of Daria's junior year.  The movie <em>Is It Fall Yet</em>? represents the summer between Daria's junior and senior year.  Because of some last season 1 dating issues, you could argue that Season 1 represents Sophomore year and summer (perhaps with a spring move to Lawndale) and Seasons 2 - 4 junior year (though that makes for a busy junior year).  Season 5 apparently mostly represents spring of Daria's senior year, though some episodes more logically would occur in the fall.  The movie <em>Is It College Yet? </em>probably overlaps most of Season 5 and covers most of senior year spring.  
<br>
<br>I have attempted to list time references shown or said in each episode.  The books and movies are included with the associated preceding season.  This list is not necessarily complete and corrections or additions welcome.

<br>
<br>Daria and Tom clearly had dates before Jodie's July 4 party in <EM>IIFY?</EM>, therefore the six-month anniversary should be prior to January 4, possibly as early as late November if the first date after <em>Dye, Dye My Darling </em>was in late May.  Alternatively, if we use Mike Yamiolkoski's suggestion that Quinn's comment, "Let's say we ignore the instance of sleazy backstabbing," to mean that the entire set of dates prior Daria and Tom's breakup in <EM>IIFY?</EM> is ignored, then the six month anniversary of dating after their make-up would be in February or March after they resumed dating at the end of summer and <EM>IIFY?</EM>.

<br>The lunchroom clock at Buzzdome says 12:10.
<br>The Buzzdome storyline works best if occurs before the tech stock bubble burst in fall 2000.
<br>Characters wear cold weather clothes outside.
<br>
<br><em>Fat Like Me</em>:
<br>Occurs over a long enough time for Sandi to heal a broken leg (at least 4 weeks), plus loose weight after.
<br>Wall calendar says May 12 in scene when Daria convinces Quinn to help Sandi.
<br>
<br><em>Camp Fear</em>:
<br>Five year reunion of Camp Grizzly.  If the actual 5 year date was the prior summer (during <EM>IIFY?</EM>), Daria would have been 12 at camp (makes most sense if episode occurs in fall), if the approaching summer (post I<EM>IICY?</EM>), Daria would have been 13 (makes most sense if episode occurs in spring).  Helen taking the book, <em>Animal Farm</em>, away from Daria could imply she was still 12 (based on the <EM>IIFY?</EM> conversation with Link that she liked to read George Orwell at that age).
<br>The garage was fairly clear in <em>The Lab Brat</em>, so most of the objects must have accumulated after that, including all the objects for the missed vacations.
<br>There is a Christmas tree in the garage when Helen and Jake are cleaning it.
<br>Jake mentions a Caribbean vacation they learned to SCUBA dive for and had to cancel, maybe it is the 'family island vacation' listed in Daria's excuses in <em>Daria Database</em>.
<br>Jake mentions that they didn't go on a camping trip; this must have been planned after <em>Teachings of Don Jake</em>.
<br>
<br><em>The Story of D</em>:
<br>Helen says to Rita that it's a new millennium.
<br>Daria tells Jane she can read the story next leap year.
<br>Story occurs over enough time for story to be rejected by Musings magazine.
<br>Sloane's clock still has same time as <EM>IIFY?</EM>
<br>
<br><em>Lucky Strike</em>:
<br>Ms. Li's clock says 11:52
<br>Daria teaches for at least 4 days
<br>
<br><em>Art Burn</em>:
<br>Jane mentions the movie <em>Waterworld</em> (1995).
<br>Trent tells Jane the workers are supposed to have something by 2:00.
<br>Jane tells Trent and workers she wants the gazebo done in 4 hours.
<br>The "Naming Gazebo".  For the story to be believable, the Lanes either lived at the house when Wind was born, or he is incredibly gullible.
<br>Tiffany alludes to the television show, <em>Sopranos</em> (first aired 1999).
<br>
<br><em>One J at a Time</em>:
<br>Helen suggests that they sue UNICEF right after Halloween, when they are flush with money.
<br>Joey has football practice, and the weather is warm enough to make Quinn worry.
<br>Daria says she attends all of Tom's luge races (an outdoor, winter sport).
<br>Quinn's phone conversation with Jamie lasts from 6:30 to 11:49.
<br>The dinner occurs on Sunday.
<br>
<br><em>Life in the Past Lane</em>:
<br>They go to the abandoned drive-in on a Friday night.
<br>When Upchuck appears stuck in the locked trunk, Ms. Li says the Singles Scientologists will be using the auditorium in less than an hour.
<br>
<br><em>Aunt Nauseam</em>:
<br>ATC motors case lasted 8 months.
<br>Eric will be "resting" for 28 days.
<br>Erin is 24.  Since she was 21 when she was married in season 2's <em>I Don't</em> ('spring' of Daria's sophomore year), this episode must occur after Erin and Brian's second wedding anniversary, and Erin's birthday must be soon after for her to be '3' years older.
<br>Rita arrives on Sunday
<br>Stacy and Tiffany can't return the dresses because it has been more than 2 weeks.
<br>Rita's first marriage was 6 months before Jake and Helens (therefore, roughly late December 1974 or early January 1975
<br>Amy lives within a couple hours drive of the Morgendorffers.
<br>Amy mentions Helen holding a grudge for 40 years.
<br>
<br><em>Prize Fighters</em>:
<br>Helen says a scholarship will look good at college application time.  Therefore, there still must be a lot of Daria's senior year left, if she hasn't started to send out applications.
<br>Upchuck starting a dot com company looks most impressive if before the fall 2000 tech stock decline.
<br>
<br><em>My Night at Daria's</em>:
<br>Daria's alarm clock goes from 10:30 to 4:07, when Tom wakes up at in her room.
<br>Daria and Tom agree to meet in his room on Saturday.
<br>He starts waiting in his room at 7:30 for the 8:00 date with Daria and continues to 9:00.
<br>
<br><em>Boxing Daria</em>:
<br>O'Neill tries to recruit Daria for freshman tours.  These commonly are at the end of the school year.
<br>Daria tells Quinn she remembers having a refrigerator box when Daria was 5 or 6.
<br>Morgendorffer clock says 7:00 when Daria and Helen talk.
<br>Quinn remembers she was 3 or 4
<br>Child Daria interviewed by a school counselor, so she is already in school, and knows how to read (shown reading <em>Black Beauty</em> after parent's fight).
<br>Daria asks if Helen and Jake had a big fight when she was 6.
<br>Helen says she was trying to resume full-time work and raise two daughters.
<br>Jane asks about the fight "eleven years ago", since Daria is 18, this would imply the incident occurred when she was 7.
<br>At 6 Daria decides she doesn't need to interact with other children.
<br>At 12 Daria tries Shakespearean insults
<br>At 15 Daria writes violent revenge fantasies to get attention
<br>
<br><em>Is it College Yet?</em>:
<br>Must occur over a fairly long period of time and overlap other Season 5 episodes.
<br>Opening scene has Daria and Jane discussing where they have applied for college.  At least in my day, students were doing this in late fall or just after the winter break.  Following scenes include more students discussing college applications.
<br>Helen reminds Jake that military school is a Morgendorffer family tradition (did Mad Dog go?).
<br>Stacy's birthday early in movie.
<br>Mr. O'Neill feels that Kevin already will be unable to graduate.
<br>Fifth anniversary of Ms. Barch's divorce.
<br>Before Daria's trip to visit colleges, she says "If I'm not back in Lawndale in four days, don't send anyone out looking for me."
<br>Kay complains about Tom's year-old shoes.
<br>Quinn starts work at Governor's Park while Daria is visiting colleges.
<br>Kay was a sophomore at Bromwell when she met Angier as a senior at a free Carpenter's concert.  This would likely have been in the early 1970s.
<br>Tom's interview at Bromwell lasts from 3:00 to 3:45, Daria's from 3:45 to 4:00.
<br>Sandi loses her voice after Quinn starts at Governor's Park.
<br>Prof Woods went to college with Angier.
<br>He recommends a 7:30 AM breakfast, says they can get to Boston by noon.
<br>Prof. Woods shows up at 8:00.
<br>They leave Bromwell at 9:30 and Kay expects to be in Boston by 1:00 and they arrive at 4:30.
<br>Quinn begins her FC sabbatical while Daria is away.
<br>When Kay suggests staying on an extra day, Daria reminds her that the admission's office won't be open on Saturday.
<br>Note tells Mr. O'Neill to go to the "Liquid Dinner" at 8:00.
<br>Brittany is reminded that football season is over.
<br>When Mack and Jodie are discussing getting into Vance, Turner and Crestmore, there is a plaque in the trophy display case behind them that says 'LHS 59'.
<br>Poster on wall in "Liquid Dinner" might be a Dale Earnhardt memorial (died Feb. 2001).
<br>Mack visits Andrew Landon at 8:00, and thanks him for "fitting me in before school".  The view outside Andrew's office window is of a major urban area with high-rise buildings.
<br>When Daria asks Jane about sending her portfolio to BFAC, it is too late for regular admission, but not for mid-year enrollment.
<br>Simultaneously, Kevin knows he won't graduate and asks Brittany if she will still be his babe.
<br>Poster on the wall of Lindy's apartment says "Cyber Doo 2001 Film and Multimedia".

<br>After Daria and Tom's final conversation, Helen asks Daria "How was the last day of school?"
<br>Jodie's party is between the last day of school and the graduation ceremony.
<br>Quinn quits Governor's Park after paying off her credit card bill, "And I mean, who works during the summer?"
<br>Sandi's voice returns by Jodie's party.
<br>Jane found out she got into BFAC on the day of Jodie's party.
<br>Demartino's eye is still bruised from Barch's punch at the graduation ceremony.
