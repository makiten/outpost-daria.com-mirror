<h1><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></h1>

<h1>The first “Daria” fanfic I ever wrote was woven around a song. “Nine-Eleven
and Counting” was, of course, about the terrorist attacks against America on
September 11, 2001, and how it affected the major characters of the Dariaverse.
As I wrote the story, a particular song kept going through my head—the Peter,
Paul, and Mary version of John Denver’s “Leaving on a Jet Plane,” played over
and over. (I can hear it inside my head now as I write this.) Certain lyrics
jumped out of that song and came to life, waving in my mind like a flag in the
wind, and I borrowed fragments of those lyrics and made them into chapter
titles for the story. “Nine-Eleven and Counting,” like every author’s first
story, is badly flawed, and I am fond of saying it will be revised one day—but
when it is, the chapter titles will stay. I cannot imagine the story now
without the song, or the song without the story.</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Since
then, I’ve written a few other “Daria” fanfics, and looking back I am surprised
at how many of them were influenced by particular songs or musical works. The
“Daria” show itself made extensive used of background music by alternative
bands, and some fans of the series find the DVD versions of the show sadly
lacking because the music tracks were removed for public distribution, for
royalty reasons. “Daria” and music are thus joined in my mind, and for whatever
interest this topic has among fanfic authors and readers, this essay on music
and writing is offered. It is hoped that the reader will forgive me if I ramble
a bit. Music is a separate language, and I was never very good with languages
other than English.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Sometimes
music forms only a small part of a “Daria” story, a background element to a
particular scene. I don’t recommend certain songs be played during every scene,
as some fanfic writers do, but when it’s appropriate I mention it. For example,
Daria Morgendorffer and her father Jake listen to Mozart’s “Eine Kleine
Nachtmusik” during a father-daughter dinner in “A Midsummer Nightmare’s Daria.”
I was looking for something that a hotel restaurant would play on a special evening,
and Mozart came to mind, as I was a fan of the movie <i>Amadeus. </i>Daria, I
thought, would appreciate classical music as well as alternative rock.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Another
scene in “A Midsummer Nightmare’s Daria” uses the Rolling Stones’ “Gimme
Shelter,” which is especially good for this tale as Daria is mentally and
emotionally changed by a supernatural force to become angrier and more
aggressive, the constraints on her behavior suddenly removed. People around her
thus need to seek shelter from her rage. The connection with the documentary
movie of the disastrous Altamont concert (“Gimme Shelter”) is echoed as well. I
thought about using “Sympathy for the Devil” in that scene, but “Gimme Shelter”
worked better.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>A
lyric from a Kid Rock song, “Fist of Rage,” arises in a scene between Daria and
Jane in “Nine-Eleven and Counting,” right before they discover news of the
attacks on New York and Washington, D.C. The lyric talks about the singer’s
negative view of the world and his struggle to get through it: “I see the future
and it’s looking grim / A lake of fire, looking like a long swim” described
exactly how I felt about life after 9/11, and I used it here to foreshadow what
was to come.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>In
the angst story, “Winter in Hell,” Sandi Griffin reveals that she once took
piano lessons until she dumped them in favor of running the Fashion Club. In a
piano shop in a shopping mall, she sits down and plays a selection of pieces
that I took from various piano CDs. Neil Young’s “Old Man” was reflective of
Sandi’s trouble with her father, who has abandoned her, and of Quinn
Morgendorffer’s relationship with the neurotic Jake. The Beatles’ song,
“Yesterday,” was similarly linked to events in the story, and Sarah McLachlan’s
“I Will Remember You” echoes Sandi’s fears that her best (and probably only)
friend, Quinn, will soon head for college and leave Sandi to an uncertain and
lonely future.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>The
short, humorous script “Quinnisqatsi” has a musical soundtrack from the movie
“Koyaanisqatsi,” though altered in a ludicrous way by Jeffy, Joey, and Jamie to
fit their home movie about their worship of Quinn. This was the only time I
recall using a song in a humorous way in a story, though you could easily read
the farce “Luuuv Story” to a selection of 1970s Barry White songs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>In
the alternate-history “Pause in the Air” series, Daria and Jane are gay. They
become lovers (as you would expect), but they then go so far as to get married
and have a baby. In a scene in “Shock and Aww,” the fifth in the series, Jane
hums the tune to Pat Benatar’s “We Belong,” a 1980s song that Jane would to
have heard as a child or seen on MTV as a music video. “We Belong” is actually
the theme song of the entire PitA series, and the lyrics reflect exactly what
goes on in their stories as they struggle with personal doubts and real-world
troubles in an effort to make their marriage and family work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>A
song’s title or lyrics can strike me as inspiration for a story title. “Click
Click Boom” (from Saliva’s song of the same name) worked nicely for an
alternate-history story in which Daria and Jane meet because they are both
camera bugs—which they are to a lesser extent in the regular Dariaverse. An
alternate-history story about Jane’s older sister, Penny Lane, was titled
“There Beneath the Blue Suburban Skies” after a line in the Beatles’ song,
“Penny Lane” (probably the source of Penny’s name).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Sometimes
a song serves as the inspiration for certain scenes in a story, but it is not
mentioned in the tale itself. “April Is the Cruelest Month” begins with Daria
and Jane driving through the Rocky Mountains, which are majestic enough in
themselves, but I wanted a particular feeling to go with this scene and found
it hard to write without something to help the emotional tone along. That
feeling was supplied by Loreena McKennitt’s “The Mystic’s Dream,” from <i>The
Mask and the Mirror.</i> This song perfect captures the eeriness of that
overcast day, the mountaintops wreathed in fog, reflecting a certain loneliness
of spirit and a pending meeting with destiny. I must have listened to “The Mystic’s
Dream” fifty times while writing the opening to the story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>AC/DC’s
“Shoot to Thrill” (From <i>Back in Black</i>) came to mind a great deal during
the writing of “Where No Light Breaks, Where No Sea Runs,” an angst nightmare
story in which Daria becomes a murderer. Many of the lyrics to “Shoot to
Thrill” evoke memories of the story in me, as the story now makes me think of
the song.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>An
incomplete story now posted on the “Lawndale Leftovers” website was helped
along in part by a song by Kid Rock. In this story, “Buried Alive,” Quinn
becomes trapped in her car under a tractor-trailer following a long
chain-reaction Interstate pileup. The scene in which the accident develops came
vividly to mind while listening to Kid Rock’s “F— Off” (deletion mine), because
the opening chords of that song have a harsh, screeching, metallic edge to
them, followed by a hard-driving rhythm that fit Quinn’s panicked and futile
efforts to steer clear of the crashes around her. If I finish the story one
day, I’ll probably rewrite the crash scene—but again keep it to the music of
Kid Rock.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>I’ve tried a couple of times to write lyrics without
music—rather, the lyrics are to music, but the music’s locked in my head and I
can’t write it down. Lyrics to unique songs appear in the stories “Go Ahead and
Dance” (actually the lyrics to a song Trent Lane is supposed to have written)
and “Meet the Fashion Club” (an alternate history in which Quinn and the
Fashion Club are a rock band).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>So,
music is sometimes a part of the stories I write, though I cannot predict when
or control how that happens. It’s one of those things that come to mind for
writers of any sort—you go with the flow and see where it takes you, hoping all
the while that it makes sense in the end for a good tale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
