style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Daria</i> fanfiction occasionally suggests that
Jane Lane has famous relatives, most often Lois Lane of Metropolis. In his
serial tale, "Shadow of a Cynic," Ranger Thorne does a very nice job with Jane
as a descendant of Margo Lane, paramour of The Shadow. Recently, however, new
information has come to light that hints that Jane has ancestors that only
authors of the wildest fiction could imagine--and, indeed, have.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The issue came to light when James
"CINCGREEN" Bowman posted a speculative essay on "The Daria Fandom Blog"
(http://dariafans.blogspot.com/), dated April 15, 2005, entitled: "Janes and
the More Amazing Lanes." In the essay, he examines possible connections between
the Lane family of Lawndale and Philip Jos&eacute; Farmer's Wold Newton family, a
genealogical chart Farmer developed that is quite famous in science-fiction,
fantasy, comics, and pulp-adventure fiction circles.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Generation of the Wold Newton
Family tree began with Farmer's assumption that many heroic (and a few villainous)
characters in fiction are genetically related, their common ancestry being a
small group of people who in December 1795 were riding in two horse-drawn coaches
near Wold Newton, Yorkshire, England, when a meteorite irradiated them and
altered their chromosomes. Their descendants allegedly include such worthies as
Doc Savage, Tarzan, Solomon Kane, Captain Blood, the Scarlet Pimpernel,
Sherlock Holmes, Wolf Larsen, Phileas Fogg, The Shadow, and James Bond. A good
starting point for exploration of the Wold Newton family's current state is its
Wikipedia.org entry at:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The original source material
is even better, if one has access to Farmer's seminal works on the subject: <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tarzan Alive</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life</i> (especially the latter). The
temptation to connect the Lawndale Lanes with the Lanes in the Wold Newton
family is almost overwhelming. James Bowman explores the topic in "Janes and the
More Amazing Lanes." Possible links between the Lane family of Lawndale and the
vast Wold Newton group were suggested by reading an essay about a Wold Newton
branch with the surname of Lane, described in detail online at:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Wold Newton family members,
according to various sources, tend to be highly intelligent and drawn to crime
fighting, though they often disobey the law if it interferes with their pursuit
of criminals. As Farmer states in his book on Doc Savage, the crime fighters are
more interested in gaining justice than in adhering to legalities. This
disregard for law can reach extremes: a few family members are notorious master
criminals. Many are adventurers and explorers, though not necessarily nomads;
they return to their respective home bases sooner or later. And many members,
primarily but not exclusively male, have great physical abilities and fighting
skills. A few had curious gold or yellow irises. The one thing they all had in
common was a complete lack of the ordinary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>James Bowman postulates that
Jane Lane's connection to the Wold Newton tree is through Lazarus Lane, her
great-great-grandfather through her father, Vincent (see the online articles
for details). Lazarus Lane was a Californian crime fighter of the Old West
known as "El Diablo." Jane's distant cousins, descendents of Lazarus Lane's two
brothers, include Barbara Gordon (Batgirl of Gotham City) and Lois Lane (of
Metropolis). She is also distantly related to Dr. Henry Jekyll (of Mr. Hyde
fame) and Hondo Lane, an Old West hero told of by Louis L'Amour. Anything is
possible!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Does black-haired, blue-eyed,
lanky Jane Lane measure up to Wold Newton standards? What unusual abilities
does she possess that set her apart from the crowd?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>She's exceptionally
intelligent, for one thing. Any high-school student who has more than a passing
knowledge of Pavlov, Goya, Joan of Arc, Jasper Johns, Van Gogh, <span
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>Toulouse</span>-Lautrec, Picasso, Warhol, Willem
de Kooning, Jackson Pollock, and chromosomes is not an intellectual lightweight.
Granted, she tells boyfriend Tom that she likes movies with exploding eyeballs
and doesn't get into "the cinema" ("Fire!"), but she also wants to see Russian
art films from the 1930s ("Monster") and deconstruct Croatian comedies ("The
Story of D"). Mentally, she's in a completely different galaxy from everyone
else at Lawndale High School, except Daria.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>A clever and witty
conversationalist, if on the sarcastic side, Jane dishes out pointed but
accurate social observations and is an inventive storyteller ("Pinch Sitter"
and "Legends of the Mall"). She speaks Spanish well enough to create "Spanglish"
neologisms like <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>que ironico</i> (<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Is It Fall Yet?</i>). However, she says she
isn't the sort who uses all the big words she knows, and claimed to not know
the meaning of one big word--verisimilitude--though she did pronounce it
correctly ("Monster" and "The F Word"). Smarts, she's got plenty of, and she
can hold her own intellectually even against the genius of Daria Morgendorffer.
Her native intelligence is backed up with a huge dose of mature wisdom. She
sees the world realistically and offers good (if sharp-edged) advice to others,
though it is rare for anyone but Daria to do as she suggests.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>It is noteworthy that at age
sixteen, and despite conflicts with her parents and siblings, Jane possessed a
strong sense of responsibility to keep her family intact. This may have been in
reaction to her parents' failure to do the same. When her parents asked her and
Trent to attend a family gathering that she knew ahead of time would have a
hostile atmosphere, she went anyway ("The Teachings of Don Jake"). She cared
for her oldest sister's children ("Pinch Sitter"), fed Trent when he camped out
for months in the backyard ("Lane Miserables"), </span><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>saved the house from being repossessed (<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Daria Diaries</i>), rebuilt the gazebo
with her own money ("Art Burn"), and possesses her parents' "Do Not
Resuscitate" orders (<i>The Daria Database</i>, "Under the Beds, Jane's &amp;
Trent's"). Her morale fiber was illustrated when she passed through a period of
guilt over wishing Tommy Sherman dead moments before his unexpected and actual
death ("The Misery Chick"), though she was also content to leave a hazardous
spill on a dance floor if only her annoying classmates would be harmed ("Daria
Dance Party").<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>In
short, Jane, not Trent, is the glue that keeps the family going when everyone else
has fled on their own self-indulgent wings. Her parents' gross irresponsibility
is well detailed in an earlier essay, "Jane and the Lanes: An Essay About the
Lane Family of Lawndale." In their favor, Vincent and Amanda Lane appear to
have saved enough money for Jane to attend college ("College Bored"), though
they could not be bothered to see her graduate from high school (<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Is It College Yet?</i>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>A strong sense of
self-preservation lies at Jane's core, despite the appearance she gives of
living on the wild side. Her decision to put off having sex until college
speaks well for her strong sense of self ("My Night with Daria"). Even when
partially intoxicated, she had the presence of mind to ward off the sexual advances
of a fellow art student (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Is It Fall Yet?</i>).
Jane describes herself as a survivor ("Speedtrapped"), likely for her ability
to cope with being abandoned by everyone else in her family but Trent--and with
Trent not being very helpful, either, because he is so unreliable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Jane's best-known talents are
in the sphere of fine arts. She is frequently shown to be a creative, original,
and multitalented artist skilled at sketching, painting, assembled and
hand-molded sculpture, computer multimedia, interior decoration, poster-making,
murals, photography, coats of arms, gluing pottery shards to walls, etc. She
took life drawing in her mid-teens, which is unusual and a sign of maturity. It
is my impression that most artists specialize and never become the Renaissance
Man (or Woman) that Jane is. While many of her works are caricatures or involve
offbeat subjects, she can forge masterworks with such skill as to profit
greatly from it ("Art Burn"), though her copies can be identified as such by
experts. She gained admission to a prestigious art school on the strength of
her own work (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Is It College Yet?</i>), so
copying the work of others is hardly her only calling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In the physical sphere, Jane
is an extremely fast runner with great endurance. She was briefly an
award-winning track star in high school ("See Jane Run"), and it appears no one
was ever able to beat her in competition. In her free time, she runs regularly
and appears to stay in good condition despite her eating habits (see below).
The only time she was shown actually fighting was when she cursed and pounded
on Tom Sloane with her fists after discovering his unfaithfulness ("Dye! Dye!
My Darling"). Surprise and Tom's unwillingness to fight back gave her the upper
hand, which was good because her fighting technique is sadly lacking. Her rage
burns off quickly so her common sense can take over, but she can carry a grudge
a long time. Good combat technique or no, she is not above offering to rip the
lungs out of those male classmates who annoy her (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>The Daria Diaries</i>); it is unlikely she ever carries out such threats,
however. She can dance well ("Life in the Past Lane"). She was also once in the
Girl Scouts and might recall survival skills from that period ("Antisocial
Climbers"). And, of course, she learned to drive long before Daria
Morgendorffer did, despite their similar ages ("Speedtrapped").<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Though she often dresses
predictably, Jane has a chameleon quality about her. It appears she can adopt
any look or disguise with ease, but she always maintains her basic persona ("See
Jane Run," "The F Word," and "Life in the Past Lane"). She will try new styles
and outfits if she thinks they will appeal to her boyfriend of the moment. Why
she pierced both ears three times each is unknown, but she seems to like the
look ("Dye! Dye! My Darling"); it is not known if she has any other piercings
or tattoos. Known to be forward with members of the opposite sex to whom she is
attracted, Jane wears bright red lipstick that is her trademark. Interestingly,
when she wants to be ignored, she is often successful, as if she can turn her
attractiveness on and off like a light switch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Jane is not perfect. Characterized
by her best friend as "snide, antisocial, and resentful," she nonetheless takes
little in life seriously, mocking convention at every turn. Her sarcasm
surfaces most sharply when confronted with pretension and fakery; her scorn is
applied directly and in heaping amounts, even to her best friend. She is anti-authoritarian
with a casual regard for rules and rule-enforcers (see incident in which she
was ticketed for crossing center line in "Speedtrapped"). Vandalism and other
criminal activities are possible if her artistic integrity is threatened ("Arts
'N Crass"). Jane does not socialize with her peers, for whom she has boundless
disdain, and she does not like to be around her self-absorbed family, except
for Trent ("Lane Miserables"). When possible, she and Daria separate themselves
from larger groups and go off on their own ("The Daria Hunter" and "Antisocial
Climbers"). Her loyalties lie only to her art, Daria, and Trent. She is fond
enough of Daria to forgive her friend for kissing Jane's then-boyfriend, Tom (<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Is It Fall Yet?</i>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Until Daria appeared, Jane
was content to be a lone wolf. By habit or nature, Jane is lazy and oversleeps;
her personal life is undisciplined and dominated by impulse, especially in
choosing boyfriends and art projects. Her bedroom, which doubles as an art
studio, is a mess. Her dating relationships are a bit of a mess, too. Though
criticized by Daria for cutting back on their time together in order to go on
dates, this is a necessary evil for anyone looking for a partner, as Daria
discovered later with Tom ("Boxing Daria"). The heart of Jane's dating problems
is paradoxically one of her greatest strengths: her refusal to compromise her
identity. She won't give up important parts of herself or her world to make a
dating relationship work; a potential boyfriend must take her just as she is,
and must measure up to certain standards. She dumped "Bobby Bighead" for being
a clumsy kisser ("The Invitation"), Evan for telling her to dump Daria as a
friend ("See Jane Run"), Tom for being unfaithful ("Fire!" and "Dye! Dye! My
Darling"), and Nathan for being too self-absorbed ("Life in the Past Lane"). Jane's
sexual chameleon quality, noted earlier, never changes her true identity. She
can go into a laundry room with Bobby, become a track star for Evan, try to dye
her hair for Tom, and dress and dance retro for Nathan, and she can even dress
in popular styles and try out for cheerleading practice ("The F Word"), but she's
always and forever Jane, heart and soul.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Anyone who fails to deal with
this also fails to get her, a prime example being Tom, who didn't like her
running off to take photos ("I Loathe a Parade") or her tastes in movies ("Fire!");
he accidentally ate gummy bears for one of her art projects and had to replace them
("Mart of Darkness"). In the end, though, Tom knew what Jane was about, telling
her, "You're smart and you're funny, you have a great attitude, you do
everything on your own terms. You're, like, from a cooler world" ("Dye! Dye! My
Darling"). These virtues were not enough for him to maintain interest in her,
though.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Perhaps Jane's most serious
personal issue is a fear of abandonment. Her accurate fears that boyfriend Tom
was becoming interested in Daria caused her to become so jealous and paranoid,
she felt she was no longer acting like herself ("I Loathe a Parade," "Fire!"
and "Dye! Dye! My Darling"). Her response to her mother's butterfly quote spoke
volumes for her feelings about having her parents run off on her (Amanda: "</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>You know, if you try to hold
a butterfly tightly in your hand, it will die. You have to let it go. And if it
comes back, it is truly yours, but if doesn't, it never really was." Jane: "How
about if you tear off its precious little wings?" --from </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Lane Miserables"). She prefers to be the dumper, not
the one dumped, as it gives her control over a part of her life she once had no
control over: being left behind by someone with whom she is in a close
relationship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Despite Jane's obvious intelligence
(and despite her claims that she does not do well with grades), she deliberately
underachieves in school, maintaining a C average to hide the extent of her
knowledge and stay off the radar of others--or perhaps because she is too lazy
to apply herself to tasks she thinks are of little worth ("Esteemsters," "Gifted,"
"It Happened One Nut," and "Prize Fighters"). Her math skills appear to be worse
than Daria's, as she is in a separate math class ("See Jane Run" and "Gifted").
Jane sings poorly and apparently does not write music ("Jane's Addition"). Her
appetite for junk food (or any kind of food) is boundless. Curiously, though
she once claimed she liked having low self-esteem because it made her feel
special ("Esteemsters"), she has a very strong sense of who she is and what she's
about, as noted above.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Could Jane be a hero in the
making? It is telling that she volunteers the services of herself and Daria in
accompanying Mr. DeMartino into a blizzard ("Antisocial Climbers"). However, this
seems to have occurred in part because they were sick of being around their
fellows. She has all the self-confidence and courage a hero could ask for. She
lacks only the sustained motivation to maintain an aggressive heroic life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The prognosis for further
development, however, is very good. Jane's laziness may have begun to wane by
the time she graduated high school. Under Daria's continued prodding, Jane made
an extra effort to get into the Boston Fine Arts College and succeeded, in spite
of her pessimism (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Is It College Yet?</i>).
She also appears to have completely gotten over the triangle/betrayal problem
with Daria and Tom, though she never appears close to Tom in any scenes after
the breakup.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Jane Lane is far out of the
ordinary. She has not yet established herself as a mythic character on the
level of some of her ancestors and relatives in the Wold Newton family, but it
would not be difficult to see that come about in fanfic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Of course, it is possible
Jane's connection to the Wold Newton group lies not through her father, but
through a lover of her mother's. Her notorious comment to Ms. Morris about her
family's genetics (</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt'>"We share certain chromosome pairs. Beyond that, I'm not supposed to
say." -- from "See Jane Run") implies she might be at best a half-sister to her
other siblings. Did Amanda Lane have an affair with one of the present-day
descendants of the Wold Newton family? Only your local fanfic author knows for
sure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
