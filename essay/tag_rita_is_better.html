<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Once upon
a time, there were three sisters named Helen, Rita, and Amy Barksdale. They
never got along, but when they appeared on the “Daria” show, Helen Morgendorffer
and Amy Barksdale became popular and developed major followings in fanfic—but
Rita Barksdale never did. Rita isn’t absent from <i>Daria</i> fanfic, but her
appearances generally do not put her in a good light.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This is
curious because, when you compare Rita’s behavior to that of her two siblings,
Rita is nearly angelic. Helen attacks Rita viciously at every opportunity,
dredging up her cherished belief that their mother favors Rita at every turn
and gives Rita financial support that Rita doesn’t deserve. Helen’s oldest
daughter, Daria, hates Rita’s daughter and calls her “my idiot cousin” (“Aunt
Nauseum”). Amy doesn’t care much for Rita or Erin (or Helen) either, calling
Daria “my favorite niece” (“Through a Lens Darkly”) and ignoring Quinn and
Erin.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>And do
you know what the damnable thing about that is? At no point is Rita shown to do
anything seriously wrong. Nothing! She’s not a tenth the first-class bitch
Helen is, or the first-class sarcastic smart mouth Amy is. I submit that Rita
Barksdale (or Chambers, or whatever her name is now) deserves a better break
from “Daria” fans and fanfic authors.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Let’s
examine the evidence. First, watch the second-season “Daria” episode, “I
Don’t,” or else go to Outpost Daria (www.outpost-daria.com) and download the complete
script. This is the first episode in which Rita appears (one of three episodes
in which she is even mentioned). Study the dialog and action in this episode.
Does Rita say or do anything bad to Helen? Does Helen say or do anything bad to
Rita?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Rita is
in a good mood when she first appears. She is happy that her only child is
getting married. Helen, however, is obsessed with an old sibling fight over who
was loved and favored most by their parents, a circumstance of which Rita had
no control. Throughout the episode, Helen constantly harps about Rita getting
this or that from Mother, and after a while it gets on your nerves (while still
being funny, true). Perhaps it is no wonder that Helen married Jake
Morgendorffer, who always complains bitterly about his father. Likes do attract
in marriage.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Look at
the start of the scene in “I Don’t” in which Amy appears. (Remember that this
is the popular aunt, Amy, who has been gone from her nieces’ lives so long that
Daria and Quinn don’t recognize her without some uncertainty.) When Rita greets
Helen, she tells her sister that her daughters look lovely. What a nice thing
to say! And what does Rita get in return? Helen, Amy, Daria, and Quinn all join
in poking fun at Rita’s line of former boyfriends, including poor Roger the
skydiver, who fell onto a cow. (I’m not taking that personally as another
Roger, you understand—I’m just pointing it out.)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Carefully
review what happens in the scene after the wedding ceremony, when the big fight
breaks out. How does the fight start? Helen is drunk and abusive, complaining
to one and all in a loud voice about her perception that Rita is unfairly the
favored one in the family. Helen also appears upset that Rita is physically
attractive. Rita is placed on the defensive but is still being nice. Then, Amy
comes over and brings up the MG vs. Dodge Dart issue (showing that their father
favored Rita as well), and things melt down. In an amazing turn of events,
Rita’s own daughter Erin tells her that Rita’s “pathetic boyfriend” is making a
scene. When Rita’s new son-in-law comes over and makes a really crass remark
(“No cat fights!”) to the sisters, Rita blows her cool and says the one cruel
thing she says in the entire episode, calling Brian a “prehistoric imbecile”
and telling him to shut up. He deserved that, especially considering later
events.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>At the
end of the episode, which sister is the first to tell the other sister that she
is loved? Rita. Rita told Helen that she <i>loved</i> her! Rita just wants to
get along.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>At the
start of the fifth season episode, “The Story of D,” a phone conversation
between Rita and Helen reveals that Brian gave Erin herpes before they were
married. Erin did not believe anyone else would want her as a result, so that
is why she married him—she didn’t love him. What a prehistoric imbecile! No
wonder Rita is pissed at Brian! It might have been better if Rita had kept this
information to herself, but Helen certainly should have shut up about it, too,
instead of telling the entire Fashion Club about it by accident. As a side
note, it is interesting that Rita and Quinn seem to know each other quite well,
as they pick up the chat about Erin’s marital woes on the spot. Quinn seems to
think Erin should dump Brian because he’s short, but we’ll let that go.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Now, on
to the only other episode in which Rita actually appears, “Aunt Nauseum.” Rita
calls Helen to ask for her help in overseeing Erin’s (well-deserved) divorce
from Brian. Helen reluctantly agrees to help but continues to jam in the knife
and twist it, remarking to her two daughters, “I could <i>kill</i> that sister
of mine!” Rita appears at Helen’s house instead of Erin, and true, Rita does
ask if she could stay a few days while her home is being painted, so she does
seem to expect help above and beyond the usual.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>If I had
to pick out Rita’s biggest flaw, she does have a remarkable sense of
entitlement, as Mike Yamiolkoski points out in his thumbnail description of her
at Daria Online. Kara Wild and others have pointed this out to me as well. This
makes sense if Rita’s been the parental favorite for years. However—and this
really freaks me out—no one disabuses Rita of this notion in practice, no
matter what they say otherwise. Helen complains mightily about Rita getting
preferential treatment, but then gives Rita the same preferential treatment in
acting as Erin’s attorney! Why didn’t Helen just say no? Helen obviously feeds
into this must-help-Rita notion herself, so why is she complaining? No wonder
Rita expects people will do as she asks: They always do!</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>However,
Rita’s venom in this episode, as in the others, is directed against her
son-in-law, who (in addition to his other scummy actions) got Erin to sign a
pre-nup, giving him access to half everything Erin owns if they divorce. Brian
is Rita’s Enemy Number One, and he earned that spot. Helen’s venom is directed
against Rita and their mother, but their mother isn’t there, so Rita absorbs
the full blast. Helen attacks Rita for not having a job, for getting money from
their mother for her weddings, and so on. After much abuse, Rita finally hits
back and nails Helen as a workaholic. This was hardly a severe statement, as
everyone already knows this; Jake and Daria have thrown it at Helen for years.
Helen points out that she’s been working for Rita all this time on the divorce
settlement for Erin, but Helen wasn’t forced into that. She chose to do it (and
give Rita preferential treatment), so Helen’s abuse of Rita thereafter is very
bad form, not respectful or mannerly at all. She should be ashamed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Curiously,
Rita several times during the episode offers to withdraw from Helen’s life or
not bother Helen with the divorce problem, detecting Helen’s antipathy toward
her, but Helen hangs on and wants to keep things going—perhaps because she is
not yet finished abusing Rita. Even when making cookies as a way to heal their
troubles, Helen is on the attack, essentially calling Rita lazy and stupid
because of the way in which Rita cuts cookie dough. Seriously, now! “Let's bury
the hatchet and, um, bake some cookies,” Helen says—not adding that the hatchet
will be buried in Rita’s back. Rita surely knows she will never have Helen’s
approval over any issue. She will never do anything right in Helen’s eyes, and
this knowledge clearly eats at her. Daria and Quinn do not see their mother Helen
as being the instigator of the troubles, preferring to blame both of them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In the
final Helen-Rita-Amy meltdown, Rita reveals that she has always been jealous of
Helen’s intelligence, drive, and ability. She has lived in the shadow of
Helen’s many achievements since childhood. Rita thinks Amy abdicated family
responsibility, but Helen thinks so, too, and Amy doesn’t deny it. Rita denies
to both sisters that she was their mother’s favorite—an odd thing to say. One
wonders if perhaps she believes this is true, that she is favored just as much
as the others. More likely, she denies it because she knows that she <i>is</i>
the favored one and always has been, and this parental screw-up has created
such a horrible mess she can barely face its consequences. Rita snaps that if
either of her sisters had a closer relationship with their mother, they would
be favored as well. Here, she is guilty of wishful thinking at the very worst,
but she is not being malign. Maybe she really believes this, not being able (or
not wanting) to see that her parents did a great evil to the family, or hoping
that Mother will somehow reverse the mess if Helen and Amy approach her in a
well-meaning way.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>What do I
think? I think Rita is screwed. She can’t win. Her parents likely treated her
like a princess and destroyed all family cohesion. You see the echoes of it in
the way Daria and Quinn can’t get along, in the way Daria hates her cousin
Erin, and in the way Amy calls Daria her favorite niece. It probably has
something to do, too, with why Rita and Erin never find good men.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Other
fans of <i>Daria</i> have pointed out to me that Rita is shown as being
self-absorbed or taken up completely in her own issues. Look at the evidence
again. The only three times we see or hear from Rita, she is involved in major
issues revolving around her daughter, her only child and likely the only person
with whom Rita has a (mostly) stable relationship besides her mother. We see
Rita when Erin is getting married, when Erin is having severe marital problems,
and when Erin is getting divorced. These are big problems, and I’m not
surprised that Rita is involved in them. We have no idea if there were other
times when Rita just called Helen to chat and see what was up, if Rita sends
her sisters and family members Christmas presents, if Rita works at a homeless
shelter or other charity, etc. We’re given only the episodes in which Rita is
experiencing crises that demand her attention as a good mother. Helen has done
the same, right? Is Helen being self-absorbed when she tries to help Daria or
Quinn? Ah, I thought not.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It is
interesting to think that Rita deliberately avoided the whole problem of
parental preference by having only one child, so that would never be an issue.
Maybe in this sense she was wiser than her mother, though to her credit Helen
managed to raise two girls and give them both sufficient amounts of parental
love. Amy just avoided the whole problem by having no kids at all.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Perhaps
we should pity Rita instead of hating her. We signed off on what Helen and
Daria have been saying without examining the bill of goods.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If Rita spent all her youth as a pampered
child, she has grown up to be a helpless adult, and it has crippled her. She is
divorced (at least twice) and lives alone, picks lousy boyfriends, can’t hold a
job, can’t make ends meet financially without her mother sending her cash, has
to beg Helen for help when her daughter’s marriage goes on the rocks, etc. She
is totally dependent on other people to get things done in her life. She knows
as a result her two sisters hate her, no matter what she does. “I should be
punished forever because I made a few bad decisions,” she tells Helen with
sarcasm (“I Don’t”), and true, she’s obviously made a few bad choices in life,
having never been made to stand on her own two feet. She’s screwed, and she
knows it. It’s expected, in a way, for people to hate the person favored by
authority. It’s sort of an American habit. It is not a habit for us to consider
that maybe the person we hate for being favored isn’t really that bad.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Why are
Helen and Amy so interesting, then, in comparison? Helen has major flaws and
bonuses, being a workaholic lawyer who also tries to be the perfect mother and
wife. Her efforts to bridge this gap and do the best by Daria and Quinn make
for great comedy and drama. She is very involved in her girls’ lives, and Daria
and Quinn cares about her mother. Amy Barksdale cares deeply about Daria and
presents her niece with a family member who might truly understand her, though
Amy doesn’t seem to care much about Quinn—an ugly little part of the show I
wish had come out differently, as Amy is repeating the same preferential
treatment pattern her mother showed Rita. Amy came to Lawndale because
Daria—her favorite niece—called her. Quinn cannot be ignorant of this; children
can tell right away what is happening in the family. Thanks, Amy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>And
Rita—everything we are presented with about Rita and Erin comes first through
the mouth of Daria and Helen. We are biased against Rita and her daughter right
from the start. Even Amy says that Helen was a tightly wound pain in the ass,
but she doesn’t say that about Rita. It is reasonable to imagine that the
childhood fights between Helen and Rita were instigated by Helen in revenge for
Rita being favored. Rita is always shown on the defensive in the episodes,
never starting fights, so this makes sense. Thanks, Helen.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We could
look at Erin, too, for that matter. Think about it: Does Erin act like she’s an
idiot in “I Don’t”? She obviously made a bad choice in men, like her mother.
Marrying a guy because of the herpes issue was not smart. That’s a pretty
serious problem, but do you think Jake Morgendorffer is a prize? Give me a
break!</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>I admit
there is one other flaw that Rita and Erin both show, which is that they don’t
know when to shut up. Erin blabs at the wedding about Brian’s job with
government intelligence, and Rita blabs about Erin’s herpes and where it came
from. Erin also calls her mother’s boyfriend “pathetic” in “I Don’t,” but maybe
she’s on target there. They still come off looking pretty good next to Helen
and Amy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Rita and
Erin are more than we’ve been led to believe. Helen and Daria slammed them, and
we took their evaluation at face value. We were wrong to do so. Look at the
evidence and give the favored sibling a more favorable thought.</p>

Rita’s new boyfriend, whom she shows off while visiting the Morgendorffers,
turns out to be Mr. Goodbar (i.e., a bad and dangerous man who appears to be a
good man). A regular family member (Helen, Daria, Quinn, etc.) discovers the
boyfriend’s true nature and tries to save Rita from a horrifying fate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Despite the patching up of her marriage in “Aunt Nauseum,” Erin eventually goes
through an extremely messy divorce, getting Helen involved and stirring up tons
of trouble within the family as Helen and Rita attempt to work with Erin on
resolving complex divorce issues. A guest appearance by Grandma Barksdale is
possible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Rita herself meets Mister Right and decides to get married (again). Is her beau
going to be a keeper? What will the Morgendorffers think when Rita and her beau
show up unexpectedly to break the news? What if the beau is someone we already
know from the show? How much will Mother shell out for the wedding? How big a
drunken brawl will ensue between all three sisters?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Rita goes along with Erin and Brian on a vacation (on Mother’s money), but the
Morgendorffers are at the same resort, in adjacent rooms, by sheer coincidence.
After the initial horror passes, things go completely to hell as the family
members keep running into each other under embarrassing circumstances.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Grandma Barksdale dies, and her inheritance goes out to....? Is a will contest
in the wind between the three sisters? Scenes from just before the reading of
the will, focusing on Rita’s point of view, would be interesting. Mixed with
the grief is the suspicion that Rita will inherit most or all of the estate,
which is substantial—or perhaps it looks like it is but it isn’t, and includes
significant debts from bad investments or gambling. Maybe Rita is sick of the
money thing and cannot take any more fighting with siblings, so she plans to
get nothing and divide the money between Helen and Amy and their children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Rita blabs something about her son-in-law, Brian, that she should not have
said, and big trouble follows. Maybe he wasn’t really fired as a government
intelligence worker, and he is still working with the CIA or other agency
(getting fired was a cover story). Maybe Rita says something that tips Helen
off that Brian might be working for the Mob. Maybe Rita admits to Helen that
she slept with that prehistoric imbecile Brian once, when she was drunk (gasp!)
and now feels guilty but doesn’t know what to do about it. Helen and other
family members, possibly Amy, get dragged into the mess.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>7. Rita blabs something about Erin she should not have—not
the herpes thing, something worse—and big trouble follows. Erin finds out and
blows up like Mt. St. Helens (sorry for the pun). Helen and other family
members feel obligated to step in and fix things before they get worse, though
they get worse anyway. Perhaps Erin was conceived during an ill-conceived
affair with a family friend (let’s not pick Jake Morgendorffer, please), or
Erin is having an affair and now everyone knows about it, and Brian’s divorcing
her.</p>

Rita, it develops, is ashamed to be taking money from Mother all this time
(though she does anyway) and has been studying to be a paralegal. Heaven knows
where she got the idea, but she decides to move to Lawndale and get a job—and
she does, at Helen’s law firm. One of three scenarios develops.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Rita finds religion—a poorly understood one from a general standpoint, such as
Wicca. She is very serious about her conversion (as all converts are) and goes
so far as to learn to become a priestess. Erin is mortified and begs the
Morgendorffers to get her mother deprogrammed, but those who investigate find
that Rita made the conversion of her own free will and is quite happy with it.
Then, Rita tries to get one of the Morgendorffers or a family friend interested
in her religion, too—and appears to be making progress.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
