*****<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Michael Fulton felt strange as he awakened on the cold, rugged patch of
rocky earth - but not as strange as he did when he looked over the outfit he
wore... the outfit of a Spartan warrior, straight from the costuming department
of the film 300'. <br>
<br>
He felt even worse when he saw the other men who had accompanied Daria and her
family on the trip - Mack, Q, even Jake, as well as Derek, and his former
roommate, and that guy Gerald, who was interested in Quinn's friend Fran - also
dressed like Spartans...<br>
<br>
... and surrounding them all, were the hordes of the Persian Empire.<br>
<br>
Four words came out of his mouth.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hated this movie.&quot;<br>
<br>
A herald stepped forth from the masses. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Leonidas. My compliments - and congratulations. You surely have turned
calamity to victory. Despite your insufferable arrogance, the God King has come
to admire Spartan valor and fighting skills. You will make a mighty ally.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Michael turned to see that freaky red-haired guy Daria had gone to high school
emerge from the crowd, disfigured and hump-backed, wearing a sad, bejeweled
dunce-cap that he must have felt made him look dashing... as if it could... <br>
<br>
&quot;Yield, Leonidas!&quot; the freak of nature cried out, his voice pouring
from his mouth like maggots being poured from a basin. &quot;Use your reason,
think of your men - I beg you!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
The herald turned back to Michael. &quot;Listen to your fellow Greek. He can
attest to the divine one's generosity. Despite your several insults, despite
your horrid blasphemies, the lord of hosts is prepared to forgive all - And
more: to reward your service! You fight for your lands - Keep them! You fight
for Sparta - she will be wealthier and more powerful than ever before. You
fight for your kingship - you will be proclaimed Warlord of all Greece,
answerable only to the one true master of the world.<br>
<br>
He paused. &quot;Leonidas. Your victory will be complete - if you but lay down
your arms... and kneel to holy Xerxes.&quot;<br>
<br>
Michael looked past him, past the massed forces, to the shining pyramid upon
which sat a gilded throne... and upon that throne, sat Bump - Daria's cat. <br>
<br>
He couldn't remember what he had just said, but it infuriated the small black
cat; her eyes glowed, and she held her soft, white front paw out as she
bellowed, &quot;SLAUGHTER THEM-!&quot;<br>
<br>
</i></span><i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdbt-sx5MDc"><span style='color:windowtext'>Michael's
skin crawled as the multitude of warriors began to slowly shimmy towards him
and the others, hips swaying and thrusting their crotches as a piece of music,
coming out of nowhere, began to play...</span></a><span style='color:#323D4F'><br>
<br>
</span></span></i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:#323D4F'><br>
<br>
&quot;Michael - are you okay?&quot;<br>
<br>
Michael opened his eyes, and turned to face Daria, who sat on the edge of the
bed with a worried expression on her face. &quot;Why were you dreaming about
feeding Bump?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hah... I, uh... What?&quot;<br>
<br>
Daria reached out to touch his arm. &quot;You were talking in your sleep, about
oysters, and Bump waving her paw...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Just - just a bad dream,&quot; Michael said, sitting up in bed. &quot;I
barely even remember it.<br>
<br>
The petite, auburn-haired young woman gave him a glance that clearly showed she
didn't believe him, and stood up. &quot;Next time, maybe you <u>won't</u> go
drinking with the other boys like that.&quot;<br>
<br>
Watching Daria leave, Michael shook his head. <i>The guys are right. If I'm
dreaming about her cat - and worrying about getting the furball mad at me -
then I really AM taking this engagement seriously.<br>
<br>
As soon as I get back, I'm buying the little beast a salmon of her very own.</i><br>
<br>
He reached for the bottle of water on the table, and drained it down. <i>And
why the hell is it that I keep having dreams where Bump's eyes glow like the
aliens in 'Stargate SG-1'? I'm definitely NOT going to tell Daria about the one
with her and Jane dressed up like Egyptians and not wearing underwear... or how
Bump made her pre-chew her salmon...</i><br>
<br>
Thought of his fianc&eacute; in filmy Egyptian outfits filling his head, Michael
tossed the bottle into the trashcan next to the dresser, and curled back up on
the bed.<br>
<br>
Minutes later, he was fast asleep. <br>
