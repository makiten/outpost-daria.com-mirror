It was late in the night or really early in the morning, whatever. Jake was looking out by the window, a mug 
of coffee in his hands. He seemed lost in his thoughts.

"My life has been a lie. I have two daughters and I barely know them. All this time I've blamed my father for 
what he have done, the damned bastard, but I have done?  Nobody gave me a chance... all my good 
intentions turned into disaster.  I've been so clumsy. All this time I've been a nobody with a job that 
sucks. ¯  

He put his now empty  mug in the sink and got upstair.  He stopped at his older daugther's  doorstep. Sha 
was sleeping.

® That's my little girl. She has grown up so so fast. In a few years she'll be gone.  She seems to be so 
peaceful when she sleep. ¯

He entered the room. He took Daria's glasses still marvelling about what she became  and how she will be. 
He sigh and put the glasses were they were.  Before he stroke his daugther hairs and made a quiet exit.

Jake entered his youger daugther room. She have become quite a pretty girl. She'll become somebody great 
too. He kissed her on the cheek before heading back to his room.

® Life isn't that bad after all. ¯ he tought before falling asleep.



Author's note :  I know it's short but I wrote this in the middle of the night while listening to the song  4AM 
from Our Lady Peace.  This fic was inspired by those lyrics. Any comment can be sent at :
