 "Hey Jane, I see you got my message. I figured the Zen was one of the few places we could talk in private, seeing as no one here cares about us anyway."<br>
 "This is creepy Daria. I did what you said and I found all these little cameras all over the place. There was even one in the fridge! Who knows how long they've been there."<br>
 "I know, I found a bunch of them in my room last night, then when I checked the rest of the house, there was at least a dozen more."<br>
 "But who would be sick enough to do this, I mean this is pretty twisted, Daria."<br>
 "I can almost picture Upchuck stashing cameras in our bedrooms and bathrooms, but that would be pretty expencive. I don't think Upchuck has that kind of cash flow. And why would anyone put a camera in a fridge?"<br>
 "Hey don't ask me. It's not like we keep anything intresting in there."<br>
 "And why us? What makes our lives so damn entertaining that someone decides to go and film it!"<br>
 "Hey maybe they got the whole town wired. Like 'the Trumen Show', or something."<br>
 "That's just sick Lane."<br>
 "And this isn't?"<br>
 "Hey, what's that doing here?"<br>
 "Huh? That's just an old security camera."<br>
 "In the Zen?"<br>
 "Aw no, not here to--"<br>
