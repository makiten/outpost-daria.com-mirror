<h2>A Chain Reaction Begins </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria Morgendorffer woke-up. It was nine AM. After a brief debate
on whether of staying more in bed or getting an early breakfast, she decided to
do the latter. After all, the rest of her family by now probably either left
already or not woken-up. That meant that she could be practically alone in the
house, if she kept quiet. That decided it. Daria dressed-up and went
downstairs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Downstairs, Daria saw a discerning sight: her father,
sitting at a breakfast table, reading a newspaper. “Dad? You're still home?”
Daria said, surprised. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why shouldn’t I be, kiddo?” Jake looked-up from the newspaper.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Um…today is a workday? Mom has left hours already, I believe.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I'm self-employed, kiddo, remember? What I say at Morgendorffer
Consulting, goes without arguing!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Dad, you <i>are</i> Morgendorffer Consulting. Without you
pushing things along, nothing goes along there.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Exactly! And so, today, I decided to have a family bonding
day with my girls instead!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Where’s mom?” Daria asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why do you ask it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“’Cause for a family bonding you need a full family, dad.
Now Quinn’s not awake yet, and I’m pretty sure that mom’s at work.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“She is, kiddo. Yesterday was her day to bond with you two;
today is mine.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh! I get it!” realization hit home. “You heard what
happened yesterday with the Lanes, hah?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, kiddo. And I want you to know…that I’m happy that you
decided to stay with us.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Speaking of us, I have two, no three points.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh? What are they, kiddo?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Firstly, where’re Penny and Jane?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, they went home to check on Trent – to see if the house
wasn’t repossessed or something. I told them that we’ll be leaving later in the
morning, so no problems there.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That brings on my second question: where <i>are</i> we
going?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You and Quinn and I are going to Boston!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Boston? Groovy,” Daria deadpanned. “And this, dad, brings
me to my last point: you got to awaken Quinn now, and get her involved in this
idea of yours quickly, before she produces any counter-arguments why she <i>shouldn’t</i>
go.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jake nodded. “Thanks, Daria! Eh, while I go and wake-up
Quinn, can you make us some breakfast?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Didn't you already eat?” Daria said, but Jake didn't hear
her – he already left. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Terrific,” Daria muttered and pulled-out the toaster.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some time later, Daria, Jake and Quinn were riding in Jake’s
Lexus. “So why mom isn't with us?” Quinn asked, still not-quite-awakened. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Helen had already spent time with you,” Jake chuckled.
“It’s my turn today.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I see,” Quinn said. “It’s because Daria almost left with
Penny yesterday?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Eh…yeah,” Jake uncomfortably said. “Helen did point-out
that our family isn't the most functional one…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You didn't see some of other families here,” Quinn rose to
defend the family honour. “The Taylors, for one example.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Whom?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Steve Taylor and his family,” Daria explained. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh them. Well, you know, their family is somewhat…
mended-over.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Dad,” Daria said softly, “Steve Taylor married a woman
who’s young enough to be his oldest daughter. What kind of a role model is
that? You're much better.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Thanks, kiddo!” Jake cheered-up. “Well, off we go to see
the wonderful city of Boston!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Will we be home for dinner?” Quinn asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We shall see…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Penny and Jane looked around the Lane residence. “All’s in
place, and we’ve seem to have gained three guys on top of this,” Penny said.
“Where did they come from?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, that’s Nick, Max and Jesse,” Jane replied. “They’re
Trent’s group, Mystik Spiral.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And they’re sleeping here <i>because</i>-?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“They were probably practicing and fell asleep.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ah! Just like the old times,” Penny nodded. “Is their music
still the same?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s louder.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, that takes care of burglar-alarms, I guess. Don't the
neighbours complain, though?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“They do still, from time to time. Then we have to barricade
our doors to escape the police.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Penny shook her head. “Wonderful. I suppose they bring girls
here too?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah, they do,” Jane said. “Just not very often.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hmm. Didn't Trent go steady with some girl named Dominique
or something?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It's Monique,” Jane replied, “and yeah, they still are
steady – like waves upon a shore. Off and on again. So anyways. Where are you
planning to stay?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Here, I suppose.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Your old room, I meant?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Please. Summer’s room is never to my liking.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And another thing – this isn't going to swamp-out into another
family gathering, is it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Let’s see. Summer is still chasing after her kids in
Canada, Wind is in either here in California or in Andros, Bahamas, Trent’s
accounted for, and Mom and Dad were in Spain, the last time I heard from them.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And where did you return from? Brazil? Paraguay?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nope. Madagascar.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Madagascar?! That’s in <i>Africa</i>!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah? So?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Did you see the monkeys there?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“More than enough. If you look around, you’d sure to see
some monkey – they’re called lemurs there.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So anyway. What do you want to do today?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sit on a couch and watch TV. I didn't do either of them in
a long while.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sounds fair. But I must warn you – Trent.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Trent will be sleeping for ages, Jane, I'll wager.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You’ll have to be more specific than that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Penny chucked a pillow at Jane in reply. Jane answered similarly;
soon the two sisters were involved in a big pillow fight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh dear. We’ve phoned Quinn several times by now, but nobody’s
answering,” Stacy Rowe nervously turned to her fellow Fashion Clubber, Tiffany
Blum-Deckler. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s bad?” Tiffany asked, not getting it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Tiffany, think. Yesterday, Sandi said something that made
Quinn upset.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“About her sister?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, you do remember!” Stacy said. “Sandi made Quinn upset;
Quinn probably told her parents, and now both they and Sandi’s parents are
upset.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So where does this leave us?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stacy nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So what should we do?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don't know. Let’s go and see what’s at Cashman’s.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tiffany nodded. At this point of time it was too hard to see
where all of this will end-up in, and who’ll win – Sandi or Quinn. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sandi Griffin was quite angry with her mother, who was angry
with her. “I was just only trying to be helpful,” Sandi muttered for a
countless time, “but does anybody care about this? No!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sandi walked another circle, and turned even more
thoughtful. “I have had enough from mom. She constantly runs my life. I've got
to do something that’ll keep her out of my hair – at least for a while. But
what?” Realizing that she could think of nothing at the moment in here,” Sandi
went outside, trying to find an idea.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen’s business phone rang. “Who is it?” she spoke into the
receiver.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Helen? It’s me, Amy.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hello Amy, why are you calling me?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Helen, Rita wants to crash at my place for a while; some
sort of a problem with Paul, I think. I told her that my place is fumigated;
can I spent some time in Lawndale away from her?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes Amy, you can. Normally you couldn’t, but this is <i>Rita</i>
we’re talking about. Any news about Erin or Brian?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nope.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh well. Have fun in Lawndale!” Helen hanged-up.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a change, Sandi Griffin was unwilling to meet any of her
Fashion Club members; they never did do anything more serious than shop. And
for once in her life time, Sandi Griffin was unwilling to shop. “This bites,
this really bites,” she muttered. “I swear, whenever I confront those two, I
end-up for punished for something that they didn’t do.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Are you talking about your two brothers?” another voice
spoke behind her. Sandi turned around. “Michael Jordan Mackenzie. What are you
doing here at the mall?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Shopping for Jodie’s birthday,” Mack replied plainly.
“You?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Reminiscing. I made a mistake, apparently, but I don’t know
what kind of! I was only trying to help.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“An ancient wise man once said: <i>Remember, there are only
two faces of evil: either an enemy cleverly made trouble, or a foolish friend
decided to give a helping hand</i>”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey! I’m not stupid!” Sandi protested. Then she remembered
something and sighed: “Or maybe I am. This is the second time, after all.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“When was the first?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I really cannot tell you,” Sandi shook her head. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Come on,” Mack said kindly. “I won’t gossip.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Okay,” Sandi nodded. “The first time was when I was four,
and me and my parents were visiting my aunt Vicki in…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>El Paso, Texas, 14 years ago</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“El Paso is bo-ring!” four-year-old Sandi Griffin loudly complained,
looking at the streets, lit-up by a morning sun. “There’s nothing here but some
dumb zoo, and a state park, where is nothing but ugly rocks!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Her parents, Tom and Linda, looked at each other with equal
distaste. “Remind me, <i>dear</i>, why did we decide to visit your sister?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Linda bristled. “Look, Tom. This is important. I need to
visit my sister…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“…In order to get some cash loaned to you, is that it? Is it
true, <i>dear</i>, that your sister organizes smuggling operations into
Mexico?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Linda bristled. El Paso was located right next to the
Mexican border and a Mexican city of Ciudad Juarez, as well as on the shores of
Rio Grande. Basically, for Tom and Linda Griffin, both of whom have lived in
the New England town of Lawndale, all of this seemed more than a little bit
criminally shady. And the weather – right now it was at least 10 degrees higher
in El Paso than back home. And since the weather was high, the Griffins’
tempers were high-strung as well. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>…Linda exhaled. “Look, Tom. We need the cash. I may be
ousted from my place as a TV anchor, for crying outloud!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So what’s so bad?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What’s so bad, what’s so bad?! I worked hard for this for
the last four years, and now I may lose it. Why, you may ask, why…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“’Cause your coworkers call you Gorgon, that’s why,” Tom
snapped. “I heard enough about you and that Barksdale woman, you know?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Her name is Amy,” Linda snorted. “Sounds like a name for a
pet rat.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And with that attitude you're wondering why you may lose
your job?” Tom sneered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Shut-up!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While her parents continued to argue, Sandi wandered-off.
She was bored; she didn't care about her parents’ arguments; she wanted
souvenirs! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Psst!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hah?” Sandi turned around. A girl of the same age as her –
was looking/squinting at her in a conspiring manner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yo, you! You want souvenirs?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Aha,” nodded Sandi. “Where can I find them?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Follow me!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And Sandi followed the strange girl, wondering into what was
she getting into? The girl’s clothes were so strange, so…cheap and
unfashionable, that Sandi couldn't help but mistrust her – a little bit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We're here!” the other girl called-out. “Penelope?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah?” another girl, this one about twice as old as Sandi,
appeared on the scene.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You got a customer!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Should I show her what we have?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey!” Sandi spoke loudly. “How do I know that you have what
I want?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, what <i>do</i> you want?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“A souvenir.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Cool! Then how about this statuette of the Great Buffalo of
the Plains, who, when he is angry, causes earthquakes, but when he is pleased,
brings abundant herds to us?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“To you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“To People of the Plains,” the younger girl explained. “Do
you want it or not?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don’t know; all I have is ten dollars,” Sandi said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Great! Such a statuette costs <i>exactly</i> ten dollars!”
the girl emphatically said. “Let’s trade!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The girl’s face shone with such honesty, that Sandi gave-in.
She handed the girl ten dollars, took the statuette of the holy buffalo and
left. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sandi!” Linda spoke sharply, when she and Tom caught the
sight of their first-born again. “Where were you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Trading!” Sandi said proudly. “See? I traded my ten dollars
for this statuette of the holy buffalo!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The mouths of both older Griffins opened wide, but before either
of them could speak, Vicki Vanelk, sister of Linda, finally made her presence
known. “Well, what do I see? My niece proving that she <i>is</i> the daughter
of my sister? How ironic.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Linda whirled around, her face scarlet. “What are you
talking about?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Isn't it obvious? Your daughter has been swindled out of
ten dollars. <i>That</i> is one of the stones from Tanks State Historical Park,
its’ shape hand-altered just a little bit. Hmm. Looks like an elk, if you ask
me.” Vicki shook her head. “’Course, your daughter, Linda, was unlucky too.
Usually people are swindled for four-five dollars this way, nothing more. Guess
some street vendors got lucky with a kid.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sandi’s face burned, and she almost didn't hear Tom
Griffin’s angry harangue at her about the value of spending the right amount.
“Nevermore,” Sandi whispered under her nose, “nevermore will I trust people in
ugly, unfashionable clothing.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>End flashback</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So that’s what happened,” Sandi finished her tale. “My aunt
did loan some cash to my mom, but it didn’t help anyways, mom did lose that
TV-anchor job and got demoted to weather channel news; there was some sort of
trouble with it in fact, of which I know nothing about; and aunt Vicki lives in
North Dakota, somewhere between Minot and Lake Sakakawea, as far as I know.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So what does that event fourteen years ago got to do with
yesterday’s punishment of yours?” Mack asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“See, the first girl – the one my age – is Daria
Morgendorffer. <i>The</i> Daria Morgendorffer, if you please. And the second
girl, I understood, was a Lane – Penny Lane, I think her name is. And you know
how Quinn claims that Daria isn't her real sister.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You know she’s lying.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, yeah. But with a sister like that, who wouldn't? Anyways,
Daria <i>does</i> spend a lot of time with Jane Lane, and <i>only</i> then she <i>is</i>
acting remotely human-like. Ditto goes for Jane too, if you ask me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Get to the point, please.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Alright, Mack. See, when I saw Daria yesterday with Lanes,
she was acting normal – like you or me, not as a Misery Chick. And then that
suppressed memory of fourteen years ago popped-up, and I recognized the other
Lane as that other street-vendor girl. Naturally, since they were together
fourteen years ago, I thought that Daria was also a Lane, not a Morgendorffer,
and told Quinn that much. Quinn freaked-out, contacted her mom, and her mom
contacted me and my mom, and here I am, in this mess.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Poor you,” Mack sighed. “This time, you really <i>didn't</i>
do anything wrong. My condolences. Although – if you mom still had a job on TV,
why is she the president of Lawndale’s Businesswomen Association?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, mom left shortly after she got re-positioned. Her ego,”
Sandi drawled-out vehemently. “My mom got a really big one. I really hate her
for that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don't say that!” Mack argued. “Your parents <i>are</i> your
parents. You’ve got to love them no matter what!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sandi pierced Mack with a glance. “Did you ever hear your
girlfriend Jodie on that subject? I know I did.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mack sighed. He may be the captain of the football team, and
certainly <i>not</i> Kevin, but he would probably never understand girls. Oh
well, why bother?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen’s phone rang. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, who is it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mom, it’s me. Daria.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh hi, honey, where did you dad take you and Quinn?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Currently, we’re in Boston, near Quincy Bay. See, we were going
to go and watch a movie, but Quinn wanted to see ‘American Pie 2’, while I
wanted to see ‘Jurassic Park III’, so dad took us fishing instead. ‘Course, he
also had fishing equipment in the back of the car, so I wonder if we were
set-up.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Did he now?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, mom. Currently, he is fishing in the Atlantic, yelling
as if he caught Godzilla himself on his lure. Whoa! Mom, I'll have to call you
later. I think dad <i>did</i> catch Godzilla Jr. Bye.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria hanged-up. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Daria!” Jake yelled again. “Quinn! Stop talking on the
phones and <i>help</i> me! Yikes! Help!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jake was indeed in trouble. A huge codfish got caught on his
fishing line and now was fighting Jake for what it was worth. Other fishermen
were looking curiously at Jake, but weren’t hurrying to aide him, since it was
too early to tell whether he needed help or not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria reached Jake first and grabbed him by the belt. “Whoa
there, dad. Steady does it!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jake grunted and jerked the lure. The fish jerked back, making
Jake lose his balance. He fell, pulling Daria and Quinn after him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Suddenly, his falling stopped. Daria had him with the waist;
Quinn had Daria by the collar of Daria’s jacket, and lots of other people had
the three Morgendorffers by various parts of their clothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Drop the rod, dad!” Quinn yelled from ahead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Never!” Jake grunted. “Little Jakey’s not a quitter, dad!”
He jerked his fishing rod and line once again. The fish leapt, and the balance
in the ‘human vine’ shifted abruptly, causing a lot of people to wall into
Quincy Bay. But spontaneously with that the balance in the fishing line changed
too, and Jake’s next jerk got the cod right into his arms. “Ah-ha!” he triumphantly
yelled, thumping the cod’s head on the nearest harbour rock.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Only, it wasn't a rock but a napping harbour seal, who
lashed-out with his teeth to counter the supposed assault. Jake jerked back,
barrelled into other people, started a sort of in-water domino effect…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In short, it was one of the more humiliating moments in Daria’s
life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amy Barksdale passionlessly looked at the closed and empty
residence of the Morgendorffers. “Wonderful. Jake gets a clue and whisks my
nieces away – right on the same day I decide to visit them. Bugger. What else
can go wrong?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Excuse me. Are the Morgendorffers home?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amy slowly turned around. “Linda Griffin. Now my day <i>is</i>
set. How’s life in the business world?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Linda paled. “Why are you here, Amy?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Visiting my family, of course. Not all of us are
embarrassed of our sisters, you know?” (Especially if there’s more than one to
choose, she silently added.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Linda seethed. In the end, her sisterly relationship with
Vicki did more harm to her than good, and Amy still got the job that Linda once
held – of a news’ anchor. “Look, <i>Amy</i>. I’m not off to search for Vicki in
North Dakota, just because you came here. And besides…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Massachusetts is smaller than North Dakota? Is that it?”
Amy asked. “Look, Linda. Try not to be so paranoid. Try to <i>act</i> friendly,
at least. After all, it’ll cost you nothing!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Shut-up!” Linda snarled. “You bloody Barksdale sisters! Always
reaching for the sky above. Your sister is a bloody lawyer, you yourself are
living <i>my</i> career! The one I should have had, but you stole it from me!!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Look at it this way,” Amy suggested. “I'm still single. You
got a husband and three kids.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Another thing to be grateful about, my kids!” Linda
snapped. “Originally, me and Tom thought that Sandi will be enough. But you and
your sister, you unbalanced us so much, that Sam was conceived.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Your oldest son?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes. He is thirteen.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And Sandi’s eighteen now, while your youngest son is eight.
Have you decided to have children in five-year intervals?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Shut-up!” Linda snarled, “shut-up! What do you know about
children? – Nothing! You're an aunt, but never will be a mother!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, I don’t know about that,” Amy shrugged. “I’m not over
my forties mark, unlike <i>some</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Linda didn’t scream. If she did, she’d probably do it in
ultra-sound. “What <i>is </i>your secret?” she finally asked, forcing herself
to sound normal. “You have no personal skills, you look like a rat, your
attitude is anything but bearable! If you didn't have your lawyer-sister on
your side, I would have beaten you!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Unlikely,” Amy shook her head. “After all, you weren’t
called the Gorgon for nothing. That may be a good thing, but too much pudding
spoils the dog, you know!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Linda paled, but for two red spots on her cheeks. Whirling
around, she stalked-off. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amy sighed. “I'm too damn nice, Daria would say in such a
situation. Hey Linda, wait up! I’m sorry!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amy went-off after Linda.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So what are you going to do now?” Mack asked Sandi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hmm? Oh, I don't know. Get even with my mom somehow, I
think,” Sandi scratched her head. “Why’s the sudden interest in my actions,
Mack? We were never friends, and me and Jodie aren’t particularly friendly,
either.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I wondered about that. Why? Isn't Jodie cool enough for
that?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sandi sighed. “Mack, do you consider me racist?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Um, no.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Do you think that Lawndale is a racist town?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not really.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Try to tell that to Michelle Landon and see how far you’ll
get with this statement. Michelle Landon is, frankly, frightening. Most kids
try to avoid the Landons as whole, and probably most adults too.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Good point,” Mack conceded. “And speaking of Jodie, can I
ask your advice?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Is there a gift involved?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Possibly, yeah. So can I ask your advice?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why not? It’s not like I have anything to do otherwise.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You know,” Stacy turned to her friend Tiffany. “Shopping
isn’t as fun without Sandi or Quinn.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Aha,” Tiffany nodded. Stacy’s chattering was starting to
get even on her nerves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Whoa, Tiffany, look!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tiffany looked, and saw Sandi, parading before Michael
Mackenzie, in some rather revealing clothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh my god! It’s Sandi! And Mack! They’re an item!” Stacy began
to squeal. Tiffany acted quickly, leaving nothing to chance. She dragged Stacy
off to the women’s washroom, where Stacy could hyperventilate as much as she
wanted. Tiffany herself needed to think too. Whom should she tell about this?
Jodie? Quinn? Anyone else? Yes, this definitely needed some thought.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So what do you think? Do you think that Jodie will
appreciate it? Or rather, will <i>you</i> appreciate Jodie in this?” Sandi
asked Mack, as she showed-off the latest achievements in lingerie
manufacturing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I think I’m going to buy it, and leave at that,” Mack said.
“It came to my attention that with your help I can make this store were lucky,
and leave the store very poor.” Mack paused. “You know something, Sandi? You
may not be exactly pretty, but you’re very elegant. Whatever you wear – it
always looks good.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ahem,” the cashier spoke. “Young man, are you going to buy
this stuff, or continue to appraise your girlfriend?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We're not a couple!” Mack and Sandi spoke at the same time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The cashier just smirked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh my god! Sandi and Mack are a couple! Oh my god! What are
we to do?” Stacy wailed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tiffany frowned slightly. There were times when it was good
to be friends with Stacy, but right now Stacy’s wails were only interrupting
her thinking processes and brought attention. And so, when Stacy paused for
breath, Tiffany jammed a large portion of low-fat fries into Stacy’s mouth,
causing her to fall silent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then Tiffany started to think for real.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>…Unlike the popular belief that Tiffany was stupid, Tiffany
knew that that wasn't the case. She always completed her assignments on time
and always passed. And just because she wasn’t as active as Jodie Landon,
didn’t mean that she was dumb. Or slow. In fact, if Stacy’s line of thought was
fast, then Tiffany was going to go with slow for a long time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tiffany frowned. So Sandi and Mack were a couple? Hmm.
“Stacy. Are Jodie and Mack a couple?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stacy shook her head. Then nodded. “I don't know. They’re always
together and all, but they’re not like Kevin and Brittany.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tiffany nodded. That was the crux of the whole matter: were
Mack and Jodie a couple or not? Or were they just hanging around each other
because they were they were practically the only Afro-American students in
Lawndale High? Tiffany wondered if she would stop hanging around the Fashion Club
if another Asian-American student would appear in Lawndale High. Course, that
student would have to be unrelated to Ms. Li. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tiffany shook her head. Originally she hanged-around with
the Fashion Club because Stacy and Sandi always had the best gossip in Lawndale
High if not the whole Lawndale, and recently, with Quinn Morgendorffer arriving
on the scene, the Fashion Club itself started to become interesting from
Tiffany’s point of view. Before Quinn, Sandi would always tell Stacy and
Tiffany what to wear or what was fashionable, and the other two would comply.
Now with Quinn Morgendorffer actually asking Sandi “Why should we do that?” or
“Why shouldn’t we do this?” Sandi actually had to think of sentences starting
with “because”. They were called explanations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tiffany shook her head. “So are Mack and Jodie a couple or
not?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don’t know,” Stacy admitted. “Mack and Jodie <i>are</i>
always seen together, and Jodie<i> is</i> the vice-president of the <i>school</i>
<i>council</i>, while Sandi is just the president of the <i>Fashion</i> <i>Club</i>…”
Stacy has forgotten than she and Tiffany <i>were</i> the Fashion Club.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And Mack’s the captain of the football team,” Tiffany
nodded. “Hmm.” She thought some more. “Too much of a good thing, maybe? Mack
and Jodie were often arguing about the lack of private time for the two of
them. On one thing, this as well as what Stacy and Tiffany saw earlier today,
indicated that Mack and Jodie were reaching a supposed climax of a relationship
– the home run, to use the baseball language. On the other hand, today’s
earlier events meant Mack and Jodie may be breaking-up – maybe just
unconsciously, but still. “I think, Stacy,” Tiffany finally said, “we should
keep quiet about this. After all – Sandi is our friend, fellow Fashion Clubber
and our superiour. We owe it to her to keep quiet about this.” (And get out of
any mess on her own, she silently added.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You think? But isn’t it just wrong? I mean, Mack and Jodie
fit-in so well!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Stacy. People aren't like socks and scrunchies – they may
go together even if they don’t match.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not matching socks and scrunchies – yikes!” Stacy gulped.
She began to blab about the horrors of that, quite forgetting about Mack, Jodie
and Sandi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tiffany sighed. Fast thinking – forget it. She’d go-on on
her own pace.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, this settles it,” Penny turned to Jane. “Nothing has
been missing since last night. Let’s go.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Go where?” Jane asked. “It’s summer-time. Many of shops are
closed; and besides I don’t do shopping, unless it’s for art supplies. And
then, of course, it’s Dega street.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Jane, anything on Dega street that’s cheap is worthless,”
Penny said. “Anything that’s worthwhile is there is never cheap.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I think that things have quieted-down somewhat there since
you were my age,” Jane said. “Besides, we do have different attitudes, you
know?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Jane. People on Dega street do what I do: sell stuff that
would be cheap if it was authentic, but since it is not, it is over-priced.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Penny, it’s hard to fake art supplies. They may be old, but
they are still art supplies. At least here.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And what <i>do</i> you consider as art supplies? Paints and
brushes?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Also pencils, pastels, even pens, chalks, paper, canvas –
lots of stuff. And I don’t just paint; I sculpt, too.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You sculpt? Can I see one of your sculptures, then?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Okay. Here’s one.” And Jane proudly presented one of her
sculptures to Penny.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hmm,” Penny said thoughtful, “can you give a clue on what
theme it was made-off?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s mythology,” Jane said. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Penny looked at her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane blushed. “What? I like reading myths.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mmm. I guess that this is a basilisk. No, wait, Echidna the
Snakewoman and the mother of all monsters, right?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Actually, it was supposed to be a phoenix,” Jane glared.
“See? The wings, the tail, the head?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I thought that a phoenix was kind-of eagle-ish,” Penny replied.
“This looks like a cross between a bird of paradise and one of those herons
that dad photographed in Egypt. You <i>sure</i> it was supposed to be a
phoenix?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane glared. Penny stared back. Jane sighed. “All right, all
right, this was supposed to be a pheasant. You know what I’m talking about?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mmm. Guess you got creative?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah. But a cockatrice? A Snakewoman? What brought that
on?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“One of Summer’s boyfriends was an artist. He drew that kind
of things. One of his paintings was Echidna the Snakewoman.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh? How did it look?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He drew a weeping woman whose face was covered by her
hands, and who was a snake from waist-down. It wasn’t a real painting; just a
black-and-white sketch. The background was just a rock. You draw better.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nah, there’s a difference between painting, drawing, and
sketching, though you probably don't know. Still, even you must know the
difference between sketching and sculpting.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, but Jane, see? The tail, the torso, the forelimbs, the
head. No offence, but those wings don't look much like wings, and I can't see
the bird’s legs, either.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The legs are there – the tail just covers them,” Jane
replied. “And the wings – so I did get a little bit showy. They still don't
look like arms or forelimbs.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s why I thought if this was a cockatrice first,” Penny
replied. “There <i>is</i> just enough bird in this whole sculpture.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hmmpf!” Jane snorted. “Coincidentally, what did become of
the sketching Summer’s boyfriend?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don't know,” Penny shrugged, “got to ask Summer the next
time she appears.” She looked around. “So how’s Trent doing?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not bad, so-so,” Jane replied, kind-of eager for the change
of subject. “Still writes songs – here’s one. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>A lover, slippery as soap,</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Crawled through my intestines into my heart.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>A lover, slippery as soap,</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Simply ripped my chest apart.”</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yup, that’s Trent, all right,” Penny replied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane snorted. “No, that’s probably Max. Or Nick. It
certainly can’t be Jesse because he never writes. He barely talks, even.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So why it can’t be Trent?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“<i>A lover, slippery as soap</i>? Alliterations were never
Trent’s things.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What about this one?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Night, like an apple-tree, into my window knocks,</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>And way outside a night-bird cries.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>I know, I know, I know one only thing:</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>What in day-time flourishes, in night-time dies.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Who wrote this one?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Now <i>that’s</i> Trent,” Jane replied. “The paper’s kind
of yellowish, I think?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, I thought so. I think he tried to impress Monique
with this one some time ago. The words sounded familiar-y.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Do you like her?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Er, why do you ask?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“’Cause you still live with Trent, and whenever he brings
somebody over here, you have either a front-row seat in an audience, or a
sleepover somewhere.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Penny, Trent isn't Wind!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“God, I hope not. One spouse-seeking boy sibling is enough.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane snorted. “Will Wind never find love?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don’t know. You tell me. I told you he was either in Bahamas
or in California.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And Summer is in Canada?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The last time we contacted, she was in Brandon, Manitoba.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And our folks in Spain?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“In Badajoz, planning to sail on Guadina upstream away from
Portuguese border. Some trouble in Beja, involving leather, I was told.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mmm. Lucky us. So Penny, since you know so much about
sculpting, why won’t we have a bit of a sisterly bonding thing and make one of
our own sculptures.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What if one of the guys wakes-up?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“They’re used to it, as long as I don’t paint their hair.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What hair?” Penny asked, looking at Nick.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nevermind. Let’s get started, shall we?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So guys, what do you want to see next?” Jake Morgendorffer
asked his girls, Daria and Quinn. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The zoo, daddy?” Quinn asked politely. “Maybe they’ll have
seals there and feed them fishies!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Um, Quinn honey, daddy had all the fishy excitement he
could get,” Jake uneasily chuckled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah, and a fishy almost fed on him,” Daria added wryly.
“What are you going to do with this monster, dad?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Take it home and cook us some cod-fish chowder – mm-mm,
yummy!” Jake chuckled, back in a good mood. “Ishmael himself would probably
deign to eat it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ishmael?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The story-teller in Moby Dick,” Daria explained.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Eew! You read Moby Dick?” Quinn explained. “This guy is
weird! First he tries to sound like some plain whaler, but then he starts
talking like a brain! That story is broken into pieces!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You read Moby Dick?” Daria incredibly asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I-I looked over it,” Quinn quickly said. “It’s dull and
dumb. Only a brain like you would enjoy reading it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey, I know!” Jake spoke emphatically. “Let’s go to the harbour
and see the seals and the dolphins play!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Dad, didn't we just come from the harbour?” Daria asked,
pointedly looking at the fish slung in a backpack over Jake’s shoulder, while
Quinn just stared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well yeah, but that was Quincy Bay; I'm talking about
Boston Harbour!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We’ll go, dad,” but no fishing there!” Quinn said firmly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You might catch a porpoise there, and that’s illegal,”
Daria added. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Roger!” Jake nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Linda sat in a diner in Lawndale Mall, feeling her anger
slowly abating. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Okay, the things were bad. Due to Sandi’s bloody interfering
with the Morgendorffer affairs, Helen Morgendorffer was angry. And Linda Griffin
remembered her first seeing of the older sister of Amy Barksdale – a female
lawyer with fiery eyes and temper; when Helen Morgendorffer had come to aide
her sister Amy, Linda Griffin was scared. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But she recovered. After all, the Morgendorffers did go back
to Texas while the Griffins stayed here, in Lawndale. But now the
Morgendorffers have returned. And what was especially aggravating to Linda, it
was the fact that Helen Morgendorffer had forgotten all about their first
meeting! That, to put it frankly, stank. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, what do you expect?” Amy Barksdale re-appeared, seemingly
out of thin air. “My sister is a very busy woman; she considers it lucky to eke
some time for her family – namely us.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Who are ‘us’?” Linda grunted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Me, our mother Evelyn, and our sister Rita and her
daughter, Erin.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I see. A big blooming family, aren't you all?” Linda
grunted. “My only family is currently consisting of a sister who is in North
Dakota!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yowza!” Amy nodded. “That stinks. Still, do you think that
she may be avoiding you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Of course! In case you haven’t forgotten, my fall didn't
happen without her help.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, get over it, already! You're a president of a business
association; surely you make enough money for now-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“This isn't about <i>money</i>, Amy, this is about <i>fame</i>.
I could’ve been known – at least for a while. I would’ve been on TV!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Linda, you know that those famous people never have any
family lives…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So spoke a single woman. I already told you about my
birth-family; a sister who is most dishonest and despises me and my family. As
for my immediate family, they involve my husband Tom Griffin, with whom I
get-on like a house on fire; my daughter Sandi, who may look like me, but acts
like Tom; and my sons Sam and Chris, both of whom are delinquents – nothing
else.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Gee, I wonder why did this happen? Not with such a loving
mother-and-wife figure at helm!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There you go again!! Being sarcastic!! I hate you, Amy
Barksdale!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hate is such an ugly thing, Linda. Have you ever seen this
‘Xena’ episode-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Linda groaned. “Just leave me alone. You came here to see
your family – fine. If they were my family I would want to visit them too. But
me – leave me alone! I have no truck with any of your family!!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Fine,” Amy got-up. “Do as you will. I just wanted to
apologize and to offer my condolences-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don't need nothing from you!” Linda hissed. “Go away.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Fine.” Amy Barksdale left, leaving Linda staring mutely at
a table. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Do you want anything?” a waiter came up to her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Linda pierced the waiter with a stare. “A cup of black
coffee and a small bottle of rum.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We-e d-don't s-serve alcoholic beverages here, ma’am,” the
waiter quailed under Linda’s death-stare.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I see. Then just a really big cup of black coffee. Can you
serve that?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes ma’am. Will you be staying or going?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Going.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sandi and Mack walked through the mall. “So explain something
to me,” Mack turned to Sandi. “Why <i>are</i> you scared of your mother? You
are eighteen, you know.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s not so easy,” Sandi shook her head. “Why my mother
gets angry – she shouts. Loudly, but it can be braved. The scary thing is
what’s on the other side, when she stops raging and turns calm. Then when
things turn scary. She just looks at you in that odd way, and you become
willing to do anything just to get her back to normal. The only one who’s not
affected by that is my cousin Marcello.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Who’s that?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Son of my paternal uncle and aunt. He’s kind of like
Quinn’s sister, Daria. Really heavy with sarcasm. And since he’s built like a
weight-lifter, this does make him unusual.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mmm. I see. So you’re not going to stand-up to your mom?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sandi looked thoughtful. “I don't think I'm going to exactly
stand-up to her. But she and I <i>are</i> going to have a conversation – later
today. That’s for sure.” She paused. “Now back to you, Mack.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“To me? What about me?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So how are things with you and Jodie? Judging from your
choice of gifts, you're going for the home run, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mack blushed. “Not exactly; I’m merely hinting at my willingness
to do so, to Jodie.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mack! You probably don't know, but buying lingerie for any
girl is a serious step; unless you’re completely confident in your dealings
with Jodie, you shouldn’t give her that.” Sandi paused. “Just how <i>are</i>
your dealings with Jodie?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hopefully, improved by this,” Mack admitted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two teens went-on, ignoring the commotion on their
right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Michelle Landon stared coldly after the mismatched pair.
“How dare that Griffin tramp steal my daughter’s boyfriend!” she hissed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Are you talking about my Sandi?” Linda’s voice came from
behind her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Michelle turned around. There stood Linda Griffin, looking
somehow disshevelled, but nonchalantly sipping some black coffee – make that a
lot of black coffee. “Yes,” Michelle bit-out the words. “<i>Your</i> Sandi is
stealing <i>my</i> daughter’s boyfriend!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Excuse me,” Linda said levelly – too levelly for anyone who
knew Linda. “Since when is Michael Jordan Mackenzie is your daughter’s
boyfriend?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Michelle looked at Linda as if she was retarded. “They spend
most of their time in school together.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Helen Morgendorffer’s girl spends most of her time with
Jane Lane,” Linda said levelly. “Are you saying that those two girls are also a
couple?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I wouldn't be surprised if that was the case with you white
folks,” Michelle sneered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Excuse me,” Linda said, suddenly coming closer to Michelle.
“Are you anti-Democratic?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I mean, since when do democratic people sneer at others for
their race, belief, or sexual preferences?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“A-plenty!” Michelle snapped, the ‘red-rag’ word, ‘race’
blotting-out everything else in her ears. “You white folks, you-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Are you feeling deficient, lacking in something?” Linda
interrupted her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Excuse me?” Michelle blubbered. “What are you talking
about?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Linda calmly put a hand on the other woman’s shoulder – a
friendly gesture, nothing more. But Michelle shivered from sudden worry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why, Michelle, I'm pointing-out the fact that any
conversation with you deteriorates into you blustering and raging about the
white folks’ superiority. Now is it just me, or are you jealous and are
wistfully wishing for some of that superiority for yourself?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Michelle’s face was so hot, you could boil water on it. “Nonsense.
Us black folks-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There you go again,” Linda said, almost jovially. “Dividing
the people into white and black. My-my-my, you really aren’t democratic, are
you? Maybe you even support Mandela?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Michelle Landon tried to get her composure together. “What
are you getting at, Linda?” she hissed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hmm? Me? Getting at? Ah, yes. You see, Michelle, in our <i>wonderful</i>”
Linda’s face turned sneering for a moment “world, people are treated according
to their social status, not their race or anything like that. If you’re just a
housewife, you’ll be treated just a housewife, no matter what special treatment
you try to weasel-out of them by pretending to be racially-deficient or something.”
Linda’s mouth forded a definite smirk, and it was wicked. “I'm willing to bet
that when you were the VP of US Women company, you weren’t so concerned about
racial treatment, were you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Um, well,” Michelle paused. Linda’s words didn't just
strike a nerve; they hammered all of them. “What are you getting at, Linda?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“My company could use a good and experienced business
manager,” Linda shrugged. “That is all. Have a good day, Mrs. Landon.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Linda left. Michelle stared after her, thinking hard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So what do you want to do now?” Sandi asked Mack, quite
unaware of the drama that has happened on the sidelines. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mack shrugged his head. “Want to see a movie?” he asked. “I
heard that ‘Lord of the Rings’ was being played.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Is it cool?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Got lots of special effects, if that’s what you mean?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mmm-m. I see. Does it have… content?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, yeah. It is deep, if that’s what you mean.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“All right, but you’ll have to explain the confusing parts.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Very well, so I shall.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So what should we do, what should we do?” Stacy nervously
chattered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Stacy, be quiet,” Tiffany droned-out. More than anything,
Tiffany right now wanted to be alone, away from Stacy. But she also knew, that
if she said that to Stacy directly, this would cause a chain reaction with too
many unknown factors involved. Tiffany didn’t like chain reactions leading into
the unknown; she didn’t like the unknown period. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But she was also tired of Stacy. After a brief
thinking-over, she had a flash. “Stace,” she told her companion, “you have
gotten tired, very tired.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I did?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Aha. You are so tired, that you want to go home, as I do.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We do?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Aha. Let us go to our separate homes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stacy nodded. Tiffany smirked on the inside. Hypnosis, her
foot! When it came to direct stupidity, simple repetition of the facts often
did the trick.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Tell me again, what’s this that we are supposed to be making?”
Penny asked Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well,” Jane defensively said, “this is supposed to be a
pot, you know!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The only way an individual can take this as a… drinking vessel
would be if he or she smoked pot or crack themselves,” Penny argued. “I know
crappy work when I see one – God knows how many I made and sold to various
suckers that tour Third World countries.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I see,” Jane said sourly. “So why did you came back to Lawndale?
Please don’t give me anything about Daria – you never knew she was here!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well yeah,” Penny began but was interrupted by Trent’s
sleep singing:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“My lover, slippery as soap,</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Show me past and what yet will be…”</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He turned onto his other side, then re-started: “Sourceress,
your kisses are like poisoned stingers!” and then he turned back to snoring.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“By any chance, is he on something?” Jane muttered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Who did you say write ‘Slippery Lover’?” Penny asked
archly, re-indicating the piece she had found first.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Aw, come on, this doesn’t mean nothing. Trent and the guys
are desperate enough to try to use anything that seems to be working!” Jane
argued. “Although, if he’ll try to sing that ‘Night’ song, I'll smother him
with a pillow!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How ‘bout using your phoenix sculpture instead?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nah, maybe you’ll sell it to some sucker instead,” Jane
said with a hint of bitterness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nah,” Penny aped her younger sister. “Anyone can see that
that is custom-made.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s not custom-made! I made it for myself!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Unfortunately, majority of people do not believe that you
can make a mythical animal out of clay just because you feel like it,” Penny
argued. “Coincidentally, why won’t we try and make some sort of animal from
clay instead of this pot or jar or frying pan that we're at.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Right. So what do you want to do? A hydra?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nah. Always get confused with the heads. How about a giant?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Too easy.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“A griffin?”<br>
”That’ll do. Bring forth more clay!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hello again, Helen.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Amy. What are you doing here? I thought you didn't like
this place?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Helen, you forgot to mention that Jake has taken my nieces
somewhere, which leaves me with a rather large amount of empty and boring time
that I decided to partially fill by joining you for lunch. Is that a problem?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen rolled her eyes. “Not, but Amy, I’m the lawyer in this
family; I’m the one who is supposed to make long, confusing sentences around
here full of bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Helen, I don't want to interrupt you, but some guy is
heading over here to us.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen looked around. “Ow, hi Eric.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hello again, Helen. Who’s your friend.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Amy, meet my immediate boss, Eric Schrecter. Eric, meet my
sister, Amy Barksdale.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey, I know you!” Eric suddenly said. “You're the news anchor!”
He paused. “You're here not for business, are you?” There was look in his eyes
that was vaguely hopeful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nah, just visiting my sister and her family,” Amy shook her
head. “Sorry.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s okay,” Eric shook his head. “By any chance, are you
related to Evelyn Barksdale, one of richest people in Nashua?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s our mother,” Helen replied instead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Wow,” Eric shook his head. “You know Helen, you really must
tell me about your family life. Well, see you later.” He left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Should Jake be worried?” Amy asked Helen with a glint in
her eye.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nah. After seeing how <i>bothersome</i> it is to have a
divorce, I’m not divorcing Jake with a <i>very good</i> reason. And his alimony
payments would suck, too.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amy shook her head. “There you go again, killing my sarcasm
with your professionalism. I really ought to take Daria off your hands – who
knows into what she will grow-up.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen shook her head. “No way, Miss Self-Made Woman. You two
are too similar; I hate to think how you will affect each other. ‘Cause, you
could always borrow Daria to do something to Rita, you know I wouldn’t mind.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You should talk about me being ‘self-made’,” Amy shook her
head. “You didn't exactly act dependant to Jake either.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, that’s not true. Jake is a good guy, can be a good
father, and a wonderful ego booster. ‘Course, he is also easily distracted, but
who isn’t?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Good point,” admitted Amy. “You sis, I wonder about Rita.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No, I am not inviting her here.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“God forbid I suggest that! I just wonder. Me – news anchor.
You – a lawyer. Rita – zilch. How come we have that ‘self-making’ gene and she
doesn't?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen shook her head. “Maybe her blondishness makes that’s
impossible?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s not a tangible answer.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“If you’re going to quote that anecdote about blondes and nuclear
physics, forget it. But seriously. Did you forget, dear Amy, that Rita had been
originally <i>cousin</i> Rita?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ah yes. Mom dearest adopted her, after Rita’s parents perished
in a car accident. Sad. Still, shouldn’t there be any similarities?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No offence, but when we were kids, few would be believe
when they met us for the first while, that we three were related. We were
different and we are still different.” Helen shook her head. “You know, Amy, my
lunch is almost finished. ‘Course, you’re always welcome to join me afterwards,
but really,”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Say no more,” Amy replied. “You're not roping me into
aiding you around the office for free. Or aiding your assistant for free,
either. But how about I join you for dinner after work?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“This could work,” Helen nodded. “I end at six; see you at
six-thirty at Morgendorffer residence?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s a deal.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Helen went to the elevator, Eric Schrecter joined her.
“So that was your sister?” he asked Helen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes. Hardly believable, isn't it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“True. You sure that she wasn’t adopted?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No, that would be my other sister, Rita.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You have another sister? Who is she?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don't want to talk about it,” Helen shook her head.
“Rita’s not really a sister of me and Amy; our folks adopted her when her
died.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“A total stranger?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No, a cousin.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You have one weird family, Helen.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“True, so why’s the sudden interest?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well,” Eric looked slightly embarrassed, “I was wondering –
is your sister available? This one, not the other one.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“She is single, if you mean it, and I think she likes being
single.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, I don't know. Many people are single till they meet a
person who is exactly for them.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Eric. You're fifty-two. My sister is thirty-six. It is
unlikely that you two will click.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Are you sure that she is that age.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“She’s four years younger than me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But you don't look forty.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Thanks! I knew that could always pass for thirty-eight if I
tried to look my best.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Eric wanted to say: “That’s not what I <i>meant</i>,” but he
saw, that despite Helen’s carefree tone, her eyes were watchful and rather
angry, and decided not to say it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was better for his health anyways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tiffany and Stacy were walking towards the Food Court section
of the mall. They were in mood for some cheeseless pizza. Suddenly Stacy
stiffened. “Oh my god, Tiffany! There’s Mrs. Landon.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hi, Mrs. Landon!” Tiffany replied instantly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Michelle looked at the two girls, her expression unreadable.
“Who are you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We're Jodie’s friends. From school,” Tiffany drawled-out.
Then she noticed that Stacy was looking panicky and opening her mouth.
Realizing the danger signs, Tiffany turned to her friend. “Stacy, why won’t you
go and order our pizza?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Right,” nodded Stacy, only too eager to leave the presence
of Mrs. Landon. (On top of everything else, Stacy was a little bit cowardly.)
She left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So you are-?” Michelle asked, not sure if she remembered
the name.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Tiffany Blum-Deckler,” Tiffany replied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh yes,” Michelle nodded. “Silly me, forgetting your name.”
She paused. “So tell me, Tiffany, is it lonely for you being the only
Asian-American student in school?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not really. Stacy and Quinn and Sandi are good friends.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But you don't feel like the odd person out because of your
race.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No, and neither does Ms. Li.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Please do not mention Ms. Li to me,” Michelle grimaced.
“That woman is nuts!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So do something about it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Michelle shook her head. “You do not displace a principal because
of personal oddities. Anyhow, you know Jodie, you say?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah, I know her.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So what kind of person do you conceive her to be?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tiffany frowned. It was <i>that</i> kind of a discussion, it
seemed. Somebody, apparently, gotten to Mrs. Landon and knocked her
psychological foundation right from under her feet. “Jodie’s fast. That’s bad.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The tortoise beat the hair.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Stacy’s also fast,” Tiffany added, jabbing her finger at
Stacy, who was standing in line for pizza, looking nervous.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Jodie’s not like her!” Michelle protested.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No, Jodie is smarter, braver. But she is also fast. Stacy
is fast, and fast means hurrying, and hurrying, Stacy runs into a dead end,
because she missed all the other options, hurrying forwards. That’s sad. Jodie
is smart, so it slows her down, but sooner or later she’ll also run into a
dead-end and will have to back-out of it. Stacy has trouble backing-out from
dead ends. I know.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I see. And your other friends, Sandi and Quinn?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“They’re normal.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Michelle looked at Tiffany: was the girl taking her own? But
Tiffany’s face was staying passive, emotionless. Kind of like Helen
Morgendorffer’s eldest daughter’s face. Daria Morgendorffer too was the queen
of deadpan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria Morgendorffer was also smarter than an average high
schooler. Michelle decided to take a risk. “Tiffany,” she said. “What do you
think of <i>me</i>?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You're sad ‘cause you can’t go to work like you used to,”
Tiffany replied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Michelle nodded. Now was the time to ask important questions.
“Tiffany. Somebody asked me to work for them. I don’t like that somebody, but I
do want to work. What do you think I should do?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I think you should work there, but try to establish clear
rules around your relationship. Few work-place romances ended successfully.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Michelle snorted. “Thanks, Tiffany. See ya.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey, where did Mrs. Landon go?” Stacy asked, arriving with
the pizza a few moments later. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We talked. She left,” Tiffany said indifferently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh. Right.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen’s phone rang. “Who is it?” she spoke into the phone.
“Amy?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No mom, it’s me. Daria.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh hi, Daria. How are your father and Quinn?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“They’re amongst the living,” Daria replied dryly. “Why’d
you confuse me with aunt Amy? We don't sound so similarly, you know.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh honey, your aunt Amy is in town. She wanted to visit
you, and you’re away in Boston. She’s joined me for a house dinner.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh really? Can we cut our trip short and join you girls?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh honey, but what about your father?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I'll ask him,” Daria promised. She shouted off phone:
“Dad?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, Daria?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Aunt Amy is coming for a home dinner. Can we go home to
join her and mom?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Great idea, kiddo! Why, I-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Thanks, dad!” Daria quickly interrupted Jake and spoke back
into the receiver. “No problem mom, we’ll meet you at dinner-time. Bye!” she
hanged-up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen was left shaking her head. What did Jake do to embarrass
even Daria?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Okay dad, you’re off the hook,” Daria turned to her father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jake stood in a distance, dripping wet. “Thanks, kiddo! I
owe you one! But why did that blasted dolphin try to pull me into the ocean-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“’Cause you smell of fish, dad,” Quinn replied, staying away
from him. “’Course, now you smell of something else entirely. I really think
that you should change your clothing once we return home.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Good idea, kiddo, and home we are going!” Jake replied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The three Morgendorffers got into their car and rode away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Michelle Landon searched for Linda Griffin. Eventually, she
found her sitting on a bench near the fountain, still sipping her black coffee.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Linda?” Michelle asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mm-hmm?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Remember, what you said about a business manager?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, even if I wanted to get that job – and I’m not saying
yes or no, mind you – my husband would find several very good and logical
reasons why I shouldn’t. What can you say to <i>that</i>, hah?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Luckily for you, an acquaintance of mine came to town for a
family visit, who can beat logical single-handedly, if we ask her.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“A female relative of yours?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No, of Helen Morgendorffer. Want to go and ask her to help
you with your husband.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Michelle nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amy’s cell phone rang. “Who is it?” she spoke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Amy, it’s me, Helen. Jake and the girls <i>are</i> coming
to join us for dinner. This means that Jake will be cooking, so could you buy
us some stomach pills and soda as well?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Roger,” nodded Amy, who knew by now how Morgendorffer
family dynamics worked. “See ya later.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes.” Amy hanged-up. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Amy!” Amy turned around. Linda Griffin was coming up to
her, with some unfamiliar woman in tow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Linda,” Amy nodded. “Who’s your friend?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s Michelle Landon. She wants to work for me, but
afraid that her husband will ensnare her in logic. Can you help us in dealing
with that man?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why not?” shrugged Amy. “Lead-on!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The three women found Andrew Landon in a small breakfast
café, eating, surprisingly, eggs and ham. “Hello dear,” Michelle spoke in
carefully controlled voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Andrew looked-up and frowned. He knew his wife and very well
and smelled trouble. “Hello Michelle. What do you want?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Me and Linda Griffin here agreed that I go to work for her
as a business manager.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Impossible. We cannot leave Evan and Rachel alone.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Jodie can take care of them.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Jodie got her extracurriculars.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Jodie can lose some extracurriculars.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Excuse me, Michelle. In today’s society, if one wants to be
successful in politics, one has to-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Excuse me,” Amy wedged-in. “But what if Jodie doesn't want
to go to politics? What if she wants to go to business, or something.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Business! That’s a good one!” Andrew laughed. “I won’t
allow it!” Too late he noticed his wife’s face become several times darker.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That does it, Andrew Landon!” Michelle snapped. “I'm going
to work, and if Jodie will want to dump all of her extracurriculars, she’ll
find my support behind her full-time, no matter what she does. Let’s go,
Linda!” They left, with Amy looking at Andrew Landon one last time. “You really
should know your wife better,” she said, then left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Penny and Jane were standing, looking at the Morgendorffer
house, when Jake, Daria and Quinn arrived. Without a word, Jake marched inside,
dripping wet and smelling to high heaven. Quinn and Daria followed, carrying a
large package. “Can we come in?” Jane asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah, sure,” Daria snorted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A short time later she and Jane were sitting on a couch in
Morgendorffers’ living room. “So what happened to your dad?” Jane asked. “He
caught that giant cod but fell into the water with it,” Daria said. “He became
saturated with fish smell, and so, a short time later, a hungry porpoise jumped
out of the water and tried to eat him. Dad got so scared, that he wet his pants
from the inside in a big way, before life guards didn't separate him from the
porpoise.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeowch!” Jane shuddered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He also used that cod to hit a seal on the head,” Daria replied.
“I don’t think either me or Quinn will want to go to Boston any time soon.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Speaking of Quinn, she’s been in kitchen for too long for
her,” Jane said. “Wonder what’s up?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why are you here?” Penny asked Quinn, who just sat at the
table, looking vague. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Got nothing to do, I guess,” Quinn shrugged. “I’m not sure
if I can phone Sandi, I don’t want to phone Stacy or Tiffany, and Daria and
Jane are too busy talking to each other – I don’t want to wedge-in.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Smart kid,” Penny snorted. “Now buzz off and bother your
dad.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nah, he’s asleep in the shower. Today’s events were too
much for him.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Okay, buzz-off anyways.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nah, I want to see what will you be doing with the cod.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I'll roast it with potatoes and onions,” Penny replied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You will? How?” Quinn looked genuinely interested. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Let’s see. Do you have any: onion bulbs, potatoes,
tomatoes, vinegar and cooking oil?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“All present!” Quinn said proudly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Good. Then watch and learn, or at least keep quiet.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Roger.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Jodie returned home, she saw her father, Andrew Landon,
looking angrily through a phone book. “Dad?” she asked. “Where’s mom?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Your mother,” Andrew snapped, “decided to return to
work-force, and now I’m stuck in finding a baby-sitter for Rachel and Evan.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I could do it,” Jodie said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You have extracurriculars.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I could dump some.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Impossible!” Andrew began, but there was a knock on the
door. Jodie opened it. There stood Mack, looking worried.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mack wasn't feeling very self-assured, to tell the truth.
His movie-watching with Sandi Griffin ended-up with them grasping hands of each
other, and that was disturbing and uncomfortable. After all, Jodie was the
whole focus here, wasn't she?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Look, Jodie, I got you a gift,” Mack said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jodie look – and her face fell. “Mack, you gave me
underwear?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You don't like it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But Sandi said it was stylish!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What does Sandi has to do with this?!!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Um…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Son, get lost,” Andrew appeared behind Jodie, “and on another
note, never admit to a girl that another girl helped you buy underwear for
her.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jodie’s face turned purple. “Dad! Go to Hell and take Mack
with you!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What’s going-on?” It was Michelle Landon; Mack thought it’d
be for the best if he faded into the background.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Dad just gave Mack some advice – that’s all!!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, Jodie, your father today is just a <i>well-spring</i>
of advice, that he is,” Michelle said. “What advice did he give Mack?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The best way to buy me underwear for presents!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ah yes, Michael Jordan Mackenzie, right. So Jodie, why did
he buy you underwear? Are you two past being friends, already?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No! I’m just not interested in him!!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, that’s good. I saw him with Sandi Griffin today.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I know! She helped him buy it!!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Who cares! I may be gay anyway!” Jodie stomped upstairs.
When she reached upstairs, there was a thud from below. “Jodie?” Michelle’s
voice came from below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah?!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Call an ambulance. Your father suffered from a mild heart attack
and dropped on the floor.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Helen and Amy came to the Morgendorffer house, inside a
semi-idyll awaited them: Jane and Daria were chatting at a couch, Penny was
setting the table, Quinn was talking to Sandi on the phone: “So Sandi, I’m
sorry I didn't call you earlier: we were in Boston. Yes, Boston. No, no
souvenirs – dad took us fishing. Okay, I'll ask Daria. I’m sorry that you got
grounded.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Quinn!” Helen called-out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sandi, got to go. Mom wants me for something.” Quinn put
down the receiver and turned and faced her mother and her aunt. “Hi mom, hi
aunt Amy!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What did your father do today?” Helen took the bull by the
horns.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Um,” Quinn said. Meanwhile, Jane turned-on the Morgendorffer
family TV:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“…Aqua-man! Next on Sick, Sad, World!” the TV blared, as pictures
of Jake hitting a seal on the head with a fish and then being pulled underwater
by a porpoise, appeared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Click! Jane quickly turned-off the TV, but insufficiently
quickly, for Helen and Amy saw the whole gist. “Where is Jake?” Helen asked
Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Upstairs,” Daria said weakly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen marched upstairs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Helen returned, with pale and chastened Jake in tow,
the table was all set. “Nice recipe,” Amy turned to Penny. “Cook much?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Had to,” Penny shrugged. “I travelled the world, you know?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That she did,” said everyone else at the table minus Jake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So what is this?” Helen asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That codfish that your husband took, roasted with potatoes
and onions. I used the end part, because the front part was somewhat damaged.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jake cringed as Helen glared at him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So aunt Amy,” Daria turned to her aunt. “Why are you here?
Not to have mom sue somebody for you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nah, I've been given some vacation time, to use it or lose
it,” Amy shrugged. “I decided to spend it with my family – and <i>not</i> with
your aunt Rita, who wanted to crash at my place, because of some house problems
with hers.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How <i>is</i> cousin Erin, by the way?” Quinn asked. “Still
married to that Brian guy?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don't know, Rita never said,” Amy shrugged. “So Jake,
Helen, what brought that sudden trip to Boston on? Not fishing, I presume?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nah, Daria just wanted to leave Lawndale instead of going
to college, and mom had to bond with her in order from prevent this from
happening,” Quinn explained.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amy arched an eyebrow. “That I got to know. What happened,
in detail?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She was told.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the tale was finished, Amy’s eyes grew round. “Good
thing mother didn't know about this,” she told Helen. “Otherwise she’d be upon
you just like <i>that</i>!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Tell me about it,” Helen agreed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn, meanwhile, turned to Daria. “So Daria, what did Sandi
mean when she asked me to ask you about souvenirs?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria looked confused. “Maybe we sold her one when we were
little, I don't know.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Lots of customers, hah?” Amy snorted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Enough,” Penny shrugged. “There’s a sucker born every minute.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And on that heartfelt advice we’ll finish this dinner,”
Helen said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was also dinner-time in the Griffin household. “Sandi?”
Linda called-out to her daughter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, mom?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You're un-grounded. I'm overreacted yesterday, alright?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Fine,” nodded Sandi, deciding not to press for an apology. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You seem to be in a good mood tonight, dear,” Tom Griffin
pointed from his seat at the table.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes. I got myself a good business manager,” Linda replied
curtly. There was the sound of a phone ringing. “Yes?” Linda spoke into it.
“Oh. So sorry. If you want to change your mind… no? All right, I'll see you
tomorrow, then. Bye.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She hanged-up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Michelle Landon turned her cell-phone off. “Jodie,” she told
her daughter, “I’m off to work tomorrow, and you’ll have to watch Rachel and
Evan tomorrow.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No problem. I could do it for even <i>more</i> than one
day,” Jodie replied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Good. You heard Dr. Phillips – your father will have to
stay for at least two weeks in the hospital.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Roger.” The car with the two Landon women drove-on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another phone rang in the Mackenzie residence. “Yes?” spoke
Mack. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mack, it’s me. Sandi. So how did things with Jodie go?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Badly. She wasn’t happy, and I think I chose a bad time to
come to them, too.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh. Well, that’s too bad. Another time, maybe?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah, maybe,” Mack agreed. “Say, Sandi – if you ever want
to go to the movies – I'll be more than happy to escort you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s a deal.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once again, night slowly fell onto the town of Lawndale. A
new day was coming, and once again, it will be bringing new changes. </p>
