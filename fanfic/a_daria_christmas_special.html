<p class=MsoNormal><b>“Casa Lane,” Lawndale
(Essex County, Massachusetts)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I wish all a merry
Christmas, I wish all a merry Christmas, I wish all a merry Christmas, and a
happy New Year!” Jane Lane was singing outloud, safe in the comforts of Casa Lane.
Well, in relative comfort anyways, ‘cause Casa Lane wasn’t that comfortable or
secure, compared to other houses - even that of Morgendorffers’. They, at
least, were all home for Christmas. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Talking again to yourself,
Lane? Sounds like you’ve got dementia, or something!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, apparently, that went
for almost all of them. “Daria?” Jane turned around. “Why aren’t you at your
place?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Did you see the weather
outside?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hm-m? The weather outside?
What about it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Remember the time we got
heat with that hurricane? Well, now it’s a snowstorm, worse than the one we had
in the mountains, remember?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane looked outside. “Whoa,
whoa, and whoa-hoa-hoa! You sure you don't want to trudge it through the snow,
singing Christmas carols along the way?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria shook her head. “I
check the Morgendorffers’ answering machine. Dad is snowed-in at his office,
mom - at hers. Quinn and the rest of her fashion clique are at the Millennium
Mall. It seems that Y2K if not quite here, then it is coming here in style!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane shrugged. She may
always wanted to be alone on a holiday with a television dinner, but Daria’s
company was good and tolerable enough, and besides, judging from the weather, a
good person would not send a dog or a cat out, let alone another person. “Very
well Daria, you may stay,” she said. “Pity that Trent isn't here, you know? Bet
then this place would be warm enough for even me!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria paused, giving Jane
an evil eye. “You know, the only reason why you’re still living is because I do
not want to spend a snowstorm in an empty, alien house. If this was <i>my</i>
place, you’d be struck dead already.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“By lightning? This happens
only in a cyclone,” Jane snorted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And aren't we just a
little Miss Weather Network,” Daria replied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nah, not really. Just that
some of older Lanes once brought forth a black-and-white movie called “Vertical
Ascent”, and it talked about some alpinists scaling a mountain. There was this
cyclone, and, you know-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m surprised that you
didn't try to paint no mountains,” Daria shrugged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane looked peevish. “I
can’t do them Daria, seriously. When it comes to landscape painting, I can do
forests or open spaces; I just can’t do no mountains! It’s extremely
frustrating!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why is it so?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane shrugged. “Search me;
ask my muse; I have no answer.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was Daria’s turn to
shrug. “Good point; but cyclone or no cyclone, I am damn glad that Li didn’t
try to pull off no Wilderness Adventure Weekend this time. It’d be a disaster
even for Lawndale!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Aw, come on, last time you
and I made it fine!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah, to miles off course!
We're lucky that it was my folks and DeMartino, who awaited us at point B, you
know?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Excuse me? I seem to
remember a $50 worth of hush money because of your folks and DeMartino.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Come on! ‘Popeye the
Sailor Man? Toot, toot!’? Lane, you’re not insane?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Point taken,” Daria
shrugged. “Let’s change the topic. So where are your folks?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane shrugged. “I'll be
damned if I know.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Caucasus Mountains,
Azerbaijan</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We're happy, Mr. Lane,
that you’ve come to us to help us complete our photo-essé,” the tall Azeri man
was telling Vincent Lane. “Now those corrupt bastards in Baky won't be able to
close their eyes on what their precious friends in Mother Russia are doing to
our nature!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Vincent Lane nodded
absent-mindedly. Ever since he began to work as a free-lance photographer, he
learned that unbiased and unattached nature worked best for him. His current clients
will stay (or at least plan to stay) here, in Azerbaijan, while he… well, he
might be working for “those corrupt bastards in Baky”, or “their precious
friends in Mother Russia” - it all was more chancy and less orderly than a game
of cards. “And the war never ends, if your whole world depends, on a turn of a
friendly card”, Vincent Lane hummed softly under his nose. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, he certainly could
say that. Once a hippy, Vincent Lane quickly realized that no protests could
change the world; “the man” was bigger than D.C., and besides - he liked to
photography. But ordinary, selective photography, couldn’t properly feed even
him and Amanda - and Amanda, damn her, seemed to be popping kids every other
time he returned after a long photo-shoot. Vincent had a sneaking suspicion
that those kids weren't his at all - or at least not all of them. Oh well.
While he wasn’t Charles Ruttheimer Jr. or Steve Taylor, who were really hang-up
on sex, he wasn’t that loyal to his wife either. Quite possible, in some part
of the world or other, there was a kid with his colouring and some really weird
facial features. Oh well. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mr. Lane, we’re here?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Vincent took a full-length
view of the large mountain-side cave. “So this is it?” he asked his entourage -
a man and a woman. “Very lovely.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That was true, of course -
the mountains were impressive, even if Vincent was no alpinist; but this
statement was also a bit of a suck-up - those never were out of place, if you
were dealing with fierce patriots of any country - always praise national
landscape - you’ll never know the difference that it’ll make. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why thank you,” the woman
nodded. “Well then, the apparati seems to be properly established, let’s
shoot?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“All right,” Vincent
nodded, turning completely professional. “So what are the orders?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“First - shoot the mouth,
the cave’s opening,” the man said. “Then a couple of interiour shots.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“All right.” Vincent cast a
critical gaze around, calculated the sun’s angle and camera’s reflection and
best shooting distance, and took a shot a photo.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With a big, big flash. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Instantly, there was a
flutter of wings, and millions, billions, <i>trillions</i> of bats came
fluttering out, their mouths open and ready to bite. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And bite they did. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bats’ squeals
cluttering his ears, Vincent Lane thought that he never ever thought that he
was going to die on a Caucasian mountainside from bitten to death by a bunch of
mutant bats.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Yellowstone National Park,
Wyoming</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh boy, oh joy!” Amanda
Lane rubbed her hands with excitement. “I knew that coming here was a good
idea!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amanda Lane was in a very
good mood, and she felt that she had every right to be. She was standing in the
Yellowstone National Park, watching as Old Faithful and other geysers discharged
their hot water charges into the air. Amanda scratched, accidentally
remembering something that Courtney and Adrian told her:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>…Deep in the heart of
Urborg lie massive volcanoes whose thick black smoke covers the land with
perpetual darkness.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amanda shook her head. From
where did <i>that</i> come from? Courtney and Adrian weren't that hang-up on
the modern-day game cards; the last thing she heard they and Summer were
somewhere in Arizona. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amanda shook her head. What
on earth did possess her to name her oldest daughter Summer? It was probably
Vincent’s fault, for not caring one thing. Vincent was a nice person deep
inside, but as he travelled the world and his view broadened, he seemed to be
growing more and more cynical - something that was not good for an artist or an
artisan of any sort. Instead, Vincent was seemingly growing more
politically-based every time they met, which weren’t often, not lately. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amanda looked thoughtful.
Maybe Helen had been right, all those years ago. Maybe it hadn’t been such a
good match, her and Vincent. In fact, Helen was probably right - Vincent proposed
to her only to escape the military draft. Maybe, just maybe, they should’ve
stayed friends. And maybe, just maybe…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amanda stiffened. Something
was wrong. The ground was shaking. She must’ve let her mind wonder for too
long. It happened once, in Tanzania, on Serengeti Plain. And as once before,
back then, when a rhino chased her and Vince all the way to a nearest baobab,
Amanda put forth an amazing burst of speed, climbing quickly the nearest fur
tree!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>VROOM! BOOM!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A geyser blew-up - the same
geyser over which Amanda was standing scant minutes before. “It’s a good thing
that I have good reactions,” Amanda muttered to herself. “Otherwise I would’ve
gotten such an enema, that I would never need one again.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amanda sighed, and began to
climb down. Climb up was easy, climbing down - that was the challenge!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Flagstaff, Arizona</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Any idea where they can
be?” Summer Lane snapped angrily at a completely innocent desk clerk. “Look
buster: you talked rings around me for hours now; now did you see my kids or
not?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The desk clerk - whose last
name was Mormot - paled. He remembered the imps passing through. The “dynamic
duo” had completely trashed the hotel, and all he had received from them was
some sort of a pseudo-wise saying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>…Whether for good or ill,
their arrival always means change.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, that’s them,” Summer
nodded. “Ever since they hooked up on that stupid card game, they been quoting
off it for months. In which direction did they leave?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“In that-a way, Madame,”
the young man replied, doing a gradual sweep of his arm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don't be a show-off!”
Summer growled. “Tell me in which <i>exact</i> direction did they leave? Or
what <i>I</i> am going to do to your place and to you will make their deeds
look <i><u>pale</u></i> and <i><u>anaemic</u></i> in comparison! Where did they go?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The young man sighed. Talk
about a perfect man-trap! Looks quite touchy and beautiful, but got sharper
teeth than a manticore! I think I heard a police record of two juvenile car
thieves matching the description of your kids. They were driving towards Little
Colorado.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What’s Little Colorado?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“A river in the state’s
northeast. I think they were going to cross it or something.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Summer paled. “Oh F*ck.
They’re going to some national park or monument there - got to go!” she
raced-off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The clerk sighed. That was
some f*cked-up family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>North Las Vegas, Nevada</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How do I always get in
those messes?” Wind Lane whined to no one in particular. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You got me,” his inmate
shrugged. “What are you here for, Colombo?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wind crossed his eyes in
distaste. He was a mature, educated man, dammit! Why couldn’t he find onto
himself a proper woman and wife?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Please don’t call me
that,” he said. “The name’s Lane. Wind Lane. I’m here for-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Wait, wait, let me guess.
From your kosher outlook and attitude, I'll say - fraud or alimony problems.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The latter, I’m afraid,”
Wind sighed. “And who are you, and why are you here?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The name’s Horatio, mate,”
the man looked down at Wind. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Like Shakespeare?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“One’d wish! No, my da - he
was a really educated man, all that antique literature and stuff. Got a brother
named Petrionius, and another one named Ovid, and so I am Horatio. But you can
call Parrot. I don’t mind.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So what are you here for?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Parrot-Horatio sighed.
“Various things. Lockpicking, mainly.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Then why’re you still
here?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s not easy, mate, nor
simple. Busting out is the easy part, it’s what to do next is hard. Besides, I
have no place to go.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I have,” Wind said slyly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh? Where?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“In Bozeman, Montana.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Bozeman, Montana, eh?”
Parrot said. “That a mighty long distance, one that would require cash - and a
bundle of it to make. ‘Course, it’s a mighty fine hidey-hole to go to when
you’re in trouble down here in Nevada.” He looked calculatingly at Wind. “You
got any money stashed away, Domicello?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wind almost grimaced in
distaste, but held himself in check. He <i>did</i> need this guy, after all.
“Yes, I got some money stashed. In Vegas proper,” he said. “Can't be a scam
artist without learning those things, you know?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“A scam artist, eh? And
about alimonies?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s my scam,” Wind
shrugged. “To my other people - mainly my mom and dad - I’m a flake that can’t
get married; but let me tell you, my friend-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Wait a sec!” Horatio
quickly skidded down to Wind. “Here’s the thing. You go there, watch-out for
the guards and continue to create a soundproof distraction, while I work on the
lock.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How long will it take?”
Wind asked nervously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Horatio smirked. “You're a
scam artist, I’m a lockpicking artist. Not long.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>San Lorenzo, Honduras</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>‘I knew I shouldn’t have
left Nicaragua!’ Penny mentally told herself. ‘Heck, I should’ve never ever
come to Central America in the first place! Back in Kitimat, British Columbia,
I could’ve had a booming business roaring, but no, I had to come to
arts-and-crafts homeland, Honduras and Nicaragua!’</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That, as far as Penny could
see, was a bust. In Corinto, Nicaragua, fair enough, things were pretty down;
but compared to Ampala and San Lorenzo in Honduras, things were pretty good down
there. ‘Unfortunately, I cannot go that way - my big mouth and Glue took care
of <i>that</i>,’ Penny thought acidly. It was bad enough that the local
separatists of Aguacatec race were planning to storm Tegucigalpa and conquer
the whole damn country; even worse were those refugees from El Salvador
(foreign provokers, most likely) were urging the separatists forward; worser
still were the separatists’ mercenary “allies”, who cared little for politics,
but plenty for cash; no, the worst thing in this mess, Penny thought was Glue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Or whatever he called
himself these days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Glue, Penny knew though and
through, was trouble. The first time he and Penny met was in Quebec, where he
was working for the Quebec separatists. Penny, of course, was then young and
foolish and more interested in the Tete de Boule Cree and Algonquin native art,
but Glue caught her eye even then. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Only back then he wasn’t
Glue, but Louis. Louis something, she couldn't remember his last name. That
wasn't the point anyways. The point was, was even back then in the tender times
of teenage years, Glue was someone bad. He was an anarchist and a blatant
anti-capitalist, if pressed hard enough. He was also a ‘good and thorough’
follower of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin, and his dream was to herd the populace of
some small country to happiness with an iron hand. <i>That</i> Penny learned a
few years later after Quebec, when she was in what would become later Nunavut,
studying art of Naskapi and Labrador Inuit. And guess what - Glue popped up
there too. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Only now his name wasn’t
Louis Something, it was Robert. Robert Zimmerman, and he was by then quite
mercenary; in fact he was a member of a small group of mercenaries, hired by
the government of Northwest Territories, stirring trouble between the two ethic
groups. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And it was then Penny and
Glue came into first contact. Penny became sort of indebted to Glue (being
saved from a rabid polar bear does that to people, even to a daughter of
Vincent and Amanda Lane), and sort of worked for a while with him and the
mercenaries, till the separation of Nunavut became unavoidable. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Still, back then Glue -
Robert Zimmerman, or whatever - was still learning the ropes. Back then he was
clearly unhappy working for a capitalist government, and was planning to do
some for an autocratic one later. Whether that was because the payment was
higher or his ideology fire was going-on brighter, Penny wasn’t so sure. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, however, that was no
longer the case. Glue was still with his old chums, only now he was promoted to
a higher position, and was using his advantage to go even higher, to become
more notorious. Then again, as Penny listened to Glue’s plan of doing things to
trains and ‘choppers, he had also gained much experience. Last time they met,
Glue could only talk in various English and French dialects; now he apparently
knew Spanish and Portuguese too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He’s a smart man, no?” a
man spoke next to Penny. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Penny crossed her Alcuado
was a metiso, a cross-breed, and a former cattle rustler. He was also damn good
with a knife, a gun, and a lasso. In short, somebody to be reckoned with. Then
again, probably every person in the room was somebody to be reckoned with, as
Glue pointed out. He was like that, this Glue - always saw the most potential
in people. Unfortunately, he used his gift for evil - or maybe he <i>was</i>
evil. Yes, that’s it, he was evil, and so was everybody else in this room -
only not as evil as Glue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Then what am I doing
here?” Penny mumbled. “God, was it only because I helped rustle some drugs over
the border?” Yeah, that must be it. She rustled some drugs in company of
Alcuado next to her, and couple of Spaniards - close comrades of Alcuado. And
as a result, she got recruited by Glue and his co-workers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Penny groaned. All she
wanted at this point was to safely return home, and… “God, if I ever return
home, I'll make a candle to the Blessed Virgin out of a pound of wax with my
own hands,” Penny silently prayed. “Please, let me return home in alive and in
one piece!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Petrified Forest National
Park, Arizona</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“This has got to be the
most embarrassing moment in our whole lives at this point,” Courtney was saying
to Adrian. “I mean, when you think about it via hindsight - two kids stuck on a
220-million-year-old tree, chased there by a crazed wild pig, that’s got to be
something for a family album.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Adrian thought about it.
“Nah,” he said. “I heard once that in Africa grandma Amanda got treed by a
rhino. Compared to him our wild pig is no big thing.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not unless it is compared
to us!” Courtney groaned. “<i>I</i> wanted to Wupatki National Monument and all
that; instead here we are, freezing our asses of a cold, cold rock of a tree,
looking down at a boar that’s been overdosed testosterone by Mother Nature! If
only we had a gun…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“If only we had Rufus,”
Adrian replied, thinking. Rufus was the pet of Summer and her family -
supposedly an Airedale, but as big as a donkey and with similarly-tuned
attitude. He wiped the floor with Adrian, Courtney and their siblings from time
to time. Adrian was willing to bet that Rufus would’ve wiped the whole National
Park with that lame-d*ck pig. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Actually, it wasn't a pig;
it was peccary. While the actual biological differences were too fine to be
pondered upon by any person but the most stalwart biologist, the crunch was
this: this male peccary was in heat, but since he lost his heard to a younger
rival, he was about to take-out his frustrations on two youngest Lanes freely. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, he would’ve, if he
could just reach them. Courtney and Adrian, apparently, got something of their
grandma Amanda in them, for they scaled the petrified tree in a matter of
minutes - something that they wouldn't be able to repeat for a long time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, at this point in
time, neither kid was able to recognize it. All they wanted was that damn pig
to find somebody else to bother, or, possibly, to hump. Looking at how… excited
he was, the two kids had their doubts that the pig wanted to kill them; in
fact, Courtney secretly hoped that the pig wouldn't go and relieve his
frustrations on them in no <i>other</i> way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Courtney was thinking
those hardly encouraging thoughts, the pig squalled. It wasn’t a
“wee-wee-wee-wee” of a pig from a Mother Goose rhyme; it was more a shrill
squeal that penetrated the kids’ skulls and caused their already fickle grasps
to weaken on cold, cold stone tree. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mommy!” the pair yelled,
abandoning their maturity to the winds. “Mommy!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I hear you!” Summer
yelled, appearing out of nowhere. “Yo, you prig! Bugger off and live my kids
alone!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The pig roared. Admittedly,
it was a somewhat of an <i>oinking</i> roar than the type associating with
lions and tigers and bears, but it was a roar still, and a quite good one, too.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the pig charged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And Summer fled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Courtney and Adrian watched
wide-eyed as their mom re-appeared a moment later, driving a car. Before their
open eyes the vehicle smashed into a pig and smashed itself and the pig I a
petrified tree behind them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unfortunately, that was the
same petrified tree that Courtney and Adrian were hanging-on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, at that moment
more genes of grandma Amanda activated, and the pair leapt scant moments before
the big </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>KA-BOOM!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The car blew-up,
effectively scattering its’ own parts, the pig’s guts and tree’s chips all over
Courtney, Adrian, and their mother.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The kids looked at each
other. “Got anything to say, kids?” Summer asked two of her four children
sternly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Adrian paused. He
remembered something…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>…As a rite of passage,
Kipamu youths taunt razorbacks with long sticks … then flee.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>…but he doubted that it
would be appropriate at this moment. He and his sister shook their heads. “No,”
they said in unison.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Then let’s go,” Summer
said in a no-nonsense tone. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Where to?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Away from here?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s not what we meant,”
Courtney shook her head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Summer sighed. The shock
was obviously wearing-off. “How about Zuni? It’s a pueblo in New Mexico,” she
suggested.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Neither of the kids knew
what a pueblo was, and they did want to get out of this national park <i>badly</i>,
so they nodded agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so, the three Lanes
left. Together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“This sucks,” Trent turned
to Nick. “Any idea where Monique and her Harpies are? We could really use
‘Leviathan’s’ snow-plough nose-thingy, you know?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Max heard that. “Aw, come
on! We’ve already got my Tank! It’s indestructible!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We don't need to destroy
it - unless we’re going to use it for a bonfire,” Nick snapped. “What we need
is a damn snow plough with a whole lot of horsepower behind it to <i>push</i>!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah, well, my Tank got a
whole of <i>push</i>, you-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Jesse!” Trent hurriedly
interrupted the other two. “What’s the sitch?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Bad,” Jesse replied in his
usual manner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We know that it’s <i>bad</i>,
Jesse,” Trent sighed tiredly. “What we need to know is <i>how</i>. Can the Tank
make it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nah-ah,” a perky young
red-head popped from behind the largest member of Mystik Spiral. “It’s up to <i>his</i>
waist.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Daria’s sister. What’re
you doing here?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I <i>was</i> shopping, but
<i>now</i> I’m stuck here you with you all.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You can always get
unstuck,” Trent suggested helpfully. Daria’s younger sister wasn't what they
needed at all. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nah-ah,” Quinn shook her
head. “If I get to get stuck in a snow-bound mall, I'll get stuck with the
people I know won't take advantage of me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Your friends?” Trent asked
curtly. He couldn’t tell Daria’s sister to get lost after all; Daria would eat
him alive for that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We got separated from each
other in the throng. It’s a real, what was that word Daria used - ah, yes,
Hodynka when the lights flickered out. I was lucky enough to find <i>him</i>,”
Quinn pointed at Jesse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He has a name,” Trent said
irritably.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What-ever. Look, you guys
got a very big van - can’t you drive it or something?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s what I was telling
them!” Max perked-up. “My Tank isn’t one of those flimsy passenger cars - it’s
indestructible!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trent sighed. “Look,
Daria’s sister, and you too Max. The Tank <i>is </i>a mighty powerful car, fair
enough. But it doesn’t have a plough to push the snow before and away from it -
without one it’ll flounder like the rest of them. And the Harpies’ ‘Leviathan’
got one of them attached - for this reason, I'll bet.” Trent paused. “Say,
Daria’s sister - do you have a cell phone?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well yeah, why?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Couldn't you phone Daria
or Janey and let them know what’s up?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn and Jesse
simultaneously shook their heads. “I tried already,” Quinn said irritably.
“Daria’s at <i>your</i> and your sister’s place, and I can't contact them for
some reason.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trent sighed, remembering
the procrastinated phone bill of Casa Lane. “Nevermind,” he said glumly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why do you need my sister
for anyways?” Quinn asked, curiously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“To contact Monique!” Trent
sighed in exasperation. “The ‘Leviathan’ is just what we need.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh? Really?” Quinn
perked-up suddenly. “Then that’s okay. Me too got Monique’s cell phone’s number
- lemme try!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now it was time for Mystik
Spiral to perk up. With eyes aglow with hope they watched as Quinn dialled
Monique’s number. “Hello? Monique? This is Daria’s sister - can you talk to
Trent?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, this is depressing,”
Daria sighed loudly. “I never thought I'll say that, but I’m <i>really</i>
depressed. This is almost as bad as getting stuck on a mountain.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey, we’re warmer than
back then, at least,” Jane argued.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria gave her
partner-in-crime an evil eye. “That's a fact, oh mighty guru? How ‘bout the
fact that we’re sitting in the middle of your living room, fully dressed,
draped with some spare blankets, almost next to your mother’s kiln - fully
functional one, by the way - and we still don't feel too toasty warm, eh?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Daria, chill,” Jane
paused. “Wrong word there. It’s just that you’re depressed that the TV doesn't
work. “I honour and respect you as a friend, you know that?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So don’t take it too
personally Jane, but your TV, your telephone, your central heating - they all
don't work! Basically, we stuck in an elaborately-shaped plywood-and-cement box
to keep the freezing cold out - and it’s a very thin-skinned box too. Jane,
I've been in warmer cars than this.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Me too,” Jane sighed.
“’Course, Trent probably didn't pack as 
much heat for me as he did for you, eh?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria turned towards Jane,
the look on her bespectacled face slightly manic. “Jane, don't mess with me,
girl-friend. At this rate, they’ll won’t find your corpse till all the snow
melts - and it hasn't finished falling, either.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane edged away slightly.
Her words obviously didn't do the reaction she hoped they would have. “Look,
Daria, maybe…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was a knock on the
door. “Who is it?” Jane yelled loudly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Janey? Is Daria with you?
Come out quickly - the snow grows higher as I speak?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Neither girl wasted anytime
- since they were fully dressed. They just grasped their blankets,
instinctively turned-off the kiln and raced outside, where two vans - Spiral’s
Tank and Harpies’ Leviathan were waiting. The Tank’s door was open. Daria and
Jane almost literally dived into it - the wind was blazing cold - and it slammed
shut. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Where are we going?” Daria
asked, her teeth chattering. The void-gazing was getting too close for comfort
to her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“To your house, Daria,”
Trent replied, sighing. “Ours is probably nothing more than a
plywood-and-cement box at this point.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria sighed herself.
“Sure. You provide the transportation, we provide the housing.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trent nodded into the depth
of the van. “Monique?” Quinn voice came from that direction. “Tell your driver
to go-go-<b>go!</b>”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Roaring, the vans drove
off, their taillights vanishing in the deepening evening dusk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria awoke from the sun
shining brightly in her face. “Where were you the day before?” she exhaled,
loudly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“At the mall,” replied the
sun in a completely Quinn-like voice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria’s eyes flashed-open.
“Wha-? Ha-? What the-?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“D<b>a</b>ri<b>a</b>,

<p class=MsoNormal>“After we all got to
Chateau Morgendorffer - not a thing,” Daria shook her head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Me neither!” Jane
looked-up from the couch in Quinn’s bedroom. “Me and Daria just barged into the
first warm room and fell asleep.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah, <b>my</b> room,”
Quinn said grouchily. “I had to take-off your boots and stuff. Ew!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Poor Quinn,” Jane smirked.
“And there me and your sister were, yesterday, freezing our asses off at Casa
Lane.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You mean the
plywood-and-cement box with very thin walls?” Quinn replied, half-mockingly.
“Still, I think the weather crisis is over - what was it yesterday? Another
hurricane?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m leaning towards a
blizzard or a snowstorm,” Daria shook her head. “Where are the others?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“In <i>your</i> room or in
the parents’ bedroom,” Quinn shrugged. “<i>You </i>go and talk to them. They’re
<i>your</i> friends - mainly.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah, sure,” Jane grunted,
getting up. “So what happened yesterday?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I ran into them at the
mall yesterday, got Monique on my cell for Trent, Monique and the Harpies came
on their Dragon Wagon, and all of us hightailed it out of there, stopping only
briefly for <i>you</i> two.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And the others?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The road was becoming
re-covered behind the Tank as we watched,” Quinn shook her head. “No do, I'm
afraid.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yo youngsters - you up?”
Monique stuck her head in the door. “By the way - nice room, Daria. Very Gothic
and depressing.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Thanks,” Daria replied, as
she, Jane and Quinn also exited the room. She paused, suddenly. “What’s that
noise?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, it’s just Jesse and
Effïndïe, making for <i>all</i> of us a <i>major</i> omelette with green
onions. There are portions for you three too.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn opened her mouth to
complain, then closed it. After yesterday she couldn't be too choosy, and
besides, there were probably eleven or so people in the house - how big a
portion could she get? Besides, she was curious, as to what would an omelette
with green onions taste like? Therefore, she said nothing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria, however, wasn't
satisfied. “I don’t think so, Monique. That sound sounded more like…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, that we were,” Helen
replied, softening down somewhat, “even if we <i>have been</i> stuck in big

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, that’s just Daria’s

looked very uncomfortable. </p>

good - thanks Jesse,” Jake said cheerfully.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesse nodded. When he and
Effïndïe woke-up, they decided on something hot and filling for the company. A
big omelette was just what the dietologist ordered. And the onions were just
what the same dietologist ordered for the improved flavour. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“However, you used all the
onions, hah?” Jake said, dimming down a little. “That’s too bad. I was going to
make a soup out of them. French cuisine and stuff.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monique and her sister
exchanged glances, but before they could say a word, Helen wedged-in. “Jake,
don't be rude!” Then she turned towards Trent and Jane. “So why did your house
appliances failed last night?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Lane siblings exchanged
glances. “We’d be buggered if we knew,” Jane admitted. “The whole appliance
thingies - they all blitzed-out. Like, literally.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jake frowned. “That's odd.

<p class=MsoNormal>Alecto took a quick look at
Trent, then got up. “Good idea, Mr. Morgendorffer. Why won’t we all just go the

She was very, very depressed. The sudden march through El Salvador was not what
she bargained for. At all. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey wagon-rider! You
okay?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Penny turned sideways. Glue
was walking next to her, whistling cheerfully something under his nose,
seemingly not bothered at all by the long march. “Can it mister,” Penny
growled. “What do you want?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Is that how you treat an
old friend? Or should I be rescuing you from more polar bears?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Penny blushed. Her meeting
with the bear in the Barrens was not something she remembered willingly, even
via hindsight. And as for her actions with Glue - back then Robert Zimmerman -
they were another sore point. Speaking of points… “You remember me?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How could I forget? I
don't <i>do</i> rescues of damsels in distress that often,” Glue shrugged. “So
where did you go to after the whole ship sank?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“To British Columbia,”
Penny replied. “You?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Louisiana. Established
contacts, and generally washed my feet in Lake Pontchartrain. Nice spot. Really
nice. So how did you get from BC down here?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The Lane curse,” Penny
shrugged. “Really big phobia of settling down. Besides, Kitimat didn't play up
to my expectations. Back to you - what do you think you’re doing?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hmm? What do you mean?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Look. When we first met,
in Quebec, you were a separatist, a trouble-maker, rabble-rouser, whatever.
Certainly not a professional. In the Barrens, you were government-paid, had a
certain respectability around you. Now, here you are, seemingly completely
without principles and all that. What happened?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I grew completely
disillusioned with the capitalist view of the world,” Glue shrugged. “What
about you? Why’d you started rustle drugs over the border?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I didn't - I got tricked
into doing that,” Penny growled. “And it’s the last time too, I wager. I cannot
afford getting involved in more fixes like these.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What’d you expect?
Descending to the river great, we all leave the tracks in the sand, and as we
throw rocks into it, the rings in its’ wake never end…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Penny stared. “What’s that
all about?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don’t know, I just felt
like it. My sister - she was big into music - until we got involved in <i>capitalist
politics</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And now here you are,

choice.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And what do you know? And
what can you offer in its’ stead?” Glue’s voice was completely serious. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don’t know - you have
any diplomas or know any trades?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sure - I've got a diploma

<p class=MsoNormal>Penny stared. “You're

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nah-ah - I’m serious.
‘Course, it’s a Canadian one, but still.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ah! Canadian? It explains
a lot. Still, if we ever get back home to US.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Chill, sister - I've got a
plan, worthy of Hades himself!” Glue grinned. “’Course, it would be simpler if
we had a fighter plane on our hand, and we’ll <i>have</i> to participate in

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s okay, Jane,” Quinn
suddenly spoke. “I don’t know what they’re going to be doing, but they probably
won’t want having you around.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was a pause. “Quinn,
what are you saying?” Helen said with obvious undercurrent of danger in her
voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn shrugged, the holy
simplicity that she was. “What? Obviously, that Alecto person didn't have Jane
in mind, otherwise she would’ve mentioned her or something. Obviously, they’re
going to rectify the Lanes’ house and don’t want a kid underfoot.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Jane’s not a kid,” Helen
argued, surprised at the sudden show of logic from her youngest daughter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Aw, Helen, come on -
remember when you were their age?” Jake spoke up suddenly. “To us all younger
people were kids, even if they were almost the same age as us, remember?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Jake! You're not helping!”
Helen exploded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jake looked confused. “Say
Helen, I realized something. When is your birthday?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen groaned and knocked
her head at the table, and Jake, using the fact that his wife is outmanoeuvred
at the point and his daughters are momentarily gaping, turned back to Jane.
“Look, Jane-o, here the facts of life: the line of the second decade’s end is a
mighty curious boundary, everybody who’s on the ‘pre’-side is considered a kid
by those who’ve just crossed it. ‘Tis the words of experience, Jane, I swear.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane listened to this all
with wide blue eyes, then bolted - or would’ve, if Daria didn’t catch her in
time. “What’s wrong?” she quickly asked. “Dad’s rumblings… they’re a bit odd,
but still…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not that!” Jane protested
loudly; “just that… I've seem a glimpse of my future: a chockfull of relatives
how can't stand me, and a chockfull of siblings who just can't stand still! I
hate my life!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen looked-up and sighed.
“I warned Amanda that that might happen, I just warned her.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane stopped looking
depressed and assembled a rather interested look. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“All ready and open!”
Horatio hissed loudly. “<i>Avec plesir</i>, as our late daddy-o used to say!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not so loud!” Wind hissed.
“Want everything to go down because of a detail? Let’s go, and quietly!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Horatio sighed, his
parrot-green-like hair crest swayed as if from a breeze. “I see, Wind, that
you’re a serious fellow, not a easy-weight either, I'll wager.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“If you’ve pulled as many
marriage and other scams as I did, you would be a serious fellow too,” Wind
snarled. “Now let’s go, and quietly!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They went. Soon they came
to the waiting room of the police district, where several policemen were
playing cards. “Now what, boss?” Parrot turned to Wind. “We're going to just
walk pass them or what?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wind thought for several
moments, then sighed. “Cousin John, I really hope you’re telling the truth,” he
mumbled, and concentrated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next moment, <i>somebody</i>,
no one could be sure as to <i>who exactly</i>, spoke: “The third cop clockwise
got an ace in his sock.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The reaction was
instantaneous: the policemen immediately started to sort-out their
relationship, using fists. It was a real pleasure to see the impromptu massacre
- they were barely pulled apart. Of course, Wind Lane and his newest henchman
were long since gone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What do you mean, you

<p class=MsoNormal>“That Amanda? Whoa! You're

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen just groaned. “Jake,
I sometimes despair of you. You can be so <i>oblivious</i> sometimes… Anyways,
we knew both of your parents, Jane.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And? What was the
problem?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, there wasn't any
problem… or chemistry. Your parents didn't have the type of common characteristic
to make a long lasting relationship. They were just friends - good friends,
kind of like Daria and your brother.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane gaped, Quinn squeaked,
and Daria blushed. “You knew?” Jane finally closed her oral opening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes Jane dear, I knew.
Ever since Daria started to go ever so often to a household where was a single
boy, I kept an ear cocked for news on <i>that</i> battle-front.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You did? I mean your
work…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen sighed. “Daria, when
you become a mother, you’ll understand. Anyways Jane, you and your brother are
much like your mom - artistic rather than artisan.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And dad?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, Vince was a good, <i>very</i>
good photographer, as a matter of fact. But photography wasn’t his life; it was
just his way of life - he was just too realistic for that. That, and he was somewhat
cynical, and <i>loved</i> to travel. ‘Course, so did the rest of us, but for
Vince, travelling was almost as important as pottery was for Amanda. Naturally,
they weren’t very concerned with each other. Oh sure, there was the occasional
hello, and sometimes it went even further than that, but give a abatement for
the time - the 70s weren't that hard on the sex.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mom!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What? Anyways, both Vince
and Amanda seemed content with that - for a while. Then Vince’s draft came, and
Catherine thought of a solution-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Who’s Catherine?” Jane
asked curiously. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Another student friend of
ours - and an odd one at that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Helen, come on - just

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen whirled onto her
husband. “You <i>remember </i>her, Jake?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sure! I mean, how many
tall, shapely brunettes did I- I-I shut up now,” Jake hurriedly said, realizing
that he had put his foot into his mouth again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen sighed. “Oh, you’re
my ineffable woe! I should’ve known you remember someone like <i>that</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So who <i>was</i> Catherine?”
Daria interrupted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Just somebody <i>we just
knew</i>,” Helen shrugged. “Basically was planning to be a doctor, and made you
and Jane appear warm and open-hearted. ‘Course, she wasn’t so big on sarcasm either,
you know? Anyways, she suggested that Vince married someone to avoid the draft
- you know of what I’m saying?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Anyone who listened to
DeMartino did,” Quinn muttered rather acidly for her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, yes. Good. So first
Vince proposed-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“To you, Helen,” Jake
spoke-up again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He did? Wow. So why did
you refuse - not that any of us are complaining?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen shrugged. “I loved
and I love Jake. Period. No matter how many blondes and brunettes he’s
noticing.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Aw, honey!” Jake bloomed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, Vince respected that
so we just parted friends.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So where does mom come
in?” Jane asked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I think she overheard it
and offered to marry him, figuring-out that the two of them were a close enough
fit - her with pottery and him with photography. I told her that it wasn't such
a good idea, but your mother, Jane, was never exactly reasonable, and so… they
got married.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Who blessed that holy
union?” Jane said wryly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Catherine.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Her again? Was she a nun
or something?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nah, just some very odd
faith.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And nobody minded?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Jane, please. It was a
hippy wedding, with the groom wearing white and the bride a miniskirt. We all
thought it was terribly cute and all.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And the army recruiters
swallowed it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah they did somehow,”
Helen shrugged. “That’s the tale, Jane.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, at least I have a
good idea why Wind’s so casual about marriage,” Jane shrugged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Wind?” Helen frowned,
trying to remember something. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah, Wind. My other,
older brother. I think he is currently in Nevada, or Montana, or something. Why
do you ask?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Just trying to remember
something,” Helen dismissed that lone of thought for later. “Anyways, Jane, I
say that your and your brother’s artistic streaks come from Amanda - gods, that
woman could work at her kiln for <i>hours</i>!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yup, that’s our mom,” Jane
sighed. “Still, it’s not nice to know that you came into this world only

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That was your plan? Grab
more than abetted share of loot and skeedaddle it out of there on a chopper?”
Penny shrieked loudly, as the wind howled in the chopper’s propeller. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah! I know it’s no
fighter plane, but we can make it work yes sir!” Glue chortled excitedly.
“Believe me Penny, I know what I’m doing!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Penny just gulped as she saw
Honduras’ portion of Sierra de Las Minas zoom pass them. “Where are we flying
to?” she wheezed to her neighbour. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“To Guatemala-Mexican
border!” Glue replied proudly. “From there - a ride to Mexico city, and from
there - an airplane flight to US!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Speaking of airplanes and
fighter planes, there’s one our radar, and <i>it had launched a missile</i>!
Glue, <i>do</i> something!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>VROOM!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The helicopter went upwards
and backwards at such a high speed, that Penny was pressed backwards into her
seat, and red and blue spots flashed before her eyes. The missile coming fast
behind them, passed way below them, and way forward now. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The plane, however, was
passing right below them, unable to change altitudes as quickly as the
helicopter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s the trouble with
semi-professionals - no imagination <i>and</i> lack of technical knowledge,”
Glue sighed. “This is a <i>military</i> helicopter…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He pressed a button. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>BADABANG-BADABOOM!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Several relatively small
bombs were discharged, all of them landing on the plane’s back or wings. The
plane went-up in a fireball, almost hooking the chopper as well. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The missile! It’s
self-controlling or something!” Penny suddenly shrieked.</p>

mask on?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah! Why?”</p>

action. He flapped the helicopter’s lid off, and fired a grenade from a grenade
cup discharger. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Straight at the incoming

<p class=MsoNormal><b>A jeep near Yellowstone
National Park, Wyoming. 10:14 AM.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The day was not shaping
well for Amanda Lane. The Wyoming city of Cody had proved to be truly
abominable, and being constantly awakened and re-awakened by the song of meadowlarks
ever since early sunrise was a bit tiresome - even for her. It was almost as
bad as when she and Vincent came to Mariupol’, Ukraine, and they were
constantly awakened by pigeons. Of course, Vince back then managed to get some
great photo-shots of sea-birds, but still…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amanda sighed sadly. The
lives of her and her husband certainly didn't went as planned. All in all, even
though Amanda’s expectations of life weren't very high, she still expected some
reimbursement from Vincent. But Helen back then was right - as she usually was.
She and Vincent just didn't have the right chemistry to be a couple.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And blaming Catherine
wasn’t the right thing to do, either. Catherine was usually as rational and
logical as Helen, except for the time when she and her room-mates got Helen’s
younger sister Rita drunk and preformed something called ‘Freak on a leash’
with her. That had been pure comedy. Helen, however, wasn't amused. Well,
publicly. At least. Certainly, seeing her sister screwing her brains out with
Conrad Engelson was pretty humiliating for her. And then there was the issue of
Rita’s later pregnancy. Then again, that was only expected when a dorky blonde
took-on the members of the campus’s toughest girl gang <i>ever</i>. Humiliation
was only expected. And Helen’s anger was directed at Rita only. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amanda smiled. These were
the good old days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then where did they all
vanish? And why weren't there any better - or at least wholesome - days
anymore? And why couldn’t her family get together for more than two days without
fighting?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amanda shrugged. Those
questions couldn't be answered - certainly not on a sudden morning near Bighorn
River. What Amanda needed was a small civilized dwelling to spend a few couple
of nights to catch-up on her sleep - and not in a roach-infested motel, either.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Say!” Amanda suddenly
perked up. “Didn't Wind say once that he had an apartment in Montana?
Somewhere, not far from here… Ah yes, Bozeman! Yes, yes, that’s right. Wind and
Penny then drunk some of Vincent’s poteen and started to brag, yes-yes!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amanda perked-up immensely.
She’ll just go to next state and take a short rest in the next state! Whistling
cheerfully, Amanda drove off to the nearest interstate highway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So where’s that Zuni gig?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How am I supposed to know?
Maybe it grew legs and ran away, hearing what you did in Flagstaff, Arizona.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The siblings giggled. They
certainly raised a rustle in that place. But past’s past, and present’s
present, and currently it wasn’t too presentable. They were in New Mexico, and
it wasn't too different from Arizona. And if Zuni was too much like Flagstaff -
they’ll just pull their old runaway trick again. All was up-to-date. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The kids giggled and
continued to watch the scenery. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Meanwhile, their mother
wasn't growing too happy either. Where the hell <i>were</i> they? The bleeding
fog that had covered the night from dusk to dawn had seemingly come all the way
from Acheron, and obscured their way completely. Now, for all Summer knew, they
passed through New Mexico completely and got stuck in Texas somewhere! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Suddenly an unexpected,
buzzing noise came from overhead. Summer stopped her and watched as a
smallish-sized plane landed on a dune near her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A door opened and a couple
got out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I thought you could fly
anything!” a woman’s voice carried on the wind. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>‘Penny?’ Summer frowned. It
would just like her red-haired sister to be using an unconventional method of
travelling. Still, what would she be doing on a plane in a New Mexican desert?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Look Lane!” a man’s voice
snarled in reply. “I told that I knew how to fly a helicopter, <i>not</i> an
airplane. Certainly not one of those semi-glider thingies!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh sure! Just my luck!
Find a man how can beat a fighter plane with a helicopter, but can't fly a
regular airplane forth a damn!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey! This damn was worth
all the way from Mexico City from here. Look, there’s a car, let’s go and ask
them where we are!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And then what? Steal it
from them?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Got any better brighter
ideas?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey Penny - is that you?”
Summer yelled out, remembering that no love was lost between Penny and her.
“Who’s your plane-flying friend?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was some silence on
the dune, then a couple of slim figures skidded down to it. “Summer? That you?
What’re you doing here?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Penny? I could ask you the
same thing, only I don't know where ‘here’ is.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, our map says that
you’re to the right of Albuquerque,” the man spoke. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Very funny!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No, really. You're between
Albuquerque and Santa Fe. What were you doing in New Mexico, anyways?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Playing cat and mouse,
most likely,” Penny sighed. “Look Summer - can you give me and friend here a
ride?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Very to? Home to
Massachusetts?” Summer almost sneered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Massachusetts?
Massachusetts is good,” the man spoke-up suddenly. “We agree.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey! See here!” Summer
protested. “I promised to take the kids to-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“N, you look. We <i>very
recently</i> got out of Honduras, where we were subjected to some cruel and
communistic political conditions, and flown for an unknown amount of time,
ruining in the process, on top of this plane, a helicopter (property of
Honduras’ government). A nice, long, relaxing ride in a car is just what we
need. And you can call me Chris.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Summer cast an indignant
gaze over Chris… which quickly wondered off. The guy was quite well muscled,
not exactly Schwartzenegger style, but still, most impressive. Obviously Penny
acted quickly, teaming-up with such a cavalier. Still, old feuds died hard.
“Look,” she said reasonably. “It’s not that I want to cause trouble, it’s just
that Penny would never agree to seat on the rear seat with Adrian and Courtney,
whereas you probably won’t fit into there.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Then you sit there,” Chris
said reasonably. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey-hey! This is my car or
what?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Good question. Where’s
your license?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Summer fidgeted. “Well, eh,
I thought… you see…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I thought so,” Chris said
in a self-assured voice. “Move over. <i>I’ll</i> drive. <i>You</i> direct me
where to go.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What about me?” Penny
said, obviously unhappy at this development. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You sit in the back with

sack onto back seat. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amanda Lane was not a happy

on a bridge crossing the Yellowstone river, because of a traffic jam. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And to top it off there were
still the meadowlarks, the blooming, blooming meadowlarks. Amanda Lane started
to dislike them quite intently, and what Amanda Lane disliked <i>that</i> intently,
it took years for her to like them back. She was still less than gung-ho when
it came to mourning doves, for example, and <i>that</i> was years ago, in
Mariupol’, Ukraine. </p>

also a very, very dysfunctional person. Her and their uncle Wind. It was something

China at the turn of the century. Oh well. Right now the only thing that
bothered the small duo was how to get away. They didn't dare do it in the

her youngest daughter. “How did you get Monique’s phone number?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It was some time ago,”
Quinn shrugged. “Me and Jane and Daria got Monique and the Harpies’ van to get
Trent’s equipment when their van ran into trouble.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh. I see. And she gave
you their phone number because?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Say Daria, who is

<p class=MsoNormal>“So what are we going to do
now, Adrian?” Courtney asked worriedly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sis, why so nervous? You
weren't that nervous in Colorado.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Please. Masa Verde
National Park and the rest of the whole eight bits don't intimidate me that
much as the prospect of being alone. With mom.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Courtney, don't say that!
What if she overhears? It’ll be just worse.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Courtney sighed. Why did
the Fates give her and her siblings a loving mother… whose mental machinery was
not up to full 100 percent? Furthermore, both they and their mother inherited
from Amanda Lane’s side her set of genes, ensuring that they’re chances of
survival were very fast. And Adrian and Courtney had fully appreciated these
sets of genes in San Juan Mountains this fall. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The trouble was, as they
learned during the last couple of days travelling with their mother through
Arizona and New Mexico, their mother also had these genes. And obviously, she
as bigger and stronger than they, and they didn't want to test their mettle
against hers. It was too scary. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And also sad. Summer Lane
really loved her kids, all four of them, but in her own, weird way. And that
way was scary sometimes. Very scary sometimes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Adrian, what are we going

<p class=MsoNormal>“So Wind, what is your plan
for today?” Amanda asked quietly. “Well, for the rest of it, anyways?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mom, me and my friend are
going to stay here for a while,” Wind carefully asked. His mother was not too
realistic, and, Wind believed, an honest person. To learn what her oldest son
was doing for a living would not have filled her with pride.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After all, what Wind Lane
was doing has been scamming… and saving. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Money, that is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And to Amanda Lane money
was of no irrelevance - or so Wind though. Certainly his mother never
showed-off anything contrary to his belief. And if she learned just <i>what</i>
his scams composed of, she’d might be angry with him. Not that it mattered much
to Wind but still. Lawndale, Massachusetts has been a place to rest for him all
those years, and he didn't want to lose it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Meanwhile, Wind’s new
friend (and future partner) Horatio was thinking among the same lines: Mrs.
Lane doesn't have to know the truth. At all. Let’s keep her in the dark and see
what comes forth from it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah, ma’am. We had a bit
of tough times in Nevada, so we just want to rest for some time. Is that okay
with you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sure,” Amanda Lane nodded.
“I could use a bit of free time from meadowlarks.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wind shook his head. “Mom,
you’re starting to sound like Summer on a bad day.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I do? Oh my. Well, she did
get it from my side, I’m sure…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Amanda continued to
drone on, Wind sighed. The Lane family was one big giant looney bin, and the

<p class=MsoNormal>Penny paused. “Not exactly.
It’s our parents really - they like to travel. They were even Africa, and more

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hel-lo, I'm Canadian, of
course I'll know. Anyways, you just followed your parents’ examples?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not exactly. My older

of women problem, and I left went to Quebec to study the local Native American
culture… Anyways, what about you? Do you have any relatives?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, I have a few
relatives in Concord, New Hampshire, including both parents and a step-aunt
with family in Rochester, same state. But my other aunt - who won the
guardianship of me and my little sister - she lives in Ontario, Canada.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Where exactly?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“In Ottawa.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Cool! But why did your
aunt win the guardianship of you and your sister?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I do not know. We weren't
told. What I <i>do</i> know, that there was a big row before me and my sister
were born, between my aunt and my folks and her stepsister - she’s the
step-aunt in Rochester.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why’d it happen?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“A man was involved, I
think. Anyways, to make a long story short, the females of the previous
generation in my family get along like cats and dogs - or worse.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That brings forth a
startling suspicion that you and your sisters were pawns in a bigger family
politics game.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“To this I have to counter
you with the fact that our aunt loved us very, very much.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And look at how you
turned-out to be,” Penny snorted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Rich? Well-educated?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, yeah. But wasn't
your aunt bothered by you and your sister’s-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not really. She ran some
sort of a crime ring when she was our age, and now that she’s an adult, she’s
worse.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And how <i>did</i> you
turn out to be this way? Why’d you join the separatists?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, my sister wanted to
spend some time in Quebec-city so I took her there. There, she befriended a
girl named Monica or something, who was Longueuil - a native Quebecois. And
that Monica girl, though just a very young teen, she was stuck on political
trouble. And that certainly rubbed the right way my pro-communistic and
anti-capitalistic tendencies, and there it all began.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And you lost your sister
as a result?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not really. The last I
heard of her, she and Monica-girl and a couple of others were in St. Stephen,
New Brunswick, about to go forth into America.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why’d cross so many
borders?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We’ve made an enemy in
Quebec - a very dangerous enemy. Someday, mayhaps, I'll find a way to pay him
back. But for now - I’m interested in finding my sister… settling down, getting
an ‘honest’ job, starting a family of my own - any suggestions?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Penny sighed. After their
shared adventures naturally such feelings will arise - mutual feelings,
coincidentally. “You know, maybe you should ask Angela Li for a position as

already!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Adrian glared. The siblings
‘invented’ that game in Colorado, as they were crossing the Rio Grande. It was
a parody of Tarot, consisting of cards that the twins made before they ran away
from their mother’s home in Pueblo. In the beginning, the siblings didn’t take
it seriously, but after they drew-out a card with a pig, and a wild pig (a
peccary) attacked them later in Arizona, the duo was starting to have doubts,
that maybe the silly game wasn’t as silly as they thought. “Come on, draw it
out!” Courtney insisted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“From which pack?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The rightmost first.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The siblings exchanged
glances. “Do we want to know what this means?” Adrian asked, almost wryly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don’t think so,”
Courtney shook her head. “Hey Adrian, what’s a cabal?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don’t know. Maybe the

Hebrew magic, I reckon.”</p>

“Adrian, get serious. For all we know, mom’s troubles started when she told
that black-haired lady off, and she accused her of having confused lunacy with
courage.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What are you two talking

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mom, do you hate anyone?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That question startled
Summer, if anything. “Courtney, why do you ask?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s just that we were
playing that divining game and it hinted that the solution lay in you hating
someone. Well, do you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Summer sighed. “Kids,
you’re starting to take that damn game too seriously!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We aren’t!” Adrian
protested quickly. “It’s just that that a pig has once come up, and presto! -
we were attacked by a crazed pig in Arizona!”</p>

Arizona? Went straight through through Colorado? How’d you end-up in Flagstaff
anyway if you were going to Petrified Forest National Park?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Courtney and Adrian winced
in embarrassment. “After we left Mesa Verda National Park we crossed the border
to Utah,” Adrian explained, and stopped only when we reached Lake Powell.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Please, it’s not a real
lake, it’s artificial!” Summer snorted scornfully. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s not the point!”
Adrian protested. “Anyways, after Lake Powell we turned south until we reached
the Grand Canyon National Park. And from there we turned south - past Wupatki
National Monument - till we came to Flagstaff. And from there - well, you know
that part.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So what was the most
memorable moment of your stay in Utah?” Summer curiously asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Gulls. There were a lot of
gulls in Lake Powell. They didn't like us,” Courtney explained, blushing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I'll wager,” Summer said,

gulls. “Take care kids, or the gulls will become your mourning doves.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How ‘bout to Great Falls?

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah, them.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So what’s the crunch?”</p>

Summer - she was really screwed.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Jane. I'm shocked. Even I

<p class=MsoNormal>“And your folks didn’t say
anything?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nah. You wouldn't want to

perhaps, was not so much of a step down then a step sideways.”</p>

stuffing?” Daria said incredulously. “Did you ever try Kitchen Sink Stew?”</p>

that,” Jane said with a bit of acridity.</p>

an Airedale terrier, but bigger than a donkey in Lawndale’s children petting
zoo, and very unfriendly. Could really hurt a person if he tried, and a few
times wrestled Trent to the floor.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So this relates to Penny

hocus-pocus.”</p>

an argument with somebody who was into that ‘hocus-pocus’ thing?” Adrian
argued.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Summer winced. “Well, there
was one time… I was in Watertown, New York. Some black-haired coot ran into my

<p class=MsoNormal>“Still do.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No, no, we mean a <i>legal
</i>car. You know?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I didn’t have <i>that</i>
kind of car ever. I was Trent’s age back then.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So you had a road-side
accident?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, it wasn't an
accident, just a minor car collision. Neither of us was hurt then. But we did
get into a terrible argument as to whose fault it was, and I think I said that
I <i>felt</i> it was her fault - or something along the same lines. So she
snapped back something like if I felt, that it would always be me who dealt it.
Or something on those lines.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So who paid the fine?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No one. It was closer to
Adirondack Mountains than to Watertown proper, and no sign of civilization was
in sight, including a police vehicle. And neither of us wanted to go to court.
We just snapped a bit and then drove off in different directions.” Summer
paused and smiled triumphantly. “So what do your little cards say about that?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Which stack do you want to
ask?” Adrian smirked back.</p>

you, behind the scenes - maybe astrally? Ever thought of having your karma and
aura checked?”</p>

Her clairvoyance and everything!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mom! You <i>like</i> aunt
Natasha, remember? You two really clicked and all that!”</p>

Christine and all of her little friends were gay.” He paused. “And you hanged
around them a lot. Should I be worried or what?”</p>

your mind - or was it the White House? Still, you can try to remember our
daughters’ ages.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I'm sorry honey, but it

and Quinn also seems to be growing out of her former fashion phase also.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Who was it?” Daria flatly
asked, watching as Glue made his return.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Summer,” Trent replied,
almost as flatly. “Penny, you’ve really done it this time. If mom and dad were
here-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mom would be at the
pottery wheel or the kiln, and dad would be in the washroom, developing his
photos,” Penny replied, also in a flat voice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Come on, give them at
least one dollar worth of credit!” Jane argued. “Maybe they’ll turn here yet,
you know?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Last I heard from mom, she
was staying in Wyoming,” Penny shook her head. “She has a lodge in Wild River
Range, remember?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah, but you know mom,
she’s probably ran it into the ground.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Wind then. He has an
apartment in Bozeman, Montana. That’s much closer, than Lawndale,
Massachusetts.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don't know. Wind usually
prefers to spend winters in Nevada, California, or Florida.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So? His apartment’s still
there,” Penny was not bulging from her argument.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Remind me - what are they
arguing about?” Daria asked Nick as he stood next to her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The musician shrugged.
“Don't worry. As far as us non-Lanes know, when more than two Lane siblings get
into one place, they begin to argue where the rest of them are, as they do now.
If you ask me, it’s something in their nature.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ahem,” Glue’s voice
interrupted the argument before it could continue. “So how much do the repo and
others want for your house?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Got shoved into this

<p class=MsoNormal>Amanda Lane finally
released the steering wheel. For what seemed an eternity she has raced through <i>descending</i>
montane roads, desperately trying to outrace a thundering avalanche. But now it
was all over. Now the sun shone once again through the clouds…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>…and back were those damn
meadowlarks! Joining them were a series of doves and pigeons, and a couple of birds
that looked like cuckoos. Amanda Lane just shook her head. Her eldest son’s
idea for staying in a house for the winter sounded better and better. Hell, she
might just do it!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amanda began to think.
Returning to Bozeman was out of the question. The road back south was buried
almost to very mountaintops. To her left once again lay Rocky Mountains, which
have proven to be <i>very</i> inhospitable. To her right was Montana’s
flatland, and to her north was Canada. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amanda suddenly brightened.
Why not Canada indeed? Penny had once stayed there for well over a year, and
even brought back souvenirs. Smiling, Amanda refuelled her car and drove north,
to Alberta.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wind wasn't very surprised.
Amanda Lane was known very well to pull off stunts like that. “Fine mom. Let us
know where you’ll stay, fine?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, Wind. Bye!” Amanda

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, this is

Monique in Jane’s room. “Who said that life in Lawndale was boring? Around the
Lane family, it’s never boring!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Pinch me again, Daria, I
may be dreaming,” Jane said absently. “Ouch!” Daria had slapped her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So tell me again, who is
this guy?” Daria turned to Monique, who quietly left with the younger girls to
prevent undue tension in the Lanes’ living room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Louis something. You’ve
got to ask for his last name Calais, ‘cause I don't know.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nevermind his name, <i>who</i>
is he?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monique shrugged. “I met
him and Calais in Quebec over a decade ago. I befriend Calais and dragged
myself, her and her brother into the pro-separatism movement.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I'm a Quebecois, so’s
Alecto. She’s my older sister. We were born in Longueuil, lived there our whole
childhoods. But then Alecto found herself a real job in the state, and after
enrolling me first into a private girl school and then into Loyola College,
left.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And you naturally got into
trouble.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s all in one’s
opinion,” Monique said firmly. “Anyways, I became involved and went to
Quebec-city. There I met Calais and her brother, and got them involved too.
Then we got into trouble with a capital T, and if Alecto didn’t return back
then with Effïndïe in tow, who knows what’ve happened. At any case, Calais got
separated from her brother, and went traipsing with me, Alecto and Effïndïe,
through Quebec, New Brunswick, Maine and New Hampshire, until finally settling
here, in Lawndale, Massachusetts.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And you became the music
group how?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It just happened,” Monique
shrugged. “It is classified information; Alecto will kill me if I let it out.
She sill hasn't quite forgiven me for being a Quebecois separatist, you know?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And Calais’ brother is mad
at you for that also,” Jane shook her head. “Ever thought of going on air at
‘Sick Sad World’?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I'm thinking more of
‘Jackass’ lines,” Daria smirked. “But seriously. Any idea where he and Penny
Lane could’ve returned with a bag full of dollars and gold nuggets?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monique looked at Daria.
Hard. “You know Daria, questions like these should not be asked.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But somebody has to ask
them.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“As Alecto sometimes says,
a question may be asked, but it doesn't have to be answered,” Monique replied.
“Besides, an answer may be censured out because of your tender age.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria gave her an evil eye.
“Monique, you’re hopeless.”</p>

around the Lawndale tree lot, which looked like some strange urbane forest.
“Which tree do you like, Jesse?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesse shrugged. He wasn't
big on trees, but you needed a prickly-looking tree for Christmas, but a cactus
didn’t count. “Ask for advice?” he replied instead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Effïndïe shrugged. In her
childhood, before she met “Alecto” Dupri she had lived in NYC, and in a sector
that didn't rate Christian holidays like Christmas very highly as well. After
that, she, the Dupri sisters and Calais travelled through eastern Canada and
America’s East Coast, until finally settling in Lawndale, and a nomadic life
did not promote holidays either (events of joy when a large amount of food or
necessities like toilet paper was gleaned-from or gained didn't count). So
naturally, she wasn't the one to argue. “Hey! Anybody here?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Out popped a boy with all
of his intelligence shown on his face. “Hey! I’m Kevin Thomson! I’m the QB!”</p>

who are quite interested in zoology, that racoons and badgers, just like black
and brown bears, hibernate throughout the winter. And what they also don't
know, that a raccoon, badger or bear awakened from his winter sleep can be a
messy problem indeed. And right now, one of such problems what about to make
itself known.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Slowly the raccoon began to
make its’ way across the Morgendorffers’ backyard towards a tiny bit ajar
basement window. If the racoon would’ve gotten into it, it would’ve been
disappointed, since in the Morgendorffer basement naught was kept but Helen’s
old paperwork, Jake’s assembled (or maybe mis-assembled) bits and ends, Quinn’s
discarded fashion stuff, and few of Daria’s mementos that Jake and/or Helen
have realized that importance of, and were kept. At any rate, nothing edible
was lying in the Morgendorffer basement, to the racoon’s future disappointment.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But the racoon never made
it into the basement directly. As it waddled across the yard, a snow-buried
rusty grating gave way, and the racoon fell - deep down into the
Morgendorffer  water pipe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sadly (but not overly), the
racoon didn't survive the fall. For a small animal plunging over three metres
down is a nasty shock; you might say it had a stroke. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That, however, is beside
the point. The point, on the other hand, is that there’s a dead animal blocking
Morgendorffers’ water supply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But water is a powerful
force. When too much of it accumulates (we're talking liquid state here) in one
point, it starts to push out, to spread. And since we’re talking about a water
pipe, most, if not all, of water pressure comes from one point - from behind
the block, aka the Dead Racoon. So naturally, the water pushes the block
forwards, and as the block does so, the water goes straight forwards, pushing
the block along. If this was a river, the whole thing would’ve gone unnoticed,
since a river, a) much wider than a plumbing pipe, and b), it eventually comes
to a sea, an ocean, or at least another, bigger river, and the whole point of
an obstacle being an obstacle to a current becomes moot. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But what we have <i>here</i>
isn't a river; it’s an artificial, man-made water pipe. The Morgendorffer
family’s water pipe, to be exact. And as water pipes tend to do, this one
branches off into smaller and thinner tubes, to go reach various sinks and
faucets. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now a racoon - it isn’t a
small animal. Let’s say this poor sod of an animal that fell down into the pipe
(believe me, when the sh*t hits the fan, the water management of Lawndale will
really hear it about their pipes going rusty and holey), is a metre long, more
so if you consider the tail. So naturally, when it reaches that branching
point, it becomes stuck. Completely stuck. Unable-to-go-further stuck. And the
water pressure behind it builds. And builds. And builds.</p>

go, it <i>really</i> will go, believe me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Jake?” Helen turned to her
husband. “Can you get me a glass of water? I'm parched.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jake nodded and went
downstairs. Downstairs, as he turned-on the tap, he received a nasty surprise:
there was no water there. “What the?” Jake wondered, as he futily tried to do
something about it, namely open and close the tap few more times. No luck.
“Hon,” Jake called-out loudly, we’ve got a problem.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What?” Helen yelled from

<p class=MsoNormal>“No water!”</p>

by Stacy and Tiffany. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The water company. For
some reason, all of our taps and faucets aren't working,” Jake replied
nervously. Helen had been storing unspent aggravation all day since morning,
and so he was very, very careful to avoid her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So did their daughters, it
seemed. If Jake had lived with Helen only throughout his <i>married </i>life,
then Quinn and Daria lived for their <i>whole</i> lives, and knew their mother
mayhaps even better than Jake did his wife. As a result, knowingly or not, both
Morgendorffer girls planned to stay out of their mother’s way as much as
possible. Other people didn't know that, or simply were unlucky. And so…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why isn’t there any water,
Mr. Morgendorffer?” Stacy asked timidly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn winced. While quite
calmer and less aggressive than Helen, Jake Morgendorffer tended to turn any
innocent question that was directed at him into a crazed rant about his father,
“Mad Dog” Morgendorffer. Actually, though Quinn wasn’t so sure, Daria once told
her that she had met her grandfather, while he was still along the living.
Apparently, it was her third birthday or so, so Daria wasn’t too sure about it
herself. The bottom line was, though, that grandpa Morgendorffer hadn't been as
bad as Jake sounded him to be. He was merely… something else. Daria wasn't sure
of that herself, so Quinn wisely withheld that bit of sister-shared information
from everybody else, including Daria, who probably forgot all about it by now. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How are we supposed to
know?” Jake sighed. Truth to tell, he was tired of constantly being afraid of
his wife. Well, not exactly afraid, but worried, worried that one wrong move -
and he’ll get scared, really, really scared. And that would be not good, not
good at all. In short, Jake Morgendorffer was not a happy camper, and as a
result, he needed to take-out steam. Stacy’s question did that for him. He
began to rant. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the other two girls
listened with wide-open eyes and mouth’s to Jake’s latest monologue concerning
the water management and his grandfather, Quinn walked-over to the faucet and
opened it. A few drops of water came out, coupled with some sort of a peculiar
smell. “Dad?” Quinn said slowly. “I think there’s something dead in the water
pipe!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What? Lousy, no-good
capitalist fat cats!” Jake yelled, as he flung a newspaper that he was reading
outside.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By caprice of fate (or
perhaps Jake just didn't know his own strength), the newspaper flew further
than it should’ve, and fell into the same grating hole that the late racoon had
fallen into as well. And just like the late racoon, the newspaper was carried
forth by the water current, until it slammed itself into the wet and smelling
corpse. Compiled with that, the wet paper effectively stopped the water’s flow.
That did it. The piping gave way. With a capital BANG.</p>

Quinn who came-up with a solution. “Say dad, when you saw our house topple
where the ground caved-in, you’ve mentioned about some summer house. What were
you talking about?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jake, always eager to bond
with his girls, immediately changed the topic. “Sure thing Quinn, it happened
when I was still in the military academy. That bloody <i>hack</i> of a sergeant
made us build a summer house for that politician buddy of his.”</p>

too near to the porch, and its’ framework eventually toppled - from the
proximity of the well. So that bloody bastard brings us again, we make a new
framework, put it onto the rim, and basically it is a matter of hours to finish
it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, we decided to
procrastinate till spring. And in spring the earth melted and began to fall
into the well, and it was almost forty metres deep! The ground, the framework -
it all went down, making a pit over six metres long, right next to the house’s
wall. </p>

a bit, then followed the porch’s framework. Then the wall cracked. Then all the

met Helen and the rest of our friends.”</p>

“Ever thought of publishing it or something?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jake shook his head. “You
don't imagine how embarrassing that was. Earlier I said ‘a bald spot’ but
really there was left an outhouse, and a sign that said ‘Private Property’.
Yeah, sure - can imagine a fence with a sign that says ‘Private Property’ but
encloses naught but a great big hole in the ground and a matching outhouse?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I've got to paint that
later!” Jane excitedly said. “I can almost visualise it, too!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen came downstairs, and
saw that all was peaceful, though not quiet, for the teen bands downstairs were
busy packing-away heavy-duty sound. Jake and the three girls, on the other
hand, were relatively quiet. Jane, in particular, was painting something, while
Jake and their daughters watched figure skating on TV. “Did I miss anything?”
Helen said, feeling that she did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nah, just dad telling us
one of his military school stories,” Daria said. “Quinn kind of pried it out of
him.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah, but… figure
skating?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The only thing we could
agree on, and it doesn't have any complicated dialogue on it either,” Daria
explained. “The <i>noise</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Right,” Helen paused. “So
are Penny and Chris back yet?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No mom. For all I know
they’ve went to Lawndale’s bowling alley or something.” Daria paused in her
turn and asked. “So what’s the buzz with the insurance company?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“They’re covering it. It
took me a lot of time, but they’ll cover it, or they’ll wish that <i>they</i>
were the one falling into that fetid hole in the ground instead of our house,”
Helen said with a promising look on her face. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So mom?” Daria turned to
Helen, away from the TV. “We know that dad’s family didn't celebrate Christmas
as a rule; what about you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen shook her head. “When
I lived at home, we celebrated Christmas. It wasn't a very functional affair,
with me and Rita snapping at each other, and Amy just merging with the
background. Then at college, well, we weren’t big into ‘official holidays’ as
we called them; we had too many things on our minds, you know?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Besides, when you get a
large number of twenty-plus aged people, holidays often are forgotten in favour
of… more… x-rated pastimes,” Jake added. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I see,” Jane said wryly.
“So no big Christmas parties, Mrs. M.?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What about Wind’s and
Summer’s attitudes?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Me and Summer get along
poorly, if at all. The closest Wind and I have ever got together was over a
bottle of Mexican rot-gut, called pulké.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ouch!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, nothing without a
good side, I suppose. I did learn from Wind that he has a number of apartments
in the US - but in which states and cities, I do not know.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Glue shrugged, having his
own knowledge of Wind - not much different from Penny’s, except that he also
knew that Wind Lane was a scam artist and was wanted for marriage - or
alimonies - in four or five states by now. He also never went <i>as </i>Wind
Lane, either. What he actually went <i>as</i>, Glue, or Chris Dimmerman never
knew nor care. He had long since discovered the power of many names, wearing a
different one each time he could be noticed by public eye. And as a result, he
developed something not unlike MPD, but nowhere as severe or violent, either.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What are you thinking?”
Penny asked him, worried by the prolonged something. “Is Wind in trouble?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>‘Your brother <i>is</i>

through, insulting her relatives would never do. Not now. Maybe later. “No,

and meet you. Also, I’m thinking about my sister?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Calais? I don’t know, she
looks alright. Besides, she’s got her friends to help her.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s what I'm afraid
of,” Glue sighed. “All those years ago - it was supposed to be just a simple
trip to Quebec province, nevermind what their political views were.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s what I always

Monique a death-eye glare. “Really, maybe somebody else is ought to do it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s <i>Monique</i>!” the
girl quietly growled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Glue cleared his throat and
began. “People! We have gathered together tonight for a special occasion. Some
of us have walked as little as next door, others a much larger distance than
that. Some of us are males, others females, and speaking about the rest isn't
politically correct. Some of us may be Christians, others - Jews, Muslims,
agnostics, but all of us nonetheless has gathered to celebrate this fine,
though Christian, holiday. Some of us are rich, some are poor. All of us have
different ages, attitudes and dispositions. It does not matter, for tonight, at
least for Christians, a God had supposedly been born, and as all major
religions agree upon wholeheartedly (although that is probably the only thing
they’ll agree upon wholeheartedly), all men and women are equal before a God.
And furthermore, as it is polite to deter to the birthday boy or girl, let’s
keep in mind that this holiday is a God’s birthday on top of all things other,
and thus we should act polite, lest we won't get invited the next year, for the
birthday boy may decide to start Armageddon a little bit early! Or something,”
Glue added as an afterthought. “That is something to be remembered all year
though… But I digress. Since it is a God’s birthday, and since the birthday boy
sadly can't grace us all with his presence, we’ll have to start without him,
honouring him to the extent of our meagre and mediocre abilities.” Glue paused
for a bit more, then added, looking mischievously. “What are you waiting for,

was lax, however. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You know, Chris there has
said one odd holiday speech, and I've heard a few by all sorts of men,” Jake
told Penny Lane. That was true. Some of his father’s drinking buddies could say
a lot of odd things, once they were inebriated, yes. “It is both convincing yet
misdirected, however.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey, it’s the best he
could come up on such a short notice,” Penny replied, “plus he wasn't much into
the holiday spirit until now.” ‘You should’ve heard his speech in San Lorenzo
where he’d won me over,” Penny said wryly. “When the bastard really wants to
give a speech, he prepares for it, oy vey, he prepares.” That was true. Glue’s
speech was pretty much the fuel for a long, eight-hour drive and march, at the
end of which the separatists and their mercenary allies took-in the Tegucigalpa
and its’ inner defences by storm - a chaotic one. Compared to that speech, this
one was pretty mild.</p>

Christmas party, and so they celebrated as good as they wanted to, and that
didn't promote high elegance (although when Wind willed it, he <i>could</i> be
quite elegant). Tobacco smoke and alcohol fumes have filled the air, and what
the three people were <i>doing</i> in the bedroom, was quite, quite x-rated.

<p class=MsoNormal>But a brief while was all
Catherine Barrette needed, as she formed the ritual pose, and whispered her
requests to the winds, she whispered the words of power, known to her, to the
winds. And those words of power were not something to be used often or lightly:
an incorrect syllable could freeze Catherine’s blood faster than the Canadian
winter, an incorrect word could drive her mad. </p>
