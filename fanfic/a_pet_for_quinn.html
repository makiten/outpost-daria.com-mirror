<P>A Roger E. Moore &quot;Iron Chef&quot; ficlet.</P>

<P>&quot;A pet?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes. A pet. What's wrong with that, Daria?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Nothing I guess. It's just that I've never thought of you as a
pet person. No - that's not true, I *have* thought of you as a pet person
- you know, captured by space aliens and kept in a cage.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Eeeew, Daria!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Okay. Sorry. If you want to keep a pet in your room it's no skin
off my nose. Just don't let it get out. If it gets into my room in the
mistaken belief that it's a bathroom I'll...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Okay, okay. You've made your point. It won't get out.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;So what made you decide that you wanted a pet? I mean owning a
pet involves care, responsibility, thinking about the pet's needs instead
of just your own. All those new experiences in one furry little package.
It could be severely traumatising.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Jeez, Daria. You make it sound like I'm self-centred or something.
Anyway, every time I went to Sandi's place her cat, Fluffy, would come
and rub herself against my leg, purring, wanting me to scratch her behind
the ears. She's sooo cute. I just couldn't resist.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Alright, Quinn, but if you lose interest don't expect me to take
up the slack.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;As if, Daria.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn walked back down the hall into her room, closing the door behind
her.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, you're such a cutie-pie! Are you hungry? Look. Mommy got you
a nice new collar with a name tag so if you get out everyone will know
you're mine.&quot; She reached down and fastened the collar, its little
bell jingling merrily as she fastened the clasp.</P>

<P>&quot;Now, let's see about getting you something to eat. Your water
dish still has plenty in it.&quot;</P>

<P>She opened the closet door and got down a can of pet food, pulled back
the tag to open the lid and emptied the contents into the bowl next to
the water dish.</P>

<P>&quot;Now, if you're a good girl and eat up all your yummy food, Mommy
will play with you.&quot;</P>

<P>Sandi eagerly buried her face in the food bowl. &quot;Yes Mistress!&quot;
she purred.</P>
