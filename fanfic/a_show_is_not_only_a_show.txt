A show is not only a show


by Jane (hello_kitty_28@yahoo.com)

Part one: The tickets down from... erh... somewhere! 

(Daria is sitting in her bedroom one morning. She's
reading a book. Suddenly, we hear a scream from
downstairs.)

DARIA: (talking) What happened Quinn? You broke
another of your nails?

QUINN: (Screaming as she enters Daria's room) No...
worst than that!

DARIA: What could be worst than broke yourself a nail?
Gee... I wonder... Tell me... I wanna know!

QUINN: There's 2 show in town next week... One I really
don't want to go... but the other... oh god... I mean... The
Hanson
are back in town... Come on Daria... I have to borrow some
money to go! Please!

DARIA: Why would I do that for you?

QUINN: Oh come onnnn! I'll... eh... 

DARIA: Do all the work in the house for two weeks?

QUINN: No way...

DARIA: No deal... it's that or forget your money...

QUINN: All right, all right! I'll do all you ask!

DARIA: Here! (she gives her the money she needs and
then show her the door) Now you can leave me alone!

QUINN: But Daria... could you...

DARIA: No!

QUINN: But...

DARIA: I can take back my money...

QUINN: Ok ok I'm going!

DARIA: Fine... thank you!

QUINN: aaaahhhh!

DARIA: (between her teeth) Gee... I never though you
could ask that much to your sister... eh... cousin!)

(Cut to an hour later... The phone rings.)

QUINN: Got it! ... Daria?

DARIA: Hello?

JANE: Oh my dear best friend!

DARIA: What do you have to ask me... I have no more
money... already gave to Quinn... And...

JANE: I have nothing to ask to you!

DARIA: Yeah right!

JANE: ok ok... Trent, Jesse and I are going to a concert
next week... would you come with us...

DARIA: It's not the Hanson's concert, isn't it?

JANE: (making a disgusting sound in the phone) Are you
out of your mind?

DARIA: No... My sister is going! I wanted to be sure you
didn't change your mind about them!

JANE: Stop it Daria!

DARIA: Ok, ok... which concert?

JANE: Eh... well... I know it's not your music style, but
at least Trent will be there...

DARIA: Don't make me repeat!

JANE: huh?

DARIA: Which concert?

JANE: eh... Korn!

DARIA: Wow... don't expect me to...

JANE: Thank you Daria... I was sure you'd come... bye bye!

(she hangs up before Daria can say anything)

DARIA: Gee... Jane, I hate you!

(Cut to the next day, Daria arrive to school and find
Jane at her locker.)

DARIA: Jane?

JANE: Gotta go... be late for... eh... something!

DARIA: Jane! Wait...

JANE: I can't! sorry!

(Cut to see Daria frustrated entering Miss Li's
office.)

DARIA: Can I go home... I don't feel very well!

MISS LI: Yeah... but if it's one of the last times! I
guess you can miss a day.

DARIA: Gee... thanks Miss Li!

(Cut to see Daria almost crying walking home. When she
thinks of her parents' reaction she turns on Jane's
street and sit s down
in from of Jane's house.)

TRENT: (walking out of the house) Gee... Daria, what are
you doing here?

DARIA: left school, don't feel well... Jane's...

TRENT: What happened to Jane?

DARIA: She runs away when she sees me!

TRENT: I'll kill her!

DARIA: Why?

TRENT: Cause she made you cry...

DARIA: I didn't cry!

TRENT: Don't lie Daria! Your eyes are red... I know you
cried!

DARIA: well...

TRENT: Come in! It'll be safer!

DARIA: Thanks!

(Cut to see them walking into the house. Trent pulls a
chair for Daria to sit down. She sits down and looks
down.)

TRENT: So... will you come to the show with me?

DARIA: With you?

TRENT: Yeah... I won tickets to meet the bands and see
the show, but Janey and Jesse planned to go by
themselves and make
out in the toilet. (Daria looks at him and make a
weird face, at this, Trent add: ) I'm just kidding,
they'll meet us there, they planned
to go on a little lover vacation before.

DARIA: Gosh! And they leave you alone!

TRENT: That's why I'm asking you! I mean that! I like
to talk with you a lot and you mean a lot to me so... I
though you could
keep me company. I know that if Jane would come with
me, she'd ask you herself so I wouldn't have to ask
you, that's why I said
"that's why I ask you!" You understand?

DARIA: Yeah... I guess...

TRENT: So, will you come?

DARIA: hmmm... yeah!

TRENT: Thanks! (Without thinking he hugs and kisses
Daria on each cheeks) (Though: duh! What the fuck am I
doing? Trent let
her go before she hits you!) (Letting her go) Eh...
sorry Daria!

DARIA: (blushing) that's ok!

Part two: Why isn't it a date???

(It's the day of the show. A nice Friday night. No
rain, no cloud and it's not too cold outside.
Everything would be perfect for a
date, if at least there could be one! Daria gets out
of her house and waits for Trent in front of it. Five
minutes later, Trent stops his
car in front of the house and watch Daria walks to his
car. His eyes widen as he sees Daria wearing a tight
black T-shirt and blue
jeans. She sits down next to him.)

TRENT: Hey Daria... you look very pretty tonight!

DARIA: (blushing) eh... thanks!

TRENT: (Thought: damn! Why the hell did I say that?)
Ah... are you ready to go?

DARIA: Yeah... I guess so!

(Trent starts the car and drives away. A bit later,
they arrive at the show.

Part three: Meeting the nice freaks

(Before the show, Trent & Daria walk behind the stage
to meet Korn. When they meet them, Daria seems very
shy. Trent talks to
the band and often glances at Daria who's looking
down. After a little while, they have to go take their
seats. Daria says she has
to go meet Jane somewhere and leave. Jon Davis, Korn
singer, grabs Trent.)

JON: Hey man... you like that girl... Don't you?

TRENT: No... why are you saying this?

JON: Ah... come on... I can recognize love when I see it...
I have seen all your little smiles when you glanced at
her... I have
seen how nervous you were around her... don't lie about
those things! 

TRENT: Ok... I love her... but she doesn't love me back!

JON: You already asked her???

TRENT: Not really...

JON: So you won't know until you tell her how you feel
about her... The best thing you can do about it right
now is to tell her how
you feel...

TRENT: I guess you're right... I'll try...

JON: You better... if you don't... I will at the end of
the show... If I don't see you holding her hand of
kissing her before the end
of the show... I'll tell her myself...

Part four: The violent show...

(A while later, Daria, Jane, Jesse and Trent are
waiting the show to start. Some people around them are
screaming... anyway...
Most of them lost very weird. Trent, oblivious,
doesn't remember what Jon told him a bit earlier.
Suddenly, the band comes on
stage and starts singing "Falling away from me".
People start trashing. Some does bodysurfing. Some are
just jumping. But some
are jumping on other people. Daria looks at the crowd
and let out a small laugh as a weird guy looking like
Quinn's friend falls on
the ground.)

(A bit later, when the show is almost finished, Jon
starts to talk into the microphone.)

JON: I have a last thing to say before we go... I made a
deal with a fan in the audience... And I'll respect it!
Daria... Trent has
something to say to you...

(Daria looks surprised and looks at Trent. Trent
glances at her and looks very shy and nervous. He
takes Daria's hand.)

TRENT: Daria... I... eh... love you...

(Daria looks at him, shocked. Everybody look at them.
Daria blushes.)

DARIA: I love you too Trent...

(Trent moves toward her and kisses her softly.
Everybody starts to applaud except Jane who is too
shocked.)

JANE: (thought: OH MY GOD... THEY FINALLY DID IT...)

Part five: coming back home...

(Cut to see Trent's car in front of the
Morgendorffer's residence. Daria and Trent are kissing
in the car. After a moment, Daria
gets out of the car and walk to her home. Trent
watches her.)

TRENT: (to himself) She's so beautiful... I'm glad I met
Jonathan Davis. He's such a nice guy. I think that if
I'd never have met
him... It would have never happened. I would never have
had Daria. 

DARIA: (to herself) Thanks Jon! Without you, that
would have never happen!

(Daria gets into the house and walks to her room.
Helen follows her and walks in Daria's room...)

HELEN: How was the show sweetie?

DARIA: Great mom... can I go to bed now?

HELEN: Of course... good night...

DARIA: G'night mom!

(When Helen walks out of the room. Daria falls asleep
with a big smile on her face.)

The end...
