SCENE ONE: MR O'NEILL'S CLASSROOM<br>
<br>
(The class is over decorated for Christmas.)<br>
<br>
O'NEILL: With only three minutes of the school year left, why don't we sing a special Christmas song?<br>
<br>
KEVIN: I know! A hundred bottles of egg nog on the wall, a hundred bottles of egg nog...<br>
<br>
O'NEILL: Oh, darn it.<br>
<br>
(The bell rings.)<br>
<br>
O'NEILL: Class dismissed.<br>
<br>
(The class whoop and run out. Daria and Jane walk out at their own pace.)<br>
<br>
JANE: Christmas.<br>
<br>
DARIA: I hate the way it's been over commercialised. Even TV shows have their own crappy holiday specials.<br>
<br>
JANE: Bah humbug. So, going out to egg Brittany's house tonight?<br>
<br>
DARIA: Nah.<br>
<br>
JANE: What is it with you and Christmas?<br>
<br>
DARIA: Exactly! It is Christmas. I really want to spend time with my family.<br>
<br>
JANE (shocked): Daria? Have you hit your head or something? Call an ambulance!<br>
<br>
DARIA: Isn't Christmas about spending time with your family, no matter how dumb they may be?<br>
<br>
ANDREA: No, it's about defacing public property.<br>
<br>
JANE: See?<br>
<br>
DARIA (angrily): Look. I don't care what you are going to do tonight, just leave me out of it.<br>
<br>
(Daria storms off.)<br>
<br>
SCENE TWO: MORGENDORFFER LIVING ROOM<br>
<br>
(Only Helen is in the room. She is getting ready to leave. Daria walks in.)<br>
<br>
HELEN: Oh, Daria. I'm going Christmas shopping at the Mall of the Millennium.<br>
<br>
DARIA: The Mall of the Millennium?<br>
<br>
HELEN: And you're coming with me.<br>
<br>
SCENE THREE: THE CAR<br>
<br>
(Helen and Daria are on their way.)<br>
<br>
HELEN: Okay, don't worry. Everybody has probably already done their Christmas- oh no!<br>
<br>
(Helen catches a glimpse of the Mall. The car park is packed.)<br>
<br>
DARIA: Maybe we ought to park here and catch a bus.<br>
<br>
SCENE THREE: MALL<br>
<br>
(Daria and Helen are very, very tired. They have obviously parked their car far away and walked to the mall.)<br>
<br>
HELEN: We're... (puff)... here.<br>
<br>
DARIA: My sarcasm knows no limits.<br>
<br>
SCENE FOUR: INSIDE THE MALL<br>
<br>
(Helen and Daria are inside the mall.)<br>
<br>
HELEN: What first? Okay, I think we can get something CHEAP for Rita.<br>
<br>
DARIA: You really love your sisters, don't you?<br>
<br>
SCENE FIVE: SUPERMARKET<br>
<br>
(Helen and Daria are in line. There is an obviously inexperienced boy at the counter.)<br>
<br>
BAGBOY: Hello.<br>
<br>
HELEN: Hello, bag boy.<br>
<br>
(The bag boy puts everything in a bag. We hear some glass breaking.)<br>
<br>
BAGBOY: Whoops.<br>
<br>
(Helen makes a slightly miffed face while Daria stands in front of her abd smirks.)<br>
<br>
SCENE SIX: THE CAR<br>
<br>
HELEN: I am never going back there again!<br>
<br>
DARIA: Thank God.<br>
<br>
(The car phone rings.)<br>
<br>
HELEN: Hello? Oh hiiii, Eric! We're on our way back from the Mall of the Millennium... talk about inexperience!<br>
<br>
(Fade out.)<br>
