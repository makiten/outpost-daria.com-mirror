Warrior Maid of Lawndale'</b></font><p></div>
<div>Rated: PG for mild violence<p><b>Short summary:</b><p>Beneath the
hurtling moons of Barsoom, the angry squeal of a wild thoat echoes, as a lone
hero rides out on a mission of honor, to reclaim her lost love, or maybe she's
just looking for a good Chinese restaurant.<p>This is a Daria story, but in the
form of a pastiche, a story done in the style of another author, in this case
Edgar Rice Burroughs.  It's also a parody.  If you're a Daria fan, enjoy Heroic
Fantasy, and can get past the verbose prose that characterized Burroughs'
Martian stories, you'll hopefully enjoy it.  But if you're looking for a
canonical Daria story, and you hated <i>Depth Takes a Holiday</i>, boy did you
come to the wrong place.  Leave now, while you still have your sanity.<p>Daria

			<hr>
			<p>Daria awoke suddenly in the darkness,
disoriented.  Realizing that she was in her bed, she felt about the bedside
table for her glasses.  The clock read 5:30.  She jumped up and ran to her
computer, quickly booting it up, and began to type furiously, before the strange
dream faded from her mind...<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>I crouched behind the low windshield of my flier, and tried to coax it to
greater heights of performance, as far below the dry sea bottom blurred past. 
Stacy, my loyal pet calot, a gray-furred beast the size of a Shetland pony, with
teeth that would make a shark jealous, sank the claws of his ten legs into the
seat behind me and whined; he would have been far happier running alongside my
thoat, but I could never have overtaken those I pursued on the ground.  Already
the soldiers who had stolen my beloved Thom out of the very center of our
homeland were far ahead, but I knew where they were going, and did not need to
see them to follow.<p>I suppose a word or two of introduction is required, lest
the reader of this tale become as confused as I was when first I set foot on
this world over ten years ago.  I know not how I came to be here on that day,
when I awoke naked and alone in the midst of a vast field of red moss.  Only
later did I learn that it was one of the millennia-dry seabeds of the planet we
terrestrials call Mars, but that the natives know as Barsoom.<p>This world is
home to many peoples, but chief among them are the red Martians, who are
humanoid, have coppery-red skin, uniformly black hair and reproduce by laying
eggs.  As my sister would say, eww!  The red Martians are divided into many
city-states and empires, and fight amongst themselves constantly, but the wild
tribes of green Martians are enemies of them all.  <p>A green Martian warrior
stands fifteen feet tall, with olive skin, six limbs, and huge china-white tusks
protruding from his lower jaw, and with rare exception knows not the concepts of
mercy, friendship or honor.  Their intermediate limbs can be used as extra legs,
for stability, or arms.  As fighters, they have no peer.<p>In the years since
my arrival, I have fought and killed many Martians, both green and red, not by
choice, as I am peaceful by nature, and would prefer to be left alone.  But rare
is the Martian who understands the concept of peaceful coexistence.  Many will
learn if defeated in battle, for they respect strength here, but some will not
accept that a small female could be their superior, and will not stop short of
death.  Nearly every day of my ten years here has been a struggle for survival;
the experience has hardened me.  Nietzsche would have loved this world.  I hate
it.<p>Oddly, I awoke here with perfect vision, which is fortunate given the
lack of optometrists.  Over the years I have discovered that I heal rapidly, do
not appear to age, and have never suffered so much as a mild cold. I do not know
what causes this, but it appears to be a condition common to all expatriates
from the third planet.<p>For several years I wandered the world, at first
alone, and later with my calot, searching for an explanation as to how I had
come to be here or a means to return home, consulting many scientists, but to no
avail.  I also looked, always without success, for a branch of the Good Time
Chinese restaurant, for that chain is widespread, and would likely have provided
a way home.<p>After many adventures, during which I came to know the language
used by all the peoples of Barsoom, and learned to fight with sword and gun, at
long last I came to the Twin Cities of Helium, greatest of all the cities of the
red Martians, and capital of the Empire of Helium.  There I earned for myself a
position as a Dwar, or Captain, in the army of Helium, which is the principle
route to advancement in this warlike culture.  In time, I found that my beloved
had also been transported here, and we made our home among our newfound friends
in Helium.  Only later did we discover that we were not the only ones so
mysteriously transported from Lawndale.<p>Unknown to us, a former friend had
also arrived, and over time had united several isolated tribes of the fearsome
green Martians.  Taking over one of the many ruined cities that dot the shores
of the dead seas, she formed her own city-state, which she named Escher.  But
her years alone among the six-limbed green Martians had changed her, and when we
finally met, we were strangers to each other.  On a diplomatic visit to Helium
I, at last, saw Queen Jhane of Escher, and unbeknownst to me her passion for
Thom was rekindled.  Now, her soldiers had kidnapped him and were fleeing back
to their city.  I had been given leave to follow, but the government could not
send additional forces to assist in what was so obviously a matter of personal
honor.<p>Thus I found myself speeding over the dead sea bottom on an
open-topped four-person flier, in pursuit of he whom I hold most dear, assisted
only by my calot.  Occasionally my flier would be struck by a bullet from those
I pursued, for the green Martians are the most expert marksmen in all the world,
able to hit a target at a distance, in terrestrial terms, of over 200 miles
thanks to the sophisticated aiming systems with which their guns are equipped. 
Fortunately it was still night, so they could not use the explosive ammunition
that depended on sunlight for its triggering.  With dawn approaching, I would
soon need to fly low and use the curve of the planet to remove myself from their
sight, but in the dark that would be far too hazardous at my present
speed.<p>When the two small moons, Cluros and Thuria, are below the horizon,
nights on Barsoom are possessed of darkness far more stygian than even the most
remote location on Earth.  The thin atmosphere, kept breathable only by the
ceaseless activity of the world-spanning network of atmosphere plants, holds
nearly no dust or moisture, leaving nothing to scatter starlight. The surface of
the planet is largely unpopulated, and thus the lights of civilization are
absent from most parts of the world.  In short, although my instruments told me
the distance of my ship above the ground, and would warn of any obstruction that
rose near to my altitude, I could see nothing beyond my flier except for the
stars above, and a dim impression of landscape somewhere below me, with
barely-seen hills and valleys flowing past, soundless except for the scream of
air past my windshield, and the occasional ping of a bullet from those I
pursued.<p>Eventually the sky began to lighten, and as dawn in this
unrefractory air is a sudden event, I slowed and took my craft lower.  Below, I
could see the ground rise, and ahead the outline of hills marked the edge of the
sea bottom I had been flying over all night.  We had come most of the way to
Escher, which was on the far side of a former isthmus I was about to
cross.<p>Suddenly, as dawn broke over the world, there was an explosion from
the prow of my flier, which bucked and would have thrown Stacy and I off but for
our safety straps.  The green Martians must have been firing explosive bullets
all night, in the hope that one or more would lodge in my craft and be triggered
by the sun, as indeed one had.  Such dishonorable behavior was only to be
expected of them, and I chided myself for not foreseeing it, even as I struggled
to regain control.  Unfortunately, the explosion must have pierced the forward
buoyancy tank, and gradually the nose of the craft sank.  I cut the throttle, as
the vessel assumed a vertical orientation, and carefully lowered the vehicle to
the ground below.<p>Grounded, I released the safety straps, and Stacy bounded
off with what passes for a bark of joy among his species.  My mood was less
joyful: I could repair the buoyancy tank but lacked a supply of the eighth ray
required to fill it.  I was afoot, with hundreds of miles of wilderness to cover
before I reached my destination.  Fortunately I was armed, as the predators of
Barsoom would make a quick snack of the fiercest terrestrial lion.  Even so, the
risk was great, but as there was no alternative I took inventory and began to
prepare for my journey.<p>My craft was well stocked with ammunition and
concentrated food, as well as more mundane tools for navigating and living in
the wild.  I packed quickly, clipping pouches and bags to my leather harness as
I went.  I had, perforce, adopted the local style of dress when I found myself
here, with a few alterations to suit my own tastes.  The dress of the red
Martians, and indeed of most of the peoples of the planet, consisted simply of
an abbreviated leather harness designed more for utility than modesty, a concept
seemingly foreign to this world.  Mine was decorated with the metal emblems
denoting my city, family, rank, and personal accomplishments, but with rather
more material in some locations than the average Barsoomian would consider
strictly necessary.  Even after ten years, I have not outgrown the culture of my
childhood.  I find it ironic that I, who never cared for fashion as did my
sister, miss my green jacket and black skirt more than any other aspect of my
old life.  Fortunately, the red Martians have sensible ideas regarding footwear,
and my boots were well suited to an overland trek.<p>After one last check of my
supplies, I shouldered my pack, and whistled for Stacy, who bounded back to me. 
Then I set out for the ridge marking the edge of the former ocean in a series of
long bounds, with Stacy in hot pursuit.  I should mention that my terrestrial
muscles, coupled with the lower gravity of this world, allowed me to move with
speed and agility far surpassing any of the natural denizens.  That was all that
had kept me alive when I first found myself here, and now it enabled a
ground-eating pace that would permit me to cross the hundreds of miles ahead in
a matter of days.  Fortunately, at least in this case, the necessities of life
on Barsoom had required me to give up the indolent lifestyle I would prefer, and
I was in excellent physical shape for such a trip.  I do miss the days I spent
counting ceiling cracks from my bed, or sprawled on the couch in front of the
television, but there are few opportunities for such relaxation here.<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>Hours later, as I approached the ridge, I realized from its regular aspect
that I was looking at the docks of one of the abandoned cities that dot the
former coastline.  Although no one had lived here permanently in more millennia
than I could conceive, the nomadic green Martians often make temporary camps in
these cities, and the fearsome white apes are known to lair here, as well. 
Accordingly, I signaled Stacy to silence, and approached cautiously, not wanting
to be observed by sentries or a pack of hungry apes.<p>Crossing the open quay
behind the docks quickly, I made my way into one of the buildings, and
ascertained that it was empty.  Moving deeper into the city, using the buildings
for cover, Stacy and I found no indications of recent habitation.  This made me
all the more nervous, as recent use by the green Martians would make the
presence of white apes less likely.  I continued deeper into the city for
several hours, breaking for lunch around midday, then continuing.  I hoped to be
beyond the city before nightfall; although there are many dangers in the wild, I
can outrun most, and the constrained spaces of the city limit the advantages of
my superior agility.  I have always preferred to run from danger rather than to
kill, a characteristic that puzzles my Martian friends.<p>Late in the day, my
luck finally failed me, as I was making my way through yet another abandoned
building.  Moving quickly, perhaps too quickly because of my desire to leave the
city, I rounded a corner and came face to face with a great white ape.  They are
an ugly species, hairless except for a shock of white hair atop the head, and
with pale skin, they look like a caricature of a terrestrial human, but have no
known language, and display no evidence of intelligence; for some reason they
remind me of football players. This one must have been a juvenile, as it only
stood twelve feet tall.  I don't know which of us was the more surprised, it
froze as I approached, and I barely diverted my headlong flight to avoid
crashing into it, an event that would likely have been fatal, as they are fierce
carnivores.  With a quiet grunt it turned to follow me, and I accelerated,
attempting to outpace it, but the low ceiling limited the length of my bounds,
and it slowly overtook me.<p>I was going to have to fight it, but the fact that
it had made no loud sounds was a sign that others of its kind were about, and it
wanted this meal to itself.  If I used my radium pistol, the noise would draw
the rest of the pack.  Killing a great ape with a sword is not impossible,
merely improbable, as its vital organs are buried beneath a layer of muscle and
fat that is difficult to pierce.  I needed an advantage, and
quickly.<p>Entering a large atrium, I found what I sought, a sunken courtyard
that went down three levels, further than an ape could jump.  Light filtered
down from an opening in the roof, several stories above. If I could lure it over
the edge, I would be long gone before it found its way back up, but these
buildings are the apes natural habitat, and it would not be easily fooled.  I
drew my sword, and suddenly reversed my course, leaping over and past it, and
cutting down at its head as I went.  I struck it, not deeply enough to cause
serious injury, but enough to annoy.  <p>The ape spun, but I was already well
past; altering my course to the side, I led it a merry chase.  I kept moving,
and doubled back frequently, getting the ape in the habit of turning to pursue
me.  While I was at this, Stacy caught up, and joined the fun, darting in to
snap at its legs with his vicious teeth, and then away when I distracted the
ape.  Stacy and I have been a team for many years, and worked together
effortlessly.  <p>Gradually we maneuvered the ape close to the edge, and then
Stacy distracted it, while I made a great jump over its head, cutting it once
again.  The ape turned and leaped, nearly catching me, but I had timed it right,
and the ape discovered it was trying to walk on air just before it caught me,
and dropped into the pit like the animated coyote I remembered from my
childhood, while I sailed across and landed on the far side.<p>Turning to look
down, I saw to my horror that the courtyard below was occupied; a party of green
Martians had encamped there.  Worse, there appeared to be no warriors in the
camp at present, and the ape had landed in the midst of a group of unarmed
women, scattering them in all directions.  While the green Martians are well
equipped for battle, with their tusks and fierce nature, the apes are equally
well armed with claws and teeth, and fiercer yet.  Although I hold no love for
the green Martians, nor they for me, I could not stand by and be responsible for
the death of innocents.  Accordingly, I launched myself down at the beast with a
yell to attract its attention.<p>The ape seemed torn between resuming our
fight, or attacking the group it had fallen among; as it dithered I struck:
bouncing off its back, and cutting it a deep gash in the back of the head with
my sword.  All uncertainty forgot, the ape turned on me with a roar, and nearly
caught me as I landed on the ground flat on my back.<p>Fortunately, one of the
women hit the ape on the shoulder with a hurled cook pot, and I recovered my
footing while it batted the harmless crockery into dust.  I dashed past it,
sinking my sword deeply into the region of its kidney as I went by, but with
apparently no effect other than to further enrage it.  Deciding that the noise
we were making was already substantial, I drew my pistol and shot the ape.  The
explosive ammunition blew a crater in its chest a full foot across, and the ape,
with a surprised look, died.<p>Holstering my pistol, I turned to the women. 
They looked at me with the suspicion that all green Martians harbor for those
not of their tribe, but without the open enmity with which they often greet
strangers.  In quick conversation I learned that they were a foraging party from
Escher, sent to the city in search of a pack of wild thoats that had been
observed by an air patrol.  The wild thoat is a much larger creature than the
domesticated thoat that I ride back in Helium, and much prized by the green
Martians as both pack animal and mount.<p>I cautioned the leader of the women,
whose name was Nala, that there were probably other white apes in the vicinity. 
She responded that they had arms, and only the unexpected arrival of the ape
from above had prevented her companions from reaching them before they were
attacked.  She also expected her warriors to return shortly, as the sound of the
fight would have carried for some distance.  I apologized for involving them in
my fight, but Nala laughed and said that it was the most fun they had had all
week.  With that, I took my leave, and leaped by up to where Stacy had been
waiting.<p>Quickly, we fled the building, and a short time later we exited the
city into the surrounding wastes.  The highlands between the dead seas are, if
anything, even more desolate, consisting mainly of barren rocky outcrops
sheltering scrub plants, and the ever-present red moss.  Although open water was
non-existent, there is a plant which concentrates water into a milky beverage,
and between that and my concentrated rations, I was in no danger of starvation,
although meals had a blandness that caused me to think nostalgically of my old
high school cafeteria.<p>We made good time through the wasteland, moving throughout the day, as well as at night when the moons were both high and cast sufficient light to see the irregular ground. When it grew dark, Stacy and I curled up together for warmth, and took turns sleeping, preventing any of the local wildlife from making a meal of us. Only once did we need to run from a predator, when we spied a banth in the distance. The Martian banth is a cousin of the calot, although it grows far larger, and has some similarities to a terrestrial cat, if you can imagine a cat that stands ten feet at the shoulder. It is a beautiful creature, seen from a safe distance, and the most terrifying animal I have ever encountered when seen up close. Fortunately, it did not notice us, and I was spared the need to kill it, for a hunting banth rarely abandons prey that it decides to pursue. <p>After several days
of travel, we topped a ridge, and saw the city of Escher in the distance. 
Quickly, I dropped back below the ridge, and waited for night without even
looking towards the city again.  The guards of a city keep close watch on the
surrounding land, to prevent being surprised by an invading force, and making
myself visible to the city walls would likely result in our discovery.  We lay
in the shadow of a rock outcrop, which would hide us from casual observation if
anyone flew overhead, and waited for nightfall.<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>Unlike the abandoned city, a wall, newly built in the years since the city
was repopulated, surrounded Escher.  Guards patrolled atop the wall, and
overhead patrol craft and small fliers protected the city from airborne
approach.  However, the wall was designed to protect the inhabitants from the
great white apes and banths that had formerly called the city home.  Under the
cover of night, it was a simple task for Stacy and I to enter the city through a
maintenance tunnel that paralleled the subterranean irrigation pipes running
between the city and the surrounding agricultural fields.<p>At night, a Martian
city is a quiet place, as people keep to their homes after dark.  Moving through
the city was simply a matter of avoiding the occasional patrol; not too
difficult given the amount of noise they made.<p>The palace of the Queen was
easily located; not only was it the largest building in the city, it was also
the only one painted with a mural depicting the uniting of the tribes and the
founding of the city by Queen Jhane.  Subtlety has never been an attribute of
her personality.  Leaving Stacy to wait for me, I quickly climbed the rough
exterior of the building to its top-most story, nearly five hundred feet above
the ground.  Fortunately, Martian architecture is rich in exterior detail, and
that coupled with the low gravity made the climb a simple task.<p>Entering
through a balcony, once I had identified the Queen's apartments, I encountered
only one guard inside the apartment itself, stationed outside the door of the
Queen's bedchamber.  Hoping to avoid his death, I drew my sword and leaped the
length of the hall in a single bound, cutting the guard's harness and dropping
his sidearm to the floor out of reach.  The guard swung his ceremonial spear at
me, but did not call for help.  I had counted on this, as Martians usually
mistook my slight appearance for weakness, and even green Martians are concerned
with appearing self-sufficient.  To call for help against such a minor nuisance,
and a female at that, is so totally against their nature that they do not even
consider it.<p>Easily leaping over the spear, which resembled nothing so much
as a flagpole with a sharp point, I cut the guard deeply across his chest; a
wound that would gradually weaken him, but by no means a fatal one. I bounced
off the wall, as one of his free hands made a grab for my legs that would have
snapped them like twigs had I remained there.  As I flew away, I cut down at one
of the hands holding the spear.  The wound was not severe, but it distracted him
long enough for me to hit the far wall of the hallway and ricochet back.  This
time I brought the hilt of my sword down atop his head with the full force of my
terrestrial muscles, knocking him unconscious in an instant.  I stepped over his
body, and entered the Queen's chamber.<p>Walking past several easels with
paintings in various stages of completion, I approached the bed.  Jumping onto
it, I brought the point of my sword to the Queen's throat, just as the motion of
the bed woke her and she began to sit up.  Feeling my sword, she stopped and
looked at me with wild eyes.<p>"Daria?  What are you doing here?  And move that
sword, dammit, you nearly cut my throat!"<p>"I go by Dar-Eya now, Jhane, and as
for the sword, the only reason I haven't cut your throat is the memory of our
former friendship.  Now tell me where he is, or I may just forget about the old
days altogether."<p>"Where who is?  What are you talking about?"<p>"My
husband, of course, why else would I be here?"<p>"Your husband?  Tom, err,
Thom?  I thought you had him nicely domesticated, keeping the home fires burning
in Helium while you adventured about the globe.  Why should I know where he is? 
Did you two have a fight or something?"<p>I poked her with the sword. "Quit
stalling.  I know you have him; your soldiers were observed kidnapping him, and
two of their bodies, complete with insignia, were found where they fought with
my household guards."<p>Jhane scowled, a familiar expression from the old days,
although she'd never turned it on me before.  It was an expression she reserved
for the terminally stupid, which included most other inhabitants of Lawndale,
but she only used it in exceptional situations.  Seeing that look turned on me
shook my certainty that I was right, but years of combat training kept my sword
in place.<p>"So, just because someone leaves a couple of bodies wearing my
troops' uniforms in your hallway, I have to be the guilty party?  The Daria I
knew was never that stupid, but obviously Dar-Eya, Dwar of the third Utan, of
the second Dar, of the magnificent twenty-seventh Umak, does her thinking with
her sword!"<p>"How did you know my station?" I asked, shaken by her
observation, at least in part because it was something I should have considered,
but had completely overlooked.<p>"Oh come on, amiga, we were friends.  Even if
you consider yourself too good to associate with someone who lives with green
Martians, I haven't forgotten who we used to be.  As soon as I discovered you
were here, I found out everything I could, and came to Helium to visit you, but
you wouldn't even talk to me!"<p>"But I was just a padwar then, and you were a
visiting head of state.  I couldn't talk to you in public, and I wasn't invited
to any of the parties thrown in your honor.  You could have called on me at my
home if you wanted to talk to me!"<p>"Jeeze, Daria, you really have bought into
this whole paternalistic culture, haven't you?  When was the last time you spoke
your mind in public?  Or are you so busy being a good little conformist, you
don't even have opinions of your own anymore?"<p>"Of course I have opinions,
but I got tired of having to kill every idiot I offended with them.  It's easier
just to let them think whatever they like, and ignore them.  I have friends I
can talk to, but they aren't the people you'd meet on a state visit.  If you
came to visit me, why make such a production of it?"<p>"Daria, you are such an
innocent sometimes.  There aren't very many options for a boatload of green
Martians in a red Martian city.  We were either raiders or diplomats in their
eyes.  Personally, I'd rather attend a state banquet than my own execution any
day."<p>"I think I'd opt for the execution, myself."  I smiled, relieved to
find that I believed her, and lowered my sword.  "But, if you didn't kidnap
Thom, who did?"<p>"Good question." Jhane sat up, and I noticed that she was
wearing something that looked suspiciously like a t-shirt.  <p>"Where did you
get that shirt?"<p>"I had it made.  When you're a Queen, you get to tell people
to do things like that.  Come here."  She slid out of the bed, and walked to the
side of the room, opening a door into a walk-in closet filled with clothes. 
Walking to the back, she reached into a rack, and pulled out a hanger with a
green jacket, orange t-shirt, and black skirt.  She handed it to me.  "I had
this made too, after I saw what you were wearing in Helium, or not
wearing."<p>My breath caught in my throat.  "My God, Jane," I said in English,
"it's the most beautiful thing I've seen in ten years!"  I noticed I was still
holding my sword, and sheathed it.  Then, for the first time in years, I was
conscious of what I was wearing, and could feel my cheeks heating with a
blush.<p>"Nice leather bikini." Jhane said, "I could never get you to wear
anything that scanty when I wanted to paint you."<p>"That's right, oh mighty
Queen, rub it in.  I'd actually stopped noticing it years ago," I said, "it's
more substantial than what I started out with when I first arrived."<p>"Me too,
but I prefer real clothing.  There's a bathroom over on the other side of the
room, why don't you go soak for a while, you smell like a calot for some reason.
I need to send the guard to gather my council of chiefs, and have him bring some
breakfast back, and both will take time since I haven't installed an elevator
yet."<p>"Uh, Jhane, you'll need to get another guard while you're at it, the
one outside the door is taking a nap."<p>"I was wondering how you got in here. 
How did you get by the dozen in the main hall?"<p>"I came in through the
window."<p>"That's okay then, an occasional fatality keeps them on their toes,
but if you killed a dozen, I'd need to talk fast to keep their whole tribe from
declaring a blood feud against you."<p>"I'd rather avoid that, it's been a long
week.  Incidentally, I smell like a calot because I've been camping in the wild
with one for several days. I should go out and let him in before someone notices
he's outside your palace and decides to have a late snack."<p>"Do that after
the bath. I need to get my guards used to the idea you're in here first, so we
don't have any accidents from excess enthusiasm."<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>After a long and hedonistic soak in the bath, I felt clean for the first
time since leaving Helium.  Emerging, my skin dried quickly in the bone-dry air,
while I combed tangles out of my hair, then, for the first time since leaving
Lawndale, I dressed in familiar clothing.  The only problem I had was
determining where to hang my sword and pistol, eventually I settled on wearing
part of my old harness as a belt over my coat, and hung them from that.  This
also gave me a place to hang my various insignia of rank and honor.<p>While I
had been soaking, I had heard sounds of activity from outside, and returning to
the main chamber, I discovered that a table had been laid with a feast, and
Jhane was engaged in eating breakfast.<p>"Thanks for waiting for me."<p>"Hey,
we don't stand on ceremony here.  Grab a chair and dig in, we've got a council
meeting as soon as we're done."<p>"How soon? I still need to let Stacy
in."<p>Jhane looked up, surprised. "Stacy?  She's here too?"<p>I had to think
for a moment, as I'd actually forgotten where my calot's name had
originated.<p>"No, Stacy is my calot.  I named her that because of the hurt
look she gives me when I have to yell at her for something."<p>Jhane laughed. 
"She did have that hurt-puppy look, didn't she?  I'd forgotten that. Anyway,
we'll have time, the council will wait for their Queen."  She looked thoughtful.
"Daria, have you ever discovered how the three of us came to be brought here, or
if anyone else is here?"<p>"No, the best scientists of Helium have been unable
to come up with an explanation.  There have been other people from Earth who
came here, always by some form of projection that left their body sleeping on
Earth while they were gone, but never more than one at a time."<p>"You mean,
even though we're on Mars, our bodies are back home somehow?"<p>"That's the way
it's worked in the past, but usually it was the result of some traumatic event,
and I don't recall anything like that, so who knows."<p>"Yeah, the last
thing I remember was going to bed, after you and Tom left, the night the three
of us had gone out for dinner.  A full stomach was rare at casa Lane, but hardly
traumatic."<p>"Thom and I have similar memories; he dropped me at home, I
argued with Quinn about whose turn it was to take out the trash, and went to
bed."  I smiled, thinking that it was odd to have fond memories of a fight, but
it was really that a fight like that was so typical of my relationship with my
sister that it helped me to remember her.  I wondered if I would ever see her
again.<p>Jhane set down the fruit she'd been eating, and leaned forward.  "So,
you called Tom your husband earlier, when did you get married?"<p>"Oh, about
six years back, shortly after I arrived in Helium and discovered he was
there."<p>"Any kids?"<p>"No, I've been too busy with my military career, and
there doesn't seem to be any urgency; at twenty-eight I still appear to be
eighteen. What about you?"<p>Jhane smiled. "I've got eight thousand people
ready to wait on me hand and foot, who needs a husband?"  Her look turned more
somber.  "Besides, there aren't any eligible bachelors around who aren't fifteen
feet tall.  I prefer my men a bit shorter than that."<p>"Jhane, how did you
come to be Queen anyway? I never heard any details."<p>"I'm not surprised, I've
never told anyone.  The full story is too long for today, but the short answer
is that one of the tribes captured me.  Did you know that among the green
Martians, the men do all the fighting, but don't have any other skills?  The
woman make the weapons and ammunition, they build and repair the wagons, and
harvest and prepare the food."<p>"Typical Barsoomian behavior, the men have the
power and the women do the work, not that much different from home."<p>"That's
what they thought, until I introduced the women to the concept of collective
bargaining."<p>I looked at Jhane, dumbstruck.  "You unionized the green Martian
women, and they made you Queen?  Why didn't they just kill you?"<p>"Like I
said, it's a long story.  They certainly wanted to, but I'd planned it
carefully.  Eventually they had to give in to the women, and accept their
representative onto the tribal council.  Over time, I introduced novel ideas
like farming and manufacturing crafts for trade to the red Martians.  They'd
barely had a subsistence economy before that, with trade they could afford
luxuries.  Eventually, other tribes joined us to get in on the action; this is
the highest standard of living these people have ever known.  After a few years
of squabbling among themselves over who would be the boss, they finally
appointed me Queen just to end the arguments."<p>"It can't have been that
easy."<p>"Well, no, but it makes a good story," Jhane smiled, "and the reality
wasn't too different.  If you're done eating, we should go find Stacy, and meet
with the council."<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>Queen Jhane, flanked by her honor guard of twelve green Martians, preceded
me into the council chamber, and the guards spread out to take positions along
the sides of the room.  As I entered, followed by Stacy, the councilors stood
and saluted their Queen, and any doubt I had had as to the actuality of her
station was banished by the respect with which they honored her.  It was a
moving sight, to see that slight, red-clad figure, dwarfed by a dozen warriors
near three times her height, walk serenely to the raised chair at the head of
the council table and take her place.  The council resumed their seats, and
turned to regard me.<p>"Councilors, chiefs, and representatives of the guilds
of Escher, I call this meeting to order."  Jhane said, "Does anyone wish to
speak before I lay my business before you?"<p>One older man, judging from the
dark tint of his green skin, rose: "My Queen, why do you permit a warrior of our
hated enemies, the red men, to bear weapons in your presence?"<p>"This is
Dar-Eya of Lawndale, an old and valued friend from Earth, and if she were going
to kill me, she'd have done so before now."<p>The tribal chief, as so I judged
him, inclined his tusked head to her in acknowledgement, and sat down.  Another,
younger, man rose in his place.<p>"Even here in Escher, five thousand haads
from Helium, we have heard of the exploits of Dwar Dar-Eya.  What brings you,
alone, to our city?"<p>That was my cue.  "Honored councilors, a week ago green
Martians, disguised as soldiers of Escher, stole my husband from the very heart
of Helium.  This was obviously an attempt to cause strife between our countries,
which, while not friends, have never had cause to fight ere this. I have come to
find who would so wish to dishonor your name, and to recover my beloved from
their clutches."<p>At this, the councilors broke into a myriad of rapid
conversations among themselves, while Jhane watched impassively.  When all were
busy, she turned to me and winked; our stratagem had succeeded, and what had
been my problem alone had become an attack on the entire city-state of Escher. 
Whoever was responsible for kidnapping Thom was about to have a really bad
day.<p>As the conversations died down, the elderly man, who appeared to be
senior among the councilors, rose and addressed Jhane: "My Queen, there are many
who are jealous of our success, and would wish to sow dissent between Helium and
Escher.  However, few have vehicles capable of reaching Helium, or the subtlety
required for such a plan.  We think that this is the work of Tal Karas, whom you
exiled last year.  He has many friends within the city who would aid him, and a
bitter enmity for you personally."<p>"Jhane," I asked, "why is this man so
upset with you that he would start a war in revenge?"<p>"He was one of my best
scientists, responsible for many of the innovations that allow us to grow food
and herd animals on this barren highland.  But his interest in the mysteries of
life led him to experiment on prisoners.  I should have executed him when he was
caught, but in recognition of his past services, I exiled him instead.  He was
never well balanced, and I fear he has descended into madness, and is focused on
destroying me as the first step of his return to power."<p>"Great, a mad
scientist.  Any other surprises you want to let me in on?"<p>"He was always
intrigued by my terrestrial physiology.  It is likely that he took Thom, not
just to start a war, but for his research." Jhane turned to her council, "Do we
know where he is hiding?"<p>The elderly chief replied: "He has taken over an
old fortress a day's march east of here.  We could easily conquer it, but not
before he could kill the captive. We must act carefully, and not simply
attack."<p>I was startled, although I remained expressionless; a green Martian
warrior considering the fate of a prisoner, rather than rushing to attack an
individual, who had raised a threat against his country and ruler, was an event
that defied logic.  It seemed that not all of the green Martians were the
unthinking savages that I knew from past encounters, or perhaps I had just not
taken the time to know them better.  This thought, and Jhanes earlier words
about my tendency to accept the world as others defined it, caused me to wonder
if it were I, and not the Martians, who had been acting like a savage.<p>"Yes,"
Jhane said, "Dar-Eya and I will need to infiltrate his fortress and free Thom
before you can lead the army against him."<p>I blinked; this was not what we
had discussed.  The chief did not seem much taken with the idea either, and
instantly objected.<p>"My Queen, my respect for your courage is unbounded, but
you are not a warrior!  We have troops who are skilled raiders, let us send some
of them with Dar-Eya instead."<p>Jhane stood, nearly vibrating with anger, and
addressed the council as a whole.<p>"No!  I have finally found my friend after
all these years, and I will not abandon her.  Two small terrestrials can
infiltrate far better than a squad of Martians, and Dar-Eya can handle any
fighting.  If it comes to a pitched battle, we will have failed in our mission.
My decision is final.  We will leave immediately, and you will follow with the
army at dawn. I have spoken."<p>She had closed with the formal words marking a
rulers decision, and the councilors appeared to accept her authority.  The older
man nodded, and sat.<p>Jhane dismissed the meeting, and the councilors exited
the room rapidly.  Jhane and I, followed by Stacy and the squad of twelve
guards, walked rapidly to the rooftop, where a patrol flier was waiting.  She
had apparently been planning such a move all along.  As we boarded, I turned to
her.<p>"Jhane, this is madness.  Let me enter the fortress on my own.  Stacy
and I have years of experience in such raids, and I doubt you have had much
experience of personal combat as a Queen."<p>"None at all," Jhane replied, with
a rueful grin, "I discovered early on that I could not bring myself to kill,
even in self-defense. I can order my troops to their deaths, or the execution of
a criminal, but I cannot kill with my own hands.  I suppose that's hypocritical
of me, but that's the way I'm put together.  However, I won't let you do this
alone."<p>"It's not hypocritical; the duties of a ruler and the actions of an
individual are not the same. I sometimes regret how this world has changed me,
but it is foolish to regret a fact.  As long as I am part of a world filled with
violence, I will fight back with every ability I have, rather than allow the
brutal to win simply because they do not have such qualms. I might wish it
otherwise, but the truth is that I am glad that I am able to do so."<p>I
paused; this was a subject I had never discussed, not even with Thom.  But I had
always been able to open my heart to Jhane, and to realize that I still trusted
her this much after all these years apart robbed me of my voice.  Jhane seemed
to realize this, and changed the subject.<p>"So, amiga, how are we going to
infiltrate this fortress once we get there?  You're the hero, so I'm hoping you
have a plan, because I'm fresh out of ideas."<p>I smiled, and began to outline
my thoughts.<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>After circling widely, the patrol flier set down on the far side of the
fortress, far enough away that we were unlikely to have been detected.  Jhane,
Stacy, and I set out on foot, much to the dismay of the padwar (lieutenant) of
Jhanes guards, who remonstrated with her at length over the foolish risk she
planned.  I do not know why I had believed that the green Martians were devoid
of the softer emotions; it was clear that her guards loved Jhane, and would
march to their deaths for her for that reason, more than for duty or honor.  But
his words fell on deaf ears, and eventually he accepted her decision, and
remained with his men by the flier, awaiting the arrival of the
army.<p>Approaching the building, which was a walled structure with several
inner towers of modest height, we waited for Thuria to set, plunging the land
into darkness.  While we waited I observed the rounds of the guards, and
discovered that there were only two, who walked a circuit atop the wall.  There
could have been others inside the grounds, but that was unlikely; the fact that
only two were atop the wall suggested that there were few guards available, and
to waste them on the ground, when they would have been more effective atop the
wall or a tower, made little sense.<p>Once the moon set, I dashed to the wall,
and using my superior terrestrial muscles leaped to the top in a single bound,
out of sight of either guard.  Quickly I dropped to the ground inside, and
waited for them to complete their next circuit.  While I waited, I examined the
area between the towers, finding a few abandoned outbuildings, but no guards. 
When it was time, I opened a lesser gate in the wall, and signaled Jhane and
Stacy to join me.<p>The three of us made our way to the largest tower, and
trying a back door, found it unlocked and unguarded.  They must have felt
confident indeed that their ruse had gone undiscovered, or they would have been
more cautious.  We made our way to the center of the tower, where stairs led
both up and down into the pits below the tower.  I signaled that we were to
descend, but Jhane demurred.<p>"Why down?  Wouldn't a prisoner of this
importance be held close to the apartments of Tal Karas, which are surely at the
highest level of the tower?"<p>I have been in many of these old buildings, and
while each is different, they often have features in common.  Thus, I had
reason, based on experience, for my decision.<p>"If he is indeed using Thom for
his experiments, he will most likely be found in the pits below the tower; that
is where there will likely be large storerooms that could have been converted to
laboratories, and cells for holding prisoners securely."<p>Jhane nodded, and we
began our descent.  The stairwell, and many of the rooms adjoining it, were
illuminated by bright, white light, given off by oil-lamps of a kind usually
only encountered in the cities of the red Martians, due to the difficulty in
obtaining the oil used in them.  Their presence here suggested that Tal Karas
did, indeed, have friends outside providing him with supplies, and also
suggested that this stairwell was frequently used, as such lights would not be
wasted on a mere storeroom.<p>After descending several stories, the stairs
ended outside the doorway to a large, and well-lighted room.  Signaling Jhane
and Stacy to silence, I crept to the doorway and peered into the room.  My
breath caught in my throat as I spied my beloved, strapped to a table at the far
end of the room.<p>The table was enclosed in a large wire mesh cage.  Inside
the cage a green Martian, presumably the scientist, was working on a machine of
unknown purpose, which was connected both to the cage and to the table holding
Thom, with many wires.  Oddly, there were no others in the room, and as Tal
Karas had already chosen to act without honor, I was under no constraint to do
so myself.  I drew my pistol, and took careful aim at his back.<p>Alas, the
cage must have produced some field of force that shielded those inside, as the
bullet that should have ended his life, instead ricocheted from the cage with a
loud noise.  The scientist turned in surprise, and quickly drew his sword,
leveling it at Thom's throat.<p>"As you can see, I am beyond the reach of your
weapon.  Throw it down, and come here unarmed, or I will kill this
prisoner."<p>Waving Jhane and Stacy to remain out of sight, I threw out my
pistol and sword, and walked into the room.  As I approached the cage, I noticed
a door in the side; I also noted that Thom was awake, but gagged so that he
could not speak.  He saw me approach, and his eyes were wild, as he strained
against his bonds, apparently overcome by emotion.  I, too, was wracked by
emotion, as love for my beloved and hatred for the one who held him prisoner
warred for dominance.<p>Tal Karas threw several switches, and a high-pitched
hum that I had not even been aware of ceased.  He motioned me to enter the door,
and I did so, eager to come within reach of this monster.  As I entered, he
gestured me to the far side of the room, keeping the table holding my beloved
between us, and with a glance at the sword he held to Thom's throat, I
complied.<p>"From your outlandish costume, you must be another terrestrial.  Do
I have the honor of addressing Dar-Eya of Lawndale?" He said, in a voice that
suggested he already knew the answer.<p>"No, I'm the Avon lady.  Working in
this cold dungeon must be hard on your skin, would you be interested in some
moisturizer?"<p>"Bah, do not seek to deceive me, my spies reported that you
were in Escher, and I knew it was only a matter of time until you found me. 
Unlike that weakling Queen, you are not one to hide from a fight."<p>"In that
case, since you know my reputation, let my husband go, and we can save a great
deal of needless bloodshed."  As I spoke, I move to my right, closer to Thom,
causing the scientist to turn to face me, and placing his back to the entrance
of the room once again.<p>"I cannot do that," he replied, "I need him for my
machine."<p>"What, this," I said, motioning to the machine beside the platform,
and hoping to distract him, "what does it do?"<p>"It is an amplifier.  As you
may know, the body has a natural electrical field.  My researches have
discovered that, as I suspected, there is a correspondence between the field of
a body and that of the world from which it comes.  By artificially amplifying
this man's field, and feeding it into the cage that surrounds us, I can
transport myself and my equipment to your world.  Then using my own body's
field, I can return with additional slaves and raw materials from your
resource-rich planet."<p>My heart leaped as the implication sank home: here was
a way for us to return to Earth. But first, I needed to deal with this
madman.<p>"In that case, we do not need to be enemies.  Let Thom and I return
to Earth, and we will help you gladly."  I did not, of course, mean this, as
even the idiots of Lawndale deserved better than to be slaves to a madman on a
foreign world, but it was a way to gain time, as I had observed Jhane and Stacy
making a stealthy approach across the room.  Jhane had collected my weapons as
she came, and while she would not use them herself, if she could get them to me,
I would make quick work of our enemy.<p>"I do not need your willing
assistance," Tal Karas said with a sneer, "you will do as I say, or I will kill
this man.  The field will persist long enough after death to suit my needs, if
necessary, although I would prefer not to be constrained, so I will let him live
if you do not force me."<p>As he spoke, a gray blur launched itself through the
still open door, and across the table.  In reflex he lifted the sword to defend
himself, and I took advantage of his distraction and leaped to the attack.
Before I could even join the fray, Stacy sunk his teeth into Tal Karas'
shoulder, and near-severed his upper arm.  Tal Karas stabbed Stacy with the
sword, but a calot is a tough beast, and more than a simple sword wound is
required to kill one, unless the sword is wielded with more precision than he
displayed.<p>While Stacy and Tal Karas grappled, I landed on his other
shoulder, and pounded his head with my fists, to little effect.  Behind me,
Jhane entered the cage, and discarding the weapons, moved to free Thom.<p>The
scientist tried to redirect the sword at me, but was unable to free it from
Stacy's body.  Blood poured from the torn shoulder to which Stacy still clung. 
He seemed disoriented, although whether from blood loss or my continued pounding
on his skull, I could not say.  He reeled, and staggered back against the
mysterious machine, damaging it severely.  Sparks flew, his body thrashed, and I
was thrown across the cage. Landing, I could feel the electrical hum return. 
Jhane yelled, as she was flung off Thom by a shock from the wires still
connected to the table.  <p>The hum became a scream, drilling into my brain,
and the last thing I saw was the room outside the cage seeming to fall away, and
then darkness claimed me.<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>Typing finished; Daria breathed a sigh of relief, realizing that it was
nearly evening.  She was thankful that it was Saturday.  She'd heard the family
downstairs hours ago, but they must have thought she'd left early, as her
writing had been uninterrupted.  As she spell checked her file, the phone rang. 
Another call from Eric, or one of Quinn's legion of fans, she thought, and
ignored it.<p>"Daria," Helen called, distantly, "are you home?  It's
Jane."<p>She picked up the phone.  "I've got it, Mom," she replied, and waited
for the click.<p>"I didn't wake you, did I?" asked Jane, after Helen hung up
the extension.<p>Daria chuckled. "No, I've been writing, but what are you doing
up before sunset?"<p>"It's after sunset, haven't you looked outside recently?
I've been painting since before dawn," said Jane.  "You'll never believe the
weird dream I had, all about Mars.  It must have been that huge dinner we had
last night at Good Time Chinese."<p>"Me too.  I think I need to see those
paintings, Jane.  I'll bring my story, see you in a half-hour."  Daria hung up
the phone, and sat thinking.  They'd discussed the history of fantasy fiction
over dinner last night, and the role Burroughs and other pulp authors had played
in forming the genre.  That must have been the cause of her dream.  Still, it
was weird that Jane had dreamed about Mars also.<p>Rising, she walked to her
bed and looked out the window, deep in thought.  Over the roof of the neighbors'
house, the red glint of Mars could be seen in the twilight.  It must have been
just a dream, she thought to herself. Mustn't it?<p>Motion on the bed attracted
her eye, and she looked down to see a puppy lying there, apparently a St.
Bernard, although the gray coloring marked it as a mongrel, gazing at her with
affection.<p>"Stacy?"<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">THE END<p></div>
<div>
			<hr>
			<p>Authors Notes:<p>As noted in the beginning, this story was
intentionally written in the rather wordy, first-person narrative style used by
Edgar Rice Burroughs in the books of his Martian Series.  Perhaps it is this
form of writing that makes these stories less widely known than his more famous
<i>Tarzan of the Apes</i>, which was written in a less wordy third-person style
more acceptable to a modern reader.  <i>A Princess of Mars</i> was the first of
91 books written by ERB, but Tarzan was written in the same year (1912).<p>If you made it this far, congratulations. I'm not entirely sure why I wrote something so completely off the beaten track. In part it was because I wanted to write something with a simple, straightforward, plot, and partly it is simply a homage to one of the pioneers of the modern Heroic Fantasy field. Hopefully, at least a few people will enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.<p>I wrote this story for the above reasons, but also as an exploration of Daria's character. In the TV series, she has often shown a tendency to verbal humor of a violent nature. I don't believe for a moment that this means she is a violent person, merely that such statements are one way she deals with her feelings of powerlessness. One of the interesting opportunities here was placing her in a world where she isn't powerless, as her terrestrial origin (per Burroughs) makes her physically superior to even the greatest fighters of Barsoom. Seeing how she would adapt to having power, in a world where might defines right, was the structure on which the story was built. Daria also has a tendency to think in terms of absolutes (there is right, and wrong, in her world view, but she's not very good at accepting compromises between the two extremes). Since such compromise is the normal way of the world, this is one of the things that makes her a disillusioned idealist (the definition of cynic), and I used it in her tendency to accept the absolutes (e.g., green Martians are unfeeling brutes) voiced by the people around her. Of course, she's intelligent enough to realize when the facts contradict her preconceptions. There is no moral to this story, it's simply an exploration of how she'd behave with a fundamental aspect of her world reversed, done in the form of an adventure story. I didn't plan how she'd behave in advance, I just wrote it as I went, and rewrote the parts that seemed out of character later.<p>If you've ever read any of the Martian Series by Edgar Rice
Burroughs, which chronicle the adventures of Captain John Carter of Virginia and
others on the red planet, you'll recognize many of the plot elements here.  I
didn't parallel any specific tale, but even ERB recycled the same events and
situations in multiple stories.  The seventh Mars book, <i>A Fighting Man of
Mars</i>, was probably the largest single inspiration, but it's hardly the same story. The pursuit by the hero of a kidnapped heroine was one of ERBs staple plot devices, and he stole it from the ancient Greeks. I merely swapped the genders. Place names (with the exception of Escher), animals, the various peoples and cultures of Mars, and the technology, are all exactly as described in his books, except for the civilized green Martians, which can be seen as an outgrowth of Tars Tarkas' effect on the Tharks a century and a half before this story, if you want a justification. Tal Karas' machine is my own invention, but is in keeping with the &quot;science&quot; described in the books.<p>Nietzsche would have
loved this world - Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche was a nineteenth century German
philosopher, perhaps best known, at least by heroic fantasy fans, for the quote
"that which does not kill us makes us stronger", which director John Milius used
to introduce the first Conan movie.  A more appropriate one here might be:
"Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become
a monster." (<i>Beyond Good and Evil</i>, 1886).  Daria was referring to the
Milius quote.  And no, I don't make a habit of reading philosophy, but
Bartlett's Familiar Quotations is a reference no writer should be without (it's
also fun to read).<p>Daria's lack of aging - John Carter never ages throughout
the years he spends on Mars, but there is mention that he'd never aged on Earth,
either, so it wasn't his presence there that did it.  Since we know Daria does
age normally on Earth, I had to either ignore this bit, or alter it slightly.  I
chose to alter it, to keep her character as close to Carter's as possible.  It
also gave me a way to duck the problem of a hero who can't see anything without
the glasses she left at home.<p>Thom, Jhane, and Dar-Eya - These are the
Barsoomian pronunciations of their usual names (don't ask me how to pronounce
them, I don't speak Barsoomian).  Jane, less immersed in the culture than Daria,
tends to use the English pronunciations unless she's being careful.  I did this
mainly to drive home the point that we weren't in Kansas anymore, Toto.<p>Good
Time Chinese - This is the restaurant that, according to the episode <i>Depth
Takes a Holiday</i>, exists on multiple planes of reality, interconnected by
wormholes.  If you prefer to think of that episode as a dream, well I certainly
left you the same out here.  If you consider the episode an aberration of an
otherwise sensible writing team, well what are you doing reading this
story?<p>Clothing, or not - Burroughs repeatedly states that Martians run
around naked except for the leather harnesses on which they hang their
equipment.  This always struck me as silly behavior for people constantly
cutting at each other with bladed weapons, and especially as he went to pains to
note that the nights are often cold, but it's his world and I have to live with
it as he defined it.  Daria's choice of a "leather bikini" in a land of
g-strings parallels her choice of a jacket in a land of t-shirts.<p>Boots -
actually, the Barsoom novels don't seem to mention footwear at all, which
probably means ERB meant everyone to run about barefoot.  This is no sillier
than the lack of clothing, but I just couldn't accept it for some reason, so I
assumed that at least soldiers wore boots, and it was just too obvious to
mention.<p>Was it a dream?  I'll leave that to each of you to decide for
yourself.  Am I going to write a sequel?  Probably not.  Ending the story in
such a way that a sequel is possible is typical pulp writing, but I can't really
see much benefit in additional Darian stories of the red planet.  Of course, if
I do think of a reason for writing one, that would be another matter.<p><b>THE
END</b><p></div>
