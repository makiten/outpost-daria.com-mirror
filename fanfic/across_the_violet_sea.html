<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The morning sun
was shining on a cloudless day in May as a river of purple flowed
down Waverly Place.  New York University&rsquo;s Class of 2003 was
graduating and Daria Morgendorffer was among them.  Wearing the
traditional robe and mortarboard in school-standard violet, she
walked the graduation route&mdash;starting on Washington Place,
making a right onto University Place, and then left onto Waverly
before finally passing under Washington Square Arch and taking a seat
in the temporary grandstand erected for every graduation.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The walk was
never especially organized, as groups of friends clumped together,
waving to each other and to the underclassmen who worked as ushers
for the ceremony, often just to see their friends one last time. 
Daria was no different, laughing and joking with a small circle of
close friends.  Topics ranged from party plans to old stories to the
humor inherent in the purple robes of the only university in the
country silly enough to call its sports teams the Violets.  Even
Daria, who still evinced no interest in athletics of any kind, found
the idea of playing for the Violets to be howlingly funny.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>College had been a
revelation for Daria.  She&rsquo;d finally reached a place where her
intellect didn&rsquo;t automatically label her an outcast, and her
role of &ldquo;Misery Chick&rdquo; was filled by whole clubs of
people with worldviews that made her look like Brittany by
comparison.  Bonding with her dormmates had been surprisingly easy,
and for the first time in her life, Daria felt comfortable.  And now
she was leaving.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Daria and her
friends turned under the Arch and that melancholy thought grew into a
deep well of sadness.  Looking due south, she saw a few puffy cumulus
clouds in an otherwise blue sky.  She did not, however, see what
she&rsquo;d seen every day of her first two years in Manhattan.  The
Twin Towers were gone, lost in the horror of September 11, 2001.  As
she contemplated the empty sky, her mind rolled back almost
involuntarily to that fateful day early in her junior year.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>She&rsquo;d
actually seen the first plane hit.  En route to Bobst Library for
some early research before her 9:55 class, she was crossing the park
when she heard the too-loud whine of a low jet.  Looking up, she saw
the first plane slam into Two World Trade, felt the ground shake, and
heard the terrifying explosion as fire bloomed from the wounded
building.  Flipping open her cellphone, she&rsquo;d called Quinn,
then a sophomore at the Fashion Institute of Technology on Seventh
Avenue, and told her to turn on the news.  Unsure of what to do after
that, she&rsquo;d begun to meander back to her dormitory, Third
Avenue North, when the second plane hit One World Trade in eerie
mirror of the first.  Shaking with horror, she&rsquo;d tried Quinn
again, but this time all she got was static.  Growing more frantic by
the minute, Daria gave up on technology and ran the mile or so to
Quinn&rsquo;s apartment on Twenty-Sixth Street.  The Morgendorffer
sisters watched the world come unraveled together, unable to reach
Helen and Jake, often crying in each other&rsquo;s arms as some new
nightmare detail was revealed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Coming back to
herself, she noted the silence around her.  Likely all of her fellow
graduates were reliving that same horrible day.  Once again she felt
grateful that she&rsquo;d had her support group, both Quinn and her
friends, and later Jane, who&rsquo;d moved to Manhattan the following
spring.  She could still remember the terror of the freshmen, newly
come to the big, tough city, now forced to deal with reality gone
haywire, where madmen flew planes into buildings and killed
thousands.  Many had left, even among the upperclassmen.  She had
stayed.  So had Quinn.  Between them the Morgendorffer sisters had
convinced their terrified parents that leaving Manhattan was not an
option.  Such a retreat would merely be letting the terrorists win,
and that they&rsquo;d refused to do.  So they&rsquo;d persevered,
through the campaign in Afghanistan and the military actions that
continued even now, the madness in the Middle East, and Attorney
General Ashcroft&rsquo;s war on civil liberties, which had only
recently begun to show signs of reversing.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Quinn was here
today, of course, having met up with Helen and Jake, who had come up
from Lawndale, and Jane, who&rsquo;d taken the day off from the
gallery.  As she took her seat, Daria tried in vain to catch a
glimpse of them in the huge crowd.  With the families of over six
thousand graduates in attendance, it was impossible to pick anyone
out.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The ceremony
itself was unimpressive.  Various and sundry speakers were trotted
out to give essentially the same meaningless pep talk before the
designated students from each school accepted their diplomas on
behalf of their fellows.  With so many students graduating at once,
it was impossible to distribute diplomas individually, and the
College of Arts and Sciences always had its valedictorian accept,
unlike the Tisch School of the Arts, which was invariably represented
by whichever famous graduate would elicit the biggest roar.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Daria had actually
been in the running for valedictorian through sophomore year, but had
broken the cardinal rule&mdash;never take a class with a professor
who is a genius&mdash;twice as a junior.  The result was her only two
B&rsquo;s, and someone else on the podium when the time came.  Not
that she minded.  She still had her summa cum laude key, and not
having to participate in the ceremony left her time to be alone with
her thoughts.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Images of Lawndale
and even Highland came unbidden to her mind.  At the time she&rsquo;d
been grateful to get out of Highland just to get away from Beavis and
Butthead, but Lawndale had turned out to be far more than just a
source of uranium-free drinking water.  She&rsquo;d met her first
real friend there, and learned about desire and then romance.  She
still thought fondly of Tom, though they hadn&rsquo;t dated for
years.  They&rsquo;d tried as freshman&mdash;he was at Princeton,
only a train ride away&mdash;but it hadn&rsquo;t worked.  They were
going in different directions.  Daria had fallen in love with the
City, while Tom had finally realized that what he wanted was to fill
the role he&rsquo;d been born to as his father&rsquo;s heir back in
Lawndale.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>As for Trent,
though The Crush was long past, he was still a firm friend, and they
were in contact often.  The Spiral were getting bigger and bigger
with gigs up and down the East Coast and major labels sniffing around
after two indie discs had sold respectably.  Daria still vividly
remembered her shock at heading down to CBGBs for the <I>Washington
Square News </I>to review an unknown group that had just hit the New
York scene and finding it to be none other than Mystik Spiral.  Even
more shocking was how much better they&rsquo;d gotten over the years.
 Their sound was now exciting, and Daria had given them a glowing
review.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Lawndale was also
where Daria had realized that there was an alternative to eternal
sibling war.  The respect that had grown up between her and Quinn was
grudging at first, but by the time she had left for college in the
fall of &rsquo;99, the Morgendorffer sisters had each come to realize
how much they valued the other.  Daria had missed Quinn terribly
during her freshman year, almost as much as she had Jane, and finding
out that Quinn would be attending FIT had been a joyous shock.  While
they still moved mostly in separate social circles, Daria and Quinn
had made sure to make time for each other, trading trips to museums
and fashion shows.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>If she was happy
that Quinn could share this day with her, she was ecstatic that her
partner-in-crime could be here, too.  Taking business courses at
Lawndale CC had been a big help to Jane, so that when she&rsquo;d
finally sold a couple of pieces, she was offered a job at the gallery
that had bought them.  Now she was here, painting away to her heart&rsquo;s
content in a loft in the East Village while working uptown to pay the
bills.  Well, some of the bills.  Manhattan was still insanely
expensive, but Jane had assured Daria that she&rsquo;d be able to
survive and thrive or, if the debts got too big, run off to South
America and spend a few years with Penny.  Daria hadn&rsquo;t asked
too many questions, being grateful to have her best friend back with
her.  Her college friends had taken to Jane as well, which was a
great relief.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The last droning
speech finally ended.  This one was Senator Clinton&rsquo;s speech. 
No matter what names were bandied around beforehand, the honor of
giving the commencement speech always seemed to go to whichever local
officeholder needed a platform to prop up their ambitions.  The
Senator had stopped short of declaring her intention to run for
President, but only just.  Daria turned her mind away from thoughts
of a Clinton campaign as, for the second year in row, the playing of
the school alma mater was replaced by Bruce Springsteen&rsquo;s folk
dirge for the victims of September 11, &ldquo;City in Ruins.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Once again her
mind drifted back to the Towers and all that had been lost: lives,
jobs, symbols, innocence, security.  She thought of the City, still
fighting back from the aftermath of the attacks, and of the long road
she&rsquo;d come to reach this point.  She thought of her parents,
how much she loved them and how long it had taken her to understand
that.  As Springsteen&rsquo;s mournful guitar was replaced by the
more cheerful strains of &ldquo;Pomp and Circumstance,&rdquo; she
looked out across the violet sea and smiled her Mona Lisa smile.  The
city was still here and so was she.  Things weren&rsquo;t so bad. 
With a whoop that surprised even her, Daria flung her mortarboard
high, proud to be a member of the Class of 2003.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2><strong>Author's Note:</strong><br>
I actually started this fic over five years ago.  First it was going to be set on September 11th itself, but after awhile I decided that a more distant persepective would help the story.  I opted to have Daria be a sophomore in 1996-97 to align with the start of the show, hence Class of 2003.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Also, as you can no doubt guess, I went to NYU.  I was there in the early '90s, and after September 11th, I couldn't help but wonder how the students were reacting and think about how I would have reacted.  I don't think IICY had aired yet (or it had just aired), and I thought that NYU was a school Daria might have been interested in, and that she'd be a good medium for examining some of my own feelings about that day.  And here we all are five years later.  Hope you enjoy.</FONT></FONT></P>
