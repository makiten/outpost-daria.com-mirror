<P>It is a Saturday morning in May, and Lawndale High School is having
an art fair. Jane and several other of the students have art booths, these
students include the fashion club and Upchuck. Daria comes to the fair
to check out her friend's booth. Here we are at our first stop, Jane's
booth.</P>

<P>Daria: What has the demented genius created now?</P>

<P>Jane: I thought I do some art on the spot, so I'm making caricatures.
</P>

<P>Daria: As if people weren't imperfect enough as it is.</P>

<P>Jane: These caricatures are different, the background of my caricatures
are either going to reflect on the subject's deepest wish or their personality.
Of course I will be sure to choose whichever is worse.</P>

<P>Kevin and Brittany stop by Jane's booth.</P>

<P>Daria: Kevin, how about a caricature of you and Brittany together so
you can always remember the way you both were years from now, they even
come with a descriptive background.</P>

<P>Brittany: But isn't that why we have cameras.</P>

<P>Jane: This is more revealing than a photo a caricature is a picture
that makes a statement, by exaggerating certain facial features.</P>

<P>Kevin: A statement of what? </P>

<P>Daria: Forget the caricatures, I think in your case a recording of the
things you say would be sufficient.</P>

<P>Kevin: Ok, but I left my tape recorder at home.</P>

<P>Jane and Daria look at each other with the same thought &quot;they get
dumber and dumber with each passing moment.&quot; Then suddenly Brittany
notices the Fashion Club's Teddy Bear Booth.</P>

<P>Brittany: Look! Kevy teddies.</P>

<P>Brittany and Kevin leave to go to the teddy bear booth. Then Jane has
an idea.</P>

<P>Jane: Maybe we should tie a bow on Kevin and put him on display.</P>

<P>Daria: I don't think that's a good idea, because Quinn will buy him.</P>

<P>Jane; Not if Brittany kills her first.</P>

<P>Daria: Got any bows?</P>

<P>We now go to the Teddy Bear Booth run by the fashion club, Sandi, Tiffany
and Stacey are all ready there yet, Quinn is still at home trying to figure
out which outfit goes best with the booth.</P>

<P>Stacey: I think the black and white bear with the red bow is really
cute next to the completely black bear with the pink bow. Is that all right
Sandi?</P>

<P>Sandi: I guess so, I would have preferred it if we had a makeup booth
instead of teddy bears.</P>

<P>Tiffany: You're so right Sandi, I think we should have had this art
fair in the mall instead of in front of the school. .</P>

<P>Sandi: I know what you mean its over eighty degrees and sweating is
so unfashionable, and we might have had it at the mall if it wasn't for
that girl that lives with Quinn.</P>

<P>Brittany: Hi Sandi, hi Stacey, hi Tiffany where's Quinn.</P>

<P>Sandi: Hi Brittany, Quinn is still at home trying to find an outfit
to go with the booth.</P>

<P>Tiffany: See our last shopping trip was over two days ago.</P>

<P>Brittany then sees a teddy with a cute football jersey in the school
colors of Lawndale High.</P>

<P>Brittany: Look how cute a teddy with a football jersey, I can put it
next to your picture Kevy.</P>

<P>Kevin: Awe Babe.</P>

<P>Quinn comes with Joey, Jeffy and Jamie, each one of them is holding
a different outfit because Quinn couldn't decide what to wear.</P>

<P>Sandi: I can't believe it took you all morning to choose that outfit,
it looks so last month.</P>

<P>Quinn: I got this outfit at the beginning of this month.</P>

<P>Sandi: It's already the tenth.</P>

<P>Quinn: I passed by the store and it's not on sale yet.</P>

<P>Sandi: So Quinn you don't think I know which fashion is current, and
perhaps I should be impeached and you should be president of the fashion
club.</P>

<P>Quinn: Why Sandi you are the best fashion club president and I am not
in doubt even for a second that you know what's current. It just that I
want something to go with the booth and that truly represents the fashion
club. So which outfit should I choose to go with the booth.</P>

<P>Joey: Choose this outfit it goes so well with your hair.</P>

<P>Jeffy: Choose this outfit it brings out the color in your eyes</P>

<P>Jamie: Choose this outfit it goes great with my car.</P>

<P>Joey: Quinn you look better in my car.</P>

<P>Jeffy: My car goes well with your hair and brings out the color in your
eyes.</P>

<P>Jamie: I thought of it first.</P>

<P>Quinn: Why are we talking about cars for, when I'm trying to choose
the right outfit. and you know what, I look good with everything, so will
one of you take those outfits home for me before they get stained. or something</P>

<P>Meanwhile Back at Jane's Booth, Jane and Daria talk about a couple of
Jane's masterpieces.</P>

<P>Jane: I don't think Mr. DeMartino liked his caricature very much.</P>

<P>Daria: I guess he didn't find putting dinosaurs in the background with
expressions of fear very flattering.</P>

<P>Jane: Ms. Barch really loved her picture though.</P>

<P>Daria: You made her a prison guard with an all male chain-gang in the
background and they are all picking up dead cats from the highway.</P>

<P>Jane: She thought the whip was a nice touch.</P>

<P>Daria: I'd like it if you drew of a caricature of me as an empress on
a slave ship and you can put Quinn and the rest of the fashion club as
rowers. </P>

<P>Jane: Daria, I'm really thirsty and I can't leave the booth, maybe you
can get us both a soda.</P>

<P>Daria: Sure thing, if you do a caricature of Quinn while I'm gone, make
sure she's having a bad hair day, that she is wearing last season's fashion,
and put a bunch of ugly guys in the background, or better yet just put
Upchuck and make a copy for me.</P>

<P>Jane: I won't need to make a second copy, because when Quinn sees the
drawing, she'll tell me I drew you by mistake.</P>

<P>Daria: Be careful funny girl I am bringing you something to drink. </P>

<P>On the way to the drink stand Daria passes by Upchuck's Female Worlds
of Wonder Photo Booth.</P>

<P>Upchuck: Won't you all come and check out some of my photos of beautiful
girls in bikinis.</P>

<P>Daria: If all these photos are suppose to be of female bodies, why do
I only see hands moving and a foot kicking sand?.</P>

<P>Upchuck: When I went to the beach to photograph girls in bikinis, I
was trying to get a close up of this lady 's gorgeous legs and she kicked
sand in my face, she was so feisty.</P>

<P>Daria: Let me guess, the hand moving in this photo must belong to one
of those feisty ladies trying to slap you.</P>

<P>Upchuck: Yes, she tried to slap me, when I tried to get a close up of
her red two piece, rowrrrr.</P>

<P>Daria: See you, I think I've seen enough of Chucky's Angels.</P>

<P>Upchuck: Daria for your information it is <I>Charlie's Angels</I> one
of the greatest TV shows of all time. I taped all the reruns.</P>

<P>Daria: A definite classic from the peroxide era of television, not like
today's shows in which female detectives actually hold a gun correctly
and can even perform autopsies.</P>

<P>Upchuck: How about having you perform a little autopsy on me. </P>

<P>Daria: First of all you're not dead, besides isn't the motto of the
show &quot;Trust No One&quot;. I'm out of here. </P>

<P>Daria stops by the drink booth run by Mr. O'neill. </P>

<P>Daria: Hi Mr. O'neill. Give me two cokes please.</P>

<P>Mr. O'neill: Hello Daria, how come you don't have an arts and craft
booth of your own?</P>

<P>Daria: It's just that all my art work is in Museums throughout the world
under the alias of &quot;Salvador Dali&quot;. Most of it is in St.Petersburg,
Florida.</P>

<P>Mr. O'neill: Daria, I think you are very gifted and it would be great
if you decided to express yourself through art, you should release the
artist within.</P>

<P>Daria: I guess I prefer writing a form of self expression, besides the
artist within is in Rome looking for another ceiling to paint. </P>

<P>It's Three hours later and everyone is packing up, Kevin, Brittany,
Mack, Jodie, Daria and Jane are standing next to each other in front of
the school.</P>

<P>Kevin: I'm going to be at this all night party with all the really cool
people. What do you plan to do later this evening Daria? </P>

<P>Daria: I was planning on going to the cemetery and raising the dead.</P>

<P>Kevin: That sounds cool, if the party gets kind of boring can I come
by and check out all the stiffs, not that I believe in any of that voodoo
mumbo jumbo.</P>

<P>Daria: I may need someone to change the expiration dates on the tomb
stones if I'm successful.</P>

<P>Jane: I can just imagine the expression on their family's faces when
they come to bring flowers.</P>

<P>Daria: They will want to sue the cemetery for bringing back their unwanted
relatives.</P>

<P>Jane: Seriously Daria what do you plan to do tonight?</P>

<P>Daria: Looking for UFO's.</P>

<P>Kevin: Daria do you believe in aliens?</P>

<P>Daria: Of course I do, I'm still waiting for them to stop by my house
and abduct Quinn. </P>

<P>Jane and Daria walk away from Kevin and the rest of the group and discuss
their evening plans.</P>

<P>Jane: I'm asking because tonight Trent is giving a concert over at the
Leathersnake Club in downtown. He's planning on singing three new songs
that he and Mystik Spiral wrote. </P>

<P>Daria: You know how nervous I get when I'm around Trent, I don't want
that rash to reappear I think I'm better of with the aliens tonight.</P>

<P>Jane: Common Daria, this will be an all night gig, meaning we will be
out after midnight like all the so called cool people, the same ones who
think that only they are entitled to the really cool parties.</P>

<P>Daria: I know what you're trying to do, but I'm not really interested
in being like Kevin or any of the so called popular people, I find counting
the cracks on my ceiling more entertaining then being at one of their cool
parties, besides I doubt my parents will let me go. </P>

<P>Jane: Of course your parent's won't let you go, but that doesn't stop
Quinn, besides it would mean a lot to Trent.</P>

<P>Daria: You act as if I really matter to Trent. Lets face it we are from
two different worlds.</P>

<P>Jane: You don't mean regular and popular, do you, because Trent is above
all that.</P>

<P>Daria: I could say awake and asleep, but what I mean is that he's out
of high school and he's already pursuing his dreams. I on the other hand
have to deal with my parents, my sister Quinn, and all the other morons
that are part of my life, when I'm around Trent I don't feel like I'm in
control and that bother's me.</P>

<P>Jane: So you'll risk not being as sarcastic as usual. Come on you'll
be totally stunned by the club's ambiance of really loud music and a really
smelly restroom often used by both genders because they're too wasted to
read the sign on the door. At least you had some fun, or does that go against
the Daria Morgendorffer philosophy of life.</P>

<P>Daria: Ok you talked me into it, I guess loud music and a smelly restroom
does beat counting the cracks on the ceiling. Meet me at my window at ten
tonight.</P>

<P>In the tank (black van they use to go to gigs) Trent is driving with
Jesse on the passenger side and Jane and Daria are sitting in the back.</P>

<P>Jane: Common Daria loosen up this is going to be fun, and if it isn't
maybe we can go to the cemetery later and try raising the dead, that's
if Trent's band doesn't revive them first.</P>

<P>Trent: Thanks Janey, I'm glad you can feel the power in my music. Tonight
Mystik Spiral is going to blow them away. What's that about raising the
dead? Is Daria experimenting with voodoo or something like that?</P>

<P>Daria: (Who is really embarrassed) Yes Trent, I figured I'd practice
on the dead first before using it on Quinn. I was just teasing Kevin earlier
today. Besides why would I want to raise the dead, there are plenty of
morons taking up space in this world as it is.</P>

<P>Trent: Good one Daria. Did Janey tell you that Mystik Spiral will be
playing three new songs that Jesse and I wrote?</P>

<P>Daria: Yes she did, would you tell me the name of one of those songs?</P>

<P>Trent: Well there's this one song I wrote about my high school days
it's called &quot;Bummer Culture&quot;.</P>

<P>Daria: I can relate to that, in fact I'm sure anyone who isn't Kevin,
Britanny or actually has an IQ over 50 can relate.</P>

<P>Trent: Thanks that's what makes a song great, people relating to it.
I guess it also helps to have really good publicist. Relating that's what's
important. </P>

<P>Jane: Here we are, the Leathersnake Club.</P>

<P>Meanwhile at the Morgendorffer house Helen and Jake are on the coach.
Jake is reading the newspaper and Helen is going over some reports for
work.</P>

<P>Helen: It not even Monday morning yet and I already have three cases
that must be in court by Wednesday, it's like a never-ending hectic pace,
just the way I like it.</P>

<P>The phone rings and Jake answers it.</P>

<P>Jake: Hello Jake Morgendorffer here. You want to talk to Quinn, ok I'll
get her. Quinn it's Corey come and get the phone. (to Helen) That's strange,
Quinn always comes running when I call her to the phone.</P>

<P>Helen: Let me take the cordless phone upstairs to see what is the matter
with Quinn.</P>

<P>When Helen enters Quinn room she notice something in the bed, she thinks
it Quinn, but even though she goes over to make sure Quinn is all right.
When she lifts the cover she discovers it's not Quinn and that Quinn must
have sneaked out of the house. So she goes to Daria's room to see if Daria
knows anything about Quinn disappearance. Daria hides her absence better
than Quinn by putting a recording of someone breathing, and putting a life
like doll in her bed. Helen calls but no answer so she becomes suspicious
and checks Daria's bed and finds that Daria is missing as well. Boy are
they going to get it.</P>

<P>Helen: Jake guess what, both of the girls are not home and it's already
11:30PM. We wouldn't have noticed if it wasn't for one of Quinn's ruder
boyfriends who calls houses at this hour, thank God for teenage rudeness.</P>

<P>Jake: Maybe they forgot the time Helen.</P>

<P>Helen: If that is so, why did they go through all the trouble of hiding
their absence by making it look like they're in their rooms? Daria even
went as far as adding sound to her cover up.</P>

<P>Jake: You know Daria has always been an overachiever.</P>

<P>Helen: Overachiever or not they both have a lot of explaining to do
when they get home. I also plan to ground them for at least a month. Just
wait till they get home.</P>

<P>Jane and Daria are standing with the rest of the audience at the Leathersnake
Club, Trent, Jesse and the rest of the band are playing &quot;Bummer Culture&quot;</P>

<P>Trent: &quot;Nobody cares, they're nothing but vultures, There's just
deceit everywhere in my Bummer Culture, All the songs make me blue, can't
find any to sing, Yes it is true, I just broke a guitar string&quot;</P>

<P>Jane: (Thinking) Trent must have read that issue of &quot;Val Magazine&quot;
that Jodie gave me with the article on Daria and the teen bummer culture.
</P>

<P>Daria: (Thinking) Was he asleep or awake when he wrote that song?</P>

<P>In the far corner of the Leathersnake Club is Quinn, Sandi, Tiffany
and Stacy, they are dressed up like Goth chicks and are wearing black wigs.
Standing next to Quinn is Andrea's ex boyfriend, the rest of the fashion
club do not have dates, and judging from the expression on Sandi's face
she not very happy about it, but they needed a ride and Alex has a car.
The music stops.</P>

<P>Jane: I think that Goth chick in the corner just signed her death warrant
Daria.</P>

<P>Daria: Tell me about it. If Andrea finds out that she's dating her exboyfriend
she's as good as dead.</P>

<P>Jane: Maybe we should warn her.</P>

<P>Daria: Better yet lets call Andrea that should liven things up a bit.</P>

<P>Jane: How could you be bored, you are who inspired Trent's last song.</P>

<P>Daria: What is that suppose to mean?</P>

<P>Jane: I think he read that article about you in &quot;Val Magazine&quot;
and then he wrote &quot;Bummer Culture.&quot; Never mind the song Daria
I think we should go over there and warn that Goth chick that her life
is in danger.</P>

<P>Daria: I guess you're right or tonight is going to be a live example
of Trent's &quot;Bummer Culture&quot; or should I say another Goth bites
the dust.</P>

<P>Jane and Daria go over to where Quinn , the fashion club and Alex are
standing. Quinn who realizes that Daria and Jane are headed her way, tries
to hide behind Alex.</P>

<P>Sandi: Quinn isn't that your cousin or whatever? She's coming over here.
</P>

<P>Tiffany: What would she want? She's like so weird.</P>

<P>Daria: (Takes a good look at the group and then realizes that it's Quinn
and the rest of the fashion club) Quinn what are you doing here? Why are
you and the rest of your friends dressed like Goth chicks?</P>

<P>Quinn: (Steps out from behind Alex) Just because you never experiment
with fashion, is no reason why I can't try a new look. Besides Alex only
dates Goth chicks. What are you doing here?</P>

<P>Daria: Quinn in case you haven't noticed Trent's band is playing here
tonight. I really don't care about what you wear, experiment all you want.
I just wanted to let you know that your life's in danger.</P>

<P>Quinn: What do you mean, things can't get any worse I'm already talking
to you, and the rest of the people in this club all look like a bunch of
losers.</P>

<P>Daria: If Andrea decides to kill you, I'll ask her is she needs any
help.</P>

<P>Alex: What do you mean? Why would Andrea want to kill Quinn?</P>

<P>Jane: Remember what happened a year ago when you both broke up for a
week and you dated that cheerleader. Andrea got so mad, that girl even
had to change schools.</P>

<P>Alex: Andrea's more mellow these days, besides the reason she got so
mad was that she didn't like the idea of being replaced by some shallow
cheerleader. </P>

<P>Daria: Then you made a great choice, Quinn is one of the deepest people
I know, and I'm the dancing queen. (thinking to herself) and Trent's band,
Mystik Spiral has five platinum LPs. Thank God Trent can't read my mind.</P>

<P>At the door of the club a dark figure emerges, it is Andrea and she
doesn't look very happy. She looks like the angry Queen Hecuba in her story
Gothic Nights.</P>

<P>Daria: I think it's time to pay that smelly restroom a visit.</P>

<P>Jane: That way we can soak up some of that night club ambiance and live
to see tomorrow.</P>

<P>Alex: I'm coming with you.</P>

<P>Daria: Excuse me, but we're going to the ladies room.</P>

<P>Alex: It doesn't matter everyone here is too smashed to read the sign
on the door anyway.</P>

<P>Jane: I thought you said that Andrea was more mellow these days.</P>

<P>Alex: Goths make mistakes to, and Andrea is not mellow tonight.</P>

<P>Quinn: Maybe the rest of us should join you, you know safety in numbers.</P>

<P>Sandi: I want you to remember Quinn that this was your idea. It's like
you do anything for a date even wear this really unfashionable clothes.</P>

<P>Quinn: Here she comes Sandi, I think we better get out of here fast.</P>

<P>Jane: Daria, I don't think we have time to get to the restroom, Andrea
is right here.</P>

<P>Alex: Hi Andrea, thought I'd hang out for a while, check out this new
group called Mystik Spiral.</P>

<P>Andrea: I see the band is not the only thing that's new here, I can't
believe you're dating that air head from the fashion club.</P>

<P>Jane: Actually the band has been around for a while now, my brother
Trent is the lead singer.</P>

<P>Andrea: I'm not here for the music, I'm here to settle a score with
that looser who is dating Alex.</P>

<P>Daria: Excuse me, Quinn might not be very bright, but I think dating
her was also Alex's choice.</P>

<P>Jane: After tonight Quinn will be probably dating the next guy on her
list, and she does have a very long list.</P>

<P>Alex: Quinn what is this about a list? Never mind. Come on Andrea we're
out of here.</P>

<P>Andrea: Yeah lets get out of this joint, besides the band isn't that
good anyway.</P>

<P>Jane: Excuse me, but that's my brother's band you're talking about.</P>

<P>Andrea: Drop it Lane, you're lucky you're still alive. Daria tell your
little sister I'll let her live this time and that she looks really stupid
as a Goth chick.</P>

<P>Stacey: Do I look stupid to?</P>

<P>Andrea: Yeah, bye.</P>

<P>Andrea and Alex leave the club just when Trent is finishing his last
song. It's already 3:00 AM. They pack up their equipment and Trent, Jane,
Daria ,Quinn and the other members of the fashion club are all riding in
the tank. Jesse and the rest of the band leave separately to get some sleep.</P>

<P>Trent: I'm not really sleepy yet, so why don't all of us go to Dega
street and hang out for a While.</P>

<P>Jane: So you're not sleepy yet, this is a rare occasion. I would really
like to go to Dega street and check out that new avant-garde art supply
shop or maybe get a few new holes in my head at Axl's.</P>

<P>Trent: Daria, maybe we can get that tattoo I promised you.</P>

<P>Daria: I guess some promises are meant to be broken. Besides it already
4:00 AM, if I go home any later it will be morning, which will make it
harder for me and Quinn to sneak into the house without my parents noticing
we were gone all night.</P>

<P>Sandi: I think Quinn's cousin or whatever is right. It will be almost
impossible for me to get into my house without my parents noticing if I
go home any later, besides tattoos are so permanent and you can't remove
them when they're not in fashion anymore. </P>

<P>Trent: Tattoos are suppose to be permanent, they're like suppose to
mark the moment, besides Daria is Quinn's sister not her cousin.</P>

<P>Sandi: I can see that your cousin's friends are really weird. Not only
do they say that your cousin or whatever is your sister, but they want
to wear something that is permanent , as if getting a bad haircut isn't
permanent enough. (Quinn looks back at Sandi with a sad expression on her
face, the evening is not going her way)</P>

<P>Tiffany: You're so right Sandi, at least your hair grows out. With a
tattoo you'll have to wear long sleeves all the time when the tattoo is
no longer in fashion.</P>

<P>Stacy: What do you do when long sleeves are no longer in fashion either?</P>

<P>Daria: I'm not getting a tattoo. Anyway, it's already four in the morning
and Axl's Piercing Parlor should be closed right now.</P>

<P>Trent: Axl's has an all night tech, see at night is when he gets most
of his business. Most of his customers are musicians like me, so their
hours are like mine.</P>

<P>Daria: I guess musicians are creatures of the night, just like vampires
and werewolves. I on the on other hand am still in highschool which means
I have to be awake during day light hours with the rest of the world, although
I do look forward to being Mrs. Dracula sometime in the future. </P>

<P>Quinn: What makes you think Dracula would want to go out with you Daria?</P>

<P>Daria: I agree, especially tonight, I'm sure you're much more his type
all dressed up like a Goth chick. In fact, come to think of it he will
want to date the whole fashion club. I hope you all want a guy with a really
pale complexion.</P>

<P>Tiffany: You know Quinn, your cousin says some of the weirdest things,
besides Dracula is not your type. I can't wait to get home and get out
of these clothes.</P>

<P>Trent: We won't be dropping you of for at least another hour. Here we
are, Dega street. Come on Daria lets go check out Axl's for that tattoo.</P>

<P>Daria: How about getting another navel ring, I promise I won't take
it of this time no matter how much it itches.</P>

<P>Quinn: Good, this time mom and dad will know I am not the one trying
to brighten her ho hum life with a little illusion.</P>

<P>Daria: You know what Trent, maybe we should check out the record store
instead.</P>

<P>Jane: That's too boring, how about checking out Herb's Adult Toys right
there in the corner.</P>

<P>Daria: (She is blushing and is really embarrassed) Maybe the tattoo
is not such a bad idea.</P>

<P>Quinn: Besides I don't want to live with someone who still plays with
toys. How immature.</P>

<P>The fashion club decides to stay in the tank. Jane goes over to the
avant-garde art supply store, and Trent and Daria walk over to Axl's. Daria
keeps hoping that this is a nightmare and that she will wake up any minute,
then she realizes she's not in her underwear meaning all this is really
happening.</P>

<P>Daria: (Thinking) Why did I let Jane talk into going out tonight? I'd
would have been better of if I had just stayed home and counted the cracks
on the ceiling. I sure hope that rash doesn't appear again. (To Trent)
Trent, I didn't know you hung out at Dega street at this time of the morning.</P>

<P>Trent: This is when I like to do my shopping Daria, when I have some
money, which is like maybe once a month, I don't like malls they're so
crowded.</P>

<P>Daria: I agree, I don't like the mall either. I prefer the Home Shopping
Network., No, on second thought they sell those really tacky cat pictures
that Quinn likes. I shop on the internet from time to time</P>

<P>Trent: How often is from time to time?</P>

<P>Daria: Once I year, see I have a really busy schedule with all my dates
and all those parties that I go to all the time. Then again maybe not.</P>

<P>Trent: I'm a loner to Daria. Gives me time to think about what I really
want from life.</P>

<P>Daria: What do you want from life Trent?</P>

<P>Trent: I would really like it if Mystic Spiral had a hit song, maybe
even a gold album. For now I'm trying to wake up in time for breakfast,
that way I can practice more. What do you want from life Daria? </P>

<P>Daria I've never told this to anyone, there's this character I created
her name is Melody Powers. She's a secret agent and she goes on really
exciting missions. She's strong, independent and has a much more exiting
life than I do. I sometimes wish I was Melody Powers.</P>

<P>Trent: Kind of like a female James Bond. I think that's really cool
Daria, I hope all your dreams come true. Here we are, Axl's.</P>

<P>Daria: It's closed, there's a sign on the door let me read what it says.
(reads the sign.) &quot;I'm sorry but I can't be at the shop this morning,
the nudist colony where I live called an emergency meeting for all the
tenants, they need to go over the dress code. Please come back, I will
be happy to serve you then.&quot; Why would there be a dress code at a
nudist colony? (notices Upchuck coming out of Herb's Adult Toys he is wearing
a hat and dark glasses) Isn't that Upchuck? ( Upchuck spots Daria and Trent
and runs away quickly) I can't believe it Upchuck actually has some sense
of shame.</P>

<P>Trent: Well Daria, I guess I will have to get you that tattoo some other
time. I think we better go find Janey, it's already 5:00Am and we better
be heading back home. I'm getting kind of drowsy. </P>

<P>At the moment they spot Jane walking out of The Bohemian Avant-Garde
Art Shop, she is carrying a large bag, she realizes that Trent and Daria
were only gone for thirty minutes and that Daria didn't get the tatoo,
so for Daria's sake she decides not to talk about it.</P>

<P>Jane: Hey Trent this bag is kind of heavy, you think you could carry
it for me?</P>

<P>Trent: Sure thing Janey. (Jane hands him the bag) This is heavy! what
do you have in here?</P>

<P>Jane: The usual, some new brushes, one month supply of paint. I love
that store, they have these really unusual colors Daria.</P>

<P>Daria: I guess you're going to be the next Jackson Pollock.</P>

<P>Jane: That was last year, Now my newest rage is Jonathan Winters not
only are his paintings cool, I love the names he gives them, my absolute
favorite is <I>Thoughts of a Hollywood Actor While Drowning in His Pool.</I>
</P>

<P>Daria: That's assuming Hollywood Actors actually think.</P>

<P>Jane: I think my next masterpiece will be a picture of Trent asleep.
I plan to call that one <I>Rock Superstar on the Pursuit of His</I> <I>Dreams.</I>
</P>

<P>Trent: I guess she wants my fans to know that I'm a very mellow guy.
</P>

<P>Daria: (Thinking) More like a catatonic guy. </P>

<P>Trent: I plan on having Janey design the cover of my first album. </P>

<P>Daria: Ok then, maybe its time I try some art of my own. I'm going to
paint portrait of Jane, and I will call it <I>Girl Who Saw</I> <I>Too Many
Sick, Sad World Reruns. </I></P>

<P>Jane: Thanks a lot Daria. I was planning on having you name some of
my paintings.</P>

<P>Daria: Why didn't you say that before? Now my life will have some meaning.
My sarcasm will make its mark in an art gallery somewhere on <I>Sick, Sad
World .</I></P>

<P>Jane: Now you're talking. </P>

<P>Meanwhile Quinn and the rest of the fashion club get tired of waiting
in the van and Quinn is thirsty.</P>

<P>Quinn: I'm really thirsty. I'm going to go check if there's a place
around here that sells Diet Coke.</P>

<P>Sandi: I prefer mineral water, Diet Coke is bad for your skin. </P>

<P>Tiffany: You're so right Sandi. Quinn try to see if you could find some
water. One should only drink Diet Coke as a last resort. </P>

<P>Quinn gets out of the van and on the way to the convenience store, a
guy dressed in jeans with holes in them and a Marilyn Manson tank top approaches
her.</P>

<P>Guy in grunge: Hi there cutie, lets go have a cup of coffee.</P>

<P>Quinn: Ugh! don't get near me. (She runs back to the van, and spots
Daria, Trent and Jane) What took you so long? I'm really thirsty but I
can't get a drink because there are some really weird people around here,
they're dressed even worse than all of you.</P>

<P>Daria: Speak for yourself. We are not the ones that are dressed like
Goth chicks.</P>

<P>Quinn: Oh no! I hope no one I know sees me dressed like this. Besides
it's already five in the morning. We better get home before mom and dad
wake up and discover we've been out all night. </P>

<P>Trent, Jane, Daria and Quinn get into the Van and they all head to everyone's
house or jail cells if they get grounded. Meanwhile at the Morgendorffer
house, Jake and Helen have been waiting for Daria and Quinn all night and
they are not exactly tickled pink. Jake is more worried with every passing
moment and Helen is more angry.</P>

<P>Jake: I'm worried it is already 5:00 Am and we have not heard from the
girls yet. I think maybe I should go look for them,&nbsp;Helen.</P>

<P>Helen: I guess you have forgotten when we were in our teens and we would
go to those all night parties with Willow and Coyote. I think we should
give it one more hour and if the girls are not back by then we are calling
the police.</P>

<P>Jake: You know what I think is strange Helen, if they both went to different
places wouldn't each of them be home at a different time. You don't suppose
they are both at the same place.</P>

<P>Helen: Come on Jakey don't be ridiculous. Daria and Quinn at the same
place, that is never going to happen. You're right though it is strange.</P>

<P>Trent first drops of Tiffany and Stacy at their houses and they somehow
manage to get in without being caught. When Trent drops of Sandi her mother
is waiting for her with her arms crossed in the front yard it's already
5:30 Am. Quinn and Daria begin to worry about the fate that awaits them.
Trent and Jane on the other hand have no worries, their parents are out
of town as usual. Trent pulls up at the Daria's driveway and they find
Jake and Helen at the front door waiting for them, with that boy are you
two going get it expression on both their faces. Daria and Quinn look at
each other and take a deep breath, this is not going to be pretty. When
they get out of the van, Jake and Helen look very surprised since they
did spend the evening together.</P>

<P>Helen: Daria, Quinn, you both have a lot of explaining to do. Quinn
why are you dressed that way? Daria I thought you were more responsible
when it came to your curfew. This time you are both grounded and no parole
for either of you.</P>

<P>Quinn: But mom, we didn't come home late on a school night.</P>

<P>Helen: Regardless of whether or not it is a school night I will not
allow either of you to return home at 5:45Am.</P>

<P>Jake: Girls what your mother is trying to say is that we were both worried
sick while you were gone.</P>

<P>Daria: How long do you plan to ground us?</P>

<P>Helen: We are grounding you both for a month.</P>

<P>Daria: (Thinking) I guess I'm going to have to play that rusty old harmonica
as much as possible. I wonder if those so called cool kids, who go to those
all night parties have this problem? I wonder how mom noticed that I was
gone? I don't know but I bet it had something to do with Quinn, after all
she was born for the sole purpose of ruining my life. </P>

<P>Quinn: Now we're both going to be marooned for a whole month and it's
all your fault Daria. It like you're always trying to ruin my life because
I'm popular. </P>

<P>Daria: Excuse me Quinn but I was not the one dating Andrea's exboyfriend
dressed like some Goth chick, and it's not my fault that your date left
you behind and that you and your friends needed a ride.</P>

<P>Quinn: I just don't understand how mom and dad noticed we were both
gone. I did a really good job of covering my tracks.</P>

<P>Daria: You got me there. I also did a good job of covering mine.</P>

<P>It's Monday morning and Jane and Daria are over at their lockers. Daria
tells Jane about her new prison sentence.</P>

<P>Daria: My parents are grounding us for a month and this time no parole.
At least they're not putting me and Quinn through family court.</P>

<P>Jane: So I guess that means I won't be seeing you after school, but
we can still talk on the phone.</P>

<P>Daria: Forget the phone, Quinn is also grounded. I guess it's back to
pestering them with all those board games. I know I will also be playing
my rusty old harmonica on a regular basis.</P>

<P>Jane: Maybe it's time you got one of those portable keyboards.</P>

<P>Daria: No, I need something that they find really disturbing, something
that will torture Quinn as well. So it has to be the harmonica.</P>

<P>Kevin comes over by the lockers to find out what Daria finally decided
to do on Saturday night and to know why she wasn't at the cemetery when
he went looking for her.</P>

<P>Kevin: Hey Daria, what did you do Saturday night? I went to the cemetery
to see if I could check you out trying to do some of that voodoo stuff
for raising the dead and I didn't find you there.</P>

<P>Daria: I figured there are too many fools roaming the earth already,
so I went with Jane to the Leathersnake Club to see Trent's band. After
we left the club we hung out at Dega street. Now I'm grounded for a month,
so is Quinn.</P>

<P>Kevin: I know I say dumb things once in a while.</P>

<P>Jane: Only once in a while?</P>

<P>Kevin: Anyway you don't expect me to believe that you went out clubbing
and then checked out Dega street after that. You're just not that cool,
Daria.</P>

<P>Daria: You're right Kevin my parents grounded me for finding too many
cracks on my ceiling and they grounded Quinn for being herself.</P>

<P>Kevin: How many cracks did you find on your ceiling?</P>

<P>Jane: Never mind I don't think you can count that high anyway.</P>

<P>At school hallway Quinn is telling Britanny her version of what they
did Saturday night .</P>

<P>Britanny: Hi Quinn, I didn't see you or anyone from the fashion club
at the party Saturday night. Where did you go? </P>

<P>Quinn: Sandi, Tiffany, Stacy and I went to Cashman's later Saturday
afternoon and they had brought in all this really cute clothes. So when
they closed the store we were still in the dressing room. We all had to
spend the night there. I guess it one of the hazards of being really fashionable.</P>

<P>Andrea and Alex passes by them in the hallway and Quinn runs away.</P>
