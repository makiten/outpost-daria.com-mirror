played softly on the radio. </a> She slowly
ran one well manicured nail up his back, purring contently while he slept
beside her.   ‘I guess musicians really
know how to use their instruments.’ She thought then giggled quietly to
herself.  It had been quite an
afternoon.  Good thing no one was going
to be home until this evening.  Still she
couldn’t lie here all day and watch her ‘music man’ sleep.  She really needed to get a shower soon.  Instead, she played with a lock of his hair
as she thought about the moment when she realized she had to have him.  Watching him perform, imagining the passion
he had for his music turned into passion for her.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;color:#6600CC'>She
had approached him when they had finished playing, meaning to strike up a
conversation.  It didn’t quite work out
that way.  They were arguing over lyrics
as they packed up their instruments. 
Instead of talking to them, she sat nearby and listened as they
talked.  Finally when they started
carting out equipment she spotted an opportunity.  He was alone for a moment wrapping wires
while the other guys hauled out the damaged sound board.  She had turned on the charm, and instead of
dazzling him she was dazzled as she got close to him.  The dark hair that begged to have her hands
running through it, those eyes, and those lips that she wanted to feel kissing
her all over. </span></p>

it isn’t that late.” She murmured to herself as she reached for him.  “Wake up baby.”  </span></p>

him while slipping her hands lower and lower down his back and kissing his well
muscled arm and along his neck.  </span></p>
