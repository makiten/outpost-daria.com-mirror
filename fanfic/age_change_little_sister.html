<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>Iron Chef: Age Trade: Little
Sister </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>By Cap</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>In response to an Iron Chef
Challenge on the PPMB</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria shut the
door behind her and irritably kicked off her sodden flats. She impaled her
drenched jacket on the coat tree. Neither jacket nor shoes were designed to
withstand wet weather yet she had to trudge two miles through a rain storm
because her father forgot to pick her up at the library and a busy signal was
the only reply to all of her calls to home. To add insult to injury, the rain
ceased as soon as she reached her home's walkway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cold, wet, and
angry, she stomped across the living room leaving </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>damp footprints in her wake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Quinn,"
Daria began. Quinn ignored her, her attention fixed on her own </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>conversation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Yes,
Donny, I know I promised you a date," Quinn cooed into the telephone. "But
every day for the next month is all ready taken. Yes, even breakfasts."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Quinn,"
Daria said more forcefully.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Shoo,
Munchkin," Quinn said flicking her hand at her younger sister. "Can't you see
I'm on the phone?" </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Did
you remember to take your herpes medicine today?" Daria yelled before storming
to the kitchen. Quinn flung a couch pillow at her but missed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Grumbling
to herself, Daria jerked open the refrigerator. She grabbed a bottle of soda
and slammed the door shut.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"So
the princess has herpes, eh?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Daria
whirled around in surprise. A lean brunette in a red jacket and grey </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>v-neck tee shirt sat at the
kitchen table. A sketchpad, pencils, and a pen were </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>scattered before her. A
black vinyl artist's portfolio with several more </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>sketchpads peeking out of
the open top sat on the chair beside her. Daria had </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>seen the girl in the halls
of Lawndale High School. She did not know what her </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>name was but she knew that
she was not part of Quinn's usual set. What was she doing here?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Daria
gave her head a small quick negative waggle. "No, she doesn't. I was just
angry. I'd been trying to call home for a ride but I couldn't get through."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
girl snorted. "Yeah, tell me about it. We're supposed to be partners on this
idiotic project that O'Neil pulled out of his ass but she hasn't got off the </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>phone since I've been here."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Daria
awarded her a small commiserate smile. "Has she offered you anything to eat or
drink?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"My
choice of diet soda, fat-free popcorn, and carrot sticks."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"I
prefer my poison undiluted," Daria said wiggling the bottle of decidedly not
diet soda back and forth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Yeah,
me, too. I'll take a glass of that, if you don't mind. What's your name?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Daria
poured two glasses. She carefully recapped the bottle and returned it to the
refrigerator before answering. "I'm Daria," she finally said in a soft, mild </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>voice as she politely sat
the glass before their guest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Thanks,"
she said expansively. "Jane Lane, artiste extraordinaire, here."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Daria
took a sip of her soda but did not reply.&nbsp; You are a quiet one, aren't </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>you, Jane thought. Well with
Miss Popularity Plus as an older sister, likely you </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>haven't gotten a word in
edgewise in years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Sorry,
I took so long," Quinn said breezing into the kitchen. "She hasn't been
bothering you, I hope," she added when she caught sight of Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"No,
actually..." Jane began with the telephone rang again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Who
can that be now?" Quinn said bounding out of the kitchen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Hey,
we got to..." Jane called out but Quinn was already gone. She glanced over to
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
smaller girl shook her head. "Forget it. Just do your part of the project."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"But
it's a team effort," Jane complained. "It's a multimedia project. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>Everything has to fit together.
My part is meaningless without her part."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Daria
stared at her for several long moments before jerking her head toward the door.
"C'mon. Grab your stuff and follow me."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Where?"
Jane asked shoving her pads and drawing instruments into her case.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"My
room," She replied exiting the kitchen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Juggling
her burden and her glass of soda, Jane trailed after the younger teen. She
started to tell Quinn where she was going but the redhead, yammering on the
telephone, did not notice her. With as much of a shrug as she could manage with
her arms full, Jane started up the staircase. Daria was waiting for her at the
top.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"My
room's at the end of the hall," Daria said pointing Jane to the front of the
house. "I'll be there in a moment. I need to dry off first."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Sure,"
Jane said as a partially open door captured her attention. Beyond it, she spied
a bed with a robin's-egg blue canopy and matching bedclothes. Stuffed animals
and wall posters featuring various boy bands fought for attention.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Quinn's
room?" Jane asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Of
course," replied Daria blandly before disappearing into the bathroom. "I
couldn't sleep in something like that."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Jane
walked down to Daria's room. She stopped just inside the door. She had no
preconceptions but was never the less surprised by the d&eacute;cor, surprised and
pleased although it did not mesh to own personal predilection. Unlike Quinn's
teenybopper mishmash, everything in Daria's room matched. All of the furniture,
the computer desk, the bureau, the vanity, the pencil post bed, was in the
stark simplicity of the Shaker style. The hardwood-tiled floor was barren of
any throw rugs. Heavy white drapes enclosed four windows set in walls painted a
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>light green. Two low
bookshelves guarded the desk while three prints from the </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>Hudson</span><span
 style='font-family:Arial'> Valley School</span><span style='font-family:Arial'>
hung on the wall above them. Another print from the same </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>school adorned an adjacent
wall.&nbsp; In a corner, two flutes, one silver-plated </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>concert and one wooden
keyless, rested on a stand laden with sheet music.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Daria,
still sipping her soda, walked in a few minutes later wearing an </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>oversized pink bathrobe and
a pair of fuzzy house slippers with kitten faces on </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>them. "These are Quinn's,"
She quickly said. "I am not a closet <i>Hello Kitty</i> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>fan."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Of
course not," replied Jane from where she was sitting on the edge of the bed.
"Everything here screams <i>My Little Pony</i>."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Daria
smiled slightly as she sat down at her desk and spun around. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"I
like your room," Jane said gesturing with one hand. "Did you decorate it </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>yourself?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Yes,"
Daria bashfully said. "I had to in self-defense. Left up to Mom it would have
either been Happy Bunny Land or Typical American Teen Girl, 1957." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Jane
laughed. "You did a great job. You made some interesting choices."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Thank
you," Daria replied. "I'd like to have left it as it was when we moved in but
Mom wouldn't let me."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Oh?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"It
was cool," Daria said. "Barred windows, padded walls, and a television </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>bolted up in the corner
there. Apparently, the previous owners kept a mentally </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>unbalanced relative in
here." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"And
your Mom didn't go for that look?" Jane asked in mock surprise. "Shame on her.
Some people have no taste."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Daria
smiled ruefully. "I thought it the perfect metaphor for my life. I should </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>have put up more of an
argument but I was so grateful to her for getting us out </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>of Highland that I felt that
it was little enough that I could do in return."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Highland?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Highland, Texas," Daria finished. "Out in the middle of nowhere. It's a </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>violent, dirty city devoid
of any redeeming qualities that's been slowly dying </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>for a hundred years but no
one there seems to realize that fact."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Highland, Texas," Jane repeated. "Wasn't it featured on <i>Sick, Sad World</i> once?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Daria
nodded the small smile disappearing from her lips. "They found traces of
uranium in the drinking water. From the mutants that I knew there, I suspect
that it was a lot more then just trace amounts."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"You're
okay, aren't you?" asked Jane in sudden concern.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Yes,"
Daria said. "Mom and Dad always insisted on bottled water. Part of their hippie
paranoia about <i>the man</i>, I guess. Anyway, what's this project about?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"What?
Oh, the project," Jane said. "It's a multimedia presentation containing words,
music, and a visual element. I was going to do the pictures while your sister
was supposed to do the words. I thought that I'd get my brother to supply some
music. So far, I haven't gotten any cooperation from either of them."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"I
understood multimedia presentation," Daria said slowly. "What I asked was
what's it about? What's the subject? What are you trying to accomplish? Do you
have a particular message or aim?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"I'm
aiming to pass English," joked Jane. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Daria
gave her a flinty glare.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Nothing's
been decided yet," Jane clarified. "It's just another dumb ass </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>assignment that O'Neil
dreamed up. I don't really give a damn what we do just as </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>long as something gets done
and I get a passing grade. Besides what do you care? "</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Composition
is far from Quinn's strong suit but it is mine. Eventually, she's going to
panic and bribe me to do the assignment for her." Daria explained.&nbsp; "It would
help if I knew what is needed and I don't trust her to know what that is </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>with any assurance." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Oh,
I see," said Jane understanding.&nbsp; "Basically, we're just going to create a
short original film."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Animation?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"That's
what I'd like to do," Jane confirmed. "I took a community education </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>course over the summer at Lawndale State and learned to use some of the new </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>animation software. If I
supply everything else, I can use LSU's computers to </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>put together something. I
just need a story to work with. I'm not good with </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>words." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"How
long?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Let's
say two minutes of film," said Jane. "Nothing really major but something that
won't endanger my 'C' average in English."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Daria
nodded slowly.&nbsp; "That's easy enough. All I need to know is what you want the
film to be about."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Oh,
I don't know," Jane mused as her gaze wandered. She spotted on the opposite
wall Thomas Cole's <i>The Past</i>, which featured a joust. "How about
something with knights in armor. I remember some of the software having
medieval scenery in it."&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Knights
in armor and two minutes," Daria reiterated. "Not a problem. Quinn will be
bothering you in a couple of days about how her end of the project is done and
when are you going to be delivering on your part."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Jane
chuckled. "Does she make you do a lot of her home work?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"She
doesn't make me do any of it," Daria retorted sharply. "However, for some
financial considerations, I do aid her occasionally."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"In
other words, you'll be paying cash for a new car when you turn sixteen," said
Jane</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Not
a new one," Daria replied with a grin.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Are
you any good with those?" asked Jane nodding her head toward the flutes on the
music stand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"I'm
second flute in the Lawndale Youth Orchestra," said Daria. "Why?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Quinn
might be bribing you for some medieval music in a few days," Jane </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>answered. "My brother's
lollygagging for some reason."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Daria
leaned back and pulled a cd from a pigeonhole in the desk. She extended it to
Jane. "It's a two-disc set," she said. "It has about fifty songs on it from
fourteenth through seventeenth century Florence. You can probably find
something you can use."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Hey,
thanks," Jane said flipping the case over. The cover art showed a </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>doublet-wearing courtier
playing a lute. "I'm sure this'll work and I won't have </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>to keep pestering Trent."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Some
of the music will be anachronistic with armored knights but I doubt if too many
will notice," Daria replied.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Notice?"
Jane laughed. "How many of our classmates even know what anachronistic means,
Amiga?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Amiga?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"It
means friend."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"I
know that," Daria said. "You can't grow up where I did without becoming </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>semi-fluent in the Tex-Mex
form of Spanish. I simply wasn't expecting it is </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>all."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Hey,
I was starting to think that I wasn't going to pass this stupid thing but </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>thanks to you, I think I
just might now," Jane replied gathering her things. "That definitely puts you
in the amiga column."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Well,
mi nuevo amiga, I'll get started," Daria said. "If you would when you get
downstairs, throw a scene then storm out. That should get Quinn up here post
haste."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Ah,
a little performance art to spice up the afternoon," said Jane grabbing he gear.&nbsp;
"No problemo. Thanks, Daria. I'll see you around." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Good-bye."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>(*)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Two
week later, Jane slid up to Daria as the younger teen was shutting her locker.&nbsp;
"Hey, Amiga," she said happily. "I owe you big time."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"O'Neil
liked the multimedia project, I take it," Daria replied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Liked
it? He loved it," exclaimed Jane. "A plus! I can cruise the rest of the </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>semester. Having the winning
knight to be a woman floored him. He went on and on about female actualization
and empowerment and a bunch of other psychobabble crap."&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Did
Quinn like being drawn as a knight?" Daria asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Jane
hooted. "She ate it up especially with all of the boys fawning over her </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>afterwards."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Did
any of them fawn over the artist responsible?" asked Daria impishly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Jane
snorted inelegantly. "Of course not but what the hell, I've got a </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>boyfriend. Speaking of
which, what are you doing Friday night?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"No
plans," replied Daria. "What did you have in mind?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"I
thought maybe we could hang out," Jane answered. "Grab a burger or something.
Catch a movie or listen to my brother's band down at the Zon."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Thank
you," Daria replied slowly. "But me tagging along with you and your boyfriend
would be awkward for everyone." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Yeah
it would," acknowledged Jane chuckling. "But he's out of town this </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>weekend. It'll be just a
girl's night out. What do you say?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Daria
hesitated then shrugged. "Sure," she replied with a small smile. "It </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>sounds like fun."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Great,"
Jane exclaimed. "Hey, if you don't have band practice or something after
school, let's hit the Pizza King. My treat."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Yeah,
okay," replied Daria. "I'll meet you out front."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"Fantastic,"
Jane said merrily. "See ya then."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Daria
watched her bounce happily down the hall. She was a strange girl; a far cry
from her few friends in the orchestra yet Daria found herself oddly regretting
that she had not met Jane sooner after her move to Lawndale.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial'>"C'est
la vie," She lamented to herself as she turned toward her next class.</span></p>
