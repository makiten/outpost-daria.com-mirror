<P>&quot;MORGENDORFFER!&quot;</P>

<P>Cadet Morgendorffer stood at rigid attention as the Corporal, hands
behind his back, slowly surrounded him in a one-man ambush.</P>

<P>&quot;Sir, yes Sir!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What are YOU gonna do when the commies arrive, Morgendorffer?&quot;</P>

<P>Jake swallowed noisily, feeling the eyes of his platoon drilling into
him, greedily tasting his discomfort, each one thankful that it was Jake,
not him, on the receiving end of Corporal Ellenbogen's taunts. Thankful
but still, Jake knew, contemptuous.</P>

<P>&quot;The commies?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;WHAT?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The commies, Sir?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That's right, Morgendorffer. The commies. The stinking, red flag
waving, slogan chanting, Godless, vodka drinking, sister raping, freedom
hating COMMIES!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Er, do, Sir?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;CAN'T YOU SPEAK IN SENTENCES OF MORE THAN THREE WORDS, MORGENDORFFER?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Sir, yes Sir!&quot; </P>

<P>Ellenbogen's face was inches from Jake's. If he closed his eyes, he
could imagine that it was his father, &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Morgendorffer,
standing there bellowing at him. He had to concentrate to stop himself
from gagging.</P>

<P>A titter escaped from the platoon. Jake felt the heat of a blush extending
from his neck to his face and he loathed himself for his weakness.</P>

<P>Ellenbogen smelled victory and turned from Jake to the platoon.</P>

<P>&quot;YOU THINK IT'S FUNNY DO YOU? Well let me tell you, you pack of
pussies, the commies are no laughing matter! They'd stick a knife - or
worse - into your sister, or your mother, and they'd laugh while they were
doing it.&quot; He paused for effect. &quot;And that, my friends, is why
we're here. Our country's depending on us - you and me - to defend it when
that time comes. And believe me, it's gonna come! Sooner than you think!</P>

<P>Jake felt himself drifting off as Corporal Ellenbogen launched into
another one of his endless tirades against the commies. If the commies
did come, he thought, a bunch of kids with rifles wouldn't be much use
against atomic bombs. Of course Mad Dog wouldn't see it that way. Oh no.
Mad Dog would be right there behind Ellenbogen, yelling at Jake to catch
the bombs as they fell and screaming at his uselessness as he failed, as
he always did, dooming America and the Free World to nuclear Armageddon,
eternal rule by the commies, his fault...his fault...</P>

<P>&quot;I SAID IS THAT RIGHT, MORGENDORFFER?&quot;</P>

<P>Jake snapped out of his reverie. He had no idea of what Ellenbogen had
been saying. He took a gamble.</P>

<P>&quot;Sir, yes Sir!&quot; he snapped with as much enthusiasm as he could
muster.</P>

<P>Jake heard the laughter of his &quot;buddies&quot;. Wrong answer. Again.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="25%"></P>

<P>&quot;You goin' to the dance tomorrow night, Morgendorffer?&quot;</P>

<P>Jake lay back on his bunk, past seething in indignation. These days
it just washed over him. He didn't need to be reminded of his worthlessness,
it was a fact of life. His father knew it, Corporal Ellenbogen knew it,
his platoon buddies knew it, and he knew it.</P>

<P>Johanssen raised his foot and prodded Jake through the mattress from
the bunk below. &quot;I said are y' goin' t' the dance?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh. Yeah. I mean no. I mean...I don't know. What's the point?&quot;</P>

<P>Johanssen stood up and leaned against the top bunk, staring into Jake's
face in mock surprise. &quot;The point? What's the point? Damn, Jakey,
you ain't goin' all queer on me now, are ya? Chicks, man! Chicks! That's
the point! You remember what chicks are, don't ya, Jakie?&quot;</P>

<P>Jake smiled despite himself. Johanssen was about the only one who bothered
to talk to him these days, though that was probably just because he occupied
the bunk below. &quot;I remember. I just don't see any point. No chicks
are going to pay any attention to me. It'll be like all the other times.
You-know-who will be surrounded by girls and I'll hang around the punch
bowl until it's time to get back to school. Why bother?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Your choice, man. But one thing's for sure - ain't gonna be no
chicks <I>here</I> tomorrow night! 'Sides, if you don't come, ain't gonna
be no-one less attractive to them chicks than me! Haw haw!&quot;</P>

<P>When Johanssen laughed his buck teeth stuck out even further than usual.
Sadly, Jake recognised that he was right. Even acne-scarred, buck-toothed
Johanssen managed to strike up the odd conversation with a girl from time
to time, but none of them had ever shown any interest in Jake. <I>What
the hell,</I> he thought, <I>it beats sitting around at school all night
while everyone else is out having fun</I>. He and Johanssen were usually
wallflowers anyway, at least they could keep each other company.</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, okay Johanssen. I'll come.&quot;</P>

<P>Johanssen grinned and punched Jake in the arm. &quot;Yee-haw! That's
mah man! You never know, Morgendorffer, you just might get lucky.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And the commies might just shit in Ellenbogen's shoes again, eh?&quot;</P>

<P>That set Johanssen off on another laughing jag.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="25%"></P>

<P>&quot;Going to spend the night keeping the punch bowl company again,
Morgendorffer?&quot; The voice made Jake cringe. A whole bus full of seats
and Corporal Ellenbogen's son had to sit right behind him and Johanssen.
Andrew Jackson Macarthur Ellenbogen Jr. One year ahead of Jake - mercifully
- at least he'd graduate this year. A chip off the old block and someone
not to be trifled with, on his own account or his father's. Known, when
he was reliably out of earshot, simply as Junior but, to his face, as Ellenbogen.</P>

<P>Johanssen spun around enthusiastically and grinned at Junior . &quot;Naw,
Ellenbogen. Jake's gonna get lucky tonight, aren't ya Jakey?&quot; He punched
Jake in the shoulder again.</P>

<P>Jake knew that Johanssen meant well, but he wished he wouldn't.</P>

<P>Junior ignored Johanssen and concentrated on Jake. &quot;Lucky? You?
Hah! You know why you're never gonna get lucky, Morgendorffer?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No.&quot; Jake muttered, thinking <I>but I'm sure you're gonna
to tell me and the rest of the bus</I> and, again, sensing the rising heat
of a blush on his cheeks and the rising gorge of self-loathing he felt
whenever Ellenbogen or Junior bullied him.</P>

<P>&quot;Because you're a PUSSY, Morgendorffer. Women like men who know
how to look after themselves. Women want to know their place, know who's
the boss.&quot; His voice became less strident and he leaned back against
the seatback, placing his hands behind his head. &quot;Yes, sir, that's
what a woman needs. A firm hand to keep her in line. Not like these damn
hippie whores, talking about peace and equality. When they can carry a
gun, pilot a fighter jet, captain a ship, then they can talk about equality!&quot;
He tensed and leaned forward again.&nbsp;&quot;They're all commies you
know, Morgendorffer. That's what those damn filthy hippies are. COMMIES.
They're all part of a plot to subvert all that's good and decent about
America! Goddamn, son, if any woman of mine started talking like that she'd
damn soon learn which way was up!&quot; He punched his open palm.</P>

<P>Johanssen laughed uneasily and, caught between the collective need to
avoid antagonising Junior and a residual sense of empathy with his bunkmate,
flashed Junior a half-hearted grin.</P>

<P>&quot;You mark my words, Morgendorffer,&quot; Junior continued. &quot;If
you want to pull a woman tonight, start acting like a man and not a pussy.
Let her know you're the boss.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Thanks for the advice, Ellenbogen.&quot; Jake muttered darkly.
<I>Hope your ass explodes</I> he thought. He spent the rest of the bus
ride trying to reconcile the revulsion he felt for Junior and his advice
with the terrible possibility that he may be right. After all, that was
the way that his father always treated his mother, wasn't it? And Junior
himself never seemed to have any trouble getting girls. He shuddered at
the thought. <I>If that's what it takes I'll stay single</I>.</P>

<P>Buxton Ridge Military Academy and Saint Agnes's School for Young Ladies
had a longstanding arrangement. Three times a year the upperclassmen from
Buxton Ridge Military Academy were bussed to the Saint Agnes's for a dance
in the gym. The Harvest Ball, Winter Ball and Spring Fling were chances
for disciplined young men and good Catholic girls to meet and socialise
in a supervised environment. Neither the nuns from St Agnes's or the staff
from Buxton Ridge had any need to worry about inappropriate influences.
A band, comprising a piano player, saxophonist and drummer, none of whom
were younger than 60 when they'd first been hired fifteen years ago, provided
wholesome music (although Mother Superior had commented the previous year
that she had detected a hint of that sinful jazz influence in the Pride
of Erin, and that had put a stop to <I>that</I>). The cadets in their freshly-ironed
dress uniforms and the young ladies in their modest dresses were allowed
to socialise until the wee small hour of 11:00pm sharp under the watchful
gaze of the nuns and Academy staff. The evenings always commenced with
a welcome and prayer by Mother Superior followed by a response from the
accompanying Academy officer - in this case, Corporal Ellenbogen, Jake's
nemesis and father of Jake's nemesis.</P>

<P>As the bus pulled up outside Saint Agnes's Corporal Ellenbogen stood
and addressed the cadets. </P>

<P>&quot;At ease, men.&quot; He looked a Jake. &quot;And boys. As always,
I require every one of you to uphold the dignity of Buxton Ridge tonight.
And by 'uphold the dignity' I mean that I catch any one of you with his
hand down or up the dress of any of the Saint Agnes girls, I will personally
feed your sorry ass, finely chopped, to my Dobermans without first removing
it from your broken and bleeding body. And your privates will decorate
my Christmas wreath. Is that clear?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;SIR, YES SIR!&quot; chorused the cadets.</P>

<P>&quot;Now I know that many of you are not of the Catholic faith, nevertheless
I expect you to respect the dignity of Saint Agnes's tradition during Mother
Superior's introductory prayer. Is that also clear?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;SIR, YES SIR!&quot; </P>

<P>&quot;Then PRO-ceed.&quot;</P>

<P>The cadets filed off the bus and into the gym, which the girls had decorated
with Christmas scenes and red, white and blue paper streamers. A sheet,
painted with the words &quot;Merry Christmas Buxton Ridge Cadets&quot;
had been hung on the far wall and the Michael O'Flaherty All Stars, dressed
in tuxedos that were unashamed of their proud years of service, sat under
the welcome banner. When the cadets had filed in and lined up, Mother Superior
stepped up to the microphone.</P>

<P>&quot;Would the girls sitting along the benches at the side cross their
legs please? Thank you. Now that the gates of Hell are closed, it is my
pleasure to once again welcome the fine young men from Buxton Ridge to
Saint Agnes's. I know that you're all eager to join in the festivities
tonight so I won't bore you with formalities. Let us begin with the traditional
prayer.&quot; The assembled cadets and young ladies bowed their heads reverentially.
&quot;Heavenly Father, we give thanks to you for once again bringing us
together in a night of wholesome intercourse.&quot; Corporal Ellenbogen
cast a wary eye over the assembled cadets to ensure that no one disgraced
the Academy by snickering. &quot;Watch over us and keep us from unholy
influences and sinful temptations of the flesh that we may not burn in
the eternal fires of damnation where unspeakable torments await young people
unable to control their sinful primal urges. Amen.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Amen&quot; echoed the multitude. The Catholics among the cadets
and all the young women crossed themselves.</P>

<P>Corporal Ellenbogen addressed the microphone for the response. &quot;Thank
you Mother Superior for that inspiring prayer. On behalf of the cadets
of Buxton Ridge&nbsp;I'd like to thank you, the Sisters of Saint Agnes,
and the charming young ladies for your warm welcome. Let the dance begin.&quot;</P>

<P>The All Stars took their cue and launched into a rousing rendition of
<I>When Irish Eyes are Smiling</I>, played strictly <I>a tempo</I> ever
since Michael O'Flaherty had introduced two bars of syncopation last year
and earned the wrath of Mother Superior. The cadets broke ranks and started
to mingle.</P>

<P>Cadets Morgendorffer and Johanssen ambled listlessly over to the punch
bowl which had been set up opposite the band. Johanssen eagerly cast around
for a possible target, landing on, then immediately rejecting as way out
of his league, the group of three immaculately-dressed girls whose figures
their modest clothes were doing a heroic, but ultimately hopeless, job
of camouflaging. Junior, he noticed, was making a bee line for them anyway.
He dug Jake in the ribs. &quot;No shortage o' talent here tonight eh, Jakey
boy? And I don't mean the band! Haw haw.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Dammit Willie! You nearly made me spill the punch.&quot; exclaimed
Jake, but Johanssen's attention was elsewhere. Jake turned to follow his
gaze. Approaching them was a plump dark-haired girl who, it seemed, shared
Johanssen's predilection for pimples. She took a glass off the table and
lowered the ladle into the bowl. Johanssen grinned at her, displaying as
fine a set of teeth as was ever contained in two mouths. Assuming that
the sophisticated approach stood the best chance of success, he grinned
at her and said &quot;Well now, ain't you the purdy one!&quot;</P>

<P>She looked up, a non-committal expression on her face.</P>

<P>Johanssen snapped to attention and saluted. &quot;Cadet Willie Johanssen,
at y'r service, ma'm!&quot;</P>

<P>She continued to size him up, looking him over with a practiced eye.
Finally all the pieces came together and she made a decision. &quot;Say,
Cadet Willie Johanssen, you wouldn't just happen to have a chocolate bar
on you now, would you?&quot;</P>

<P>Johanssen's grin, in contravention of all the known laws of both physics
and dentistry, widened. He dug around in his pocket and pulled out a Three
Musketeers bar, somewhat limp but still recognisable, and offered it to
her.</P>

<P>She smiled the victorious smile of someone whose chocolate detection
system had, once again, passed a crucial battlefield test. &quot;So, Cadet
Willie Johanssen,&quot; she purred, taking the proffered gift and offering
him her arm, &quot;come and sit down and tell me all about yourself,&nbsp;
you big, strong military type man.&quot;</P>

<P>Johanssen took her arm and let her lead him off towards the benches
that had been set up along the side walls of the gym, looking back at Jake
over his shoulder with a look that screamed &quot;Got me a live one here,
Jakey boy!&quot;</P>

<P>Jake sighed. He looked over at the group of three girls who, by now,
had surrounded Junior. Junior was in full flight, miming a person climbing
a ladder, looking around, freezing, then blubbering. He looked back towards
Jake, indicating him with a flick of his head. The girls turned, stared
at Jake and burst out laughing. Jake sighed again and turned back towards
the punch bowl, intent on drowning his sorrows in the heady mix of orange
and pineapple juice. Canned cherries bobbed around in the bowl like putrefying
goldfish floating atop a stagnant aquarium.</P>

<P>Jake stared out across the gym, not seeing anything, not feeling anything,
not thinking anything, drifting along in merciful nothingness. A harsh
voice behind him startled him back to the present.</P>

<P>&quot;Why don't you watch where you're going, clumsy?&quot;</P>

<P>He spun around to see the group of three girls and Junior just as one
of the girls bumped into the back of another who'd just poured herself
a glass of punch, spilling it down her dress. The group walked off laughing.
The girl whose punch had spilled looked down at herself, sadly assessing
the damage.</P>

<P>Jake pulled a clean handkerchief out of his pocket and reached across
the punch bowl, offering it to her. &quot;Damn. I mean gosh, you know I&nbsp;think
she did that on purpose!&quot;</P>

<P>She looked up, sniffed back a tear, and gratefully accepted the handkerchief,
dabbing ineffectively at the spilled punch. &quot;Thanks,&quot; she said,
smiling wanly at him. &quot;They're always doing stuff like that.&quot;
Looking down, she realised that the handkerchief wasn't going to do much
good on the sticky juice. She looked back up at Jake. &quot;I'm going to
have to go into the Ladies room and try to rinse some of this out. Can
I...&quot; she looked down at the handkerchief.</P>

<P>Jake caught himself staring. &quot;Wha...oh...uh..yeah - of course!&quot;
He smiled at her.</P>

<P>&quot;Thanks.&quot; she said, distractedly returning his smile and striding
damply off towards the ladies' washroom.</P>

<P>Jake stared after her, mesmerised by the way her shoulder-length honey
blond hair moved as she walked. The unmistakeable bray of Johanssen's laugh,
followed immediately by a horse cackle from his new companion made him
turn back towards the dance floor where groups of cadets and their partners
were performing a Texas Twostep which Johanssen obviously found hilarious.
Jake watched with a combination of envy and ennui.</P>

<P>&quot;That's a little better, but your handkerchief's soaked I'm afraid.&quot;</P>

<P>He turned to see the girl standing behind him.</P>

<P>&quot;I think I got the worst of the punch out. It's only water now.
I'll wash your handkerchief and get it back to you if that's okay.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Handkerchief? What? Oh, yeah, no problem.&quot; Jake felt a familiar
sensation of heat ascending his face, but this time without any of the
familiar feelings of loathing that accompanied it.</P>

<P>She smiled again. &quot;I'm Amanda. Amanda Phillips.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake stared at hazel-green eyes. &quot;Amanda.&quot; he breathed.</P>

<P>Her smile turned to a grin. &quot;And you're...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Amanda.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No, I'm Amanda. You're...&quot; She waited, slowly nodding encouragingly.</P>

<P>Jake shook himself. &quot;JAKE!&quot; He shouted then, realising what
he'd done, said &quot;Jake Morgendorffer. I mean...&quot; he snapped to
attention as Johanssen had done. &quot;Cadet Jake Morgendorffer at your
service, Ma'm!&quot;</P>

<P>She politely stifled a chuckle. &quot;It's a pleasure to meet you Jake.
And it's Amanda, not Ma'm.&quot;</P>

<P>By this time Jake was doing a passable imitation of a beet. &quot;Oh,&quot;
he stammered. &quot;Oh, the pleasure's all...mine.&quot; He forced himself
to regain some composure. &quot;I'm sorry about your dress. I&nbsp;hope
it isn't...um...damaged.&quot;</P>

<P>Amanda looked down at her dress again then back at Jake. &quot;No, it'll
be alright, but it's uncomfortable.&quot; She looked around for an open
door. &quot;Maybe we could go outside. There's a breeze. It might help
me to dry off.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake tried to stop himself from looking around to see who was behind
him, not quite believing that Amanda was talking to him. He swallowed noisily
again. &quot;Outside? Can we go outside?&quot; he looked around the gym.
&quot;I mean are we allowed to? I thought we had to stay in here.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;There's a balcony over there.&quot; She indicated a door. &quot;There's
always a nun standing guard out there but at least it's outside.&quot;
</P>

<P>Like Johanssen's friend had done, she offered Jake her arm. He looked,
half-understanding what was expected of him, but too dumbfounded to move.
Amanda smiled again, took his hand and put it on her arm, then led him
to the balcony. The mid-January night was cool and clear, a high waning
gibbous moon washed out the stars and a light breeze blew from the south..
At the far end of the balcony a nun sat under a light reading a black-bound
Bible with one eye while she watched out for potential sin with the other.
The noise from the gym was muted out here and they walked up to the steel
railing that surrounded the low concrete balcony. Steps leading down to
the school grounds had been roped off to prevent escape, but the sounds
from inside provided enough background for them to feel a sense of modest
privacy providing they spoke quietly.</P>

<P>Jake broke out into a sweat. <I>Say something, dammit,</I> his mind
urged, but his mouth refused to co-operate. Finally he forced out the first
line he could think of. &quot;Do you come here often?&quot;</P>

<P>Amanda again stifled a laugh. &quot;I go to school here. Actually, I
live here too. I'm a boarder.&quot;</P>

<P>The weight of his inadequacy descended on Jake like a cartoon anvil
on an animated coyote. He deflated, and with the realisation that both
he and Amanda were wasting their time, he lost his nervousness. He looked
straight at her, his face showing his disappointment. &quot;I'm sorry,&quot;
he said quietly. &quot;I can't do this.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Can't do what, Jake? I don't understand.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I can't pretend to be...I don't know. Anything. I&nbsp;mean I
know that I should make witty conversation, or be charming, or funny, or
manly, or something like that, but I&nbsp;can't and I'm not. Ellenbogen's
right. I'm a pussy.&quot; He turned towards the door. &quot;Come on. It's
cold out here and you're wet. You should go and talk to your friends. I'll
keep the punch bowl company until it's time to go.&quot;</P>

<P>She reached out and took his arm, stopping him from walking off. &quot;Jake,
I didn't want you to be any of those things! I just wanted to talk to you.
Besides...&quot; That sadness crossed her face again. &quot;I don't have
any...&quot; A light dawned. &quot;Um, you don't get to talk to girls much,
do you?&quot;</P>

<P>His face fell further. &quot;I guess it's obvious.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It is a little.&quot; She wrapped her arms around herself and
shivered. &quot;Brr, you're right, Jake. It is cold.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake started. &quot;Oh darn - what was I&nbsp;thinking! I'm sorry!&quot;
He slipped his jacket off and put it round her shoulders. </P>

<P>She wrapped the coat around her shoulders and looked up at him. &quot;Thanks,
but now you're going to be cold.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, I'm fine. I don't feel the cold,&quot; he lied. &quot;But
what happened in there with the punch? Why did that girl bump into you?
She did it on purpose didn't she?&quot;</P>

<P>Amanda turned to look out over the railing, across the school. &quot;Sandra.
She's been like that to me since I started here. She's one of the 'popular'
girls - you know the type. They pick on anyone who isn't part of the 'in'
crowd, who don't share their obsession with fashion and dating. I guess
I'm one of her favourite punching bags. I've never really felt like I belonged
here.&quot; Jake couldn't see her face, but heard the change in her voice,
and he felt what she felt.</P>

<P>&quot;I&nbsp;can't believe that,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;How could
anybody not like you?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I guess it's easy. If you don't fit in with the way everyone else
thinks, you end up being the butt of the jokes. I don't suppose you'd understand.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Understand? Oh God! I mean Oh Gosh! You've just described me!
Did you see that guy with them?&quot; She nodded, surprised at the animation
in his voice. &quot;That's Andrew Jackson Macarthur Ellenbogen Jr. He's
the son of the bas...the guy who made the speech. Between the two of them
they've made my life miserable since I got sent to that rotten, stinking,
lou...&quot; He caught himself and blushed again. &quot;Oh damn...I mean
darn...I'm sorry.&quot;</P>

<P>She laughed and smiled at him, nodding towards the nun who had raised
both eyes to glare at Jake. &quot;I don't mind, but I think you'd better
tone it down a little. Sister Assumpta's about to blow a fuse.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake looked round and grinned nervously at Sister Assumpta. &quot;Pardon
me, Sister. It won't happen again.&quot;</P>

<P>Sister Assumpta stared over the top of her spectacles. &quot;I should
hope not, young man! One can be expressive without being offensive, and
particularly without taking the Lord's name in vain!&quot; she said in
a voice that was surprisingly free of malice, then looked down at her bible
again.</P>

<P>Amanda stared past Jake to where the nun sat in the cold light of the
lamp. &quot;She's actually very nice - my art teacher. She's been the only
person here who I actually think of as a friend.&quot; She looked up at
Jake. &quot;We've got something in common I guess.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hey! I guess we have!&quot; Jake grinned, relaxing a little. </P>

<P>He listened to Amanda talk about how Sister Assumpta had nurtured her
love of art, amazed at the way she described the sensuous feel of wet clay
on the wheel beneath her fingers. Sometimes, she said, it made her feel
as if a living thing was taking shape in her hands. She felt the genuineness
of Jake's empathy when she described how the other girls teased and bullied
her because she didn't care about clothes or boys, or how she'd rather
read a book than go to the movies. He told her about his father, Mad Dog,
about how he hated military school, how he hated Junior and his father
and everything they stood for. She told him about the school, pointing
to the building across from the gym. &quot;See the second window on the
left down the bottom?&quot; He nodded. &quot;That's my room.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You have your own room? Wow! We have dormitories with 40 kids
each in them! Your parents must be rich!&quot;</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">She laughed in surprise. &quot;No! Nothing like
it. We live in the next county, about three hours away by bus. When I started
here I used to be a day girl. I'd get up at four in the morning and get
home at eight at night. I was so tired when I got home that I'd just go
to bed. They could have sent me to a closer school, but Dad wanted me to
go to a Catholic school and Saint Agnes's was the closest school big enough
for me to study art. Dad works really long hours to pay for me to board.
The rooms are tiny. They used to be nuns' cells.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P>&quot;Cells?&quot; exclaimed Jake. &quot;This was a jail? For nuns?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No!&quot; She chuckled. &quot;It was a convent. Cells was what
they called the rooms that the nuns slept in. They're really only big enough
for a bed and a desk, but they let us have some posters on the wall.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh. Well, you're still lucky. We don't get any privacy at all.&quot;
Bitterness crept into his voice. &quot;I hate it.&quot;</P>

<P>Amanda started as she felt a hand on her shoulder. She turned to see
the face of Sister Assumpta. &quot;It's almost ten thirty, dear. I know
you haven't noticed, but your friend here has been shivering for the last
half hour. Perhaps you'd both better go in and warm up before the boys
have to leave.&quot;</P>

<P>Amanda looked at Jake with horror. &quot;Oh Jake - I'm so sorry!&quot;
She slipped his jacket off and handed it back to him, then turned to Sister
Assumpta. &quot;Thank you Sister.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, I'm sure your young friend hadn't noticed. You two have been
lost to the world. Now go in and get warm.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake slipped on his jacket. He hadn't noticed how cold he was until
she'd mentioned it. &quot;Thanks Sister,&quot; he grinned as they walked
towards the door. Sister Assumpta smiled and nodded in acknowledgement.
&quot;She's pretty cool for a nun. Are you dry?&quot;</P>

<P>Amanda nodded. &quot;I've been dry for an hour.&quot; She stopped and
turned to Jake. &quot;I've really enjoyed talking to you, Jake. Do you...I
mean...do you think we could...?&quot;</P>

<P>Jake swallowed noisily again. He couldn't believe what he was hearing
and the easy rapport between them vanished as quickly as it had come. He
blushed. &quot;Do you mean...could we...?&quot;</P>

<P>Amanda felt herself blushing, but she steeled herself. &quot;Could we
get together again some time? I&nbsp;mean do they let you out?&quot;</P>

<P>Jake felt an odd sensation in the pit of his stomach. &quot;Yeah. Yeah
- we get free time on Saturdays. Maybe we could...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Maybe we could meet for a soda or something? On the Saturday after
school gets back from Christmas break?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Do you know Gilberts? The malt shop on Manson Street?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Next to the drug store? Sure&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Uh, how about midday Saturday? Could you be there?&quot;</P>

<P>She nodded. &quot;Uh huh.&quot;</P>

<P>There was a pause as they stared uncertainly at each other. Finally,
Jake looked up at the clock. &quot;We've got another half hour. Do you
want to sit down?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Sure.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake looked around, saw some space next to Johanssen and his friend
and started walking over to it, Amanda walking beside him. As they moved,
their hands brushed. Though neither of them could remember later who had
made the first move, when they sat down they were holding hands.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="25%"></P>

<P>Amanda watched the bus leave, too focused on the disappearing tail lights
to notice that Sister Assumpta was standing beside her.</P>

<P>&quot;I get the impression you like him.&quot;</P>

<P>Amanda kept her eyes on the bus's tail lights as it turned the corner
at the end of the street, hoping that the darkness was concealing the colour
in her face. &quot;He's nice.&quot;</P>

<P>Sister Assumpta&nbsp; smiled gently, looking at the way Amanda was holding
Jake's now dry handkerchief tightly in her hand. &quot;I hope you'll be
able to convince him to tone down his damn language,&quot; she deadpanned.</P>

<P>Amanda spun round to stare at the nun, her mouth open in shock. It was
the first time she'd ever heard any of the sisters swear, but the sparkle
in Sister Assumpta's eyes gave her away, and they burst out laughing.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="25%"></P>

<P>The rest of Jake's week passed in a haze, much of it filled with visions
of Amanda. Johanssen was as taken with Hilda as Jake was with Amanda, but
there the similarity ceased. Where Jake was tongue-tied when he tried to
talk about Amanda, so he tended not to, Johanssen would bray continuously
about Hilda's endearing qualities.</P>

<P>&quot;I tell ya, Jakey, she's one fine mess o' woman. Man! Did you see
the way she attacked that chocolate bar? Like a hound on a prime rib! My,
but that was a fine site t' see!&quot;</P>

<P>Jake couldn't help smiling at Johanssens' enthusiasm. He leaned over
the side of the bunk to see Johanssen lying back with his hands behind
his head and a grin wide enough to contain most of his teeth. &quot;So
what is it with you and, uh, ample women, Johanssen? I mean you're as skinny
as a rake. What is it? Attraction of opposites?&quot;</P>

<P>Johanssen turned to look up at Jake's upside down face. &quot;Well lemme
tell ya, Jake. Before my daddy packed me off t' Buxton Ridge he took me
aside and he said to me 'Willy,' he said - he always called me Willy, 'cause
of that's m' name -'Willy,' he said, 'when the time comes for ya to find
yerself a wife, take my advice, son. Find yourself a woman who likes her
food. It's a sure thing that woman as likes her food's gonna be a good
cook. And son,' sometimes he called me 'son', too, 'Son,' he said, 'there
ain't nothin' as is more important in a wife than bein' a good cook.' An'
Jake, I always listened to what m' daddy told me. He was fine man, m' Pa,
God rest his soul.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;So your Mom was a good cook?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;A good cook? Haw haw!&quot; Johanssen brayed. &quot;A good cook?
Jake, my Ma couldn't cook t' save herself. I mean look at me! If Ma could
cook do you think I'd be skinny as last year's scarecrow now? Oh no. I'm
sure it was Ma's cookin' that sent daddy off to a early grave. Not that
she didn't mean well, mind, but Lord, when we was young 'uns, Pa used ta
use her hotcakes fer shoe leather, an' I'll tell ya Jake, our shoes just
used ta last an' last. Haw. Good cook! That's rich!&quot; But he caught
himself and looked at Jake seriously. &quot;Don't get me wrong, Jakey -
I love m' Ma - she just cain't cook fer nuts. Never could.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake could never tell whether Johanssen was joking or not, but there
was no doubt that he was as happy as a man could be at having met Hilda.</P>

<P>&quot;So, Jake, what I did was, I decided to always carry a chocolate
bar around with me, 'cause it seemed t' me that a woman who liked her food'd
be pleased t' see a man who came prepared for a famine, and Lord, didn't
that pay off, I swear!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You'd better stock up then.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I'm way ahead o' ya, Jakey.&quot; He grinned, got up and opened
his footlocker, and triumphantly pulled out a carton of two dozen Three
Musketeers bars and another of Snickers. &quot;So who'd a' thunk it, eh,
Jakey boy? You an' me gettin' lucky on the same night! That Amanda, she's
a pretty one alright. Too skinny fer my likin' o' course, but pretty all
the same.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake lay back and sighed. &quot;For the first time in my life someone
actually likes me for who I am. I don't have to try to be something I'm
not with her.&quot; He looked back over the edge of the bunk. &quot;I think
I love her, Willy.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Couldn't a' guessed in a million years, Jakey, not in a million
years! Haw haw.&quot;</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="25%"></P>

<P>Most of next week was taken up with pre-Christmas preparations and the
routine relaxed a little.&nbsp; </P>

<P>The Wednesday before Christmas break was traditionally given to the
cadets to go into town to get any last-minute Christmas shopping done.
For Jake it was traditionally a time of resentment and anger and the older
he got the worse it was. The older he got the less he could accept that
giving presents at Christmas was something you just did, and the more he
understood it was something you did for people you cared about. Did he
care about Mad Dog? Oh yeah. He cared alright. He cared enough to fantasize
about how good it would be when he died. He cared enough to understand
that his mother was afraid of his father so much that she could never take
Jakey's side, but had to support Mad Dog. For fear of what he'd do to her?
He loved his mother. She was the only source of love he'd ever known, though
fear of Mad Dog tempered that love. He could buy something for his mother.
Not much of course. His allowance was small, but he didn't have anything
to spend it on most of the time so he managed to save most of it. But buy
something for Mad Dog? How much was hemlock? Wasn't that what that Greek
guy drank when he committed suicide? Was death by hemlock poisoning painful?
He hoped so. Could you buy hemlock from the druggist? Gift wrapped? </P>

<P>&quot;Here Dad, this is for you.&quot; </P>

<P>&quot;Hemlock? Gee, thanks Son. I'll drink it now.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah. You do that, Dad. Drink up, Shriner.&quot;</P>

<P>The shopping trip ended, as it had these past few years, with a pair
of socks for Mad Dog and a handkerchief for his Mom, gift wrapped at the
store with a little card on each, printed with a snowy Christmas scene
and the words &quot;To:&quot; and &quot;From:&quot; with space for writing
the names. On the socks he wrote &quot;Dad&quot; and &quot;Jake&quot;,
on the handkerchief &quot;Mom&quot; and &quot;Jakey, with love.&quot; He
felt as empty as the the gesture.</P>

<P>By Thursday afternoon most of the cadets had packed their bags ready
for the break. On Friday morning some would be picked up by their parents,
some would take taxis to the airport and some, like Jake and Willy, would
take the bus to the train station.</P>

<P>They were sitting around quietly, each with his own thoughts, when Corporal
Ellenbogen opened the door and walked in followed by a gust of cold wind.
The cadets jumped off their bunks but Ellenbogen growled &quot;At ease&quot;
and strode over to Jake, who, by then, was standing at the foot of his
bunk. Ellenbogen handed Jake an envelope.</P>

<P>&quot;Letter from your Father, Morgendorffer.&quot; said Ellenbogen.
A shot of adreneline coursed though Jake's system. Ellenbogen never spoke
quietly.</P>

<P>Jake took the envelope, addressed to Corporal Ellenbogen, and took out
the small note inside.</P>

<P><I>Corporal,</I></P>

<P><I>Don't send my son home this Christmas. His mother and I will be visiting
her family in Toronto.</I></P>

<P><I>T. E. &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Morgendorffer</I></P>

<P>Jake looked up at Corporal Ellenbogen. &quot;But...&quot; he stammered.</P>

<P>&quot;You're a big disappointment to your father, Morgendorffer.&quot;
Ellenbogen growled. He turned and strode out, leaving Jake holding the
note, staring at the space that the Corporal's face had occupied seconds
before.</P>

<P>&quot;Jakey?&quot;</P>

<P>Without looking round Jake passed the note back to Willy.</P>

<P>&quot;Visiting your Ma's folks in Toronto? I didn't know your Ma had
folks in Toronto.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;She doesn't. Her family's from Saint Paul Minnesota.&quot;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&quot;But what...oh. So what...?&quot;</P>

<P>Jake climbed up on his bunk again. &quot;Simple. They don't want me
to come home for Christmas. I think they'd be happiest if I never came
back.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Damn, Jakey. I just can't figure that yer folks wouldn't want
y' at home at Christmas. I'm real sorry, man.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake looked inside himself and found nothing. &quot;I'm not.&quot; He
peered down over the edge of the bunk. &quot;You know, I don't even think
I&nbsp;care. In fact maybe it's a good thing.&quot;</P>

<P>Johanssen looked into Jake's face. &quot;No, man! No. How can that be
good? You should love yer Ma and Pa, and they should love you. It ain't
right. I'm real, real sorry.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake lay back on his bunk &quot;I've told you what it's like, Willy.&quot;
His voice was neutral.</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah. I know, Jakey. I'm still sorry though.&quot;</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="25%"></P>

<P>On Friday morning the dormitory emptied. Jake lay back on his bunk,
ignoring the bustle and being ignored by it. Everyone knew the story, but
they were either too embarrassed to mention it or, more likely, just didn't
care.</P>

<P>Before he left Willy stood by Jake's bunk and held out his hand. Jake
took it and they shook. &quot;Merry Christmas Jakey. See you real soon
eh?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Merry Christmas Willy. Have fun.&quot; They dropped hands. &quot;This
is the first Christmas you'll spend without your Pa, isn't it?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah.&quot; He paused. &quot;Yeah, it is. It's gonna be hard on
Ma.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I'm sorry Willy. Wish her merry Christmas from me, will you.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I will Jakey. See y' in a few days, ok?&quot;</P>

<P>Jake managed a smile. &quot;OK. See you, Willy.&quot;</P>

<P>He watched Willy walk out and heard the bus pull away a few minutes
later. The last of the cadets left and closed the door. </P>

<P>Jake was no stranger to aloneness. Nevertheless, the emptiness of the
dorm seemed to close in on him, the void outside mocking the void inside.
If he'd felt sorrow or anger he would have felt...normal. But he was empty.
Filled with nothingness.</P>

<P>The days that followed were his. No-one bothered him. A skeleton staff
stayed on at the Academy to look after the resident teaching and grounds
staff. He picked up his meals from the refectory and could eat them there
or in the dorm, though he usually ate alone in the refectory because it
was less trouble. Sometimes he sensed that the kitchen staff felt sorry
for him, but the more he thought about the horrors of another Christmas
at home, with Mad Dog using every opportunity to tell him what a disappointment
he was, the better he felt about being at school. Sometimes he'd walk around
the grounds. A river - more of a wide stream - ran past the south boundary
and on into the town. Sometimes he'd sit and watch the water, letting his
thoughts drift with the ripples, and he found, more often than not, they
turned to Amanda.</P>

<P>Christmas day was a Monday and it passed like all the other days except
that there was Turkey with cranberry sauce and gravy and sweet potato pie
for dinner. On Wednesday there was a card for him, waiting at the place
he always sat, though he had the run of the tables. He didn't recognise
the writing, but the spelling made him suspect who it was from. He opened
the envelope, ignoring the smiling snowman and Santa Clause on the front.</P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">Jakey,</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">Im sorry that you didnt get home for Christmas.
I told Ma what you said. She cried. She wanted me to bring you some of
the Christmas cake she made but I told her you were alergick to cake. Its
ok - you dont have to thank me. We visited Pas grave on Christmas Day.
Im real sorry hes gone. I wish you could of had a Pa like mine Jakey.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">I hope your feeling ok. Im sure looking forward
to seeing Hilda when I get back. I guess your looking forward to seeing
Amanda to. Maybe if you think a lot about her you wont feel bad.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">Merry Christmas.</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">Your friend Willy</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Jake never decided, even years afterward, whether
the tears were for himself or for Willy and his Mom.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">But Willy was right. Jake's thoughts were increasingly
filled with Amanda. And it was good.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">On Tuesday, January 2nd the kids returned, happy,
refreshed, with Christmas presents to show off and talk about. Jake was
glad to see them back though none of them, with the exception of Willy,
took any notice of him, nor he of them. They just filled some of the emptiness.
By the end of the week things were, relatively, back to normal. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">And then it was Saturday.</FONT></P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="25%"></P>

<P>A dozen cadets filed out of the bus as it pulled up in the main street
and went their separate ways. Half of them - including, to Jake's chagrin,
Junior - headed in the direction of Gilbert's Malt Shop.</P>

<P>Before the door had closed behind them Joahnssen dug Jake in the ribs
with his elbow, nodding towards a booth about half way down on the left.
Hilda was facing the door and as soon as she caught sight of them she spoke
eagerly to the person sitting opposite her, identifiable only by a blond
head visible over the seat back. Hilda grinned and beckoned. Johanssen
strode over to the booth and slid in beside Hilda, flashing her a smile
that would have been a yard wide if all his teeth had been lined up together.
Jake approached more cautiously. Amanda turned toward him and smiled. Jake
froze, unable to work out where the music was coming from. Choirs of angels
seemed an unlikely choice for a malt shop jukebox and, come to think of
it, he didn't remember having seen a jukebox. Instead of the shapeless
dress she'd been wearing on Wednesday night she was dressed simply in faded
jeans, a light pale blue cotton print top gathered at the neck, her hair
tied back with a pale blue ribbon matching her top. A small, plain gold
crucifix hung from a fine chain around her neck. If Jake could have spoken
at that moment he would have said &quot;Take me, Lord, I'm ready to go.&quot;</P>

<P>He slid in beside her as Johanssen turned to Hilda and said &quot;Close
yer eyes and hold out yer hand, sweetie pie.&quot; Hilda giggled and obeyed.
Johanssen pulled a Snickers bar out of his pocket and put it in her open
hand. She opened her eyes, looked down and grinned at him. &quot;Why, Willy
Johanssen, you sure know the way to a girl's heart.&quot;</P>

<P>He looked at her and lowered his voice about two octaves, doing a fair
Elvis impersonation. &quot;There's plenty more where that came from, sugar.&quot;
The other three burst out laughing.</P>

<P>Jake turned back to Amanda, all the ease of the other night forgotten.
&quot;It's see to good you.&quot; he breathed. &quot;I mean good to see
you. Dammit!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Haw haw, nice one Jakey!&quot; laughed Johanssen. &quot;Now where's
yer manners, boy!&quot; He turned between Hilda and Amanda. &quot;What
would you two lovely ladies like? I&nbsp;hear tell the banana splits here
are real good!&quot;</P>

<P>Hilda slid a glass bowl with a spoon and remnants of ice cream in front
of him. &quot;Not bad at all.&quot; Then, in response to the unasked question,
&quot;We've been waiting half an hour for you boys. A girl could starve.&quot;</P>

<P>Willy looked at the bowl, then at Hilda. &quot;Starve? Sugar, forgive
me f' neglectin' your needs so bad. What was I thinkin'? So what'll it
be ladies?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah!&quot; exclaimed Jake, pleased that Willy had taken the initiative.
&quot;What'll it be?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I'm not so hungry after that banana split,&quot; said Hilda. &quot;I'll
just have a double chocolate double malted and a slice of blueberry pie
with extra whipped cream.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Why sure, honeybunch. And you, pretty lady?&quot;</P>

<P>Amanda stifled a laugh. &quot;Just a cherry Coke for me.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake grinned. &quot;Cherry Coke? Hey! I love cherry too! Cherry's my
favourite!&quot;</P>

<P>A burst of laughter from the next booth drew Jake's attention to the
fact that Junior, Sandra, and her two friends were sitting behind them.</P>

<P>&quot;Ooh - please take my cherry, Jakey,&quot; squeaked Junior, falsetto.
Then, in a fair imitation of Jake, &quot;Sure! I just loooove cherry!&quot;
Another peal of laughter rose from the booth.</P>

<P>Jake felt a wave of fury pass over him. Bullying him was one thing,
but he wasn't going to stand by and listen to that bastard insulting Amanda.
His face turned red with anger and he started to slide out of the booth
when he felt Johanssen's hand clutch his arm. He turned to see Johanssen
shaking his head.</P>

<P>&quot;Don't get into the cage with the monkeys, Jake.&quot; he murmured.
&quot;It ain't worth it. If you think you're embarrassed now, just try
goin' for Junior.&quot;</P>

<P>Amanda reached out and gently took his other arm. &quot;Please Jake,
it's alright. They're bad enough already. They'll make life even worse
if we react. Maybe we could move to another booth.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake sat back down, his face still red, logic slowly getting the better
of anger. &quot;Yeah, I guess you're right. Come on - there's an empty
booth down there,&quot; nodding to the far end of the room. They rose,
and as they walked away one of the girls called after them &quot;Make love
not war, eh Amanda?&quot; and laughter rose again.</P>

<P>Jake started to turn, but immediately Amanda reached for his hand and
squeezed. Whether it was intentional or not it had the desired effect.
All the anger drained from Jake and an involuntary sigh escaped as his
body relaxed. Jake and Johanssen stopped to order while the girls slid
into the booth.</P>

<P>&quot;They're bad news, Jakey. The last thing either of us needs right
now is Junior - and that means his old man - gunnin' for us. A run-in with
Junior and we wouldn't get out on weekends for the rest of the year, an'
I dunno about you, but I want all the weekends I can get if y' take my
meanin'.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh - jeez - yeah. Thanks Johanssen. Damn - it's so hard though,
listening to that moron make fun of Amanda. I tell you Willy - if I ever
get the chance...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You'll shit in his shoes?&quot;</P>

<P>Jake grinned. Their order arrived and they took it back to the booth.
Johanssen unloaded the tray, took it back to the counter then eased in
next to Hilda, watching with pleasure as she attacked the blueberry pie
like a lioness tearing apart a particularly ripe wildebeest. &quot;Whooee!
I'm sure glad you had that banana split first, Honey, else I might o' had
to move afore you started in on me!&quot; Hilda shook with mirth and dug
him the ribs. </P>

<P>Willy's and Hilda's antics covered Jake and Amanda's awkwardness, but
under the table their hands met and, slowly, they moved closer together
until their bodies touched, unfamiliar sensations flowing and mingling.
</P>

<P>Amanda turned to face Jake. &quot;Maybe we could go for a walk?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;A walk? Uh, sure, good idea!&quot; Jake noticed that Willy had
slipped his arm around Hilda's shoulders. &quot;Er, would you mind...?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Mind?&quot; said Willy, grinning. &quot;Oh no. We wouldn't mind
at all, would we sweetie pie?&quot; Hilda shook her head. &quot;See you
back at the bus stop Jakey. Four o'clock sharp.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake grinned at Willy. &quot;I'll be there.&quot;</P>

<P>Hilda looked down at the two untouched cherry Cokes. &quot;You two ain't
gonna want those now, are you?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Be our guests,&quot; smiled Jake, and they walked out, hand in
hand. If there were any taunts from Junior's booth neither of them noticed.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="25%"></P>

<P>They walked slowly, talking, oblivious of their surroundings. Amanda
led them to a deserted park that sloped gently down to the river, grey
under leafless trees anticipating spring, and a January sun low in the
south that wouldn't give up its warmth for weeks to come. They sat on a
park bench overlooking last season's reeds, dead and brown, while under
the water's edge living buds slept dreaming vegetable dreams of light and
warmth. Though it was only two o'clock the air was getting crisp. Amanda
shivered. Jake put his arm around her shoulder for warmth and she hesitantly
slipped an arm around his waist under his jacket. They turned to face each
other, explorers, lost in silent and uncharted depths of brown and hazel-green.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="25%"></P>

<P>The January days passed, and two outcasts found belonging and strength
in each other. Their friendship was a barb that their tormentors prodded
them with mercilessly, but none of it seemed to work any more. Instead
of getting upset, or angry, or running off in tears, Amanda and Jake just
let it all wash over them, secure in the completeness they found in each
other. Weeks were only interludes between weekends but, freed from the
bonds of their otherness, their weeks improved and so did their school
performance. Instead of dwelling on the unfairness and resentment that
consumed him, Jake was able to concentrate on the task at hand. His grades
picked up and, while it was clear that his heart was never going to be
in military training, he didn't screw up quite as predictably. </P>

<P>Amanda had always been a good student, but Sister Assumpta saw a freshness
and inspiration in her art work that, in other circumstances, she might
have called passion.</P>

<P>They met in the malt shop every Saturday, shared a cherry Coke while
Willy and Hilda cemented their relationship over banana splits, blueberry
pies, Three Musketeers and Snickers bars. Amanda felt, at first, that their
relationships seemed so different - Willy and Hilda were always laughing
and joking while she and Jake had something that seemed more intense, a
bond based on shared experience of of mutual difference and social rejection.
But then she realised that the differences were probably superficial and,
in a way, she envied Willy and Hilda the lightness of their friendship.
But when the intensity was upon them she wouldn't have traded places with
anyone.</P>

<P>They'd walk to the park or, more often, stroll in the opposite direction
out of town past small farms with red barns and empty winter fields. Sometimes
they'd stop to talk to a palomino pony that would stroll across to the
fence when it saw them coming, hoping for an apple or a sugar cube or perhaps
just some company. Sometimes when they felt alone they kissed, the pressure
of their bodies a physical counterpart to a more subtle closeness. Before
they dared to say the word to each other, each of them recognised love
for what it was.</P>

<P>The season changed.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="25%"></P>

<P>Tuesday dawned like any other,<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"> </FONT>but it was
a day Jake had been dreading for a week. The obstacle course. Mostly it
was just a pain the butt. Jake knew that he'd never been particularly athletic
or even well co-ordinated, but he could cope with leaping through the tires
carrying his rifle, or crawling under the barbed wire, or walking across
logs across the muddy ditch. But there was one part of the course that
filled him with dread. The ropes. Ever since Mad Dog had dangled him over
the edge of the bridge by his ankles when he was five he'd been terrified
of heights. The thought of climbing the fifteen foot rope made him break
out in a cold sweat.</P>

<P>Morning classes usually dragged on forever but today they flew, conspiring
to bring on the afternoon. Lunch was over almost as soon as it began and
afternoon classes made the wink of an eye seem like an eternity. What made
the whole thing worse was that everyone else looked forward to the obstacle
course and had been chattering about it all day. When the last class ended
they had twenty minutes to get changed and down to the course carrying
replica rifles, weighted to simulate the real thing.</P>

<P>They lined up in ranks of five. Ellenbogen blew his whistle and the
first rank ran forward into the tire maze, high-stepping through thirty
yards of randomly placed tires, a task that needed concentration and agility
to avoid falling and, potentially, snapping an ankle. When the first group
cleared the maze and dived forward to crawl under the barbed wire, the
second group started. The barbed wire was set just high enough for them
to crawl on their bellies, heads down, for another thirty yards. Looking
up to see how far in you were always result in at least a painful scratch
on the head and the weight of the replica rifles made the crawl a difficult
and muscle-straining exercise. After that a muddy ditch had to be negotiated
by walking across a single strand of rope with two ropes on either side
as handrails. The first time it looked easy, but the slightest misstep
would start the bottom rope swaying and that would almost always lead to
a dunking. It was rumoured that the ditch had been the site of the original
Academy latrines and, though the staff never confirmed it if asked, they
never denied it either. Finally, five fifteen-foot high climbing ropes
dangled over a ditch also filled with the same muddy water. The idea was
to leap from the edge of the ditch, grab the rope and climb to the top,
then climb down and swing across to the other side.</P>

<P>Jake stared at the ropes at the far end of the course trying to force
himself to relax. Climbing up was tolerable - he could stare at the top
without looking down. But once he was there it was impossible to stop the
acrophobia from hitting, impossible to shut out the vision of the river
under the bridge...the turbid yellow-brown water rushing by thirty feet
below...a five-year-old's imagination...falling...hitting the water head
first...the current...impossibly strong...dragging him down...sinking...drowning...</P>

<P>Phweep</P>

<P>...</P>

<P>Phweeeeeeep</P>

<P>...</P>

<P>MORGENDORFFER!</P>

<P>Jake came to, seeing the other four already halfway through the tire
maze, and he dashed forward with the laughter of his platoon in his ears.
Through the tires, tripping once, getting up, diving under the barbed wire,
struggling to catch up, across the rope bridge and almost falling but just
recovering, then the rope. He leaped forward and grabbed it, swinging a
foot above the water. Staring up, hand over hand, ankles grasping the rope
as he went, higher, finally...the river...rushing by...his muscles clenched,
frozen...the current...a five-year-old's imagination...</P>

<P>The rest of the platoon rearranged themselves into ranks of four. When
the last group had gone through Ellenbogen stood staring at Jake dangling
from the rope, his eyes shut tight. &quot;Well, Morgendorffer, the other
cadets are gonna turn in - seems they're all tuckered out from laughing
at your cowardice. Guess I'll have to leave you here for the night. By
the way your father called and I told him all about it. He says don't bother
coming home for easter.&quot;</P>

<P>Ellenbogen walked off, ignoring the voice straining with fear behind
him, saying &quot;Help me&quot;.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">As the stars came out the pain of his cramped
fingers and arms - and the pain of his situation - became too much to bear.
Beyond the bridge and the muddy river, beyond the fear and the self-loathing
and the anger and the hatred that typified his life there was a glimmer,
a pinpoint of light in the dark.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">He painfully inched his way down the rope, his
muscles knotting in protest, and started swinging, kicking his legs out
to amplify the movement and, at just the right instant, let go and landed
on the other side of the ditch. He stood, panting, then made his way to
and over the wall and down the road towards town.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Gathering clouds scudded across the sky.</FONT></P>

<HR WIDTH="25%"></P>

<P>Jake arrived at Saint Agnes's in time to see the lights in the cells
go out. He waited in the shadows for ten minutes until clouds obscured
the moon and quietly crept up to the second window on the left, his heart
pounding, and he rapped with what he hoped was just enough force for Amanda
to hear, but not enough to rouse anyone else. Nothing. He tried again,
three slow taps. The curtain parted and Amanda looked out into the night
to find Jake's face staring at her. He was terrified that she was going
to shriek, but her fright at seeing a face at the window was averted by
instant recognition. She silently opened the window and hissed &quot;What
the hell are you doing here?&quot; She looked around, her eyes wild. &quot;Do
you know what kind of trouble we'd be in if...&quot; She looked at his
face and her anger melted away. &quot;I guess you do. What's wrong?&quot;
She glanced left and right.</P>

<P>Jake realised that simply seeing her was enough. She looked so beautiful
that he was lost for words, her hair untidy, her left hand clutching the
collar of her winter nightdress. All the urgency and the hurt had disappeared,
and he felt like a fool. &quot;I...I&nbsp;just wanted...I just wanted to
see you.&quot; He hung his head, ashamed that he'd taken such a risk, and
worse, made her take one too. &quot;I'll go. I'm sorry.&quot;</P>

<P>She looked down at him, silent for a few seconds, then whispered &quot;Wait
there.&quot; She closed the curtains. A minute later they opened again.
Slowly she lifted the window all the way up and swung a leg out, followed
by the other. He lifted her down. She'd pulled on a pair of jeans and sneakers
without socks, and put a coat on over her nightdress. &quot;Close the window,&quot;
she whispered. &quot;Not all the way - leave it open a little so that I
can get back in.&quot;</P>

<P>They looked round to make sure there was no-one about. Clouds still
covered the moon and there were no lights on outside. She grabbed his hand
and led him through the darkest areas, crouching, around the front of the
gym and into the street, turning two streets down into the road the led
out of town, walking a couple of blocks to where the houses started to
thin until she hissed, quietly, &quot;What the hell is this all about Jake
Morgendorffer? You know this could get me expelled! Do you have any idea
how stupid this is?&quot;</P>

<P>Jake was already on the point of panic at the stupidity of what he'd
done and words, once again, failed him. His mouth opened and closed like
a fish blowing bubbles.</P>

<P>She stopped, turned, and looked at him. &quot;What happened Jake? Why?
What made you do it?&quot;</P>

<P>They walked on and he described his humiliation at dangling at the top
of the rope, his fellow cadets laughing at his fear while Ellenbogen chuckled,
and how, as he hung petrified, his muscles cramped and aching as the sun
set and the moon rose in the east, it was his decision to find her that
had given him the courage to climb down. He told her about how Mad Dog
had dangled him over the side of the bridge, screaming in terror until
he couldn't scream any more, how his father had given up and pulled him
back, white and trembling, disgusted at the five-year-old's cowardice,
and made Jake walk home alone along unfamiliar streets. Then, how, at the
sight of her at the window, all of it had gone, leaving him with nothing
but knowledge of his own stupidity and recklessness.</P>

<P>As he turned to suggest they go back the heavens opened. Fat raindrops
plopped onto the road around them. Amanda pulled her coat up over her head
and they ran down the road towards the only cover that they knew the now-familiar
road offered - the barn where the palomino pony lived, half a mile in front
of them. Soaked, Jake held the wires of the fence open for Amanda, who'd
given up trying to stay dry, to climb through, and he followed her in through
the barn doors which were mercifully open a crack. Inside it was pitch
black and they stood, dripping, cold and silent, while the downpour lashed
the barn, trickling through cracks in the roof.</P>

<P>A snort made Amanda jump and a squeak burst from her mouth when she
realised it was the pony in its stall, and they both laughed nervously.
&quot;Sorry fella,&quot; said Jake quietly. &quot;No apple tonight.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Jake, I'm freezing,&quot; Amanda shuddered, her teeth chattering.</P>

<P>&quot;There must be something we can wrap around ourselves, maybe some
blankets for the horse or something. Hold on. I'll see what I can find.&quot;</P>

<P>She stood there, shivering, while Jake felt his way along the wall,
trying to hold the lightening-bright image in his mind and being reminded,
every time he cracked his shin on something, how unreliable memory can
be. Finally he felt his way to the stall and felt the rails then, seconds
later, the warm, moist breath of the pony sniffing him in the hope that
he'd been teasing about the apple. Jake stroked the pony's nose and whispered
&quot;Have you got a blanket, boy? Would you mind if we borrowed it, just
until we get warm?&quot; The pony snorted again and Jake smiled through
the darkness, feeling along the rails. &quot;Bingo!&quot; he said as his
hand touched a rough woollen blanket thrown over the rail.</P>

<P>&quot;What have you found?&quot; came Amanda's voice out of the blackness.</P>

<P>&quot;A blanket. Can you make your way over here? There are some hay
bales that we can sit on. Be careful, there's a lot of stuff on the floor.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I'm coming.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake heard her shuffling along, completely invisible in the blackness,
and eventually felt her hand touch his head as it probed the way ahead.
He instinctively reached out to guide her and felt...</P>

<P>&quot;What the...?&quot;</P>

<P>She sounded annoyed. &quot;You weren't going to wrap us up in the blanket
in our wet clothes were you? Great idea, Jake! Why not just hold the blanket
out in the rain for a while? Get out of yours too - we'll hang them over
the rail so that we can find them again.&quot; He heard the sound a zipper.</P>

<P>&quot;But...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Your choice, Jake, modesty or pneumonia. It's not as if we can
see anything.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But...&quot;</P>

<P>She lifted the blanket off the rail. &quot;OK. Stay wet. You're not
getting under this in those wet clothes though.&quot; She felt around behind
her and found the hay bale and sat down. &quot;Arggh!&quot; she exclaimed,
jumping up again.</P>

<P>&quot;What happened? Are you okay?&quot; </P>

<P>&quot;Have you ever sat on a hay bale without any clothes on?&quot;</P>

<P>He grinned. &quot;Oh.&quot;</P>

<P>He gingerly took off his wet things and draped them over the rail. &quot;Okay.
Where are you?&quot;</P>

<P>She reached out a hand and touched his. &quot;Oh God, you're freezing.&quot;
She spread the blanket over the bale and guided him to sit beside her,
then she pulled the blanket up around them. As it tightened, their arms
touched. &quot;Eeww. Cold! Wet!&quot;</P>

<P>He jerked away from her. &quot;Sorry. Wow! You're warm.&quot;</P>

<P>She gently put an arm around his waist and pulled him close.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="25%"></P>

<P>Jake woke an indeterminate time later. The storm had passed and the
full moon shone through the cracks in the roof and reflected through the
window.</P>

<P>Amanda was breathing deeply and slowly, her head on his shoulder, one
leg across his and her arm across his chest. In the moonlight he could
see her face, every detail clear but soft in the diffuse light. A few whisps
of hair fell across her face and his eyes traced the line of her cheekbones
back to the pale curve of her neck, soft down visible just below her hairline.
The blanket had fallen off her shoulder and he slowly pulled it up, trying
not to wake her. She stirred and pulled herself closer to him and, involuntarily,
he hugged back. She opened her eyes and looked at him, the faintest of
smiles playing across her lips. &quot;What time is it?&quot;</P>

<P>He brought his arm out from beneath the blanket and stared hard at the
luminous hands of his watch. &quot;Quarter past twelve.&quot;</P>

<P>She kissed him on the cheek. &quot;Happy Valentine's day, sweet Jake.&quot;</P>

<P>He drowned in a flood of emotion, his eyes brimming.</P>

<P>She drew back a little to bring him into focus. &quot;Jake? Are you
alright?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I'm alright.&quot; He took a deep, ragged breath. &quot;I'm alright
for the first time in my life.&quot; He traced the line of her lips with
his finger and she gently kissed it. &quot;You're like...like all the beautiful
things that have ever been, come together in one place, in one person.
I can't believe that you've happened to me.&quot;</P>

<P>She snuggled into him again.</P>

<P>&quot;None of it matters now. Not Ellenbogen, not Mad Dog. None of it.&quot;
He looked over at her eyes. &quot;Amanda?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I love you.&quot;</P>

<P>She lifted herself onto one elbow and looked down into his eyes, then
slowly brought her lips down to his.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="25%"></P>

<P>&quot;We'd better go. What time is it now?&quot;</P>

<P>He peered at the watch dial again. &quot;Two thirty.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I hate the thought of getting back into those wet clothes.&quot;
She sat up reluctantly. </P>

<P>Jake sighed. &quot;It's going to be colder than it was earlier. If you
run you can be back in twenty minutes.&quot;</P>

<P>Her breath steamed in the cold air. &quot;Oh God. When I get out from
under I'm going to have to put my clothes on and run or I'll freeze. You'll
have to do the same thing.&quot; She lay back down, pulled the blanket
over her and snuggled up to him one last time. </P>

<P>After a few minutes she reluctantly got up. He stared, speechless, overwhelmed.
She muttered as she pulled on the wet clothes, then turned to him before
she left. &quot;Come on, Jake. You've got farther to go than I&nbsp;have.
Get up.&quot;</P>

<P>He did, and she stared, as he had. He stood still as she slowly approached
and leaned forward, avoiding getting him wet, and kissed him. &quot;Saturday?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Saturday.&quot;</P>

<P>She turned and was gone. He heard her footsteps as she ran off down
the road. Her presence faded and Jake felt himself fading with it, as if
he was becoming insubstantial. He wanted her back desperately. He wanted
to lie under the blanket with her forever - thoughts of Buxton Ridge, Corporal
Ellenbogen, Junior, and Mad Dog banished for eternity by the warmth of
her soft body. &quot;Amanda...&quot;</P>

<P>The pony neighed, bringing Jake back to reality. He shivered, and reluctantly
pulled on his clothes, the wet, clammy fabric clinging to his skin. He
threw the blanket back over the rail, stroked the pony's nose, and left,
climbing through the fence and out onto the road, looking one last time
in the direction of town, knowing she was gone but hoping...</P>

<P>The moon shone brilliantly, washing out all but the brightest stars
and lighting the road and the landscape in frigid detail. He turned and
jogged off in the opposite direction to the one he so badly wanted to take,
back to purgatory.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="25%"></P>

<P>Amanda slowed as she neared the school. The run had left her warmer
but breathless and she knew she'd have to be able to hold her breath if
she was to get in without being heard. In minutes she was shivering again.
The bright moonlight was going to make getting back in much trickier than
getting out had been. She crouched low and close to the buildings, taking
the long way around the back of the gym, hugging the shadows. The cold
was forgotten and her heart beat like a triphammer as she prised the window
up, placed her hands on the sill, and sprung from her toes. She leaned
forward into the room, her legs dangling as she silently slid onto the
floor. Picking herself up she turned round and cautiously peered between
the curtains. There was no-one. The room was silent. She breathed again
and closed the window.</P>

<P>She threw off her cold wet clothes and rummaged around in the drawer
for a dry nightdress. Slipping it over her head she climbed into bed, exhausted,
sore and cold, longing for a hot bath.</P>

<P>As sleep crept up on her she was filled with conflicting feelings of
guilt and joy, tingling with the memory of him, the feeling of the rough
blanket against her skin, the earthy smells of horse and last summer's
hay, his gentle, nervous touch, <I>You're like...like all the beautiful
things that have ever been, come together in one place, in one person.
I can't believe that you've happened to me.</I> She fell asleep to the
sound of his voice saying &quot;I love you.&quot;</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="25%"></P>

<P>Jake ran until he was out of breath, then slowed to a walk. But soon
the cold crept in and he picked up the pace, eventually finding a stride
that he could maintain and that kept him tolerably warm.</P>

<P>It took more than an hour to get back to Buxton Ridge and, like Amanda,
he slowed to catch his breath and think. At some point in the run he'd
dried off. How to get in? The front gate was easy, but he'd have to cross
an expanse of playing field and driveway to get to the dorm. He could cut
around to the eastern wall then skirt the parade ground. That might be
best - he could get straight up to the dorm that way without having to
pass any of the staff quarters. He wondered whether anyone had missed the
fact that he hadn't come in last night. If he came in now someone was sure
to hear him or see him. Once again he envied Amanda her own room.</P>

<P>The more he thought about it the more it seemed that the best idea was
to tough it out. Just walk in and say that he'd spent the night up the
rope, or wandering the grounds. They couldn't punish him for that could
they? After leaving him up there? Could they? Well yes, they could. Those
bastards could do any damn thing they wanted to - and they generally wanted
to where he was concerned. But it was the best idea he could think of.
He walked around to the eastern wall. The moon was still bright but it
was lower in the west now and there was shrubbery along the wall so, with
any luck, he should be able to get in without any problems. He chose a
spot where the bushes were high enough to hide him, slipped over the low
wall and walked along, crouching, until he could use the shadow of the
dormitory to cover him. He made his way quietly to the door - no sense
in waking anyone if he could avoid it and, besides, he was dog tired. If
he could catch a couple of hours sleep before reveille he might be able
to make it through the day.</P>

<P>The door opened silently and he tiptoed in, closing it behind him. The
floor creaked a couple of times but no-one stirred. He got to his bunk
without incident and reached up to get his pyjamas. Changing quietly wasn't
too hard since his clothes were dry and, finally ready, he threw his clothes
onto the top bunk and started to climb the ladder. At the second rung his
foot slipped and he fell with all the grace and subtlety of an elephant
with diarrhoea.</P>

<P>The dorm burst into life, yells of &quot;What was that?&quot;, &quot;Who...&quot;,
&quot;Arrgg&quot;, &quot;Morgendorffer?&quot;, &quot;Hey - Morgendorffer's
back!&quot;, &quot;Where the hell have you been Morgendorffer?&quot;. The
light went on and cadets surrounded him. He stared up into a sea of angry
faces. </P>

<P>He felt an arm behind his back helping him to sit up. &quot;Stand back
y' idiots - can't y' see he's hurt?&quot; Jake looked up into Willy's eyes
and saw the faintest of winks. It took him a second to realise what was
going on, but he caught on.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh - I mean ooooohhhh, my leeeeg!&quot; He writhed, clutching
his leg and wincing in pain.</P>

<P>&quot;I don't think it's broke. Mason - help me get him onto the bed!&quot;</P>

<P>A cadet bent down and he and Willy lifted Jake onto the bottom bunk.
The others muttered and swore, but slowly went back to bed. &quot;You'd
better have a good excuse Morgendorffer!&quot; more than one of them commented.
The lights went out.</P>

<P>As the sounds of snoring returned, Jake whispered &quot;Thanks Willy.
What the hell was that all about?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Man, you're in deep shit. Ellenbogen went out after sunset to
get you down off'n that rope but you weren't there. He had us out until
midnight searchin' the grounds for you. The guys were pissed I can tell
ya.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake felt sick.</P>

<P>&quot;Where were you, man?&quot;</P>

<P>He sighed, quietly. &quot;In a barn.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;In a what?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;In a barn. With Amanda.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;A barn? With Amanda? What in tarnation...?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Later Willy.&quot; He lay back and sighed again. &quot;I'm screwed.
Let me get an hour's sleep. And thanks.&quot;</P>

<P>Willy grinned. &quot;Okay, Jakey. I'll get into the top bunk. But man,
I'm lookin' forward t' hearin' <I>this</I> story!&quot;</P>

<P>Jake was asleep before Willy had climbed the ladder.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="25%"></P>

<P>Though he'd slept for an hour and a half it felt to Jake as if his eyes
had only just closed when reveille sounded and it all came back. He was
going to have to face Ellenbogen. He trudged to the showers, undressed
and walked into a stall, bracing himself as he turned on the cold water
first then added hot water until the temperature stabilised. As he showered
he wondered whether it might be better to face the ire of his squad than
Ellenbogen, but then he realised that his squad would only beat him to
a bloody pulp. Ellenbogen, on the other hand, could really hurt him. He
drifted off as the warm water splashed over him and the vivid image of
Amanda getting up from under the blanket in the moonlit barn blazed in
his mind's eye. How was it possible that, all the time his life had been
a non-stop disaster movie, the universe had held something as beautiful
as her?</P>

<P>&quot;MORGENDORFFER!&quot;</P>

<P>Jake's eyes snapped open painfully, revealing the sneering visage of
Corporal Andrew Jackson Macarthur Ellenbogen glaring at him. Even in his
befuddled state the irony of the scene change didn't escape him. Before
he could react, Ellenbogen snapped &quot;My office. Ten minutes.&quot;
and walked out. Jake quickly rinsed off, dried and dressed, wondering all
the while what difference it would make if he was late. Could things be
any worse?</P>

<P>He tied his tie as he walked into the administration block and up to
Ellenbogen's office. Bracing himself, he knocked.</P>

<P>&quot;Come in Morgendorffer&quot; came the feared voice, low and quiet,
like a cheetah crouching to spring. He opened the door and walked in.</P>

<P>Corporal Ellenbogen watched him enter as if he was trying to decide
which limb to remove first. He gestured to Jake to sit in one of the bentwood
chairs that faced his desk. Jake sat, waiting. Ellenbogen continued to
stare silently, his expression blank, as if he was looking at a particularly
interesting beetle, or a side of beef he was considering serving to his
dobermans. Finally he spoke.</P>

<P>&quot;You surprise me, Morgendorffer.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;S...sir?&quot; Jake stammered.</P>

<P>&quot;I suppose you know that I went out to get you down from the rope.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Y...yes sir.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But you weren't up the rope, were you Morgendorffer?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No sir.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Got the whole dormitory out looking for you, Morgendorffer. Searched
the grounds, searched the buildings.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes sir.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But you weren't in the grounds, were you Morgendorffer?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;N...no sir.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Where were you?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I...I...went for a...walk, sir.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You went for a walk.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes sir.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Mmmm.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Sir?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I mean it's not your style, is it Morgendorffer? Your style's
more the foetal curl, whimpering, crying for Mommy.&quot; He stood up,
walked round to the front of the desk and sat, looking down at Jake. &quot;But
this time, you got down all by yourself and you went for a walk. Where
did you go, Morgendorffer? Into town?&quot;</P>

<P>Jake couldn't work out where this was leading. &quot;No sir. I went
the other way sir.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Mm. Out of town eh?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes sir.&quot;</P>

<P>Ellenbogen waited. &quot;It rained.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes sir.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Get wet, did you?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes sir.&quot; Jake shuddered inside. <I>He knows</I>.</P>

<P>&quot;What did you do?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I, um, sheltered under some trees.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Trees?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes sir. Er - oaks I think, sir.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Must have been cold.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes sir. I...um...I ran for a while after the rain stopped. To
get warm. And dry.&quot;</P>

<P>Ellenbogen stared at him. Jake was sure that any moment he was going
to pull out a large manila envelope, open it, and show Jake the photographs.
That was how it happened, wasn't it? <I>What's it worth to you Morgendorffer?</I>
he'd say. <I>How much to stop me from showing these to your parents? How
much to stop me showing them to HER parents?</I></P>

<P>&quot;It's an improvement, Morgendorffer.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Er, an improvement, sir?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Mmm. There might be hope for you yet. I've seen signs of an improvement
in you over the last few weeks.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake breathed again. &quot;Um, thank you sir.&quot;</P>

<P>Ellenbogen stood again and walked around to face Jake.</P>

<P>&quot;I want you to work on those ropes, Morgendorffer. I want to see
you spend your spare time on them. Climb up a couple of feet and back down.
Get up a foot higher the next day. Take it in stages. Get over that acrophobia.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes sir. Thank you sir.&quot; <I>Damn. I'm going to get out of
it!</I></P>

<P>&quot;Don't think you're getting off lightly, Morgendorffer. If you
ever do something like this again I'll personally put my hand down your
throat and rip your lungs out. Understood?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes sir! I won't sir!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I want to see you at least half way up that rope in two weeks
time. Is that understood too?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes sir. Thank you sir!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Alright Morgendorffer. Dismissed.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake sprung to attention and saluted, then turned on his heel and walked
toward the door. As his hand touched the knob, Ellenbogen spoke again.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, and Morgendorffer...&quot;</P>

<P>Jake turned. &quot;Sir?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Standard punishment for being AWOL - loss of weekend privileges
for the rest of the semester. Now get to class.&quot;</P>

<P>Amanda found it increasingly difficult to pay attention to Hilda. By
Friday she'd admitted to herself that she was living for Saturday and,
though it had seemed like a good idea at the time, she was beginning to
regret that she'd talked Hilda into getting to Gilbert's an hour early
just in case. Apart from anything else it had cost her a large slice of
coconut cream pie.</P>

<P>Willy walked in without Jake. His face wasn't its usual grinning self
and, as he slid into the seat beside Hilda Amanda knew there was something
wrong. Willy kissed Hilda on the cheek and Amanda felt a sinking feeling
in her stomach. Willy turned to see her staring at him, her face pale.</P>

<P>&quot;Uh, Amanda, Jake ain't gonna make it today.&quot; he said quietly.</P>

<P>She felt like throwing up. The demons of guilt had been working overtime
since Wednesday. It happened, didn't it? They were all sweetness and light
until they got what they wanted and then...but not Jake...not Jake...please
no not Jake. It wasn't like that. He said he loved her. And she trusted
him. But she couldn't stop the feeling. <I>GodnoGodnoGodno...</I></P>

<P>Willy reached into his pocket and handed her an envelope. With trembling
hands she tore it open.</P>

<P><I>Dear Amanda,</I></P>

<P><I>I've been grounded. Willy will tell you the story. </I></P>

<P><I>I'm not very good at expressing myself. I wish I could write poetry
because I feel like writing poetry when I think about you. I can't even
quote someone else's poetry but I think I'll start reading some so that
I can one day</I></P>

<P><I>The only words I can give you are these - I love you. I'm wish I
could be there to say them to you. I wish I could look into your eyes and
tell you.</I></P>

<P>Amanda pulled a handkerchief out her handbag and dabbed her eyes. <I>Thank
you God. </I>She read on.</P>

<P><I>I've lost weekend privileges for the rest of the semester. But I'll
get out. We'll arrange a time through Willy. I can't be away from you for
that long.</I></P>

<P><I>I hope everything's alright with you. Send a note back with Willy
if you like.</I></P>

<P><I>I love you more than life Amanda.</I></P>

<P><I>Jake.</I></P>

<P>She folded the letter and put it back in her envelope, her eyes wet
with relief and disappointment.</P>

<P>&quot;He was real upset, Amanda.&quot; said Willy quietly. &quot;I thought
he was gonna cry on me there fer a minute. He...likes ya a real lot.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What happened, Willy?&quot;</P>

<P>He told her the story, just as Jake had told it to him. &quot;That Ellenbogen,
man, he's been a real ba...been real mean t' Jakey, but Jake said this
time he wasn't mean, it was just like, you know, the same as if he'd had
t' write some lines on the blackboard or somethin'. Ellenbogen didn't know
what it meant. But Jake's been real down. He ain't gonna wait, Amanda.
He's gonna make a date 'n time and find a way to meet ya.&quot;</P>

<P>Amanda's mind shifted into high gear. &quot;What if he got caught again,
Willy? What would happen?&quot;</P>

<P>Willy thought for a moment. &quot;Can't rightly say. I mean up until
now Ellenbogen would've expelled him fer sure. Jake said the he was...sorta...friendly.
But I dunno, I wouldn't trust that basta...guy as far as I could throw
him.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But he could get expelled, couldn't he?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah. Yeah, he could.&quot; Then understanding dawned. &quot;Oh,
yeah - I see what you mean. Damn.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Will you take a note back to him?&quot;</P>

<P>He looked at her with the most serious expression she'd ever seen him
wear, a compassion behind it that wasn't usually visible behind his clowning.
He reached out to her and took her hand. &quot;Pretty lady, I'd take <I>you</I>
back to him if I could.&quot;</P>

<P>She smiled at him through wet eyes, then reached into her handbag for
a notepad and pen, and she wrote. When she was finished she folded the
letter and handed it to him. &quot;I haven't...got an envelope.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I&nbsp;have.&quot; he smiled, placing the folded note in his shirt
pocket and patting it. &quot;It's as safe in here as it'd be in Fort Knox.
Ain't no-one gonna read it except Jake.&quot;</P>

<P>Amanda smiled back and slid out of the seat. &quot;Thanks Willy. I'll
leave you two to yourselves. Um, will you give him something else for me?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Why sure - I'd be glad to.&quot; he grinned.</P>

<P>She leaned over and kissed him gently on the cheek.</P>

<P>Willy turned bright red. &quot;Uh, Amanda, I'm sorry - I ain't gonna
kiss him for NO one!&quot;</P>

<P>Hilda squealed with delight and elbowed Willy in the ribs.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="25%"></P>

<P>Jake was lying on his bunk with his eyes closed when Willy arrived back
at the dorm. He assumed that Jake was asleep and he pondered whether to
wake him, then cursed himself for a fool for even thinking about it. He
put a hand on Jake's shoulder and shook. &quot;Jake?&quot;</P>

<P>Jake sat bolt upright. &quot;Was she there?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Of course she was there! Damn Jakey - she was as cut up about
it as you are. She cried when I told her what had happened.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;She cried? Oh Jesus, Willy.&quot; Jake's stomach knotted.</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah. She was real upset, Jake. But damn - she's smart you know.
She's real smart.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</P>

<P>Willy took the folded note out of his pocket. &quot;I don't know what
she said in here, Jakey - I'm sure it's real private, but I bet I know
one thing she said.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake grabbed the note from Willy's hand and read it.</P>

<P><I>Sweet Jake,</I></P>

<P>Sweet Jake! &quot;Happy Valentine's Day sweet Jake&quot; she'd said.
He'd been happier at that moment than he'd ever been in his life. </P>

<P><I>Willy told me what happened. I wanted so badly to see you.</I></P>

<P><I>But please Jake, please don't risk getting caught again. Willy said
that you could get expelled. Even if we don't see each other until after
Summer vacation, we can write, and Willy can take messages between us.
But if you got expelled I don't know what would happen. It'd be harder
than this though, I'm sure about that. Please think about it.</I></P>

<P><I>It's going to be hard anyway. I think about Tuesday night all the
time. I'll write to you. I'll write every day and on Saturday I'll give
Willy my letter to take to you. Will you do the same thing? It's not like
being together, but it's not like being apart either.</I></P>

<P><I>Please don't take the risk Jake. I love you.</I></P>

<P><I>Amanda</I></P>

<P>Jake thought that his heart would jump out of his body. He looked at
Willy. &quot;She loves me?&quot;</P>

<P>Willy grinned. &quot;Okay Jakey - two things. She said that she didn't
want ya t' risk gettin' out again, didn't she?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah. But Jesus Willy - I can't just rot in here for three months
without seeing her!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes y' can, Jake.&quot; He was serious again. &quot;She's right.
If you get caught again, what's Ellenbogen gonna do to ya? You ain't gonna
stay in his good books f'rever! And then what'd happen Jakey? What if y'
got expelled? What kind o' chance would you have then? Y'd get sent off
t' some other school somewheres next year and that'd be it, man. That'd
be it. She's right Jake. She's smart an' she's right and you know it.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake stared at the note. She'd held it in her hand. Written her thoughts
on it. &quot;Yeah.&quot; he scowled. &quot;Yeah - she's right.&quot;</P>

<P>The week passed slowly. Every night Jake wrote his thoughts to her and
every night he read her letter. <I>I love you.</I> <I>I think about Tuesday
night all the time. I love you.</I> He could have subsisted on nothing
but her words.</P>

<P>On Saturday Willy came back with a six page letter. She'd done the same
thing that he had, writing her thoughts, telling him the little details
of her days. She'd been right. It wasn't like being together, but there
was there was a different and satisfying intimacy in it. Nothing made him
feel so good, though, as when she wrote, simply, &quot;I love you.&quot;</P>

<P>As the weeks passed they got better at it. Amanda told him that Sandra
and her friends didn't bother her any more - they tried, but she didn't
care, so she ignored them. Jake told her that Junior was still as obnoxious
as ever, but he just didn't care. Junior and his old man had come to seem
less menacing - more patetic. What sort of sorry life would you have to
lead, he wondered, to make you need to bring other people down to make
yourself feel good? What sort of contempt for women would you have to have
to talk about them - to treat them - the way they did? The way that Mad
Dog did. And when he thought like that, Mad Dog didn't seem so menacing
any more either.&nbsp;&quot;If I ever have kids,&quot; he wrote, &quot;I'm
damned if I'll treat them the way he treated me.&quot;</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Amanda wrote about how embarrassed she'd been
when Sister Assumpta had talked about the &quot;delicacy of her work&quot;
and the &quot;subtlety she was developing with glazes and firing techniques&quot;
in front of the class. He could hear the excitement in her voice when she
told him that she was entering some work in an art show, how Sister Assumpta
felt that she had a good chance of a prize.</FONT></P>

<P>Jake spent Easter at school and used it as an opportunity to do what
he said he'd do. He spent a lot of it in the library, trying to pick his
way through Keats, Wordsworth, Shelley, Byron and the other romantic poets,
appreciating for the first time how words could capture the way people
felt.</P>

<P>They wrote about their childhoods. They came to know each other and
it never got old, or boring, or uninteresting. Whatever they wrote, &quot;I
love you&quot; was always there at the end. And the months passed. Amanda's
plate won third prize in the art show, the first time that a non-professional
had ever received a prize. Jake shared her excitement and pleasure. She'd
given the plate to Sister Assumpta to thank her.</P>

<P>But there was one thing that Amanda never mentioned.</P>

<P>On May 24th the senior classes graduated. In the Junior Year Awards
Amanda came top of her year in Art and her plate and the prize it won was
displayed as an example of the work that Saint Agnes's students produced.
Jake didn't win any prizes, but Summer Vacation was prize enough. It was
a milestone that signalled the start of the countdown to next year and
the return of Saturday privileges. They'd survived three months. They'd
survive another three. They'd write every week, just as they'd done at
school.</P>

<P>He never got another letter from her.</P>
