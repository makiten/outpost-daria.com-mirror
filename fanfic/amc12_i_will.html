<p>"Jakey! Helen! Man - it's so good to see ya!" <br>
</p>

<p>Willy's teeth threatened to burst out of his mouth as he opened the car door for Helen
and
helped her out.</p>

<p>"It's only been a day, man," grinned Jake.</p>

<p>"Ain't the point, Jakey. I mean it's great to see here - at home!"</p>

<p>Helen hugged him and kissed him on the cheek. "It's wonderful to
be here, Willy. I didn't really get a chance to congratulate you after
the graduation."</p>

<p>Willy blushed though Helen was dressed modestly. "I still figure
there was some kind'a mistake about that."</p>

<p>"Yeah, me too," said Jake. "I mean what with that business
with Ellenbogen's shoes..."</p>

<p>Willy and Jake looked at each other and four years of shared
experience
released itself in a burst of laughter that fed off itself until it
became a hysterical
catharsis. They laughed until tears rolled down their cheeks, slapping
each other on the back, pausing briefly, and starting again until they
leaned, exhausted, against the car.</p>

<p>Helen watched, bemused, but half-understanding what was happening.
"Yeah,"
she said dryly. "I can see that happening halfway through the ceremony."</p>

<p>"Oh man," gasped Willy. "I dunno what that was about,
but it felt good."</p>

<p>Jake, clutching his sides, just looked up at him and nodded.</p>

<p>"But listen - this is important," said Willy, pulling himself
together. "Ma's doin' all the cookin'. Now I'd be obliged if you'd
help me out.. I didn't have the heart t' ask her not to, and I'm real
worried.
I mean no-one's gonna eat the food, and I dunno what to do - it'd break
her heart, I'm sure."</p>

<p>Helen remembered the quiet dignity with which Willy's mother had
responded
to Ruth's rudeness "Willy," she said, "if I have to eat all your mother's
food by myself, I'm going to see that there's nothing left."</p>

<p>Willy stared at Helen. "Uh, Jake's told y' about Ma's cooking,
right?"</p>

<p>"Well, he mentioned it, sure. But it can't be all that bad."</p>

<p>"I won't lie to y', Helen," said Willy, "and I'm real
grateful to y' for wantin' t' help, but I can't ask that of ya. I
thought
maybe we could work out some way of...y' know...disposin' of it real
careful
like, so Ma thinks that it all got et."</p>

<p>"We'll think of something, man," said Jake. "Now come
on - let's get inside."</p>

<p>Willy led them from where the car was parked beside a classic red barn,
around to the front of a rambling country farmhouse. A long central<font color="#000000"> </font><font color="#000000">area</font> was
flanked on either side by porches that extended to the front and, between
them, a country garden planted with hollyhocks, forget-me-nots,
buttercups and snapdragons lay beneath two ancient and gnarled
magnolias. A stone path, its gentle curve showing that whoever
had laid it had well understood that curves are more interesting than
straight lines, led
up to the front porch with wicker chairs scattered about and an
overhanging wisteria that shaded it from the southerly sun. Willy
opened the screen door
and looked back to see Jake and Helen walking slowly, taking it all in.</p>

<p>"Willy," Helen sighed as she climbed the steps, "it's
gorgeous. You're so lucky."</p>

<p>Willy looked puzzled. "You think so? It's just home t' me - where
I grew up. I dunno that I'm so lucky - maybe other folks are just
unlucky."</p>

<p>He held the door open and Helen and Jake walked in. Slowly their
eyes
adjusted to the darkness of the old house and they found themselves in
a high-ceilinged room where comfortable old-fashioned furniture was around
a deep red and cream Axminster rug. Helen stopped and looked around, absorbing the sense of simple elegance.</p>

<p>"Ma, they're here!" Willy called, startling Helen out of her thoughts.<br>
</p>

<p>"Well bring 'em through, boy."<br>
</p>


Willy led them through into a bright country kitchen where his mother
stood at an enormous scrubbed pine table full of bowls, pans,
chopping
boards, knives, vegetables, and all the accoutrements of a small
restaurant
kitchen. Pots steamed on every burner of the gas stove behind her and,
beside it, a fuel stove, probably part of the original kitchen and
perfectly
maintained, was pumping heat out into the room. She looked up and
beamed at them, wiping the sweat from
her
brow with a forearm covered in flour. "Jake! Helen! Welcome! And look
at me, I ain't in any fit state to welcome guests!" She wiped the flour
off her hands and arms on her apron and strode over to
Jake, enveloping him in a welcoming hug.
<p>"It's great to be here, Mrs Johanssen," Jake said, returning
the hug. </p>

<p>She turned and hugged Helen then stood back to look at her, smiling
and holding her hands. "I swear you get prettier every time I see
you, girl," she said.</p>

<p>"I love your house, Mrs Johanssen," Helen exclaimed, looking
around at the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Well thank-you, sweetheart. Now, I reckon it's time we
relaxed on the formalities. How about we drop
the 'Mrs Johanssen'?"</p>

<p>"Uh, sure," said Jake. "So what...?"</p>

<p>"M' name's Mandy," she said, and turned to Willy. "Land
sakes, boy, I swear I ain't taught you any manners at all. What's wrong
with you? Offer our guests some tea and cake - they must be hungry and
thirsty after their long drive."</p>

<p>"Yes'm," Willy smiled. "Maybe they'd prefer somethin'
cool."</p>

<p>"Well," started Jake...</p>

<p>"Tea!" Helen said enthusiastically. "I'd love tea!"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jake added, taking Helen's lead. "Tea'd be nice."</p>

<p>"Suit yerselves," said Willy, taking a large kettle down from
a shelf and filling it with water.</p>

<p>"You youngsters won't mind if I keep workin' here will you?"
Mandy asked. "It's just folks are always hungry after a wedding and
I've still got a mess o' food t' make."</p>

<p>Jake winced inwardly. "Sure, Mrs...Mandy - don't mind us."</p>

<p>Helen looked round at the pies and pastries that were cooling on the
bench, smelling rich and exotic, their golden crusts looking (Helen
imagined) as if they'd come out of a French patisserie. "Can I help?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sweetie" Mandy smiled as she cracked eggs
into a bowl. "No, You have a cup of tea and somethin' t' eat, then get
Willy to show you around. I expect Peter and Millie - that's
my other son and his wife - 'll be here any time. Helen, I've got you
and
Hilda stayin' down the road with my sister, Patsy. I hope that's okay."</p>

<p>"Sure, that's great," Helen answered, relieved that
a question that had been nagging her had been settled early and easily.</p>

<p>Willy took a cobalt-blue china teapot down off the shelf, poured
some
boiling water into it from the kettle, swirled it round and tipped out
the water into the sink as Helen watched. He put the teapot
down on the table and opened a printed tinplate canister. He took three
teaspoons
of black tea, and carefully emptied them into the teapot, which he took
over to the stove where the kettle was boiling, carefully tipped the
bubbling water into the pot, put the lid on, and turned the flame under
the
kettle off.</p>

<p>"Sure y' wouldn't like somethin' cold?" he asked, as he put
the kettle, a milk jug, and three small plates, two teacups and two
saucers,
and a silver sugar bowl onto an ornate old wicker tray.</p>

<p>Helen pictured English teatimes she'd read about in
P.G.
Wodehouse stories that she'd found in the school library last summer.
"No,"
she said quietly, watching entranced as Willy poured some milk into the
jug and deftly sliced a lemon onto one of the plates.</p>

<p>"We'll take it into the parlour, Ma," said Willy, opening
the refrigerator and helping himself to a Dr Pepper.</p>

<p>"Don't you make a mess, now," Mandy said. "Oh, Helen,
take that teacake," she added, nodding a large pine dresser where at a pale golden cake lightly
dusted with confectioner's sugar, crossed by undusted diagonal stripes
which made diamond patterns of white, rested on a blue willow pattern
plate.</p>

<p>Willy grimaced as Helen picked up the cake, and they walked back
from
the heat of the kitchen into the cool, dark room they'd passed through
on
their way in.</p>

<p>"You folks make y'selves at home," said Willy, putting the
tray down on a low table as Helen and Jake sat down in the old couch,
sinking into the soft cushions. He looked around toward the kitchen,
and
said quietly "I'm real sorry about this. Ma's got some strange ideas
about stuff, but I'm real obliged to y' both for not makin' fun of her."</p>

<p>Helen glanced at Jake then turned back to watch Willy as he set out
the plates and put the cups on the saucers. He turned the teapot round
three times by its handle and looked up at Helen. "Milk or lemon?"</p>

<p>"Milk, please," she answered immediately, thinking about how
Jeeves would have prepared it for Bertie Wooster.</p>

<p>Willy poured the tea into the teacup and added a splash of milk from
the jug. "Jakey?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Uh, same...I guess," Jake replied, bemused at the formality
of the ceremony. Ruth drank tea sometimes, but it was kept in little
paper bags that she dangled in a cup and he'd always assumed that that
was how tea was made. Watching Willy's easy familiarity with something
so strangely exotic made Jake feel slightly odd, seeing a side of Willy that
Buxton Ridge had never revealed.</p>

<p>Willy poured a cup for Jake and put one in front of each of them.
"Help
y'selves to sugar," he said, indicating the sugar bowl.</p>

<p>Under Jake's watchful gaze Helen picked up a pair of small silver
tongs
and gently lowered a cube of sugar into her cup, stirred, and
passed
the bowl to Jake who copied her. Willy, meanwhile, walked over to a
dresser,
opened a door, and took out a glass and a bottle opener. He settled back into an overstuffed armchair and
looked back to the kitchen again. "Ma don't like me drinkin' out of
the bottle," he said, pouring the drink out into the glass and taking a
deep drink. "Never did understand what Ma saw in tea."<br>
</p>

<p>Helen picked up the cup, took a sip, and sighed. "Willy, this is
delicious! Do you always make tea like this?"</p>

<p>"Ever since I was knee-high to a grasshopper. Like I&nbsp;said,
Ma's got some strange ways, but Pa always said that we should respect
the
way she liked to do stuff. Folks think we're pretty strange I guess,
but
I don't mind as long as it makes Ma happy."</p>

<p>He put the glass down, picked up a knife, and cut three slices
of cake which he put on the plates he'd brought from the kitchen..</p>

<p>"That looks wonderful," said Helen.</p>

<p>Willy looked up at her. "Yeah, it does, don't it? Pa always used t'
say
that if Ma's food ate like it looked we'd o' been livin' high on the
hog.
But there ya go." He sighed. "We got pretty darn good at makin'
her believe that we liked it too," he said, nodding to the plates
with crumbs and sugar on them as he picked up the slices of cake and
wrapped
them in a napkin. "We'll get rid o' these outside somewhere away from
the chicken coop - wouldn't want 'em eatin' it."<br>
</p>

<p>"So listen, man," Jake said, "Where are you and Hilda going on your
honeymoon?"<br>
</p>

<p>Willy grinned. "Up t' the back o' the field out back."<br>
</p>

<p>Helen chuckled at the image that conjured up.<br>
</p>

<p>"There's an old cottage up there that Ma's been fixin' up. It's small, but it's real pretty."<br>
</p>

<p>"You're not going away then?" Helen asked.<br>
</p>

<p>"Can't afford it, besides - we ain't really got time. I gotta be in <font color="#000000">Fort Benning</font> fer basic trainin' in a week. I figure that we'll just save up
an' have a real honeymoon when I get some leave. Hilda's gonna live in
the cottage, Pete an' Millie'll live here with Ma. We won't have nothin'
t' spend my pay on really, so we'll be able t' go somewhere real nice
when I get m' first leave."<br>
</p>

<p>"But you only have a week..." Helen said. "That's such a shame."<br>
</p>

<p>"Yeah." Willy looked a little downcast. "Pa used 't say that it's
easy t' be wise after the event." He looked sadly at Helen. "I was real
keen 't get signed up, y' know - excited. I figured I'd have some time,
I didn't expect it'd all happen so fast. Hilda was a might upset about
it, but she understands. She's real good like that."<br>
</p>

<p>"Will you show us the cottage?" Jake asked.<br>
</p>

<p>"Yeah, sure. We'll walk up there later this afternoon."<br>
</p>

They finished their tea and Willy took the things back to the
kitchen.
As he came back into the parlour the door opened and a taller, older
version
of Willy stepped into the room followed by a very pregnant woman.
<p>"Pete! Millie!" Willy said, hurrying to the door as Jake and
Helen stood up.</p>

<p>Willy hugged them both and turned to Jake. "Pete, this is Jake
- you know, m' buddy from Buxton Ridge! Jake, this is my brother, Pete."</p>

<p>"Hi Jake," said Peter, putting a large suitcase down on the
floor.</p>

<p>"And this is Pete's wife Millie."</p>

<p>"How d'you do, Jake," Millie smiled. "Willy's told us so much about
you!" She turned to Helen. "And you must be Amanda!"</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Jake shook his head violently from side to side, his mouth closed
tightly.</p>

<p><font color="#000000">Helen had laughed off Willy's embarrassed
apology
for the case of mistaken identity but Jake had looked very
uncomfortable,
so she'd taken him by the arm and said "Why don't you guys catch up?
I'm sore from the trip - I'd like to take a stroll around outside,"
and without waiting for an answer she'd led him out the door as she
heard
Peter and Millie answer Mandy's welcoming shout from the kitchen,
and
they'd walked out into the bright summer afternoon. </font></p>


<font color="#000000">Helen looked looked up at Jake as they
walked
slowly down the stone path to the gate and she linked her arm with his as
they
strolled around the house, not speaking. She waved and smiled at
Mandy
and Peter as they passed the kitchen window. </font>"Oh, wow," she said, hoping to distract him from whatever
was bothering him, "I've never been in a real barn! Come on, let's
go look!" She'd let go and run towards the barn, stopping in the
half-open
doorway and looking back at Jake to see him standing, rooted to the
spot,
staring at the barn.
<p>She walked back to him.&nbsp;<br>
 </p>

<p>"Jake? What's wrong?"</p>

<p>He shook his head again. "I don't want to go into the barn,"
he said quietly.</p>

<p>Helen looked from eye to eye, trying to work out what was going on,
adding all the pieces together. So far she'd found two things that
could affect Jake like this. "It's Amanda, isn't it?" she asked.<br>
</p>

<p>Jake kept staring at the barn. A warm breeze blew across the
fields
and ruffled his hair. </p>

<p>"You've never really told me about her," Helen said quietly.</p>

<p>Jake tore his gaze away from the barn and looked at Helen. She had
the
same look in her eyes that she'd had on the night of the prom and he
understood
that it hadn't been the dress or the hair that had made her look so
beautiful. She took his hand and they walked aimlessly around the barn, stopping
to sit on a bench in the shade on the side away from the
house,
staring out across the copper fields.</p>

<p>"They had these dances three times a
year, with the Catholic girls' school across town," he said quietly, staring off into he distance. "They
were a drag, always the same. But Willy kept saying that one day we'd
get
lucky..."</p>

<p>Helen listened in silence while Jake told her about the dance,
Ellenbogen
Junior and the spilled punch, the incident with the rope, the storm,
how
they'd sheltered in a barn just like this, about finding her letters
and
what they contained. Helen bit her lip when he told her how he'd left
the
ring on the hay bale. </p>

<p>Jake was breathing deeply when he finished. For the first time in
years
Helen felt self-conscious and uncertain of herself as she wondered how
much damage had been done to Jake by Mad Dog, by Ellenbogen
and by Buxton Ridge; and by Jake himself, by the depth of his belief, though it
was so wrong, that he'd betrayed Amanda. And she understood a little of
how important Willy, the one person he trusted and confided in, had
been
to him.</p>

<p>Looking past his eyes she did all she knew how to at that moment. As
she kissed him softly and long, Jake felt some of the pain drift
away.</p>

<p>Back in the house, Willy took another Dr Pepper from the fridge and
turned to the sink
to pick up the church key. </p>

<p>"I&nbsp;sure hope your friends weren't bothered by my mistake,"
Millie said as she sipped a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>Willy smiled as he looked out the
window to see Jake and Helen walk slowly out from behind the barn,
close
together, hand in hand. "I don't reckon they mind at all."</p>

<p>* * *<br>
<br>
"I'm gonna take Jake and Helen up t' see the cottage, Ma. We'll
probably go
into town and catch a movie, maybe get a burger or somethin'."</p>

<p>"Oh, I was hopin' we'd all have a nice dinner together..."
Mandy said with a note of disappointment in her voice.</p>

<p>"'Sakes, Ma, you got enough t' do without havin' t' worry about
us. We'll be back after dinner anyway." Willy said as he hustled Jake
and Helen out the door. "I reckon the hardest part about all this
is gonna be keepin' you folks and Ma's cookin' apart fer a whole two
days."</p>

<p>"Willy I just can't believe your mother's cooking could be all
that bad," Helen said as they walked round to the back of the house and along a path that led to a gate in the back fence.</p>

<p>Willy sighed. "I guess there's only one way
you're gonna find out, but I ain't takin' no responsibility for the
consequences."</p>

<p>Helen smiled nervously. <br>
</p>

He led them up over a low rise behind the house and down again,
across a footbridge over a small creek, flowing languidly in the
summer heat through a cool grove of cottonwoods. The path started
uphill again and, as it turned right, a small cottage came into view.
It looked to be the same age as the main house. Fresh cream-coloured paint gave
it an almost out of place feel, and the small garden in the front yard
was starkly formal, divided into small plots by brick pathways, each
plot with its own planting of herbs and vegetables. Below the cottage
the ground sloped away down to the creek as it curved around the base
of the hill, overhung by weeping willows.<br>
<br>

They turned to hear Helen laughing gently. "Willy, you're
amazing," she said.<br>


<p>"Must be why everyone calls me Amazin' Willy," he deadpanned,
getting a chuckle out of Jake. "Yeah - I know, it's real pretty.
When Pa was alive we used t' use it fer visitors an' such. We
told Hilda's folks they could stay there, but they're real busy with
their shop so they gotta get back tomorrow. Ma loves all them stinky
plants in the garden an' Pa drew the line at havin' 'em out the back o'
the house, so she comes up here every day t' tend 'em." They stopped
and stood, taking in the scene. "I figure if Hilda an' me move out once
I get a regular postin' Ma'll probably come and live here an' leave the
house t' Pete an' Millie."<br>
</p>

<p>As they walked up to the house Helen bent down to get a closer look
at Mandy's "stinky plants". She recognised some of them - parsley,
several kinds of mint. She plucked a small leaf and crushed it between
her fingers, smiling. Oregano - her mother grew it. Obviously
this was Mandy's herb garden, but "stinky plants" was such a great
description that she couldn't help but smile.<br>
</p>

<p>Willy opened the door to let them in and Helen turned to admire the
view from the wooden porch across the herb garden, down the hill to the
creek and across the roof
of the main house to the road and hills beyond. She knew that as
the sun set the herbs would release their fragrance. Sitting on the
porch on a summer's evening would be romantic. Sniffing the fresh
herbal smell on her fingers again, she envied Hilda.<br>
</p>

<br>



<hr size="2" width="25%">
<p><br>
</p>

"Stag party?"<br>

<br>

"Of course, little brother - damn - y' gotta have a stag party the
night before your wedding, right Jakey?"<br>

<br>

"Uh, yeah, I guess so..." Jake replied nervously.<br>

<br>

"It's traditional. Heck - I had one - everybody has one!" Pete slapped
Willy on the back while Mandy, Millie and Helen looked on in wry
amusement.<br>

<br>

"They had to throw a bucket of cold water over him to get him up in
time for the wedding," Millie whispered <i>sotto voce</i> to Helen and
Hilda.<br>

<br>

"Aw, honey, I was just tired is all," Pete said indignantly. "We didn't
get back till nigh on sunup!"<br>

<br>

"You know what, boys?" Millie said, "I think it's a great idea!"<br>

<br>

Pete, Jake, Willy, Mandy and Helen turned to look at her.<br>

<br>

"So good, in fact, that I think us girls need a party of our own. What d'you say, ladies?"<br>

<br>

"Sure!" exclaimed Mandy! "We got all the fixin's we need here! We can
have us a fine time celebratin' your last night of freedom, honey!"<br>

<br>

"Damn right!" added Helen. "Who said the guys get all the fun?"<br>

<br>

Hilda just laughed.<br>

<br>

* * *<br>

<br>
Jake stopped on the sidewalk and looked up at a sign proclaiming
"Baker's Bar - Live Bands Saturday Night" in red neon. He glanced
across
at Willy to see that Willy was glancing at him, and they turned and
followed Peter inside.<br>

<br>
A long pine bar stretched away toward the back of the room, propped up
by four customers sitting on pine stools with red vinyl padding,
chatting or nursing beers. Along the wall opposite the bar small tables
each with four chairs continued the theme. Peter led them to the
back of the room where the bar ended and more tables and chairs were
scattered in front of a small dance floor leading up to an even smaller
stage where a stool and microphone stand waited patiently for someone
to use them. A few people lazed around a pool table, the air hazy with
cigarette smoke, and a dozen or so others sat at the tables, chatting
or watching the pool players,
occasionally exclaiming noisily at a particularly good or bad shot.<br>

<br>

Peter pulled a chair out from under an empty table, guiding Willy to
sit down. Jake followed suit. "Okay boys, so what's it to be?" he asked.<br>

<br>

Willy and Jake exchanged glances again.<br>

<br>

"Uh, beer I guess," said Willy uncertainly.<br>

<br>

"Beer? And you, Jakey, the same?"<br>

<br>

"Beer?" he asked, looking up at Peter.<br>

<br>

<i>"Here Jake. Have a beer with your old man!"<br>
<br>
Jake looked down at the glass that his father was holding out to him,
pale yellow, bubbles rising slowly to the frothy white foam on top. He knew
that twelve year-olds weren't supposed to drink beer, but it couldn't
be too different to soda - and besides, it was what 'men' drank - Mad
Dog had told him so often enough. Slowly he reached out and took the
glass, and raised it to his lips as Mad Dog grinned. The slightly
bitter taste was a shock. It wasn't that it was disgusting, though Jake
couldn't understand for the life of him why anyone would want to drink
it, but it was so different...<br>
<br>
"Bah," grunted Mad Dog. "That's no way to drink beer, boy. You drink
like a girl! Down it!"<br>
<br>
Jake looked down at his father's face. He could do this. If he
didn't think too hard about it he could pretend it was Coke, and as
long as he drank it fast...<br>
<br>
"That's it boy! Maybe there's hope for you yet," Mad Dog grinned as
Jake finished the glass. "Here," he said, taking the glass and
refilling it, "Have another."<br>
<br>
Jake managed to get the second glass down just as the effects of the
first started to make themselves felt.<br>
<br>
"I don't feel so good," he said, and turned to run to the bathroom, his
father's grunt of disapproval echoing in his increasingly muddy mind.</i><br>

<br>

"No, thanks," he said, vividly remembering the minutes he'd spent
throwing up into the toilet.<br>

<br>

"Okay - what then?" Pete asked. "Or would y' like me to choose for ya?"<br>

<br>

"Uh, yeah, sure," Jake replied.<br>

<br>

"This is great, huh, Jakey?" Willy asked uncertainly.<br>

<br>

"Yeah. Great." Jake replied, equally uncertainly.<br>

<br>

"Here ya go," Pete said, putting a tray down on the table. <br>

<br>

Jake looked straight past the drinks on the tray and his stomach
rumbled. "Oh boy! Peanuts!" he said, grabbing a handful of the salted
morsels and devouring them greedily.<br>

<br>

Pete put a beer down in front of Willy, a glass of Coke in front of
Jake, and helped himself to the other beer. "Well, here's to your last
night 'o freedom, little brother, and your first night o' wedded
bliss!" He laughed and raised his glass. Willy and Jake smiled, touched
their glasses together with Pete's, and the three of them drank.<br>

<br>

"Hey, that's good!" Jake exclaimed. "Cherry Coke?"<br>

<br>

"Close, Jakey. Sloe gin and Coke. Good eh?"<br>

<br>

"Great," Jake replied, grabbing another handful of peanuts.<br>

<br>

* * *<br>

<i><br>
</i>"If I know Peter, those boys'll be back by ten, unless there's
something on at Baker's. He used to spend a lotta time down there
before he married you, Millie, but he's never been a drinker. It was
the music." Mandy put tray of glasses down on the table and looked
around at the others. "So - what's it t' be, ladies? We have t' send
you off well, Hilda!"<br>

<br>

"Gin and tonic for me please, Mandy!" said Millie enthusiastically.<br>

<br>

Helen and Hilda exchanged exactly the same nervous glance that Jake and
Willy had exchanged, but Helen was more forthright.<br>

<br>

"I've never really had anything alcoholic, Mandy," said Helen. "I mean
Dad used to give me a sip of his whiskey, but I hated it."<br>

<br>

"Oh - whiskey's not a good thing to start on. It's what they call an
acquired taste." Mandy looked at Hilda. "How about I mix you two up one
of my famous cocktails?"<br>

<br>

"Sure," said Hilda.<br>

<br>

"Okay then. You make yourselves comfortable. I'll be right back."<br>

<br>

Mandy waltzed into the kitchen and, in a few seconds, the sounds of
chopping, stirring, shaking and mixing floated out, mixed with
cheerful humming.<br>

<br>

"Mandy's full of surprises," said Millie,&nbsp; as Mandy came back
into the room carrying a tray with assorted bottles and glasses.<br>

<br>

She handed Millie her gin and tonic, the faintest blue tinge reflecting
off the floating ice cubes and droplets condensing on the glass
and starting to run down the sides. "Now, let's see what we've got here,"
she said, picking up a jug full of pale orange/yellow liquid with
crushed ice floating in it and pouring it into three wine goblets.
Passing one each to Helen and Hilda, she took the third herself
and raised it in toast. "Hilda, honey, you've made my son a happy boy -
man, I should say. And that's made me a happy woman. Here's to many
long years of that happiness to both of you."<br>

<br>

The raised their glasses and Helen and Hilda took a tentative sip.
Hilda's eyes widened. "Chocolate!" she exclaimed.<br>

<br>

Mandy laughed. "Chocolate orange frappe. I thought it'd be appropriate,
honey. I believe you have a likin' for it. I admit I'm partial m'self."<br>

<br>

"It's delicious!" Helen added, taking another sip.<br>

<br>

A faint bell sounded from the kitchen. "Ah - food's ready," Mandy
said, going back into the kitchen and returning in a minute with a
plateful of golden pastry shapes in squares, triangles and rolls. Three
small china bowls held strange looking condiments, one thick and pale
red with small chunks of red and green...things floating in it, one
apparently black, and one thick and brown.<br>

<br>

The nervous glance again passed between Helen and Hilda, but Helen had
already made up her mind that, regardless of the consequences, she was
going to find out what all the fuss was about. She tentatively reached
out and chose a triangle, lifted it to her mouth, and took a bite.<br>

<br>

* * *<br>

<br>

"Ah, two Buds and a sloe gin and Coke, please. Do you sell food?"<br>

<br>

"Nope," the bartender said as he pulled the beers. "Got chips, peanuts,
n' jerky."<br>

<br>

"Uh, well, gimme three packets of chips and three packets of peanuts
too, please."<br>

<br>

The bartender smiled at the thought of all the drinks it'd take to wash
down all the salt. "Here y' go, son," he said, handing Jake a tray.
"Hungry?"<br>

<br>

"Yeah, I've hardly eaten for two days. It's a long story."<br>

<br>

"Ah, well. Y' don't wanna drink on an empty stomach, young feller."<br>

<br>

"Yeah, thanks," said Jake handing over a ten and taking the change.
Passing out the drinks, Jake opened the chips and peanuts and ate
hungrily. Talk and laughter flowed easily along with the obligatory
ribald jokes about Willy's wedding night. Jake was feeling a pleasant
sense of relaxed ease and he started happily on his second drink when a
guitar chord from the stage behind him made him turn just in time to
see a musician, wearing a tassled suede jacket, strike the second
chord of song, and start to sing...<br>

<br>

<i>I pulled in to Nazareth, I was feelin' 'bout half-past dead<br>
<br>
</i>The sweetness of the sound was amazing to Jake who'd never heard a
live performance of this kind of music. The closest he'd come was the
school brass band. Jake was captivated.<br>

<br>

<i>I was lookin' for a place where I could lay my head.</i><br>

<i>Hey Mister can you tell me where a man might find a bed?<br>
He just grinned and he shook my hand, and "no" is all he said.<br>
</i><br>

Jake turned to see Willy and Peter grinning.<br>

<br>

<i>Take a load off Annie,<br>
Take a load for free,<br>
Take a load off Annie,<br>
Aaaaaannnnnnddddd<br>
<br>
</i>The singer held the note and Peter chimed in a third above, adding
a luscious harmony. Jake looked back to see the singer grin at Peter.<br>

<br>

<i>You put the load right on me.</i><br>

<br>
"What the...?" he whispered to Willy.<br>

<br>

Willy just smiled and put his finger to his lips in the "shush"
position.<br>

<br>

<i>I picked up my bag and I went lookin' for a place to hide,<br>
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walkin' side by side.<br>
I said "Hey Carmen, come on let's go downtown."<br>
She said "I got to go, man, but my friend can stick around."<br>
<br>
</i>This time Peter joined in earlier in the chorus, singing high and
clear over the melody. The pool players had stopped and were tapping
their toes and smiling as the next verses started. <br>
<br>
<i>Go down Miss Moses, there's nothin' you can say.<br>
It's just old Luke, an he's waitin' for the judgement day.<br>
"Hey Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?"<br>
He said "Do me a favour, boy, stay and keep Anna Lee company."<br>
<br>
</i>Finally the song wound down to
the last verse and, though the words didn't really make any sense, the
melody was pretty and the sweetness of the delivery turned to honey as
he sang quietly.<br>

<br>

<i>Get your cannonball now, to take me down the line,<br>
My bag is sinkin' low and I do believe that it's time,<br>
To get back to Miss Annie, don't you know she's the only one,<br>
She sent me down here with her regards for everyone.<br>
</i><br>

The chorus started quietly and repeated, building, the two voices
blending perfectly. As the last chord
rang out the drinkers clapped and cheered. Jake jumped to his feet,
clapping louder than anyone, and sat down again as the applause died,
staring at Peter with wide eyes.<br>

<br>

"Thank you! Peter Johanssen, ladies and gentlemen!" the singer said,
indicating Peter, who stood and smiled as the audience clapped and
cheered again.<br>

<br>

"Pete and Martin used to play in a band," Willy explained. "They played
here just about every Saturday night. When Pete got married and went
off, Martin went solo." He looked down at Jake's glass. "I'll get us
another, huh, Jakey?"<br>

<br>

"Yeah, yeah! Far out!" Jake enthused, draining his second sloe gin and
Coke. He turned to Peter as Willy got up and Martin started his
next number. <br>

<br>

"Man - that was incrediblblb...incredidible! Willy never told me you
were a musician!"<br>

<br>

Peter smiled. "Thanks Jakey. I miss it real bad. It sorta gets inta
your blood, y'know? Maybe now that Millie and me are movin' back in with
Ma..." He looked wistfully at Martin, who'd started a rendition of
Leonard Cohen's<i> Suzanne</i>, his fingers effortlessly
drawing lush descending arpeggios out of the spotlight-gleaming bronze strings of the big
Martin twelve-string guitar. Jake turned back to
listen, transfixed, as Willy arrived with another round of drinks.<br>

<br>

<i>
Suzanne takes you down<br>
To a place near the river <br>
You can hear the boats go by <br>
You can spend the night beside her <br>
And you know that she's half crazy <br>
But that's why you want to be there <br>
And she feeds you tea and oranges <br>
That come all the way from China <br>
And just when you mean to tell her <br>
That you have no love to give her <br>
Then she gets you on her wavelength <br>
And lets the river answer <br>
That you've always been her lover <br>
<br>
</i>The words writhed in the raw places of Jake's alcohol-dulled soul, and he
felt tears welling in his eyes as Martin sang...<br>

<i><br>
And you want to travel with her <br>
And you want to travel blind <br>
And you know that she will trust you <br>
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind.</i><br>

<i><br>
</i>Through the haze, the words burned. And, though Willy was fast enough to distract him from descent into
maudlin drunkenness, Jake would never hear that song again without
touching Amanda's perfect body with his mind.<br>

<i><br>
* * *<br>
</i><br>

The next morning five of seven people woke up with headaches.<br>

<br>

The previous night, before the boys arrived back home, Helen and Hilda
had walked - unsteadily - the half
mile to Willy's Aunt Patsy's house,
where they'd been welcomed with open arms and wry amusement at their
condition. She woke them early and gave them
a hearty breakfast, before the three of them drove to pick up Hilda's
parents and sister from the airport. Though they were friendly and
welcoming to Willy and his
family and friends, Helen got the impression that they'd be happy to
get away after the wedding.<br>

<br>

Jake was still hungry. His stomach rumbled loudly from time to time,
and being surrounded by food just made it worse. He hoped that he'd be
able to pick something up on the way to town to get the rented
tuxedos, and his heart sank when Millie arrived with the clothes before
heading
off to Patsy's to join in the preparations for Hilda.<br>

<br>

Mandy's house was a scene relative calm. Four years of Buxton Ridge had
made Willy and Jake expert at ironing shirts and shining shoes so,
though they'd given themselves an hour to get ready, it only took ten
minutes to have them looking ready for a dress parade. Mandy puttered
'round in the kitchen, putting the finishing touches to the food.
Willy's nervousness started showing when he'd given Jake the ring, a
plain gold band, to put in his pocket ready to produce at the
appropriate moment.<br>

<br>

"Just check that y' got the ring, Jakey," he said every ten minutes,
and Jake had to produce it on cue to convince him that it was safe.<br>

<br>

A few minutes before they were due to leave Jake walked into the
kitchen to get a glass of water. Mandy was standing at the sink, her
back to Jake. As he approached, he noticed her shoulders shake gently,
and he slowed, walking up nervously.<br>

<br>

"Uh, Mandy...?" he said quietly. "Are you okay?"<br>

<br>

She turned to him and smiled through the tears rolling down her cheeks.
"I'm sorry, Jakey. I just wish Paul could o' been here today."<br>

<br>

Jake thought
back to the way that Willy had spoken about his father. "Willy told me a lot about him. I'm
really sorry that I never got the chance to meet him."<br>

<br>

Mandy sniffed, and stood back looking at Jake as he
took a clean handkerchief out of his pocket and handed it to her. She
accepted gratefully and dried her eyes. "He would have been so
happy to see Willy getting married. O' course he saw Pete and Millie's
wedding, but Lord, he loved Willy something fierce, Jake. He would have
been happy that Willy had a friend like you."<br>

<br>

"Well, perhaps he's, you know, perhaps he's looking down and seeing it
all," Jake said, embarrassed again at how lame it sounded in his own
ears
as he took the handkerchief back and put it in his pocket.<br>

<br>

"Perhaps he is," she smiled. "Now come on - don't let a silly old woman
hold things up. We gotta get to the church before Hilda does or it'll
be bad luck!"<br>

<br>

Peter drove them the five miles to town where a dozen friends and
relatives, dressed in their Sunday best, milled around outside a small
white
stone church. Jake remembered the hugs and the greetings, the
good wishes and the general happiness, but none of the names of the
people he was introduced to except for the pastor, The Reverend Walter
Entwhistle. <br>

<br>

The small group nearly filled the little church. Willy and Jake
fidgeted while Reverend Entwhistle joked with them with practiced
expertise in calming, or at least distracting, nervous grooms-to-be.
Finally Helen and Patsy arrived and walked down the aisle to take their
seats next to Mandy. Seconds later a breathless rendition of
Mendelssohn's Wedding March threatened to overtax the church's wheezy
old harmonium and the wheezy old harmonium player as Hilda, her arm
linked
in her father's, appeared in the door, framed by the bright light
behind them. As they walked slowly down the aisle, Willy and Jake could
see Hilda's broad smile behind the small veil that barely covered her
face. Hilda's simple tea length white dress and
matching pillbox hat lent her something that was almost elegance and
Jake, glancing at the beatific expression on Willy's face, shared
a little of his friend's joy.<br>

<br>

Fate, meanwhile, conspired in an almost playful way to make its
presence felt and, as Hilda and her father separated leaving Hilda and
her sister Roslynn to stand together, Jake's empty stomach growled loudly,
demonstrating a youthful vigour far beyond the powers of the
old harmonium. Helen, Mandy and Hilda barely managed to stifle
their laughter and Jake, poor Jake, prayed fervently for the ground to
open up and swallow him. The rest of the congregation either didn't
notice or was far too well-mannered to respond, and the incident passed
without further comment. Or it would have if it hadn't continued to
provide a running commentary for the rest of the wedding. Jake's
prayers, even in the sanctified atmosphere of God's house, went
unanswered. <br>

<br>

The ceremony moved along without incident, the ring duly materialised
from Jake's pocket at the appropriate time, and, as those final
monumental words were spoken and Mr and Mrs Johanssen, their eyes full
of love for each other, kissed, The Reverend Entwhistle whispered in
Jake's ear "The Lord moves in mysterious ways, Jake. Perhaps your
stomach is just emulating His example." <br>

<br>

Jake took the comment in the spirit with which it was
offered and relaxed a little until Hilda, the kiss over, reached deep
into the recesses of her simple bouquet of white roses and baby's tears
and drew forth, as if miraculously, a Three Musketeers bar which she
handed to Jake, whispering  <br>

"Honey, you need this more than I do."<br>

<br>
Only Helen's stifled laughter reached Jake's embarrassed ears
before the sweet sound of an expertly played guitar diverted everyone's
attention. Peter, who'd made his way with Millie to the front left hand side of the church, started
playing the song that Willy and Hilda had asked for, and Millie sang in
a clear contralto, as Willy and Hilda walked down the aisle together to
the delight and congratulations of the congregation,<br>

<br>

<i>Who knows how long I've loved you <br>
You know I love you still<br>
Will I wait a lonely lifetime<br>
If you want me to--I will. </i>
<p><i>For if I ever saw you <br>
I didn't catch your name <br>
But it never really mattered <br>
I will always feel the same. </i></p>

<p><i>Love you forever and forever <br>
Love you with all my heart <br>
Love you whenever we're together <br>
Love you when we're apart. </i></p>

<i>
And when at last I find you <br>
Your song will fill the air <br>
Sing it loud so I can hear you <br>
Make it easy to be near you <br>
For the things you do endear you to me <br>
Oh, You know I will <br>
I will.</i><br>

<br>
His embarrassment forgotten, Jake stared at Peter and Millie as
Willy and Hilda walked down the aisle and out of the church to he last,
sweet strains of the Beatles song and the handshakes and hugs of
well-wishers..<br>

<br>

<hr size="2" width="25%"><br>

Clutching a struggling Wind, whose diaper was threatening to desert
him, under one arm Amanda reached into the back of the Willys to take
the air mattress from Vincent. Carrying both loads and her expanding
stomach over to the tent, she dropped the air mattress,
pulled up Wind's diaper and put him back in his collapsible playpen
where he sat happily dribbling and watching the activity as his mother
and father set up camp.<br>

<br>

"You know it's going to get harder to do this when you-know-who arrives," she said.<br>

<br>

"Then we'd better enjoy it while we can," Vincent remarked, climbing
backwards out of the car. "So go chop some wood and fix us up some
vittles while I drink beer."<br>

<br>

The rubber foot pump missed his head by a scant inch.<br>

<br>
Amanda stood and watched him taking the rest of the gear out of the back
of the car and putting it down in a neat pile. The warm afternoon sun
was starting to dip below the trees and a stream burbled in the
distance. A cardinal flapped noisily
from one tree to another. <i>A motel room</i>, she thought, <i>would be so much easier</i>.
Her back was starting to ache, but she breathed deeply, taking in the
earthy smells, and smiled, that sad expression back momentarily,
realising that it <i>was</i> going to be harder from now on. Harder to
go where the road took them. Harder to say "hey - that looks nice," and
to stop and pitch a tent for the night. Harder to take two children
instead of one wherever they felt like going. Harder to say, simply,
"New York," and go.<br>

<br>

She was going to enjoy it while she could. It might be a long time
between drinks. And in two days' time - unless they decided again to
detour via somewhere that sounded interesting - they'd be in New York
City. Nothing was going to spoil that.<br>

<br>

<hr size="2" width="25%"><br>

Helen chuckled as Jake greedily tore open the Three Musketeers bar, broke it and handed half to her.<br>

<br>

"It's okay - like Hilda said, you need it more than me," she said, smiling.<br>

<br>

"So how come you're not hungry?" he asked, stuffing half the chocolate
bar into his mouth and chewing enthusiastically as his stomach growled
at the prospect of being fed.<br>

<br>

Helen just smiled as they parked in front of the barn, got out, and
joined the others from the church as they walked into Mandy's parlour.<br>

<br>

"I'm going to help Mandy and Millie," she said as soon as they got in,
leaving Jake to mingle. He walked around aimlessly, smiling and nodding
as people he didn't know slapped him on the back and said things like
"Great wedding, huh, Jake?", or "Doesn't Hilda look wonderful?" Smile.
Nod. Watching Mandy, Helen and Millie carry in plates from the kitchen
piled high. He poured himself a Coke and gin and sipped distractedly
while Helen put a plate of hot pastry triangles down in front of him
and turned to smile up at him as she left to go back to the kitchen for
another load. Jake stood, staring at the triangles, the sounds of the
room fading into the background as his attention focussed on the golden
morsels. Suddenly he felt a presence by his side.<br>

<br>

"Don't think about it Jakey."<br>

<br>

Jake turned to see Willy looking at him with a worried expression.<br>

<br>

"But..."<br>

<br>

Willy was whisked away by an elderly woman who wanted a photograph, and
he turned back to the plate. Slowly the room came back into focus and
Jake noticed something strange.<br>

<br>

Helen reappeared at his side and slipped an arm through his. "Well,"
she said, smiling that odd smile. "Aren't you going to pour me a drink?"<br>

<br>

"Uh, oh - yeah..." Jake said distractedly. "What would you like?"<br>

<br>

"Oh, I don't know. What's that you've got?"<br>

<br>

He looked down at the glass in his hand. "Joke. I mean Coke. Gin. And Coke."<br>

<br>

"I'll try that then."<br>

<br>

He walked across to the sideboard where Mandy had set out a selection
of bottles and poured Helen a glass of the same, guessing the
quantities, and adding a couple of ice cubes from a glass
ice bucket, all the time glancing back over his shoulder to confirm what
he'd noticed.<br>

<br>

Helen took the drink and sipped. "Mmm. Not bad. Gin?"<br>

<br>

Silence.<br>

<br>

"Jake...?<br>

<br>

"Oh - uh, yeah - sorry. Sloe gin."<br>

<br>

"Why Jake," she said. "you seem distracted."<br>

<br>

"What?"<br>

<br>

"I said you seem distracted."<br>

<br>

Jake turned and stared at her. "The food..."<br>

<br>

"Yeeeeeesssss...?"<br>

<br>

"They're..."<br>

<br>

"They're what?" Helen reached down and picked up a pastry triangle,
lifted it to her mouth, and chewed. She closed her eyes and said "Mmmm."<br>

<br>

Jake stared.<br>

<br>

"How long have you known Willy?" she asked.<br>

<br>

"Uh, four years," Jake replied as his gaze flicked between Helen and the plate.<br>

<br>

"Isn't it amazing how you can know a person for so long and still not have the faintest idea..."<br>

<br>

Jake snatched a triangle from the plate and ate it. His eyes widened
even more. "Goddamn!" he breathed, reaching down and picking up a
handful while Helen tried, with strictly limited success, to control
her laughter. "What the Hell?" he said, turning to her. "You knew? How?"<br>

<br>

Helen smirked and took another bite of her own food before
she replied. "Well, Willy made such a big deal out of it, I just had to
know, you know? So last night I tried some. Good, isn't it?"<br>

<br>

"Good? It's glmph..." He swallowed. "It's great! But why doesn't he like it? I mean most of this is nowhere near
spicy, and he warned us, me off her cooking for, well, Hell, most of the
time I've known him!" Jake eagerly thrust another triangle into his mouth and cast around to see what else was on offer.<br>

<br>

"I was wondering that too. Millie saw how I looked when I ate it
and she told me what Mandy had told her, after Peter did the same thing
to her."<br>

<br>

"Hold on," said Jake, stepping over to pick two crispy springs roll off
a plate, then coming back and giving one to Helen. "So - what did...oh
man..." he took a bite out of the spring roll and chewed, closing his
eyes in ecstasy. "What did she say?"<br>

<br>

Suddenly a voice piped up behind them. "She said that there were
once
two little boys who messed with their mother's cooking when they
shouldn't have." Mandy grinned at Jake and Helen who'd both
blushed guiltily. "Land sakes, its okay, relax. I know my
boys won't touch
my cooking. They're both real sweet about trying to not hurt my
feelings about it though."<br>

<br>

Helen laughed. "Go on, tell Jake, Mandy."<br>

<br>

"Well," she sighed. "I guess the boys were maybe eight and five. I'd been making sushi..."<br>

<br>

"What?" said Jake.<br>

<br><font color="#000099"><font color="#000000">
"Oh, it's raw fish on sticky rice - it's Japanese." She smiled at
Jake's horrified expression. "Now don't you go makin' the same mistake
again, Jake Morgendorffer," she said. "Y' gotta use fish so fresh it's
still jumpin' around, but it's delicious. I'll make some for y' next
time you visit if I can get some fresh salmon straight outa the river.
Anyway, the boys spotted a bowl o' green stuff, an' they start darin'
each other 't eat it - o' course this only came out later. Anyway, I
guess they thought it was guacamole..." She looked at Jake's vacant
expression again. "My, my - I can see that I'm gonna have t' educate
your palates, you two. So what it was wasabi - Japanese
horseradish. It's real hot, but just a tiny bit's Heavenly with good
sushi." She smiled wistfully and shook her head. "Those two were always
doin' silly things. I remember one time if Paul hadn't stopped Pete
from climbin' up t' jump off the roof o' the barn...anyway, Willy stuck
his finger in the wasabi and sucked on it. I guess it hadn't hit yet
'cause
Pete did the same thing. Next thing they're wailin' at the top o' their
little voices and runnin' round the room like all the demons o' Hell
are after' em. We came runnin' in. Soon as we saw the finger-sized
scoops out o' the wasabi and realised what had happened I ran in and
got 'em glasses o' cold milk from the refrigerator."<br>
<br>

"It sounds terrible," said Jake.<br>
<br>

"It was worse than terrible, honey," Mandy added sadly. "Wasabi can
bring tears to a grown-up's eyes, but the boys were just little and
their mouths were tender. It hurts me somethin' dreadful to think of
what it must o' felt like to them. And t' make it worse, they rubbed
their eyes with their fingers, and, well - you can imagine."<br>
<br>

Helen winced.<br>
<br>

"Paul called the doctor, an' he said the best thing we could do was t'
use lots o' runnin water to wash it outa their eyes. The milk helped
too, but the poor little mites were in terrible pain, cryin' an
wailin'. I felt worse then than I think I ever have in my life. I guess
I overreacted. I wouldn't let 'em near anything spicier 'n a little
salt for the next few years. Everything I cooked I made special for
them without any kind o' seasoning at all. Lookin' back it was probably
the worst thing I could o' done. Ruined their palates for anything at
all with a little adventure in it. But the worst of it was they never
trusted me again when it came t' food, an' Lord, that's
somethin' I do love."<br>
<br>



"They never grew out of it?" Jake asked.<br>
<br>



Mandy shook her head, smiling sadly. "Paul saw the funny side of it you know,
and he used t' love my cookin' - mind you it took a few years for me t'
educate him - he didn't take to it at first, but he played along with the
boys fer weeks afterwards. When we were eatin' he'd say 'Now boys, this
here's nasty - I'll take your share.' It was all in fun o' course, but it hurt me"<br>
<br>



Helen looked puzzled. "But Japanese food, gwocca - whatever it was -
all...this..." she looked around at the food, noticing that Jake had
filled a small plate with a selection of morsels which he was
contentedly munching through, "where did you learn...?"<br>
<br>



Mandy sighed again. "My Pa was a diplomat, Helen. He worked in
American embassies and diplomatic missions all over the world. I was born in Germany." <br>
<br>Jake realised that he was staring, open mouthed, and for the first
(though not the last) time he learned that appearances can make for
dangerous assumptions.<br>
<br>
"We lived in Paris, Rome, Singapore, Tokyo, all kinds of places, when I
was little. I went
to American international schools that the government set up for the
children o' diplomats and expatriates, but Daddy always used to say
that it was hard to hate someone after you spoke
their language, listened to their music, and ate their food. So that's
exactly what we did. He made sure that I learnt a little of the
language wherever we are. French, Italian, Japanese, Vietnamese -
not fluently of course, but enough to speak to people and to read a
little. The embassies always had local cooks, and I used to love
watching them cook."<br>
<br>



Helen looked stunned. "But then...how...?"<br>
<br>

"How did I end up here?" She smiled again. "Daddy was born and raised
hereabouts. He retired here when I was sixteen. At first I hated it.
After all that, to come to rural America where puttin' American mustard
on a hot dog was considered exotic? I thought I was gonna die for a
while. So I made it m' hobby to learn how t' cook the kinda food we ate
overseas. Daddy loved it, and I must say I got pretty good at it. O'
course you couldn't get most o' the ingredients here - people in the
stores used t' think I was crazy, askin for this an' that that they'd
never heard of, but I made do. I sent away for seeds and grew a lot o'
my own, and Daddy's friends'd come to visit sometimes and
they'd always bring me little packets or jars o' things you just
couldn't get
in America. People in the service'd bring me back spices and pickles
and things, and mail them to us. It got so that I loved it." Suddenly
sadness replaced the happiness of reminiscence on her face. "Of course
the war put an end to it...and Daddy, rest his soul, passed away before
it ended. But
then..."<br>

"You met Paul?" Helen asked.<br>
<br>



"And then I met Paul," she smiled again, and stared into the distance, then turned back to her rapt audience of two.
"He was the finest man I ever
met. He helped me to understand that the important thing isn't
where you live, it's how you feel about it." She laughed. "It sounds
silly, doesn't it? That this farm could be as exotic as the <i>Champs
Elysees</i>?
That's a beautiful park in Paris, Jake. But it is, you know.
And when Peter an' Millie got married, what with Willy away at school,
I started my cookin' again, and the best part was that the things I
couldn't get were startin' to be available in the stores. These days I
can get a few more, and what with m' herb garden, well, I
think I love it more than ever."<br>
<br>

"But Willy and Pete never changed." Jake said.<br>
<br>

"No, they never did." she sighed. "Maybe when Willy and Hilda move out - maybe they'll get to travel too,
with the Army - I'll be more than happy to live in the cottage with my
herb garden, and see my days out here, because this is where my heart
is."<br>

Helen gave way to the overwhelming urge to hug Mandy, and Mandy hugged her back happily.<br>

<br>

"Thank you, Honey," she said. "Will you both promise me that you'll
come by and visit us some time? Willy's got his Pa's taste in friends,
I must say."<br>

<br>

"I promise," Helen said.<br>

<br>

"Well, we'd better get on with it then," Mandy picked up a knife and tapped it against a glass.<br>

<br>

Jake, still chewing enthusiastically, reached for a plate of small pies
when the sound of Mandy's tapping attracted everyone's attention and
they turned towards her, as Millie brought in a classic two-tiered
wedding cake, white, the top section balanced on four Corinthian
pillars, and put it on the table beside her. Perched right on top was a
snowglobe with a bride and groom inside, standing in a snowy winter
scene.<br>

<br>

"Folks," she said, "I want to say how happy I am that you're all here
to be with us to celebrate this day." There was a polite round of
applause and murmurs of agreement and congratulations. "Now, I'm not one
for formalities or makin' speeches. Willy and Hilda said that they
didn't want anything like that, but I have to say a few words or it
wouldn't be a wedding, would it?" Polite titters of amusement. "I was
saying to Jake earlier that I wish Paul was here with us today." She
paused. "But wishing won't make it so. I know he'd be as happy as I am,
so I'll say no more about that. Hilda, honey, it's wonderful to have
you as part of our family. Now come on you two and cut the cake."<br>

<br>

Willy and Hilda walked hand in hand to the table and took the knife
from Mandy. Hilda picked up the snowglobe and shook it, watching the
'snowflakes' fall on the smiling couple. "Hey," she said, "this is
soooo great!"<br>

<br>

Mandy laughed. "Well, it's not exactly right for a summer wedding, but I liked it too. Now come on and cut the cake."<br>

<br>

They both held the knife handle and plunged it into the cake to the
applause of the guests. Willy looked over at his mother. "Well, I
ain't gonna say much but thank-you, Ma." He looked back at Hilda
and put his arm round her. "I don't reckon there's a man on Earth so
happy as I am today. What more could a man want? I got a beautiful
wife, wonderful friends," a smile towards Jake, "a great brother an'
sister in law, a fine job t' go to - even if it's a bit sooner than
we'd want." Another round of laughter from the guests. "Wonderful
friends and relatives an' neighbours, an'...well...the best mother a
man could have I reckon. And yeah - the only thing I could want would
be Pa, but like Ma says, that's somethin' we just have to live with. I
wanna say a special thanks to m' buddy, Jake. Jake's been a real good
pal these four years, and we've had some good times. And some bad ones.
But Jake, I'm real pleased that you an' Helen could be here. Hilda an'
me hope you'll come an' see us real often." He looked around at the
faces of the people he'd known most if his life, seeing the inevitable
rear or two, and he held Hilda closer and she turned to smile at him.
"Thank y' all." His voice cracked just a little on that last, and he
turned again to kiss Hilda while another round of applause and muttered good wishes rose around them. <br>
<br>
Jake drifted back over to the table, selecting the tastiest morsels he
could find and closing his eyes in the ecstacy of discovery of each new
taste sensation, while Helen, nibbling on a curry puff, watched in
amusement. Someone put a nondescript middle-of-the-road album on the
record player, distracting her for a second or two, and when she looked
back Jake was standing there looking as if he'd just eaten a wasabi
sandwich. Helen hurried over to him. <br>
<br>
"Jake? What's wrong?" she asked, taking his arm.<br>
<br>
"I just realised...." he said, "...all this time..."<br>
<br>
"What?"<br>
<br>
He turned to her. "Care packages. Every goddam month Mandy sent him care packages. Full of food."<br>
<br>
"Oh God. And you..."<br>
<br>
"Every last one. Do you have any idea how much incredible food I helped him toss into trash?"<br>
<br>
It was too much. Helen tilted her head back and roared with laughter.<br>
<br>
"There's nothing funny about it," Jake said despondently.<br>
<br>
Helen tried valiantly to keep a straight face, then, loosing her
battle, she broke into laughter and pulled him out onto the middle of
the room where people were starting to dance.<br>
<br>
After an hour of dancing, eating, and threatening to end Willy's
marriage before it got started, the festivities were interrupted by the
sound of tapping on another glass as he record player became silent.<br>
<br>
"Willy, Hilda," Peter said from over by the door, "What's supposed t'
happen now is that y' get into the limo an' drive off t' the cruise
ship or the plane t' take y' t' some exotic place. I know that's what's
s'posed t' happen 'cause I seen it on the TV." The guests laughed. "So
if you two wanna come on outside, your limousine awaits!" He bowed low
and swept his arm beneath him in the direction of the door.<br>

<br>

Surprised looks followed Willy and Hilda outside, turning to laughter as
they reached the porch. In front of the gate stood Aunt Patsy's old
horse, Charlie, pulling an ancient grey wagon whose sides were
emblazoned with 'Just Married' painted haphazardly on the sides in
white paint, and a dozen tin cans tied by string to the back.<br>

<br>

Hilda laughed so hard that Willy was afraid she'd tire herself out.
They walked down the path to the cheers of the guests, and Willy bowed
low to Hilda. "May I help you into your carriage, my dear?" he said,
triggering another round of laughter. Hilda climbed up onto the seat
and Willy sat beside her, holding Charlie's reins. <br>

<br>

Mandy handed up a wicker basket lined with straw, holding a bottle of
champagne and two glasses. "Just in case you get thirsty," she said,
grinning.<br>

<br>

Willy flicked the reins and said "Gya, Charlie." The old horse walked
off slowly as Hilda leaned her head on his shoulder. People waved and
tin cans clattered.<br>

<br>

"Just turn old Charlie round and send him back when you get t' the cottage," Patsy called. "He knows the way home."<br>

<br>

Jake and Helen watched Willy turn and wave. The warm afternoon sunshine
painted the scene in shades of orange and crimson. Just then, a single cloud
positioned itself in the precise spot to throw a shadow across Willy,
leaving Hilda in sunshine. And Fate, standing at the back of the group, lifted an arm and waved.<br>
