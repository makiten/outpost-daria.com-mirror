minutes</i><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">,
he thought. He looked over at the bushes by the side of the road and
tried to work out what they might be. Didn't the leaf shape have
something to do with what they were called? He seemed to remember
that it did. He reached down and fiddled with the radio dial again.
Still nothing. He opened the glove compartment and took out the car's
owner's
manual, thumbing through it in case something interesting had inserted
itself in the five minutes since he'd last looked. Nothing. He put the
manual back and closed the glove compartment. Then he opened it and
closed it again, listening to the satisfying 'click'. He glanced at his
watch again. Eleven minutes. Damn. Eleven minutes was plenty. He opened
the door and got out, peering over the roof of the car to the bushes.</span><br

realised that she wasn't going
to answer. He looked around again for signs - footprints, broken
twigs, anything. But he was sure she'd gone&nbsp; to the other side. He
ran across again, looking desperately for something - anything.&nbsp;
Was that a broken leaf? He looked more closely. Yes!&nbsp; He&nbsp;
parted the&nbsp; bushes. Nothing. No clearing, just more of the same.</span>

<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Amanda looked around the apartment
with a
small sense of pride. They'd been in New York City for just a little
more than three weeks and she'd managed to turn
it into a liveable, if
still slightly barren, home. Some ratty furniture had come with
it. When combined with the odds and ends
they used on the road, she'd only had to do a little junk store combing
to find the rest of their basic needs. From time to time she found
herself slipping into comparison with the place in San
Francisco. It had been airy and full of light, where the New York
apartment was dingy and
dark, and a little musty, so she stopped herself whenever it happened.
New York
hadn't been the bastion of culture she'd hoped for... at least not yet.
It was hot, smelly, and just plain loud. For Wind's sake she was glad
that
it was a temporary arrangement, though she didn't mind putting up with
it herself. Getting around was hard since she was getting round, and
she hadn't had a chance to get out and see the
galleries yet. But it was home. And every night Vincent would come back
from his day's schmoozing and they'd sit and talk about the people he'd
met, and they'd play with Wind, and share a meal, and laugh, and life
was good.</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">With a sigh of contentment she
wiggled her way off the couch and
waddled to the sink for a glass of water. The pipes shook and
rattled, and finally she got a glass of rust coloured sludge which she
stared at for a minute but couldn't quite bring herself to drink. With
a sigh, she
poured out the water and set the glass on the sink where
yet another surprise awaited. Her shrieks shook the thin walls on
either side and brought a sleeping Vincent quickly to his feet. He
surveyed the scene and stifled a laugh as he washed the two-inch roach
down the sink and helped Amanda back over to the couch as she plastered
a smile on her face in a valiant attempt not to burst into tears. </span><br

<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"Oh, I don't know," he said, pouring

Helen wasn't there. The car was parked exactly where it had been in his
dream. The bushes by the side of the road...the time of day...the bend
up ahead...identical. He reached down to pinch himself and broke out in
a cold sweat with the realisation that this was no dream. He snapped
his head around to face across the road. The same bushes.</span><br

<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Three cokes, two cups of coffee, a
large slice of coconut cream pie
each, two trips to the bathroom, and an hour and a half later, he'd
introduced himself as Paul Katz; Amanda had reciprocated, they'd
realised that they'd seen each other in the diner from time to time,
and they'd delighted in each other's love of art, before the
conversation turned to music and the theatre.</span><br

up
to see the look on her face, and he felt like kicking himself.&nbsp;
They'd been getting along so well, he had let his guard down,
and now she'd either take off, or cause a scene -&nbsp; maybe the
whole "sinner" thing or, worse yet. the "you're a freak" one.<br>
<br>
While Paul was mentally kicking himself Amanda was attempting to
process the new information. After nearly a minute of silence between
them she
finally reconnected her brain to her mouth.&nbsp; "So, what's he like?"<br>
<br>
Paul smiled, feeling a flicker of relief.&nbsp; "A
bit older than me.&nbsp; He works at a publishing
house as a junior editor."<br>
<br>
"He reads a lot then? "<br>
<br>
"Not as much as you'd think.&nbsp; He does more fact checking than
actual editing,&nbsp; but he's up for a promotion next month."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"So," she started cautiously, "you two, you're...um... together?"<br>
<br>
Paul mentally crossed his fingers before answering.&nbsp; "Yes."<br>
<br>
"Neat," Amanda replied, then returned the conversation to the theatre
as Paul breathed a silent sigh of relief.<br>
<br>
Vincent, meanwhile, trudged up the stairs, back from the park with Wind
fast asleep in a papoose on his back. As he turned the key in the lock
he heard the door behind him open.<br>

<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">He laughed and, knowing that Amanda
had been happy to leave Wind with
the genial grandmother from time to time, left them to the apartment.
As he rode the creaking antique elevator down three floors, Vincent
told himself that Amanda wasn't really late, she'd only been gone five
- well, nearly six - hours. She could spend days - weeks - at the Met.
But the rational part of him knew that, being nearly seven months
pregnant, she'd get tired after half an hour on her feet, and that he'd
expected that she'd be back a couple of hours ago at the most. The
worried human brain is that most exquisite of torturers, infinitely
inventive and possessed of a subtle knowledge of its own weaknesses.
And
Vincent, for the first but not the last time, felt its exploratory
probings.</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">

<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Amanda's gaze flicked back and forth

like a spectator at a tennis match, as she slowly realised what was
happening. Vincent was jealous. Her eyes widened momentarily, and a
thought crept into
her mind: </span><i style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Time to get even for
Dino and Sam, my Dear.</i><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> She

person! The time's just flown by," and, turning back to Paul and

<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Paul caught the wink and felt
decidedly uncomfortable seeing the effect
that Amanda's game was having on Vincent. But he decided to play along
up
to a point, and see what she was getting at. </span><br

<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"Oh yes!" he said, staring into her

guilty.</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">

<font style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" color="#009900">Amanda felt a twinge
of
guilt too at the look on Vincent's
face, but the memory of Vegas firmed her resolve.&nbsp; "Paul was
talking about going out, weren't you Paul?"&nbsp; She reached across
the table and took
his hand in hers.&nbsp; "It should be fun."<br>
<br>
Vincent's face darkened even more and he 'accidentally'
knocked their hands apart as he reached for the sugar for his iced tea.
"Amanda, could you
move over a little? There's just not enough leg room here."&nbsp; When
she
moved over, just out of hand-holding range, Vincent turned and
stretched
his legs out.<br>
<br>
Paul's eyes widened </font><font style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"
 color="#000000">as he reached
out a hand and stroked the arm of Vincent's coat.&nbsp; "That's nice,
did
you get it around here?</font><font style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"
 color="#009900">" At that moment he realized
someone was standing over their table. <br>
<br>
"John," he said, his face turning red. "Uh, this is my friend Amanda,
and her friend Vincent."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;John seated himself across from Vincent and grunted, shooting
Vincent an irritated look. At first glance Amanda took him to be middle
aged, but she soon realised that he was in his mid-twenties, but
prematurely balding, his thinning black hair surrounding a shiny bald
pate like a monk's tonsure..<br>
<br>
Paul decided that enough was enough, reached out for John's hand, and
said quietly "Amanda, Vincent, this is my...boyfriend, John." He
blushed a little, not only at the effort and the risk, but also at
having to use such a ridiculous word to describe their relationship and
wishing there was something more dignified.<br>
<br>
John turned to Paul, the look on his face posing the obvious question.<br>
<br>
Amanda, sensing that John had just played a very dangerous card,
immediately reached out for Vincent's hand. "My husband, actually." She
pulled his hand close to her and looked into his eyes with unmistakable
adoration.<br>
<br>
Vincent, meanwhile, tried furiously to cope with the last few seconds
of information. <i>Paul? John? Boyfriend? What the... Amanda...?<br>
<br>
</i>John looked back and forth between Paul and Vincent, wondering
whether there was going to be an explosion of invective or whether Paul
knew these people well enough... <br>
<br>
"It's great to meet you, John. Paul's told me all about you," Amanda
offered, hoping to move things in the direction she wanted, and to buy
Vincent a few seconds, confident about how he was going to react but
knowing that he'd need a second or two.&nbsp; She saw John relax a
little and she squeezed Vincent's hand. Vincent had had enough time to
interpret a little of the situation and, feeling Amanda's squeeze,
decided to go along, knowing that explanations could wait. He held his
hand out to John and smiled. <br>
<br>
"A pleasure, John. Vincent Lane. "<br>

bedroom was never really dark, thanks to the glow from the neon sign
above the deli across the street. Vincent turned over and glanced at
the clock on the nightstand. Two-fifteen. In the lulls between the
traffic noise that seeped through the window, cracked open to let in
whatever breeze there might be on a hot summer night, he could hear
Amanda breathing. He closed his eyes, and opened them again thirty
seconds later, the thoughts </font></span><font

it useless to try getting back to sleep. He slipped silently out from
under the single sheet that covered them, and padded the two steps over
to the chair where he'd carelessly tossed yesterday's clothes, looking
back to see that she hadn't stirred. Wind lay sprawled across his cot
in a position that would have been impossibly uncomfortable for an
adult. None of them bothered with nightclothes in this weather and,
picking up the underpants he'd worn yesterday he considered whether it
was worth risking opening the drawer to get out a clean pair, but he
decided against it. The drawer always stuck and it was sure to wake her
up. He gently picked up the jeans and t-shirt, bent down to get the
socks and sneakers from the floor, and walked silently out into the
next room, quietly pulling the door closed behind him.</font></font><span

<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">He dropped the clothes on a chair
and walked over to the fridge (the
light had burned out a week ago and he hadn't got round to replacing it
yet), took out the half-full gallon of milk and poured himself a glass.
He took a deep breath after he finished it, put the glass down quietly
on
the sink before returning the milk to the darkened fridge, and went

his brow and into his eye. He wiped it away, closed the door and
decided to take the stairs down
three
flights to the front door of the brownstone apartment block. The street
was quiet for New York, but not deserted. A dark (blue? it was hard to
tell in the dim monochromatic light) Chevy cruised slowly down the
street and Vincent glanced at the driver and his female passenger. </span><i

<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The year replayed itself in his mind
as he walked aimlessly
through the New York night. More had happened in that one year than in
the last 20, and he thought of the chance encounter that had led to the
sleeping woman and child he'd left behind, and the new life in her
belly. The encounter with Paul had rattled him more than he cared to
admit -
to himself, let alone to Amanda. He realised that, at least in Amanda's
mind, he'd probably deserved what she'd dished out, and perhaps he had.
But that twisting,
angry sensation was a feeling that wasn't just unpleasant, it struck at
the roots of who he was. The worst thing about it was that, somewhere,
deep down, he must still be insecure about Amanda, not completely
confident, afraid...</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">

<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">He turned right towards the Hudson

to warehouses as he neared the
river, and he looked
across to the lights on the Jersey shore, thinking about the diner.
Amanda's embarrassed admission that she'd
been trying to get even for the Dino and Sammy thing (even though he'd
done nothing--hadn't thought for a second that she wouldn't have
recognised them); John's even more embarrassed admission that he'd
thought that Paul was coming on to him; his own furious attempts to
take in what had been happening. He smiled again and shook his head.
Amanda had a talent for hooking up with interesting people. He thought
of the way she'd looked at him, at the love in those blue eyes, and
scolded himself for doubting her.</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">

behind them, they probably would have turned around and left. Paul led
them through the main bar into a smoky back room, filled with an
extraordinary mix of people - students, businessmen, young people,
older people - all chatting, drinking, and generally enjoying
themselves. Some were dancing on the small dance floor to the music
from the jukebox in the corner. The only thing that distinguished it
from any other bar was that some of the couples dancing were both men.

"Oh shit!" Paul said, looking over Amanda's
shoulder.<br>
<br>
John turned to see what Paul was looking at and his face fell.<br>
<br>
"What?" asked Vincent, looking around and not seeing anything more out
of the ordinary than he already had.<br>
<br>
Paul nodded towards two tall men in suits who were walking slowly among
the tables. "Cops. I think we're going to get..."<br>
<br>
"Stay where you are, please, everybody. This is Deputy Inspector
Seymore Pine of the New York Police. You know the drill."<br>
<br>
"...raided."<br>
<br>
"Again," John muttered.<br>
<br>
Amanda and Vincent watched in stunned silence as a group of half a
dozen besuited police walked calmly through the door and started
leading people out. <br>
<br>
"It's not really much more than theatrics," Paul said.<br>
<br>
"It's all so calm!" said Amanda, watching as Carlotta was led out,
seemingly happy to chat to the policeman who was leading her away.
"Somehow it's not how I imagined a raid."<br>
<br>
"Yeah," added Vincent, reaching into a pocket and pulling out a small
camera. "What do you mean?"<br>
<br>
"Will that work in here, I mean without a flashgun?" asked John,
nodding at the camera.<br>
<br>
"I might get something. I've got a fast film in it and if I push
it in developing..." he said, surreptitiously firing off a couple of
shots from table level, "I might get something usable."<br>
<br>
Paul continued. "It's complicated. The cops are actually pretty good
about it. They're under orders from higher up, and whatever the
politics are, they're not really gunning for us." He picked up his beer
and finished it. "We're the whipping boys for the religious
fanatics and the rednecks..."<br>
<br>
"And we're getting damn sick of it," John interjected.<br>
<br>
"...but the cops are after bigger fish than us."<br>
<br>
"Bigger fish?" Vincent asked, taking another photograph as the police
led one of the bar staff out..<br>
<br>
"What happened during prohibition?" John asked rhetorically.<br>
<br>
"Organised crime took over the distribution of alcohol," said Amanda.<br>
<br>
"Exactly. They're opportunists. We're easy targets for every damn
idiot looking for a fight, And sometimes..." <br>
<br>
"Okay you four, outside," said a bored-sounding policeman coming up
behind Amanda and, to her surprise, pulling out the chair for her as
she stood up. She turned to thank him but he'd already turned his
attention to another group. They stood and joined the people being
herded out under the watchful eye of Inspector Pine.<br>
<br>
"...for people like Carlotta, it gets..." Paul paused.<br>
<br>
"Deadly, " continued John. "You know what happens? No - I 'll bet you
don't," he said. "More times than not, they're raped. And that's before
they're beaten within an inch of their lives, or past it."<br>
<br>
"But..." Amanda started.<br>
<br>
"But we're attacked because we're filthy homos. Goddam
faggots. Unnatural. Against the laws of God and man. And they rape us."
He shook his head in bewilderment. Amanda saw the anger in his face,
and she saw Paul reach down to squeeze his hand as he turned back to
them. "So we don't - we can't - go to 'normal' bars. And where there's
a vacuum..."<br>
<br>
"Oh, man! I get it!" said Vincent.<br>
<br>
"Yeah. Most of the gay bars are run by the Mafia," John muttered.<br>
<br>
"Including this one?" Amanda asked.<br>
<br>
"Damned if I know," he answered. "Probably. We don't care. They're the
only places where we can be ourselves. The mob doesn't tolerate trouble
in their own joints, and that's good enough for us. I don't care who
runs the place if I can go and have a good time and feel safe doing it
- just like everyone else. I guess the cops get paid off, as usual."<br>
<br>
As the crowd spilled out onto the sidewalk Vincent could see that they
transvestites, bouncers, and bar staff&nbsp; were being herded into a
paddy wagon. But the doors were left open and the wagon was unguarded,
so after they'd been unceremoniously shoved in, the cops would go back
to get another group, and the previous group would simply get out, to
the cheers and applause of the gathering crowd. The odd flashbulb
popped as the few members of the press who'd gathered took some shots
for tomorrow's morning edition, and Vincent took a few more of his own,
out in the open about it now.<br>
<br>
"See," said Paul. "Theatrics. Tomorrow's papers'll show us being
rounded up in a story about keeping the city safe for decent people.
The politicians keep in sweet with the churches, the papers get
good shots for people to be disgusted over with their morning coffee.
Everybody's happy. And we'll be back tomorrow night as if nothing had
happened."<br>
<br>
"Except a lot of people are getting plenty pissed about it," John
added. "The Negros did, and they're winning. More and more gays are
talking about not taking it any more."<br>
<br>
They watched as a group of the girls who'd just climbed down out of the
paddy wagon lined up in a chorus line and started kicking up their legs
and singing:<br>
<br>
<i>We are the Stonewall girls<br>
We wear our hair in curls<br>
We wear no underwear<br>
We show out pubic hair...<br>
We wear our dungarees<br>
Above out nelly knees!</i><br>
<br>
As they were laughing, there was a sound of breaking glass, and they
looked up to see a second floor window shatter. There was a collective
"ooh" from the crowd as another rock flew overhead and another window
shattered.&nbsp; Within a space of moments the mood of the crowd
changed
palpably.<br>
<br>
"Shit," said Paul, turning to Vincent and Amanda. "Time to go. This is
gonna get ugly."<br>
<br>
Vincent looked around. "No - I'm gonna stay and get some photos." He
turned to Amanda. "Honey, get back home - I'll be there soon."<br>
<br>
Amanda looked around, then back at Vincent. "No - please. Come with me.
This..." She was jostled from behind.<br>
<br>
Paul grabbed her arm. "Come on, I'll come back with you. John - you
coming or staying?"<br>
<br>
"I'll stay with Vincent," he said. "He might need someone who knows the
deal."<br>
<br>
Vincent clasped Paul's shoulder. "Thanks, man - get her out of here."
He kissed Amanda on the cheek. "Get going. We'll see you there.<br>
<br>
Paul and Amanda hurried off, leaving Vincent and John to circle around
to the back of the crowd, taking photographs of the increasingly angry
scene.<br>

"Oh wow. You know what? I think his ka's been damaged," said Willow,
after Helen had finished telling her about Jake's relationship with his
father.<br>
<br>
"His car?" Helen looked puzzled.<br>
<br>
"No - his ka," said Willow, sipping her yarrow tea.<br>
<br>
"That's what I said," said Helen, who'd decided after the first sip
that she didn't really want to drink anything that tasted like
insecticide.<br>
<br>
"No, you said 'car'. I said 'ka' - kay aye - you know - his spirit -
like the Egyptian Book of the Dead?"<br>
<br>
"Oh," said Helen uncertainly. "His ka."<br>
<br>
"Yeah! The Egyptians really had it sussed. They wrote this book to
instruct the spirit about what to do and what it'd meet on its journey
to the stars."<br>
<br>
"I don't think Jake's Egyptian. I think his grandfather was German."<br>
<br>
"No, man, everybody's got a ka. And from what you say, I think Jake's
has been damaged." She shook her head. "His old man must be the
reincarnation of someone really evil - like maybe Ghengis Khan, or some
warmonger like that. He needs spiritual healing!"<br>
<br>
"Oh!" said Helen.<br>
<br>
"And I have just the thing!" She got up and left the room, then came
back a minute later and placed a small object on the table.<br>
<br>
"What is it?" Helen asked.<br>
<br>
"It's a pyramid of course!"<br>
<br>
"Uh, well, I can see that..."<br>
<br>
"But not just any pyramid. It's a crystal pyramid! It's really
powerful!"<br>
<br>
"Powerful?"<br>
<br>
"Oh yeah! You know about pyramids, don't you? And crystals?"<br>
<br>
"Well..."<br>
<br>
"Pyramids are soooo cool! They focus cosmic energy! That's why the
Ancients built them. The Ancients were Atlanteans you know! People
think that the Egyptians built the pyramids, but they didn't. Even with
all our technology today it would be impossible for us to build the
pyramids. Oh no - it was the Ancients using psychic powers. And they
built the pyramids to focus the cosmic energy into one tiny spot below
the pyramid. And crystals focus cosmic energy too - you know that the
Great Pyramid used to have a quartz capstone - that's crystal!"<br>
<br>
"Oh," said Helen.<br>
<br>
"So all we have to do is to get Jake to lie down, and we'll put the
pyramid over his third eye..."<br>
<br>
"Third eye...?"<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
"This is pretty cool," Jake said. "Who owns it?"<br>
<br>
"No-one owns the land, Jake. We're all just custodians, holding it in
sacred trust."<br>
<br>
"Oh, yeah...of course..."<br>
<br>
Grey Wolf, the </font><font style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"
 color="#009900">tall, long-haired and suntanned man who Coyote had
introduced as one of the nine members of the 'Aquarius Commune',
sighed. "Of course not everyone understands that. We have to pay money
to the capitalist who thinks he owns it. One day enlightenment
will come and peace and brotherhood will rule."<br>
<br>
"So how do you - you know - how do you get
the money...?"<br>
<br>
"We grow stuff. You know - vegetables, herbs. All organic of course.
And we sell it. We're completely self sufficient. We've got goats to
milk and make cheese and yoghurt, fruit, vegetables, all we need."<br>
<br>
As they walked around the back of the farmhouse past some outbuildings,
Jake felt something squelch under his foot. He looked down.<br>
<br>
"It's cool, man," said Grey Wolf, "it's organic."<br>
<br>
As he looked around to find an organic stick to scrape it off, Jake
heard a low chanting. <br>
<br>
"Ah, the sisters are out here. We've just finished the summer planting
and they're asking the&nbsp; blessing of the spirits of the land. Come
and meet them, Jake."<br>
<br>
"Sure!" Jake said, relaxing a little and warming to Grey Wolf.<br>
<br>
He led them round the corner to where a group of five women were
standing in a circle, holding hands. Their eyes were closed and their
heads tilted upward towards the sun, which shone hotly down in
the early midsummer's afternoon, glistening on beads of sweat.<br>
<br>
"Give us your blessing, spirits of the land..." said one.<br>
<br>
"Spirits of the earth..." added the next.<br>
<br>
"Spirits of the air..."<br>
<br>
"Of the sun..."<br>
<br>
"Of the rain..."<br>
<br>
"We give you thanks." they said together, and slowly dropped hands and
opened their eyes, smiling.<br>
<br>
"Sisters," said Grey Wolf, "this is Jake, brother of Coyote. Jake and
his lady, Helen, are crashing with us for a couple of days.<br>
<br>
</font><font style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" color="#009900">"Cool!
Welcome Jake!" one of them said.<br>
<br>
"Jake," said Coyote, "this is Clover, Snowflake, Leaf, Lindesfarne, and
Anne."<br>
<br>
They all smiled and welcomed Jake, as Helen and Willow rounded the
corner. Willow introduced Lavender, adding that the boys were in town
getting some supplies as the women left to go back inside.<br>
<br>
"Wanna look around the rest of the place?" Grey Wolf asked.<br>
<br>
"Later, man," said Coyote. "Right now I wanna let Jake sample some of
the local produce. Join us?"<br>
<br>
"Sure, man," he said. I just need to get the tools back in the shed.
I'll catch you inside, huh?" He put his arm around Jake's shoulder and
gave him a friendly pat on the back. "Good to have you here, man."<br>
<br>
"Uh, thanks," Jake stuttered. "Great to be here."<br>
<br>
Grey Wolf picked up some gardening tools and walked off with them
towards the toolshed as Jake, Coyote, Willow and Helen walked back
towards the house.<br>
<br>
"Um," Jake started. "Do they, um..."<br>
<br>
"I think what Jake's trying to ask," Helen said, "is do they
always go around naked?"<br>
<br>
"Oh, when they're invoking the spirits - of course! You have to be
close to the land and the air." Willow answered.<br>
<br>
"Or when it's hot." Coyote added.<br>

Vincent stopped reading and put the New York Times down on the table. <br>
<br>
"I'm just glad none of you were hurt." Amanda said, pouring herself
another coffee as Wind finished his breakfast bottle.<br>
<br>
"Me too. It got ugly pretty quickly once the uniformed cops arrived."<br>
<br>
"It's started then." Amanda said, getting up to put the breakfast
things in the sink.<br>
<br>
"It?"<br>
<br>
"The...marches - the fight. Like the Negros did. Paul said it's been
brewing for years."<br>
<br>
"Yeah. I guess it has," Vincent said, smiling. "If you hadn't met Paul
we'd be reading this and wondering what the hell was going on. I'm

"So whaddayasay, Jake, my man? Care to sample a little of the commune's
finest?" Coyote asked.<br>
<br>
He was sitting on a purple vinyl beanbag. Opposite him, Jake had
slumped into a yellow one under a Che Guevara poster while Willow came
out of the kitchen carrying a tray with a teapot and cups, followed by
Helen with a plate of oatmeal cookies.<br>
<br>
"Sure," Jake said enthusiastically. "I could eat."<br>
<br>
"Eat?" said Coyote, looking a little puzzled.<br>
<br>
"Yeah! You're talking about the stuff they grow, right?"<br>
<br>
"Oh! Yeah, but I wasn't thinking about eating it, unless those
cookies..." He looked at Willow.<br>
<br>
"Straight oatmeal cookies, lover," she said, as Helen put the plate
down on the table.<br>
<br>
"No, man - I'm talkin' about the kind o' produce that you smoke," he
said,&nbsp; producing a plastic bag half-full of dried dark green
herbaceous material and putting it on the table.<br>
<br>
Jake stared intently at the bag. Helen and Willow exchanged glances.
Coyote pulled a pack of Zig Zag rolling papers out of his shirt pocket.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Jake leapt up out of the beanbag as if he'd been bitten. "Oh
no! Drugs!"<br>
<br>
Helen and Willow exchanged another glance. Coyote pulled three papers
out of the packet. "Well, yeah, man. It's cool. You've never smoked
before?"<br>
<br>
Jake shook his head, nervously eyeing the bag, and glancing at Helen.<br>
<br>
"Jake, m'friend," Coyote said, "I'm gonna be straight with you. Seems
to me that you need to mellow out a little. And this," he glanced at
the bag, "is the smoothest stone this side o' the bayou. To be honest,
I think it'd do you a lot o' good."<br>
<br>
Jake backed away, staring at the bag, as Coyote stuck the three papers
together and started rolling a joint. On his third step he reached the
arm of the sofa where Helen and Willow were sitting and fell backwards,
landing across Willow's and Helen's laps, staring up into Helen's face.<br>
<br>
"Arrrrrgggg!"<br>
<br>
"Jake!"<br>
<br>
"But Helen - drugs! What would your father..."<br>
<br>
Helen glared down at him. "Smoke it!" she growled.<br>

</font><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Jake reached out and picked
up an oatmeal cookie from the tray. He slowly lifted it to his mouth,
took a bite, and slowly chewed a couple of times. He froze, and his
eyes widening.</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">

<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"Oooohhhh maaannn! This is the best

<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Helen took one and, like Jake, she

<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"Ah - they guys and the kids are

Jake.</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"Hello!" he said with a big grin. "I
Sage. Who you?"</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"Hi Sage! I'm Jake," he said,

sunset.</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"Dake! Hi Dake! Who you?" he asked,

<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"I'm He...Lavender."</span><br

<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"Lav'ner!" he said happily. "Hi
Wiwwow, hi 'Yote!"</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"Hi Sage, buddy!" said Coyote,
holding his arms out and tossing Sage up into his lap as he ran into
them. "Sage and his sister, Saffron, are Anne and Michael's kids. And
that," he said pointing to the door, is Michael."</span><br
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<font style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" color="#009900"><br>
Michael was an older version of Sage, average height but muscled, with
short, curly sunbleached hair. He carried two full paper bags which he
put down on the table.<br>
<br>
"Hi guys. You must be Lavender and Jake. I'm Michael - I see you've
already met Sage. How was your trip?"<br>
<br>
"It's only dope, man," said Coyote, giggling.<br>
<br>
"Ah yes," grinned Michael, sniffing the air. "Aquarius Ambrosia. Good
stuff, eh?"<br>
<br>
"Great," said Jake, staring up at Michael and wondering where he'd seen
him before.<br>
<br>
"Wonderful," breathed Helen, realising that she was looking at the
spitting image of Michelangelo's David.<br>
<br>
Michael looked at the four of them, then at the plate of cookies. "Oh -
Willow's oatmeal cookies - one left for me. Whaddayasay we share it,
buddy?" he said, turning to Sage and breaking the last cookie in half.<br>
<br>
"Yeah! Cookie!" said Sage, jumping down from Coyotes lap and taking the
half cookie.<br>
<br>
"Am I right in assuming that the munchies have set in?" he asked.<br>
<br>
"Munchies?" Jake asked, puzzled.<br>
<br>
"Oh wow!" said Michael. "Dope virgins! My friends, you're in luck. I
just happen to have, though you may not know it, the keys to paradise
right here in this bag." He reached into one of the paper bags and
pulled out a chocolate bar. Willow and Coyote giggled as he unwrapped
it, broke off four large pieces and handed them around, then broke of a
smaller piece which he gave to Sage, who took it happily. "Now for the
fun," he said, and sat down next to Willow.<br>
<br>
Jake grinned a vacuous grin, half his mind trying to work out where
he'd seen Michael before, half trying to remember that he was holding a
piece of chocolate (which sounded pretty good every time he thought of
it) and the other half thinking (if that was the word) that the world
was a groovy place to be. He slowly lowered his gaze to the chocolate
in his hand and concentrated on raising it to his mouth. He
bit off a square, chewed, and felt all three halves of his mind implode.<br>
<br>
Michael watched, grinning, watching Helen watching Jake. Willow and
Coyote, unable to control themselves, started laughing and Jake, his
eyes closed in a paroxysm of ecstasy, heard the laughter, opened his
eyes, and caught the laughing bug. <br>
<br>
Helen, meanwhile, had cautiously tried the chocolate. The flavour
exploded in her mouth and her bloodshot eyes widened in surprise. "Oh
my GGGOOOOOOODDDD! " she squealed, prompting another burst of laughter
from Willow, Coyote, and Jake.<br>
<br>
"There's nothing quite like
that first dose of the chocolate munchies. I kind of envy you." said
Michel, smiling.<br>
<br>
Helen stuffed the rest of the chocolate into her mouth. "Ha' you go'
any more?"<br>
<br>
"No," Michael said, "but I've got something nearly as good. We don't
usually get this crap, but I thought that the dog man might not be able
to resist letting you sample the produce, so I made an exception." He
reached into another of the paper bags and tossed her a large bag of
potato chips.<br>
<br>
An hour later they'd moved out onto the porch. The cloying scent of
honeysuckle dribbled down over
them in the still, cooling, air, deliciously spiced by the fading
effects of Aquarius Ambrosia.<br>
<br>
Willow and Coyote were sitting on a bench next to Michael and Anne.
Helen was sitting on a step</font><font style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"

sunset that was turning the sky orange and green and golden</font><span

month old toddler with hair the colour of pale honey was busy
exercising her newly-discovered ability to walk by walking as fast as
she could towards the edge of the porch, making Anne jump up and rescue
her every time she got too close for comfort. Jake was lying on his
back, his knees up in the air making a slide for Sage, both of them
laughing and giggling.</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">

The scene in The Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village<font

as accurate as we could make it. The riot that ensued marked the
beginning of the Gay Rights movement in the US.We have no idea what
"nelly knees" are - the song that the women sing is as it was reported.
The quote that Vincent
