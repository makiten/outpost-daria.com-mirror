<h2>Chapter 14: The Moon in The Man<br>
</h2>
<hr>
<p>The full moon was so bright that it washed out all but the brightest
stars, and when he
turned his head, Jake could clearly make out the colours of the
buildings and the fields beyond. But when he'd tried it
Willow had quickly gripped his temples between her hands and put his
head
back where she wanted it. She didn't speak, but the message was
clear: don't move. He could see the flicker of the candles that
Willow had placed around him as she moved in and out of his field of
vision.</p>
<p>"What are those leaves she's using?" Helen whispered to
Coyote.</p>
<p>"Rosemary, sage, thyme, a few others," he whispered
back.</p>
<p>"Is she going to cook him or cure him?"</p>
<p>"We're vegetarians, remember?"</p>
<p>"We don't have to take our clothes off do we?"</p>
<p>"I don't think so, but you can if you want to."</p>
<p>They were silenced by an icy glance from Willow.</p>
<p>Jake stared up at the moon. Soon, he thought, three men
would actually go there. He imagined what it would be like; saw himself
lying
back on his seat as a barely-controlled explosion flung him into
space, iron bands of g-force thrusting him down into his seat, each of
the five huge first-stage engines burning three tons of fuel every
second,
until the massive pumps shut down and the tin can with three men
aboard went into free fall, loosing the bonds of gravity, floating,
silently moonwards...</p>
<p>Willow's voice jerked him back to Earth with a thud. "All is
ready. Now..." He crossed his eyes trying to keep the crystal
pyramid in focus as she lowered it slowly onto his forehead. "...as
the cosmic forces are focussed by the mystical power of the pyramid,
we invoke the name of Osiris!" She picked up a book and started
reading by the candlelight...</p>
<p><i>Homage to thee, Osiris, Lord of eternity, King of the Gods,
whose names are manifold, whose forms are holy, thou being of hidden
form in the temples, whose Ka is holy. Thou art the governor of
Tattu, and also the mighty one in Sekhem. Thou art the Lord to whom
praises are ascribed in the name of Ati, thou art the Prince of
divine food in Anu... </i>
</p>
<p>The words meant nothing to Jake, and the more the tried to feel the
cosmic forces focussed by the mystical power of the pyramid,
the more he wanted to sneeze. Willow's voice droned on.</p>
<p><i>Thou art the Lord who is commemorated in Maati, the Hidden
Soul, the Lord of Qerrt, the Ruler supreme in White Wall. Thou art
the Soul of Ra, his own body, and hast thy place of rest in Henensu.
Thou art the beneficent one...</i></p>
<p>He faintly heard the exchange between Helen and Coyote, and had to
force his thoughts elsewhere. He remembered his conversation with
Helen's father.</p>
<p><i><font color="#000000">You know there are some really
interesting things about my business, Jake. The things that the right
mix
of chemicals can do when you're not properly protected</font></i>.
Y<i><font color="#000000">ou're a good chap, I think, and I'm not
silly enough to tell you not to touch my daughter. But I will say
this--if you don't do the right thing by her, there won't be a body
to find.</font></i></p>
<p>Jake had gulped and nodded in agreement. What he didn't remember,
because he'd left the room by that stage, was that Amy had spoken up
from her hiding place behind the door.</p>
<p><i>Wow, Dad! That's so cool! Which chemicals are you talking
about?</i></p>
<p><i>Amy!</i></p>
<p><i>Pickle juice? Ketchup?</i></p>
<p><i>One of these days, young lady, you're going to get yourself
into serious trouble with this eavesdropping habit of yours!</i></p>
<p><i>Yeah, but think of all the interesting stuff I'd miss! I never
realised the wholesale grocery business was so dangerous!</i></p>
<p>Jake imagined himself climbing through the command module's airlock
into
the Lunar module; feeling the silent vibration as the docking collar
released the captive Eagle; watching the command module getting smaller
as
they dropped, weightless, towards the tar-black Lunar surface...</p>
<p><i>...Thou art the beneficent Spirit among the spirits. The god of
the Celestial Ocean draweth from thee his waters. Thou sendest forth
the north wind at eventide, and breath from thy nostrils to the
satisfaction of thy heart... </i>
</p>
<p>"Jake!"</p>
<p>His eyes snapped open.</p>
<p>"You were snoring," Helen said.</p>
<p>"I..." he started.</p>
<p>"No, it's cool, Lavender," Willow interrupted. "It
means that it's worked, see! His Ka's at peace! Don't you feel it,
Jake?"</p>
<p>"Uh, yeah, sure," said Jake, who was feeling so at peace
that he would have gone back to sleep if the opportunity had arisen.
Noticing that the pyramid was gone he sat up and felt Helen put her
arm around his shoulder.</p>
<p>"You know what you two need now?" Willow asked.</p>
<p>"Sleep?" said Jake.</p>
<p>"Food?" said Helen.</p>
<p>"Sex," said Willow.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>"Um, this is a little embarrassing..." Helen nervously
fiddled with her earring as they sat on Willow's bed in the Kombi
van.</p>
<p>"Hey - remember when we used to ride our bikes around the
neighbourhood? Remember that old lady - the one we used to
think was a witch?"</p>
<p>Helen smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>"What were we? Five?"</p>
<p>"Maybe six," Helen answered.</p>
<p>"And remember..."</p>
<p>"Oh no. Not that!" Helen said, pushing Willow away.</p>
<p>"Yeah! Yeah! When you peed your pants in fifth grade? That
was soooo funny!"</p>
<p>"Not for ME it wasn't! And it was YOUR fault! You KNEW I
needed to go, and you made me laugh!"</p>
<p>"And remember," Willow said quietly, "that talk we
had after the stunt driver thing?"</p>
<p>Helen smiled and nodded again. "We stayed up all night."</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"I was so stupid."</p>
<p>"No you weren't." Willow half-turned towards Helen. "You were always
the thinker, Helen. I was always..."<br>
</p>
<p>"Impulsive?"<br>
</p>
<p>Willow nodded. "Mm hmmm. Impulsive. I never told you this, but I was
really impressed that you did something like that...on an impulse."<br>
</p>
<p>"It was stupid. I don't want to do anything impulsive again."<br>
</p>
<p>"It wasn't stupid. It was...cool."<br>
</p>
<p>"I thought it would be," Helen said sadly. "But it wasn't. It
hurt. And after it stopped hurting it hurt more when I realised how
dumb I'd been."<br>
</p>
<p>"Hey..." Willow grinned. "So you gave your cherry to some
good-looking dork. You think you're the only one who's ever done
something like that? Now you <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span>
being stupid. Stop stressing about it. It's no biggie!"<br>
</p>
"It was to me."
<p>"So," Willow said, "you want to be a little more
cautious this time. Is that it?"</p>
<p>Helen blushed. "Maybe."</p>
<p>"You really like Jake, don't you?"</p>
<p>Helen nodded. "He 'defended my honour' once." Helen said, making the
'quote' signs
with her fingers.<br>
</p>
<p>Willow sat up. "What? Defended your..." Willow grinned.<br>
</p>
<p>"Remember? The guy in the restaurant?" She paused, and Willow saw
her cheeks colour.&nbsp; "And he might just have saved
my
life a few days ago."</p>
<p>"What the...?"<br>
</p>
<p>"That guy - the one who raped the girl in Montana?"</p>
<p>"Oh yeah! He was in the paper!"</p>
<p>"I heard Michael talking to Coyote about it. I didn't realise it at
the time, but he tried it on
me when we were on our way here. Jake scared him away."</p>
<p>"You're <span style="font-style: italic;">kidding</span>!" Willow
gasped.<br>
</p>
<p>"No. Jake didn't know who it was, he was just being
overprotective. I yelled at him. I told him I could look after
myself."</p>
<p>"You yelled at him?" Willow shook her head in disbelief.<br>
</p>
<p>Helen shook her head. "I'm not going to tell him.
He's insufferable enough as it is. I'd never hear the end of it if he
knew what had happened. And don't you say anything to him either."</p>
<p>A wry smiled appeared on Willow's lips. "Hmm. Okay, but I still
don't understand. I mean...gratitude's fine, but there's gotta be more
to it than that."</p>
<p>"It's...complicated. I don't know whether I
really understand it myself."</p>
<p>"Then what's the problem?" Willow asked, taking her
hand.</p>
<p>Helen blushed again. "I told you. It's embarrassing."</p>
<p>"Helen," Willow said. "It's me. Remember?"</p>
<p>Helen paused again. "I'm so stupid."</p>
<p>Willow moved over to sit beside her. "You're one of the
smartest people I know. Whatever it is, I'm sure it's not stupid."</p>
<p>"I don't want...oh GOD this feels..."</p>
Willow sat quietly, waiting for Helen to speak. Finally, she
turned to
look at Willow. "What if...what if
he...?"
<p>"What if he
says 'that was fine, thanks Ellen. Close the door on the way out?'"<br>
</p>
<p>Helen looked away and nodded.</p>
<p>*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *</p>
<p>"Um, this is a little embarrassing..." Jake looked out
across the fields.</p>
<p>Jake and Coyote sat down on a
log behind the toolshed. "I thought you were gonna choke when
Willow laid the sex trip on you," Coyote said,&nbsp; a faint smile
animating his face. "So you and Helen haven't...?"</p>
<p>"Well...um...no," said Jake, turning to Coyote. "Not that I
wouldn't want to," he added quickly.</p>
<p>"So there's nothing wrong with the, uh, equipment, then?"</p>
<p>"No!" Jake exclaimed in surprise. "No - I
mean I don't think so."</p>
<p>"Never done it before, huh?"</p>
<p>"Yes! I mean no...I mean...sort of..."</p>
<p>"You've 'sort of' done it before?" Coyote cocked an eyebrow.<br>
</p>
<p>Jake sighed. "It's a long story. I guess I have. I mean
everything...works." <i>Maybe too well,</i> he thought. "That's
not what I'm worried about."</p>
<p>"So...?"</p>
<p>"Well, it's just that...I mean...I've only done it once, and
that was a sort of...accident..." His voice took on a
worried whine. "What if..."</p>
<p>"What if you're not good enough?" Coyote
asked kindly.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I guess," Jake said. "I really like her,
man. I mean I <i>really</i> like her. I don't want to blow it. What
if I get nervous and I can't...you know..."</p>
<p>Coyote bent down, picked up a stick, and started doodling in the
dirt at his feet. "Hm. Yeah. I get it, man. I mean who can work
out the sisters?"</p>
<p>Jake smiled.</p>
<p>"You'll do just fine, man. It's not about performance, at least not
at first. It's more about just being there, y'know what I mean?"<br>
</p>
<p>"I guess."<br>
</p>
<p>"There are a couple
of things that can screw it up. I'll give you some
hints if you want."</p>
<p>"Thanks man, I'd appreciate it," Jake said nervously.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>"Goodnight," Helen said, standing by the door of her
room.</p>
<p>"Yeah, uh, goodnight," said Jake.</p>
<p>"Goodnight, people," said Willow. "Don't worry
about keeping it down. Some of the couples here get quite, um, vocal
some nights.
We can hear them from the Kombi."</p>
<p>Helen and Jake laughed nervously and watched Willow and Coyote walk
away.</p>
<p>"After you," said Jake, holding the door open.</p>
<p>"Thanks," said Helen, turning hesitantly and walking in,
followed slowly by Jake, who closed the door behind him.</p>
<p>They stood, looking down at the bed.</p>
<p>"Well," she said.</p>
<p>"Yeah," he replied.</p>
<p>"Um, I guess we should...um, you know..." She pulled the
drawstring of the bow tying her blouse and, glancing at Jake, slipped
it off over her head and hung it up carefully in the closet.</p>
"Oh...yeah," muttered Jake. He bent down and untied his
shoes, slipped them off, and put them neatly together at the foot of
the bed before taking off his pants, folding them neatly, and draping
them
over the back of the chair by the head of the bed. Helen slipped out of
her sandals and her jeans, folded them, and
put them next to Jake's on the chair, turning and laughing nervously
as Jake, slipping out of his shirt, returned her laugh at their pants
laying together over the chair.
<p>They stood, facing each other. Helen took a
step towards Jake. Jake took a step towards Helen. Uncertainly, they
put their arms around each other, closed their eyes, and leaned in...</p>
<p>"OW!" Jake yelped, jerking back as Helen's teeth
collided with his lips.</p>
<p>"Oh Jake - I'm sorry," Helen gasped, raising a hand to her mouth as
she let
go. "Are you alright?"</p>
<p>Jake lifted a finger to his lip, pulled it away, and examined the
smear of blood.</p>
<p>She gently touched his lip where it was bleeding. "I'm
sorry," she said quietly.</p>
<p>"Helen," he said, precisely at the moment she said "Jake,"</p>
<p>"Go on," they said together.</p>
<p>"We don't have to do this," he said quietly.<br>
</p>
<p>Helen looked down at her feet. "No...we don't."</p>
<p>"Maybe it'd be better if...we...you know..?"</p>
<p>"Waited until we're ready?"</p>
<p>"Yeah," Jake said with relief. "Until
we're ready."</p>
<p>Helen looked up at him and smiled. "But I'd like it, uh, that
is if you
don't mind, I mean it'd be nice if we, um..."</p>
<p>"Slept together?"</p>
<p>And, until the morning sun woke them, they did, soundly and
dreamlessly. </p>
<p>Outside the open window a bird was singing and the new day
smelled of a fine country morning. Or maybe Jake just hadn't cleaned
his shoe off very well. Helen slowly turned over and looked at him
as he lay asleep beside her. How many guys would have taken it so
well, she wondered. How many would have forced the issue? If he had,
would it have ruined everything? <span style="font-style: italic;">Probably</span>,
she thought, feeling that
perhaps she hadn't made the wrong decision this time. <i>If only I can
keep myself from wringing his neck</i>, she thought with a
private smile, and she snuggled in next to him, enjoying the warmth of
his body.<br>
</p>
<p>Her thoughts were interrupted by a knock at the door and, as Jake
grunted and stirred, she sat up, pulled the sheet up, and said
"hello?"</p>
<p>Willow's head appeared around the door. "Well?" she
smiled.</p>
<p>"Well what?" asked Helen as Jake grunted again, rolled
over, and opened an eye.</p>
<p>"Well how <span style="font-style: italic;">was</span> it?"</p>
<p>"Muh, glmph," Jake said as Helen looked down at him,
then back to Willow.</p>
<p>"It was nice," Helen said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Nice?" mumbled Jake, confused.</p>
<p>Helen looked down at him, quietly said "Very nice," and leaned over
to kiss him.</p>
<p>"And that," said Willow, "looks like my cue to
leave. See you at breakfast. Don't be too long, we've got some
travelling to do today," and she closed the door.</p>
<p>"What was nice?" asked Jake. "Did she mean...did
we...oh my God! Helen! I can't remember!"</p>
<p>"No, Jake," Helen sighed. "We didn't. I meant it
was nice sleeping with you!"</p>
<p>"Oh," said Jake, grinning sheepishly.</p>
<p>"Though it might not be a bad idea if we let Willow think...that we
did more than that, okay?"</p>
<p>"What did she mean about 'we've got some travelling to do'?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I forgot. Willow and I were talking about taking a drive
into the state capital and..."</p>
<p>Jake sat bolt upright. "What? But Helen! We can't go anywhere
today! Don't you know what today is?"</p>
<p>"Sunday?"</p>
<p>"Helen!" Jake exclaimed, his eyes wide. "Today's
the day they land on the moon!"</p>

bubble gum on knotty pine?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, great."</p>

<p>Vincent, lying on the sofa with his head on what remained of her

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>"It has a stark beauty all
its own" </i></font>
</p>
<p>"He blew it! Did you hear what he said?"</p>
<p>"That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for
mankind?"</p>
<p>"No, I bet that's what he meant to say, but he said 'one
small step for <i>man</i> - not <i>a man</i>'."</p>
<p>Vincent smiled. "Subtle, but I get it. It doesn't matter. But
imagine how much pressure he's under. I'd probably say something like
'Hey - I'm walking on the goddam moon!'"</p>
<p>Amanda laughed. "Yeah, you probably would."</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Are you getting a TV picture now

eyes shining with delight.<br>

<br>
<hr style="width: 25%; height: 2px;"><br>
<br>
And so, taking leave of their friends at the Aquarius Commune, Helen,
Jake, Willow, and Coyote set off westwards in search of America. In the
first hour on the road hardly a word passed between Helen and Jake as
they followed the floral Volkswagen along summer roads. From time to
time Helen glanced at Jake, once to find him glancing at her, and
smiling, and she reached a hand across and squeezed his. When the sun
was high overhead they turned into a picnic area where concrete tables
and benches were shaded by shingled shelters, where tall poplars marked
the line of a stream that trickled lazily through the midday heat. They
sat in the shade as Willow brought out a picnic basket that the commune
members had packed for their trip. <br>
<br>
"This is so cool," Helen said as they watched Willow take out a loaf of
bread that
had been baked that morning, a bowl of tomatoes picked fresh from the
vine, a cucumber, various sprouts, carrots, and a soy bean loaf.
<p>"Special people, Lavender," said Willow. "Huh? What the..." She took
out a paper parcel and read a message hastily written on it. "It says
'This is not to say we approve'." She unwrapped the paper to reveal a
dozen slices of ham and another note. 'We hope you enjoy it, Jake. Try
to remember that you don't need meat.' "It's signed Michael". Willow
smiled while Helen tried to look vaguely disapproving </p>
Jake grinned and tore off a piece of ham and tasted it. "Oh wow! This
is
great! What a guy!"<br>
<br>
They ate well. As Jake was just deciding whether to make himself
another
ham and tomato sandwich, Coyote looked round. "Hey - what was that?"<br>
<br>
"What was what?" Willow asked, taking a bite out of an apple.<br>
<br>
Coyote put his finger to his lips and they held their breaths.<br>
<br>
"I heard it!" Said Jake, and he stood up and looked around. "There!" He
pointed and started walking slowly and quietly towards the source of
the sound, the others following.<br>
<br>
"It's a puppy!" Willow exclaimed as they started running towards the
sound, finally arriving at a concrete drain sunk into the ground and
half-covered by brambles. The puppy's whimpering echoed in the&nbsp;
drain as they cleared away some of the tangled branches in front of it.<br>
<br>
Coyote knelt down and tried to encourage it. "Here, puppy, come on.
Nice puppy!"<br>
<br>
The whimpering changed to a happy yapping, but&nbsp; there was no sight
of the dog. Jake stuck his head down the drain. "I can't see it.
There's a bend down there."<br>
<br>
"The poor thing," said Helen. "It must be stuck."<br>
<br>
"It's probably been abandoned," growled Coyote. "There's nothing for
miles around here. Someone must have dumped it." <br>
<br>
"Bastards," said Willow. "We can't just leave it there."<br>
<br>
Jake stood up. "I'm gonna see if I can get in there. I think I could,
it's narrow here but it gets wider farther down. Hold my feet, man," he
said, lying down in the ground and starting to wriggle forward into the
drain. The yapping stopped. "Here fella. Good dog. Come to Jakey!" he
said wriggling farther in. The puppy started whining again. <br>
<br>
No-one noticed that Willow had run back to the picnic table and
returned with the rest of the ham. She took it out of the paper
wrapping and leaned in past Jake's legs. "Here puppy," she called,
waving the ham in the air. For a second there was silence. Jake turned
to see what was happening, and almost immediately a small brown pup,
yapping happily, bounded out of the drain, using Jake's back for
purchase, across his legs, and into Willow's arms where it hungrily
swallowed the ham and started licking her face, its tail wagging
furiously.<br>
<br>
Startled by the suddenness of the puppy's appearance, Coyote let go of
Jake who promptly slid down into the drain and landed in a pool of
stagnant water, yelling "Gaaaahhhh" as he went.<br>
<br>
"Oh shit!! Sorry, man," Coyote exclaimed, leaning into the drain and
reaching out a hand to Jake. Willow and Helen hardly noticed, cooing
over the puppy, as Jake clambered up out of the drain, dripping
noisome greenish liquid. "Far out - you're gonna have to get out of
that gear, man," Coyote observed unhelpfully.<br>
<br>
"Thanks," Jake scowled, holding out his hands as the water dripped from
his sleeves.<br>
<br>
"Oh Jake!" Helen said. "Look! Isn't he gorgeous?" And then, tearing her
eyes away from Willow and the pup, she looked over at the dripping mess
that was Jake, and stifled a laugh. "Oh, Jake! Come on. Let's
get you some dry clothes," and she led him, dripping, back to the cars
as Willow and Coyote fussed over the
pup. <br>
<br>
Helen rummaged around in the trunk of the car and brought out some
clean clothes. As she handed them to him, her nose wrinkled. "Eewww.
You're going to have to wash - you can't ride in the car like that,
clean clothes or not. Come on." She led him over to where the stream
ran clear and fast around a jumble of water-worn rocks and
boulders.&nbsp; It looked cool and inviting, and the fact that he had
no choice made Jake's decision easy.<br>
<br>
"Okay. Just leave my clothes here. I'll wash off," he said.<br>
<br>
Helen walked back to the cars, where Willow was sitting on the grass
playing with the pup. As she approached, it turned, jumped off Willow's
lap and bounded towards Helen, who picked it up and held it out as it
wagged its tail furiously and tried to lick her face. "Oh you cute
thing," she cooed, bending down and putting it back on the ground.<br>
<br>
Coyote walked over to pat it, but the pup stopped wagging and backed
away nervously. "Wow," said Coyote. "I bet the poor little tyke's had a
hard time from some guy. He's OK with you chicks, but he's really leery
of me."<br>
<br>
"Leary!" exclaimed Willow! "Yeah! That's what we'll call him! Here,
Leary, here boy."&nbsp; He bounded over to her and leapt into her arms,
wagging again.<br>
<br>
"Where's Jake?" asked Coyote.<br>
<br>
Helen flicked her head in the direction of the stream. "Washing off."<br>
<br>
"Ah. Cool. What's the stream like?"<br>
<br>
Helen described it.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
Jake lay back in the cool, crystal-clear water, feeling the heat of the
summer's day drift away with the stench of the stagnant water. He
looked
up at the sky, at the trees, at the green bank, listened to the trickle
of water tumbling over rocks, and felt totally relaxed and
at peace. He
closed his eyes in ecstasy.<br>
<br>
Suddenly the pup's yapping made him sit up and, before he realised what
was happening, Willow and Coyote ran, naked and laughing,
into the stream.<br>
<br>
"Hey, man - this is so cool! You weren't gonna keep it all to yourself
were you?" Coyote hooted, scooping up a handful of water and splashing
it over Willow, who ran at him and pushed him over into the pool beside
Jake.<br>
<br>
Helen, holding Leary, walked up to the bank and stood, watching. The
pup jumped out of her arms and stood on the bank, barking
and wagging, clearly wanting to join the fun. Helen
watched as Coyote swung his arm round through the water, splashing the
surprised Jake,
whose expression suddenly turned from embarrassed surprise to outrage
as
he spat out a mouthful of water. He stood and ran towards Coyote,
pulling him down into the pool as Willow, laughing, dived in beside
them. <br>
<br>
From the bank, Helen looked down at Leary, up at the hot sun high
overhead, across at
the three people frolicking in the cool water, and sighed.<br>
<br>
Jake turned and froze, watching transfixed as Helen, leaving her
clothes in
a pile on the bank, picked up Leary and walked across the rocks to
the pool. Willow and Coyote smiled at each other, quietly crept around
beside the hypnotised Jake, dived under the water and grabbed him
around the knees. Helen squealed with laughter and Leary yapped
excitedly as Jake fell backwards into the water.<br>

"Honey, I...whoa." Amanda's gaze froze Vincent in his tracks. "Um,
what...?"<br>
<br>
"'Some music festival. I don't know much about it.'"<br>
<br>
"Oh. That. Well, yeah, so what's...?"<br>
<br>
"Look." Amanda threw the newspaper at him. He caught it and read. "Oh,"
he said.<br>
<br>
"Yes. 'Oh'. So tell me, Mister Lane, who's playing at this 'some music
festival'?"<br>
<br>
"Um, well..."<br>
<br>
Amanda snatched the paper from him and read, speaking each name
individually. "Joan Baez. The Band. Paul Butterfield. Canned Heat. Joe
Cocker. Country Joe and the Fish. Credence Clearwater Revival. Crosby
Stills and Nash. The Grateful Dead..."<br>
<br>
"Yeah, okay, I know..."<br>
<br>
"I haven't finished," she said icily. "Arlo Guthrie. The Incredible
String Band. Jimi Hendrix. <span style="font-style: italic;">Jimi
Hendrix for God's sake!</span> Jefferson Airplane..."<br>
<br>
"Honey..."<br>
<br>
Amanda looked up at him over the top of the newspaper, ice and fire in
her gaze. "<span style="font-style: italic;">Janis...Joplin</span>.
Melanie Safka. Santana. John Sebastian. The Who. Johnny Winter..."<br>
<br>
Vincent sighed. "Okay, enough. I know it's not just some festival, but
Amanda..."<br>
<br>
"But Amanda? But Amanda WHAT?"<br>
<br>
A pained expression appeared on his face. "Amanda, you're..."<br>
<br>
"The biggest freakin' music festival EVER. 'Just some music festival'?
And you thought you were going to get away without taking me?"<br>
<br>
"But honey..."<br>
<br>
"But NOTHING, Vincent Lane."<br>
<br>
"Amanda. For God's sake..."<br>
<br>
"Yes! I know! I'll be three weeks away from giving birth..."<br>
<br>
"Two weeks and three days to be precise...."<br>
<br>
"Stop splitting hairs!<br>
<br>
"It's not splitting hairs, Amanda. Two weeks and three days is just
too..."<br>
<br>
"Lightning doesn't strike twice in the same place, Vincent! This
one'll probably be two weeks late, and if you think that I'm going to
miss the chance to see all those bands - <span
 style="font-style: italic;">not to mention Janis</span> - then you're
crazier than I think you are!"<br>
<br>
"This is not something we're going to discuss, Amanda." Vincent said
sternly.<br>
<br>
Amanda wilted. She stood, staring at him, frozen, mouth half-open as if
ready to reply, the colour draining from her face.<br>
<p style="font-style: italic;">"This is not something we're going to
discuss, Amanda. Your Aunt's
expecting you. You leave in the morning."</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">"But I..."</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">"ENOUGH! You've done your part in this,
you and...whoever got you
into this mess! Now..."</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">"His name's..."</p>
<span style="font-style: italic;">"I SAID ENOUGH!"</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<br>
Amanda lifted a hand to her face, feeling the heat of her father's
handprint. The last year vanished; she was a frightened little girl
again, missing the certainty of her parents and her home, and the
weight of her loss descended on her.<br>
<br>
Vincent watched, horrified, not understanding what had happened, but
sensing that it had been something terrible. Against her courage and
strength of will there was a fragility in Amanda that lay buried,
waiting for a trigger, always waiting in the sadness behind those
Wedgwood-blue eyes. He stepped forward, uncertain about how to react,
and gently held her half-expecting that she'd be tense, but she was
limp, as if the will had gone out of her. He put his arm around her and
stroked her hair, feeling their son move again inside her and the
pressure of her painfully swollen breasts against him, and he felt as
if
he'd just kicked her.<br>
<p>He kissed the top of her head. "Honey?"<br>
</p>
<p>She put her arms around him, her head bowed.<br>
</p>
<p>"Amanda?"<br>
</p>
<p>She looked up into his face. Though there had been no external sign,
her face was wet with tears.<br>
</p>
"Honey! I'm sorry," he breathed, his heart aching,
and he kissed her forehead. "I'm sorry. Look - you're probably right. I
mean, what're the odds that..."<br>
<p>Amanda shook her head. "It's not that. It was...what you said."<br>
</p>
<p>"What did I say?" he asked, recollection of specific words lost in
the reaction they'd caused.<br>
</p>
<p>"You..." she sniffed "...it was what my father said...when..." The
tears welled in her eyes. "...and I tried to call him from Vegas, but
the number was disconnected, and..."<br>
</p>
Amanda had never told him the details of that day, or about the phone
call to her parents from Las Vegas. As the story unfolded two
resolutions took immutable form in Vincent's mind. Amanda was going
with him to
Woodstock, no matter what the consequences. And after that, as soon as
they possibly could, they were going to find her parents.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 25%; height: 2px;"><br>
<big><big><big><big><big><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></span></big></big></big></big></big>"The
Sink?"<br>
<br>
"Sure," said Jake, looking up at the sign.<br>
<br>
Willow screwed up her nose. "Somehow I doubt that they do soy bean and
lentil casserole."<br>
<br>
"They do beer," said Coyote happily.<br>
<br>
"They probably do salads," Helen sighed. "And I suppose we'll have to
make some concessions to the
presence of <span style="font-style: italic;">two</span> carnivores in
our caravanserai."<br>
<br>
"Yeah," Jake beamed. " Besides, when in Boulder, do as the, um,
Boulders do."<br>
<br>
"Now you be good," Willow told Leary, pouring him a bowl of water and
putting him back in the Kombi. "We'll be back in a little while with
some meat." The word dripped distastefully off her tongue, and she
closed the sliding door as Leary yapped disappointedly.<br>
<br>
"I'll leave the window down a little for him, so he can get some fresh
air," said Coyote, opening the front door and winding the window down.<br>
<br>
As they walked through The Sink Jake looked around in amazement at the
walls decorated with beatnik and hippie murals, and he thought about
Baker's Bar where they'd gone for Willy's stag party. As he led them
down
the back to a table just like the one they'd sat at that night he
wondered how things were going for Willy and Hilda.<br>
<br>
"Okay! Beer!" said Coyote, interrupting Jake's train of thought. <br>
<br>
Several beers, some sloe gins and Coke, three surprisingly good salads,
and half a Sinkburger later (the other half being wrapped in a paper
napkin
for Leary) the well-fed group headed for the door.<br>
<br>
"It's gonna get cool pretty quickly at this altitude, we'd better head
out to find somewhere to camp for the night," Coyote suggested.<br>
<br>
"Yeah," said Jake. "I'll see you guys outside - I gotta visit the
bathroom."<br>
<br>
He pushed through the pine door marked "Buckaroos", next to the one
marked "Buckarettes", and attended to his needs. As he stood at the
basin washing his hands a short, thin, dark-haired man at the basin
beside him spoke.<br>
<br>
"Now you look like a man who appreciates the finer things of life."<br>
<br>
Jake turned. "What? The finer things...?"<br>
<br>
The man looked around to make sure no-one was watching. "Nature's
bounty, my friend, the blessings of mother Earth," he said
conspiratorially.<br>
<br>
"Oh," said Jake. "Yeah! Colorado's beautiful alright. We're gonna spend
a little while here and see the Rockies."<br>
<br>
"Wha...oh! Oh yes, truly one of the wonders of the world, my friend.
But I was thinkin' more along the lines of Mother Nature's more, how
can I say this, more mind-expanding bounties!"<br>
<br>
Jake suddenly realised what the man was talking about and he grinned.
"Ohhh! I get it!"<br>
<br>
The man smiled. "I knew you would. You know, my friend..."<br>
<br>
"Jake," said Jake.<br>
<br>
"Jake! It's a real pleasure. The moment I saw you, Jake, I said 'Petey,
now there's a man of the world.'" He looked Jake in the eye. "I can
tell a man who's known the depths and the heights of human experience,
Jake, and when I saw you I knew you were such a man. It's in your eyes."<br>
<br>
"Well..." said Jake, blushing, "I guess..."<br>
<br>
"No, don't say any more Jake," Petey said, looking around again, "Men
like you and me, we understand each other. We have an unspoken bond, a
special kinship that only men of the world have, right?"<br>
<br>
"Uh, I guess," Jake said, uncertain of where all this was going.<br>
<br>
"And that's why, when I saw you, I knew that I was going to offer you a
chance to share in my good fortune."<br>
<br>
"Good fortune?" Jake asked.<br>
<br>
"Mother Nature's bounty, Jake, my friend." He looked around again, and
reached into his pocket, taking out a plastic bag full of green plant
material.<br>
<br>
Jake's eyes widened.<br>
<br>
"Now Jake, I know a man like you's heard of Acapulco Gold, am I right?"<br>
<br>
"Aca - oh, yeah, sure," Said Jake, lying, but not wanting to appear
naive.<br>
<br>
"Well," said Petey, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper,
"I'm willing to bet that you know exactly what this is. Not many people
would, of course, but you, Jake, I suspect, know exactly what you're
looking at. Am I right?"<br>
<br>
"Uh, well, I, uh, I don't..."<br>
<br>
"I know! I know!", Petey said, grinning. "You don't want to show off. I
knew you'd be modest&nbsp; too, Jake, the moment I saw you. And I know
exactly what you're thinking. You're thinking, and you're right of
course, that a bag of Rocky Mountain Green like this would be worth at
least two hundred dollars!"<br>
<br>
"Two hundred..." Jake said, choking on the words.<br>
<br>
"And you'd be right of course, Jake. Probably closer to four hundred,
wouldn't you say?" He looked at Jake and waited for an answer.<br>
<br>
"Oh. Uh, yeah! Rocky Mountain Green. Four hundred, sure!" said Jake,
warming to the task.<br>
<br>
"But Jake," Petey continued, "like I said, you and me, we have a bond.
Just like the bond between brothers." He looked intently at Jake. "And
between brothers, money is meaningless. Am I right?"<br>
<br>
"Meaningless..." Jake muttered, staring at the bag.<br>
<br>
"Exactly. Meaningless. And that's why I'd like you to have this, as a
gift, from one brother to another."<br>
<br>
Jake looked up into the narrow, beady eyes. "A gift?"<br>
<br>
"A gift." Petey nodded.<br>
<br>
"Well, I don't..."<br>
<br>
"Jake!" I should have known. I'm so sorry!"<br>
<br>
"Sorry...?"<br>
<br>
"Now look at what I've gone and done! I've insulted you!"<br>
<br>
"Insulted...?"<br>
<br>
Petey put his hand on Jake's shoulder. "I'm truly sorry, Jake! I should
have know that a man like you would be insulted by my suggestion that
you wouldn't want to contribute to my expenses. I'll tell you what.
Just to make you feel better,&nbsp; I'll let you give me a token, what
they call a peppercorn, just so's you can feel that you actually paid
for it. I mean you and me, we'll both know that it was a gift, but your
conscience, well, I don't want my brother's conscience prickin' him. No
way. I couldn't live with m'self if I did that!"<br>
<br>
"Oh," said Jake, "I'm not..."<br>
<br>
Petey laughed. "Jake, you know what they say about Rocky Mountain
Green."<br>
<br>
"Say?"<br>
<br>
"Yeah - you know - they say that when you smoke Acapulco gold you see
stars, but when you smoke Rocky Mountain Green you see the planets and
the galaxies too! But I know what you're thinking, Jake."<br>
<br>
"You do?"<br>
<br>
"Of course I do! You're not thinking of yourself! And isn't that just
like a guy like you? You're thinking of those friends of yours out
there! You're thinking about the look on their faces when you show them
what you've got here. You're thinking about how they're not gonna
believe how sharp you are! What a sharp bargain you struck with ol'
Petey - gettin' - what - five hundred dollars worth of the most famous
herb on the planet for, oh, I dunno, let's just say fifty bucks. And
you're gonna feel real bad because they'll think you took advantage of
your brother - and a man like you, a man o' the world, well you'd never
take advantage of anyone. You an' me, Jake, we're so alike I can just
tell that you're thinkin' that, 'cause that's exactly what I'd be
thinkin' myself. Right?"<br>
<br>
"Uh, right," Jake said, thinking nothing of the sort, but thinking how
cool it'd be to be able to offer some Rocky Mountain Green around, and
to tell them what a sharp bargain he's struck with this dumbass he'd
met in the john.<br>
<br>
"Well Jake, I don't want you to feel bad. I don't mind at all, because
I'll know that my brother Jake is smoking the very finest herb that
Mother Nature put on the planet. But Jake, I'm holdin' you up - your
friends are probably worried about where you are." He thrust the bag
into Jake's hand. You get along now, and all I ask is that when you're
blissed out on this miraculous weed, you think of your brother Petey."<br>
<br>
Jake thrust his hand into his pocket, pulled out his wallet, and thrust
a fifty into Petey's hand.<br>
<br>
"I've put a pack of rolling papers in there for you, Jakey. God speed,
brother, God speed." said Petey, as Jake thanked him and hurried out.<br>
<br>
He hurried across the road to where Willow, Helen and Coyote, were
standing around, and put his hand in his pocket. "Hey, guess what I
just..."<br>
<br>
"Jake," interrupted Coyote, "it's Leary! He's gone, man!"<br>
<br>
"Because you left the window down enough for him to get out!" added
Willow in an accusatory tone.<br>
<br>
Helen stamped her foot. "Stop it you two! We'll argue about whose fault
it is later. Jake - you stay here with the car in case he comes back.
Willow, you take that way," she pointed down the street, "Willow, you
look down the block there, and I'll take the road behind us. He's only
tiny, he can't be far away." <br>
<br>
Jake watched them go, looking up and down the street. It was starting
to get dark and, even though it was mid summer, at that altitude the
air
was starting to take on a chill. <span style="font-style: italic;">I
hope they find the poor little guy,</span> he thought as he climbed
into the passenger seat of the Kombi and closed the door. He sat,
quietly chuckling to himself, thinking what a chump Petey had been. He
took out the baggie and looked at it. <span style="font-style: italic;">Wow,</span>
he thought. <span style="font-style: italic;">Five hundred bucks worth
of Rocky Mountain Green! I can't wait to see the look on Coyote's face
when he sees this.</span> He opened the baggie and put his nose to it,
inhaling the rich, earthy aroma. <span style="font-style: italic;">Hm,</span>
he thought, <span style="font-style: italic;">I guess it wouldn't hurt
to sample just a little.</span><br>
<br>
He reached into the bag and took out the packet of Zig Zag rolling
papers that Petey had given him, removed a paper, sprinkled a little of
the dried vegetation on it, rolled it inexpertly into a thin cigarette,
and
twisted the ends. <span style="font-style: italic;">Dammit,</span> he
thought. <span style="font-style: italic;">No matches</span>. He
turned around and looked on the back seat, to see a matchbook, smiled,
and reached over to it. He lit up, and inhaled deeply. The smoke was
acrid and it burned, unlike the smoothness of Aquarius Gold, and he
coughed, clutching his chest. <span style="font-style: italic;">Dammit!</span>
he thought. <span style="font-style: italic;">This must be really
powerful stuff!</span> He took another cautious puff, and managed to
keep it down, then another. Then he waited. <br>
<br>
A vague feeling of dizziness made him smile. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Ah. It's coming on.</span> He looked up. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">No stars.</span> And the a thought struck
him. <span style="font-style: italic;">Dammit! How could there be
stars? You're inside the car!</span> He opened the door and stepped out
onto the sidewalk. The sky was getting dark, and the Rocky Mountain air
was clear and cloudless. Even though there was still some light from
the setting sun the stars were starting to show, clear and bright. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">That guy was right - they look so big out
here.</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">I'm not seeing any
galaxies though.</span> He pulled the baggie out of his pocket and eyed
it. <span style="font-style: italic;">Hm, I wonder if this stuff
really works?</span><br>
<br>
A hand fell on his shoulder, and he looked around to see the grinning
face of a corpulent, red-faced man in a blue checked flannel shirt,
holding out a silver star badge embossed with the words "Deputy
Sheriff" and "County of Boulder Colorado".<br>
<br>
Jake stood there, holding a plastic bag full of Rocky Mountain Green in
one hand and the smoking end of a thin joint in the other, staring in
dismay. <br>
<br>
"What is it you hippies say? You're broken? Nah - that ain't it. You're
snapped? Oh yeah! I remember! You're busted!" He laughed and put the
badge in his pocket. <br>
<br>
"Now this here's what the judge's gonna call an open an' shut case.
I'll just take the evidence," he said, indicating the baggie in Jake's
hand. "You can drop that," he added, looking at the joint, "or finish
it, it don't make no difference t'me. There's enough evidince in that
there bag t'privide you with free board 'n' lodgin' for quite a while."<br>
<br>
Jake was stunned, unbelieving. His mind was racing at a million miles
an hour. He pictured himself in a black and white striped suit, a ball
and chain around his ankle, swinging a sledge hammer in the hot sun
while the deputy, in a guard's uniform and dark glasses, looked on with
a rifle slung over his shoulder. The deputy's expression changed from
one of pleased amusement to a scowl as Jake seemingly refused to comply
with his order to hand over the bag.<br>
<br>
"Okay, son," he said, "if that's the way you wanna play it..." and he
effortlessly swung Jake around, twisting his arm around behind him as
he forced him up against the side of the Kombi.<br>
<br>
"Aaaaaarrrgggghhhh," Jake yelled, feeling as if his arm was breaking.<br>
<br>
"Now jus' 'cause I'm a friendly lookin' fella don't mean I don't know
how t' handle you ugggghhhhhh."<br>
<br>
Jake felt the iron grip on his arm loosen and he turned just in time to
see Helen rubbing her knuckles and the bulky form of the deputy
collapsing on the ground. And it was at that point that things started
to get really interesting.<br>
