<p class=MsoBodyText>The professor was just preparing to have breakfast, and in
the domestic settling looked very nice and friendly. She even wore a bib.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;Do you want to join?&quot; she asked her guest, a neatly
dressed and shy young woman.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;No thanks, I'm sated,&quot; the later replied.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;Well then, excuse me,&quot; the professor replied, taking the
silver cup with an egg, &quot;but sit down please anyway.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The young woman politely thanked the professor and sat
down into an armchair. Her gaze passed impassively over the massive rings on
the professor's fingers. The professor, meanwhile, took-on the egg.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;You look familiar,&quot; the professor said, flicking-away a
bit of shell. &quot;Where could've we met?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;You've got a good memory,&quot; the young woman replied, blushing
slightly.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;Well, it must've been on a lecture,&quot; the professor
continued thoughtfully.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;It's simply astonishing!&quot; the guest exclaimed. &quot;Exactly
on a lecture!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;Only - on which one?&quot; the professor's eyebrows made a
bridge while his eyes grew round.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;On which you demonstrated the mask,&quot; the young woman
prompted further, using all of her store of courtesy that she was able to
generate.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;Oh yes, of course!&quot; the professor exclaimed. &quot;You sat in
the front row...&quot;</p>

<h1>&quot;Exactly...&quot;</h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;...and I must admit, it was very interesting to watch your
reaction...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoList>&quot;Happy to hear it...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoList>&quot;And I'm really happy... yes...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>They exchanged compliments for some more time till they
fell silent. The professor made a waiting facial expression and dipped her spoon
in the egg yolk. The wall-clock chimed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;Well now, professor,&quot; the young woman said, pausing a
bit, &quot;I'm not quite agreeing with your point of view.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;Well! That's nice! It'll be very interesting to hear
you!&quot; and professor settled down for some more comfort, preparing to have fun.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The guest didn't hurry with an answer, taking her time.
Clearly, that her problem area with to express her way of disagreement.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The professor condescendingly looked away, and allowed herself
to remember that lecture in all of its' details. It, indisputably, was one of
her best lectures; simply a brilliant lecture!</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>...There was quite a bit of a crowd, and the audience
reflected the professor's expectations beyond them. The audience consisted of
psychos, hysterical, and simply exalted personages, stuck on one or another
type of super-natural anomalies. The professor, known to them by her
materialistic and sceptical attitude towards those problems, looked to them as
easy prey, and they thirsted to give her plenty of ingenuous questions. The
professor silently laughed. She hated such type of people and, in her turn,
loved to see them flutter under her scientific logic and irrefutable facts. She
truly changed on the rostrum, crushing and squashing foolish illusions and
baseless beliefs.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Questions were asked about everything. The professor, her
glasses glinting, didn't miss anything. She explained, in particular, that over
ninety UFO appearances is explained as purely physical phenomena, while
everything that can't be explained is also, of course, a physical phenomena, to
understand which the humanity merely lacks scientific knowledge. Explaining the
true essence of extrasensory individuals, she explained, that there was nothing
&quot;extra&quot; about them, and everything was pure &quot;sensory&quot; - a lower limit of heat
perception and a higher speed of analysis of the received data. She showed
slides which showed the calmly rusting remains of planes that &quot;mysteriously&quot;
vanished in the Bermuda triangle. And so on. At the end of the lecture the
atmosphere in the audience was red-hot. The audience, attacked in their
beliefs, were ready to rip the professor apart. And they didn't yet know what
surprise lay in store for them...</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Suddenly for all the professor made a liberal curtsey. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;I'm a materialist,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm a scientist. And as a
scientist, I must admit that some things that can't be explained scientifically
and never will be explained, do exist.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>With those words she opened a travelling bag and exerted a
roughly made clay mask with gaping openings for mouth, nose and eyes. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;A Tibetan sage, who had advanced far in the knowledge of
the supernatural has given me this mask a gift. It represents a copy of his own
face. He loaded that mask with spiritual powers, after which she can affect the
nearby in certain conditions. Now we'll turn-off the light, I'll set the record
of ancient Tibetan spells, and you'll later share your experiences. I must warn
the audience that who doesn't trust no dark magic, should leave the audience.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>No one leaved the chamber, the light was turned-off, and
the professor started the recording. Something like a monotonous rattle of a
bass string came from the dynamic. A melody - of Buryats or someone similar -
froze blood. Soon some gibberish could be heard. A sepulchral voice solemnly
spoke in an unknown tongue of things mysterious. The letters were mostly
resonant consonants, and the words were usually monosyllable. A floodlight was
aimed at the mask, and it appeared that it spoke by itself, framed by pale
flame.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The professor observed. Many people were in prostration,
some sneezed a lot, and others shook their heads and made strange gestures. One
of the operators dropped his video camera and left, weeping. Occasionally
unreasonable laughter burst, the tension grew.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The procedure lasted five minutes. Finally the professor
stopped the recording, turned-on the light, and asked the members of the
audience to share their opinions.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>They varied. Somebody, weeping, admitted that he had felt
a powerful emanation of heat, somebody couldn't contain their tears, and some
admitted that they saw angelic choirs, while others - dancing demons. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The professor decided to finalize this.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;All this,&quot; she said, and her eyes narrowed sternly, &quot;was
a game, nonsense, nonsense. I decided to trick you so that you understood
personally the absurdity of your world-views. I made the mask myself, I know no
sage, and the recording contains only meaningless letter conjunctions. Now you
can see...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>An indignant roar overpowered her words. Many, standing
now, yelled: &quot;It's dishonourable! How dare you lie to the public!&quot; and so on.
It was better than an avalanche of claps to the professor.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;I don't know, I don't know,&quot; she replied in a sated
voice, putting all in her travelling bag. &quot;The lecture is over. Good luck.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>...All of those events, narrating which took some much time
(and space) passed in the professor's mind in a fraction of a second. Now she
had to haul her guest over coals, and every emotion left her face. She was
ready to battle.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;Well?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The spoon jerked, shaking the egg. The young woman smiled.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;You see, professor... The matter is that you - irrelevant,
for what reasons - made a number of actions. Nobody did them before you. It's
irrelevant, do you or not believe in the super-natural, you did quite specific,
perceptible manipulations: made the mask, turned-off the light, and released
certain information. Again, it's irrelevant whether or not it's genuine...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;I love the well-educated young people of today,&quot; the
professor noted with satisfaction. &quot;And with what, missy, you disagree?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;Well you know,&quot; the guest smiled, shaking her shoulders,
&quot;maybe there is no disagreement... The matter is in something else. Here's an
example: a man, who feels the urge to serve a Higher Power, sooner or later
will chose for herself that religion, that form of serving the Higher Power,
that fits her personality best of all. Maybe it'll be Christ, maybe - Muhammad
or Buddha... As an atheist, you do agree with this?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;Considering that I do deny the existence of the Higher
Power of such - of course,&quot; the professor nodded, studying her interlocutrix. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;Deny it, it's your choice... &quot;But the forces, the forces
that make a person search - they're quite real. They often merely lack the form
- the area in which they can settle... For example, I consider myself among the
servants of the negative, dark beginning. I, if you like it, a Satanist.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;Happy for you,&quot; the professor started to feel
uncomfortable. One thing - to shock a neurasthenic to her senses, another thing
- to do so to a mad-woman. She instinctively wetted her lips.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;You could've put as many ideas into your creation as you
wanted to,&quot; the guest continued, getting her inspiration. &quot;But, unknown to you,
you have created something, that before you didn't exist... I always respect the
traditional Devil-worshipping customs: black masses, kissing the goat's ass,
etc. But it just didn't relate to me. The form didn't correspond to my internal
Me. And then I saw your mask...&quot; the guest's voice shook. &quot;I beg you, ma'am, give
it to me! Back then, I experienced a sense of rare harmony. Having it in my
possession, I could've freely and completely give-in to serving the forces of
Darkness. My ideal gained its' only possible physical characteristics... Seeing
your mask before you, I'll be able to freely, with a full agreement with
myself, make our rituals... I plead you, give it to me... do you want me to kneel?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;Please don't!&quot; the professor exclaimed, rocking in her armchair.
With a nod she indicated at the big redwood cupboard with glassy windows, where
various &quot;wonders&quot; were kept. Happy that she had escape so easily, the professor
would've willingly surrendered the entire cupboard. &quot;It's there, you can take
it, and it's yours!&quot; And she indignantly re-started eating her egg.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The young woman got up. Her eyes a-glow, she reached the
cupboard, extracted her treasure, and carefully put it on the coffee table. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;There...&quot; she muttered, &quot;no, there... Let her look under this
angle... Perfection! It's perfect!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;It's so like a human,&quot; the professor uttered with a
philosophical peaceableness. &quot;To sate an empty idea with a material shape, I
mean.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;Exactly,&quot; the young woman agreed. &quot;It's like the...
emperor's new dress.&quot; She opened her handbag and began to take out new, shining
surgical implements, one after the other. They were so sharp, that their shine
alone seemed was no less dangerous to the cornea than a razor.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The egg-yolk dripped from the professor's spoon. Looking
into her widening pupils, Andrea Hecuba spoke:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;Ma'am, I beg you, if you're thinking of screaming now or
waiting for later - do not wait, do it now. First of all, your house is
standing remotely and no one will hear your screams, and secondly - I'll
personally will have great satisfaction hearing them.&quot;</p>
