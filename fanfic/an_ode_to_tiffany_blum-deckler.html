"An Ode To Tiffany Blum-Deckler<br>
(a.k.a. Mystik Spiral's Quiet Musing)"<br>
A Daria Fanfic/Poem By<br>

<br>
Legalities-Daria (and Tiffany, and Mystik Spiral) are owned by MTV/Viacom and not me. There, happy?<br>
<br>
Summary-The author takes a break from his attempt at screenplays to show that he IS a big softie and that he has a poetic soul, he just doesn't let it out very often. This is a result of Fifteen minutes of "Tiffany Blum-Deckler" worship. She's a goddess!!!<br>
<br>
<hr>
Lovely girl walking down the Hall<br>
A sparkle in her eyes,<br>
But that's not all...<br>
Her skin shines in the morning light<br>
The master of the art of Cantonese delight<br>
<br>
She appears pretty vacant, it's true<br>
Those around her think she has no clue<br>
I, however, see beyond this ploy<br>
Knowing what it is used for<br>
Too many readings of 'The Art Of War' (1)<br>
<br>
Sweet Tiffany, hiding inside herself<br>
Non-confrontational, her emotions locked on the shelf<br>
Plotting, scheming, waiting for the day<br>
When Sandi finally gets taken away<br>
To a 'rest' home by the bay<br>
<br>
The Fashion Club will then be hers<br>
She will no longer have to crawl<br>
Or hide behind a irritating drawl<br>
Her intelligence laid bare for all to see<br>
None a more competent ruler than She<br>
<br>
Until then she lies in wait<br>
Red x's on her calendar mark down the date<br>
Until that magical day of conquest<br>
She will simply ponder that...<br>
"Maybe this dress DOES make me look fat?"<br>

1) "The Art Of War" by Sun Tzu is the OLDEST Military Treatise in the world. It states, "Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer."<br>

Editor's Note- In case you can't guess, I'm a HUGE Tiffany Blum-Deckler fan. She is, to me, the most underrated member of the Fashion Club and I feel she has gotten a bad rap by everyone! I'm sorry to say this, but even this particular website is guilty of "Tiffany Bashing." I mean just look at her profile (under "Characters"). "Brain damaged" or "over medicated," INDEED!!! For a long time, I have itched to do a work of some sort, i.e. story or poem, that sings Tiffany's praises to the Max (not to be confused with Tyler), thus this little poem was born. I know it's not much, it took a grand total of fifteen minutes to complete, but it's a start. I do plan to follow up this "poeme" (British accent) with a Tiffany-fanfic, but as of yet, I suffer from Writer's Block. I would like to thank Martin J. Pollard, Crazy Nutso, Austin Covello, Renfield, C.E. Forman, Erin Mills, Canadibrit and all those OTHER excellent fanfic writers that, although I've never met them personally, inspire me to no end. Thanks, you guys! And oh yeah...<br>
