&quot;...To die; to sleep;
<P>
no more; and by a sleep to say we end
<P>
the heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
<P>
that flesh is heir to.  'Tis a consumation

devoutly to be wished.&quot;

<I>Hamlet,</I> Act III, Scene I.  She'd memorized it, awhile back.
 This'd been a long time coming, she reflected as she drew the
bath, water just above body temperature. The bath wasn't simply
bacause people who slit their wrists in fiction always seem to
do so in the bathtub -- there was a <I>purpose</I> to it.  If
she bled herself dry -- no pun intended, of course -- there'd
be some nastily-painful muscle spasms towards the end, and the
whole idea behind what she was planning was that she'd had quite
<I>enough</I> pain, thanks very much.  The water-bath was supposed
to prevent or at least mitigate that side-effect; she'd done some
pretty extensive reading on the subject.
<P>
After the bath was drawn, she took her clothes off (not much point,
really, but she preferred to be tidy about these things) and got
in.  She had a nice, fresh razor blade ready, wanting a sharp
one that could do the job quickly and efficiently.
<P>
As she sat in the water, she thought about her reasons for what
she was going to do.  There wasn't going to be any note -- as
with just about everything else these days, she didn't see any
point.  It should be obvious, really, to anyone who'd been paying
attention, not that she thought anyone <I>had</I>:  no one loved
or wanted the real her.  She'd known this most of her life, in
fact it'd been one of the first things she could remember learning
in childhood.  The pain of this realization had been enough to
cause her to build a false persona which she'd used to provide
an insulating layer between the <I>real</I> her and the world.
 She'd managed to live that way quite a number of years before
managing to delude herself into thinking someone might like who
she <I>really </I>was.  She'd let down her defenses... and she'd
paid the price.
<P>
And after that, what was there to do? Go back to living the lie?
<I>How?</I> She knew now that all she could ever show the world
was a false front, all the time, to everyone, <I>forever</I>.
 And what did that imply about what the rest of the world showed
her? No point.  Futile to go on.  Time to just end it.
<P>
Carefully the girl positioned the corner of the razor blade on
the sensitive inside of her wrist, and drew upwards.  Blood welled
up, but the wound was too shallow to do any real harm.  <I>Hesitation
cuts.</I>  She'd read about those too...the victim wasn't quite
sure of themselves the first time, or few times, they tried to
make the incision.  Or maybe they were just afraid, afraid of
the pain, afraid of the mess, not enough <I>guts</I> to do it
right the first time.
<P>
<I>Maybe no guts, </I>thought the girl, steeling herself, positioning
the blade over where her researches had taught her the ulnal (or
was it radial? whatever.) artery was.  <I>Maybe no guts, but here
comes some <B>blood....</B></I>
<P>
Just then the door to the bathroom opened.  Stupid.  <I>Stupid!</I>
 She'd chosen a time when she'd been as close to sure as she could
manage that no one would come home before...it....was finished,
but <I>dammit she should've remembered to lock the door just in
case.</I>  She looked up, made eye contact with the interloper...
<P>
<I>O God not her. Either of my parents my stupid classmates some
stranger off the street <B>anyone</B> but my damn <B>sister!</B></I>
<P>
While she sat there frozen, her sister took in the situation and
suddenly lunged across the room and had ahold of the wrist whose
hand held the razor, pulling it inexorably away from her other
wrist (who would've expected that kind of strength from her?)
despite her resistance, forcing the blade from her hand, and it
was over.
<P>
The girl looked down into the water at first, then raised her
eyes to again meet her sister's gaze.  <I>Why did you do it? </I>she
thought.  <I>You've always hated me, I disgust you.  You <B>want
</B>me dead!</I> But when she saw her sister's face, she saw genuine
concern -- no, <I>fear</I>, her sister was actually <I>afraid</I>...for
<I>her</I>? There was even an audible tone of worry in Helen's
voice as she said &quot;Rita, what the hell do you think you're
doing?&quot;
