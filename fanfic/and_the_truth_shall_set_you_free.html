<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i>A '<u>Daria</u>' fic by
Brother Grimace</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Ewwww!&quot;<br>
<br>
Charles Ruttheimer III winced as the very pretty girl - Angie, one of the
cheerleaders - accidentally bumped into him as he sat down &quot;Don't touch
me, <i>freak!&quot;</i><br>
<br>
Something snapped inside the mind of the boy known as 'Upchuck' at the sound of
the girl's voice. &quot;While my feelings yesterday may have been different...
why would I <u>want</u> to touch you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Tossing her platinum-blonde locks in a manner that made every boy in sight drool,
the cheerleader dropped the most scornful of laughs on Upchuck. &quot;Like you
don't dream about it every night. &quot;<br>
<br>
Upchuck turned away from the girl in an equally-dismissive manner.
&quot;Because I couldn't get a girl like you any other way - I'm not in the same
league as you, right?&quot;<br>
<br>
Angie started off, triumph on her face. &quot;You got THAT right.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Very well, then.&quot;<br>
<br>
The cheerleader stopped in her tracks. &quot;What does that mean?&quot;<br>
<br>
Upchuck didn't even bother to turn back to face Angie as he spoke; at tables
all around his, conversations died as other students focused on Upchucks
comment. &quot;Like all the hothouse flowers that are the lovely ladies that
attend school here, your opinion is that I'm beneath you - that I'm 'not in
your league', correct?&quot;<br>
<br>
Angie said nothing as Upchuck ate a tater tot before speaking. &quot;That goes
even moreso for the 'cream of the crop' - the cheerleaders - the most
attractive and most desirable of all.&quot;<br>
<br>
A slight snort came from two tables in front of Upchuck, where the Fashion Club
performed their daily food-avoidance ritual. &quot;The only reason the
Powers-That-Be allow you to prance about in the salacious attire you sport is
to entice us young men,&quot; Upchuck observed. &quot;To get us to try to act
in certain manners in the vain hope against hope that someday, one of you will
notice one of us, and we shall have our dream of dating a cheerleader.&quot;<br>
<br>
Upchuck's gaze flickered across the gulf to make momentary contact with Quinn
Morgendorffer - Queen Bee apparent of Lawndale High - and her 'frenemy-in-chief,
Sandi Griffin - before returning to something more interesting,... his spork.
&quot;Or a perfect teen princess,&quot; he said. &quot;That's the way the
system works... but if I finally realize there's never any way that I'll ever <i>win,</i>
then <i>why,</i> my dear, <span class=posthilit><i>should</i></span><i> I
continue to play?&quot;</i><br>
<br>
Angie stepped back as Upchuck stood up, tray in hand. &quot;If that is the only
power you have over we of the Y chromosome, and even a sordid, much-reviled
gentleman such as myself; a gentleman who has been eternally rebuffed in my
advanced and yet still sallies forth <span class=posthilit>time</span> and
again in the dogged pursuit of love...&quot;<br>
<br>
He smiled. &quot;If even such a gentleman as myself decides that you're not
worth the price or the pursuing, <i>then the eternal game is over</i> - and
you, my dearest, <span class=posthilit><i>no</i></span><i> longer <u>have</u>
any power</i>.&quot;<br>
<br>
Before she could speak, Upchuck continued. &quot;The worst part of this for
you, my pretty? I am - I <i>was</i> - the gentleman here most infatuated with
the fairer sex, and the most rambunctious in my pursuit of their attentions. If
I can divest myself of any attempt to win the affections of any of you young
ladies who are placed as examples of what we gentleman <span class=posthilit>should</span>
aspire to woo and win - and if the other average gentlemen, seeing that I can
survive and thrive without feminine companionship until I happen to come across
'someone in my league'... oh, yes, fair one. <i>Your world is about to
change.&quot; </i><br>
<br>
As Angie looked around the cafeteria, filled with boys who she would never,
ever dream of dating (although it was perfectly acceptable for them to notice
how attractive she was in her cheerleading uniform) as a sinking feeling began
to form in her stomach-<br>
<br>
- a sensation also beginning to fill the otherwise empty bellies of the four
Fashion Club members as they watched the scene unfold - <br>
<br>
- Charles Ruttheimer III dumped the remnants of his lunch into a garbage can,
placed his tray onto the conveyor belt - and stepped through the cafeteria
doors into a world unmatched by even his wildest flights of Hefnerian fantasy.<br>
<br>
