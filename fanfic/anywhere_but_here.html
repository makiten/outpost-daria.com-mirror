<p>ANYWHERE BUT HERE</p>

<p>By M Man</p>

<p>JUNE 11, 1950, JUST OUTSIDE THE TOWN LIMITS OF LAWNBURG:</p>

<p>"... and so, once gain, the State Forestry Service thanks Horace Sloane for
his generous donation of land, and I now officially declare this to be the
Horace Sloane State Forest!"</p>

<p>Generous donation, my ass, thought his grandson Nathaniel Sloane, watching
the ceremony, anonymously, from the crowd. The old coot's going to be dead
in a month and he just can't stand the thought of leaving his family the huge
fortune they would come into if old Horace had sold the land to those
developers. So he just gives it away! Acres and acres and acres of
prime land!</p>

<p>Damn him forever, thought Nathaniel.</p>

<p>-------</p>

<p>Old Horace Sloane sat in his wheelchair, watching the proceedings. He had
been asked to say a few words, but his lung cancer was now so advanced that
he couldn't even make himself heard with a microphone.</p>

<p>There's my grandson in the crowd, he thought. Damn lazy bastard Nathaniel.
The damn kid wants to live off an inheritance created by selling off the
best damn stretch of land still left in this part of the state. Damn
developers citifying everything and everybody. Well, thought Horace, they
won't do it here. They wanted to merge Greendale Township with Lawnburg
and call it "Lawn-Dale" or some such nonsense. Build those damn tract homes
for miles and miles and miles. Well, they won't do it now. Not with 95% of
the prime land turned into a state forest.</p>

<p>I've lived here the whole 86 years of my life, thought Horace, and I just
can't stand the thought of this wonderful wilderness turned into a Levittown.
I just can't.</p>

<p>No, siree, thought Horace. Lawnburg will remain the small town it always
has been and was always meant to be. Those damn developers will have to
take their business somewhere else. Anywhere but here.</p>

<p>-------</p>

<p>PRESENT DAY - SUBURBAN PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND</p>

<p>"Hey, Quinn!"</p>

<p>Quinn stopped as she recognized the voice of Callie. What did that stuck-up
bitch want *now*?</p>

<p>"Yeah, Callie, what is it?"</p>

<p>"This is kind of last-minute, but Ms. Heller wants four of us K-Hi Hostesses
at this meeting she's having over the weekend. Something about someone from
the state board of education coming to visit."</p>

<p>"On the weekend? A three-day weekend? Why? Don't they usually visit when
school is going on?"</p>

<p>"Beats me. Anyway, she wants just four of us. Set up the conference room,
serve coffee, the usual sort of stuff."</p>

<p>Quinn and Callie had been at odds ever since the Morgendorffers had moved
from Highland, Texas three years ago. Callie was the most popular girl at
John F. Kennedy High School (K-Hi for short) and seemed to resent Quinn's
very existence. Callie was also Head Hostess.</p>

<p>So why is she picking me out of all 15 K-Hi Hostesses, thought Quinn.</p>

<p>"Um, Callie, my family is going away this weekend. I'm afraid you'll
have to find someone else."</p>

<p>Callie's slight smirk told Quinn this was welcome news.</p>

<p>"Well, Ms. Heller chose four of us personally. But I'm sure Tish will fill
in for you quite nicely."</p>

<p>Yeah, I'll just bet she will, thought Quinn. She's the sort of spineless
dishrag good ol' Callie just loves to push around and make miserable.
Besides, Tish won't outshine Callie.</p>

<p>Good thing the Morgendorffers were going away for the weekend. Quinn had
had enough of Callie, K-Hi, and the Hostesses. She'd just as soon spend
a weekend anywhere but here.</p>

<p>-----------</p>

<p>CHICAGO, ILLINOIS</p>

<p>"... and so, fellow students, as we begin the activities of African-American
Cultural Awareness Week, let is remember the words of Dr. King, and judge
each other not by the color of our skin, but by the content of our character!"</p>

<p>Jodie Landon told herself not to let the applause make her big-headed, but
it was hard not to do so in this moment of triumph. Two years earlier
she had become president of the school's almost moribund African-American
Club and turned it into one of the most influential clubs at Lincoln High.</p>

<p>Getting the school board to devote an entire week to African-American cultural
awareness would be the crowning glory of her high-school years.</p>

<p>It was hard to believe that she had almost gone to neighboring Douglas High.
Douglas High wasn't in Chicago, but in the adjoining suburb. Her father
had wanted desperately to settle in the ritzier school district: "Why do we
want to move back to some ghetto?" he had protested.</p>

<p>Ghetto? The Lincoln High neighborhood was seventy-percent white and quite
upscale by most standards. Ghetto? Finally Michelle had prevailed and
Andrew agreed that having children go to Lincoln High wouldn't be a
black (ha! ha!) mark on his status as a businessman.</p>

<p>Jodie tried to imagine what it would have been like going to a 99% white
school like Douglas. She certainly wouldn't have been involved in the
wide range of extracurricular activites she was in now. She probably would
have been a non-entity, if not the constant target of racial slurs. Lord
knows what sort of grades she would have made in such an environment.</p>

<p>Would there have been an African-American club in such a place? Hah!</p>

<p>She had gone through Douglas High once, accompanying her father on a house-
hunting trip. She had gagged at the whole white-bread atmosphere of the
place.</p>

<p>Douglas High?, she had thought then. Go to school here? Anywhere but here.</p>

<p>-----------</p>

<p>HARRISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA</p>

<p>I can't believe this is happening to me, thought Stacy Rowe.</p>

<p>She was in a confidential pregnancy clinic in the seedier part of town.
She had definitely tested positive. The counselor had asked her several
times who the father was, and smiled condescendingly when she told her
that she didn't know.</p>

<p>Actually, she did and she didn't. She and her friends had gone to an
away football game in York and decided to hook up with some guys they met
there. Just a little harmless flirting, and then making out, and then
driving to a secluded area to make out more seriously ...</p>

<p>The boy's name was Andy. At least that's what he told her. He also told
her he would "pull out" in time. She thought he had. Obviously he hadn't.</p>

<p>God, what am I going to tell my parents? What am I going to do? Abortion?
Adoption? Try to be a single mother?</p>

<p>I guess they don't do shotgun weddings anymore, she thought. Stacy chuckled
bitterly at the thought. She barely remembered what Andy even looked like.</p>

<p>The counselor was coming back. Whatever the counselor advised, Stacy knew
she would do. She always did what anybody told her to do, pressured her to
do, or seduced her to do.</p>

<p>Maybe suicide was the answer. Stacy wasn't sure if she believed in heaven
or hell, but at least she'd no longer be here. And she'd rather be anywhere
but here.</p>

<p>COLUMBUS, OHIO</p>

<p>Charles "Chaz" Ruttheimer III was lovin' life.</p>

<p>Straight A's. President of his class. President of the Computer Club.</p>

<p>And, of course, boyfriend of Renee Frohman, the head cheerleader.</p>

<p>Chaz sometimes found it difficult to fathom that he had once, not so long
ago, been regarded as something of a geek. Then there had been that
fateful day in his freshman year. He was annoying the freshman cheerleaders
with what he now, with painful memory, thought of as his "Casanova routine"
when one of the cheerleaders said in a loud, teasing voice, "Hey, Ruttheimer,
Renee has a crush on you."</p>

<p>Poor Renee had almost died of embarrassment. How dare her best friend
publicly humiliate her like that, revealing that she had a thing for
red-headed guys with freckles and actually saw her geeky classmate as
somewhat cute? That was supposed to be a *secret*! But when Chaz asked her
"Really?" Renee, though blushing desperately, had bravely looked him in the
eye and said "Yeah."</p>

<p>Renee had been a skinny freshman then, and was hardly considered one of the
"hot" cheerleaders. Chaz didn't mind. She was still kind of cute, and she
liked him. A lot.</p>

<p>Not that Chaz complained when her figure filled out the next year or so.
She had gone from cute to drop-dead gorgeous.</p>

<p>Everything always seemed to fall into place for Chaz.</p>

<p>There had been that awful month last summer when his father had been up for
a promotion that would have sent him to the West Coast. Chaz couldn't
fathom starting over again at a new school. Luckily for Chaz the promotion
had fallen through.</p>

<p>With life the way it was, why would Chaz want to live anywhere but here?</p>

<p>HOUSTON, TEXAS</p>

<p>"Did not!"</p>

<p>"Did too!"</p>

<p>"Did not!"</p>

<p>"Did too!"</p>

<p>Sandi Griffin couldn't stand it anymore.</p>

<p>"Shut *up*!" she screamed at the top of her voice.</p>

<p>"Go ahead and make me!" shouted Chris, as he and Sam ran outside, laughing.</p>

<p>Sandi Griffin was reading her magazine - make that *trying* to read her
magazine - for the past hour, but had gotten nowhere with her bratty brothers
always underfoot.</p>

<p>This wasn't how she had imagined things would turn out when her parents had
divorced two years ago. Linda had moved to Austin with her new boyfriend,
the immediate cause of the divorce. Sandi had insisted on living with her
father, more to get away from Sam and Chris than for any other reason.</p>

<p>But Linda didn't exactly battle Tom over visitation rights. On the contrary,
she seemed content to dump the boys in Houston every weekend and holiday.
The better to spend more time with her 30-year-old lover-boy. Of course, Tom
had his golfing buddies and other things to do on weekends, so Sandi got stuck
baby-sitting the two little brats from hell.</p>

<p>Which is where her once-active social life had gone. Weekends were now shot
to, well, hell. Or wherever.</p>

<p>Maybe I could go live with my Aunt Vicki instead, thought Sandi. North
Dakota may be nowheresville, but as least it's not here. &nbsp;And, Sandi thought
as her screaming brothers came running back into the house, she would rather
live anywhere but here.</p>

<p>MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA</p>

<p>"Bend your knees, Tiffany! Bend your knees more!"</p>

<p>Tiffany Blum-Deckler sped across the ice rink, her coach's voice echoing
from the walls and rafters. Tatiana Kolkova was a Russian, well actually
an American now but Russian-born, and everyone knew those Russians were
sticklers for the fundamentals. Tatiana must have told Tiffany to bend her
knees ten-thousand times, and would probably do so many thousand more times.</p>

<p>Often Tiffany's mother or father attended the early-morning practice
sessions, but today she and her coach were alone in the rented rink.</p>

<p>Tiffany had been barely five years old, skating in a public session, when
Tatiana had spotted her. The coach had approached her and her parents,
and told them that Tiffany skated with an assurance and balance far beyond
her years. Tatiana was amazed to hear that Tiffany had never had formal
lessons, but had learned to skate mostly from watching figure-skating on
television. Her parents, who had taken up skating because it seemed the
thing to do in icy Minnesota after moving from southern California, had no
idea that there was anything unusual about their daughter's skating skill.</p>

<p>Tatiana knew Tiffany had the potential to be a good figure-skater, but how
good? From the start Tiffany was an apt student, absorbing Tatiana's
lessons readily. Tiffany learned best from watching Tatiana demonstrate
the various moves. Verbal instruction was often wasted on her.</p>

<p>Well, here they were over ten years later, and Tiffany had just missed a
medal in the last Olympics, finishing fourth overall. Tatiana was
determined her star pupil would get a medal in the next Olympics, maybe
even a gold.</p>

<p>Like most elite skaters, Tiffany did not attend high school with her peers,
but had a private tutor. Luckily the tutor had been a bald man when he
began to teach Tiffany, or he would have torn his hair out by now.
Tiffany, who could skate for hours and never lose concentration, had a
short attention span when it came to schoolwork. It was a struggle.</p>

<p>Worse, Tiffany was sometimes the object of snickers for her public
interviews. She had a way of speaking that made her seem even duller and
more slow-witted than she actually was. A magazine article had been written,
castigating the Blum-Decklers and Tatiana for exploiting a talented girl
and neglecting her education.</p>

<p>Tatiana shook her head. Tiffany's only chance for success in life was on
the ice. If Tiffany won the gold, she'd be set for life.</p>

<p>"Should I practiccce my spinnns?" Tiffany asked Tatiana.</p>

<p>"Not yet. More backward skating first!" shouted Tatiana in her heavy
accent.</p>

<p>Tatiana often wondered what would have happened to Tiffany if she had
remained in California, or moved somewhere else where there were few ice
rinks, or no expert coach to spot Tiffany's talent. Or if she had never
even taken up ice-skating. Her talent might have remained undiscovered had
she lived, well, almost anywhere but here.</p>

<p>PORTLAND, OREGON</p>

<p>The memory of that awful night had never left Vivian Taylor. The night that
had saved her marriage.</p>

<p>Vivian had been living in that tiny apartment, separated from her husband.
Only the formalities remained until they were divorced.</p>

<p>Then came the phone call. Her husband, his voice barely understandable,
choked out the news that their daughter Brittany had died in a car wreck.</p>

<p>Brittany was a passenger in the car driven by her boyfriend Biff Raines,
quarterback for the Pacific High Rams. It was a post-game party and Biff
had gotten drunk. Vivian would never know how strongly Brittany had
argued that she should drive Biff's car. But Biff was 17 and had a license.
Brittany was 15 and didn't. Brittany gave in. It had cost both of them
their lives.</p>

<p>Vivian and Steve decided the next day that the divorce was silly, that they
were arguing over nothing, that there was nothing more important to them
than their son Brian and his future. Their only child, now.</p>

<p>Vivian stared at the familiar tombstone and felt Steve's hand squeeze hers.</p>

<p>They both knelt and placed what Brittany would have wanted on the tombstone -
not flowers, like every other grave. No, they each placed a red-and-blue
Pacific High pom-pom on the plaque which read:</p>

<p>BRITTANY LEIGH TAYLOR
B. 1984
D. 1999
GO, RAMS, GO!</p>

<p>And below that a megaphone inscribed "P.H.S."</p>

<p>What an awful place to be thankful for the saving of her marriage - her
teenage daughter's burial plot. She wished it could be anywhere else,
anywhere but here.</p>

<p>--------</p>

<p>OGDEN, UTAH</p>

<p>When his father had been transferred to Utah, Michael "Mack" Mackenzie had
almost decided to run away from home. From what he had heard, Mormons
weren't famous for racial tolerance. Or any other kind of tolerance.</p>

<p>Well, he *was* the only black kid in Ogden Moroni High School. He seemed
to be an object of curiousity more than anything else during his first
week. But, he had to admit, no one had burned a cross or dropped an
n-bomb or asked him to shine their shoes. He had been prepared for the
worst.</p>

<p>Then had come his first football game. Three touchdowns, 150 yards rushing.
He had been named Most Valuable Player, as a sophomore, on an 8-2 team at
a school that had not previously been prominent in football.</p>

<p>Now, in his senior year, he was one of the leading rushers in the state,
and Ogden Moroni seemed headed for the state championship. They had won
their first nine games, all by four touchdowns or more.</p>

<p>And everybody at Moroni High was his friend. Or claimed to be.</p>

<p>Mack knew he wouldn't have been such a superstar if he went to a larger
high school that played in a tougher division. But it had all worked out.
And to think that he once thought he'd rather live anywhere but here.</p>

<p>SUBURBAN DETROIT, MICHIGAN</p>

<p>"Owwwww!!!!"</p>

<p>Kevin Thompson had just hammered his own thumb. Again.</p>

<p>"Kevin! Watch what you're doing!" shouted his father.</p>

<p>Kevin's mind - what there was of it - had been wandering, as usual.</p>

<p>He had flunked out of high school the year before, and gone to work for his
father's construction company. Luckily there was plenty of work in the
ever-expanding Detroit suburbs.</p>

<p>Kevin might have scraped through high school if things had gone differently.
He had been a talented football player, a quarterback, but Walter Kline,
who had been Kevin's backup in junior high, had developed into an all-state
quarterback after a ninth-grade growth spurt. Kevin was relegated to the
bench, and coaches didn't pull academic strings for bench-warmers.</p>

<p>Doug Thompson had considered transferring his son to another school district,
but the state education board had been cracking down on athletes' grades, and
no other school wanted an athletic transfer who was flunking every subject.</p>

<p>Kevin wondered why Walter Kline couldn't have gone to school somewhere else.
Anywhere but here.</p>

<p>SUBURBAN PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND</p>

<p>"Stop shrugging your shoulders, Miss Dempsey!"</p>

<p>Daria cringed as Lucretia Heller, principal of K-Hi, scolded the girl next
to her. The girls were all lined up for a surprise inspection of their
skirt lengths. By rule, all skirts or shorts had to be at least as long as
their fingertips with their arms fully extended at their sides. Patti Dempsey
wasn't quite making it, and was trying to "cheat" by not fully extending her
arms.</p>

<p>"Aha! I thought so! Well, unless you have a change of clothes in your
locker, you're going to have to go home and change, Miss Dempsey! This
*will* go on your permanent record, you understand ... "</p>

<p>Daria fought the urge to shout "Heil Heller!," which so many students at
K-Hi thought was an accurate reflection of "Lu" Heller's personality and
administrative style.</p>

<p>Daria had never failed the test since her skirts were long and her arms
short. But she resented the intrusiveness of it, the pettiness of it.</p>

<p>And she resented the hyprocrisy of it: this was Friday, and students
participating in athletics could wear their uniforms to class. The
cheerleaders' skirts barely came down to their wrists, let alone their
fingertips. Likewise the short uniform kilts the field hockey girls wore
to class. But they were exempt from the inspection.</p>

<p>Daria's sister Quinn had been sent home her first week as a freshman for
wearing too-short shorts. After that Quinn had dodged the whole issue by
wearing jeans every day.</p>

<p>Daria seethed as Ms. Heller looked her over and nodded approvingly. Daria
didn't *want* the principal to approve of her. Daria suspected there might
be an inspection today, and in science class had mischeviously asked her
lab partner, Ginger, if she might trade skirts with her today. Ginger was
a field hockey player.</p>

<p>Ginger had giggled at the thought, but said that she'd get in as much
trouble as Daria for pulling a stunt like that.</p>

<p>At least the Morgendorffers were going away for the weekend. Not that
Grandma Barksdale was so enjoyable to visit, but at least it wasn't
Providence and K-Hi.</p>

<p>Daria wondered if all high schools were like this: full of stupid rules,
clueless teachers, shallow classmates?</p>

<p>Surely things would have been different had she gone to school somewhere
else, anywhere but here.</p>

<p>------------</p>

<p>HORACE SLOANE STATE FOREST</p>

<p>"Jake, I refuse to go any further until you get that mirror fixed!"</p>

<p>Jake wondered where Helen expected him to get the rear-view mirror fixed
out here in the middle of nowhere. The mirror had fallen off an hour
earlier, while the Morgendorffers had stopped at a roadside picnic area.
Apparently the bolt and nut had become loose, and the mirror had fallen
to the floor. Too late they realized they had thrown the bolt and nut
into the trash at the picnic area in the process of cleaning out the car.</p>

<p>"Jake, did you hear me? It's dangerous to drive that way ..."</p>

<p>"Helen, do you see any car-repair shops out here? Or any sign of
civilization? Gahhhh ... !!"</p>

<p>"Jake, *you're* the one who suggested taking this short-cut to avoid the
construction on the interstate!"</p>

<p>"That's right, Helen, blame ol' Jakey for everything ... "</p>

<p>Daria was studying a road map of the region.</p>

<p>"Uh, Dad," said Daria, "we're in a state forest ... "</p>

<p>"State forest? *State forest*? Helen, did you ... "</p>

<p>"Uh, but Dad, it looks like there's a small town right in the middle of it.
Lawnburg."</p>

<p>"Lawnburg!" piped up Quinn. "See that sign? Lawnburg - 5 miles!"</p>

<p>"Jake, let's see if we can get the mirror repaired in Lawnburg," said Helen.</p>

<p>----------------</p>

<p>The first sign of Lawnburg was an old brick building: Lawnburg High School.
The date on the cornerstone was 1937.</p>

<p>"*That's* a high school?" asked Quinn.</p>

<p>"They could fit that into the auditorium at K-Hi," observed Daria.</p>

<p>"Look, Jake! A hardware store. I think we can get the mirror fixed there!"
said Helen.</p>

<p>"Sloane Hardware," said Daria. "I wonder if we'll find Horace Sloane in
there."</p>

<p>"Horace Sloane?" said Helen.</p>

<p>"The name of the state forest. Horace Sloane State Forest." said Daria.</p>

<p>"Ha-ha! You're kidding, right?" laughed Jake.</p>

<p>Jake pulled into a parking place in front of the hardware store. The four
of them all got out and walked in. Jake carried the rear-view mirror. A
middle-aged man greeted them.</p>

<p>"Hello, folks, what can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"Are you Horace Sloane?" asked Quinn.</p>

<p>I can't believe you asked him that, thought Daria, rolling her eyes.</p>

<p>"Uh, no, miss, I'm Angier Sloane, but Horace was my great-grandfather ... "</p>

<p>"Mr. Sloane," said Helen, "we're in a hurry to get back home tonight. That's
Providence, Rhode Island ... "</p>

<p>"You folks have a long drive ahead of you ... "</p>

<p>"Our rear-view mirror fell off its mount," said Jake, "and we've lost the
nut and bolt. Could you repair it for us?" Jake handed the mirror to
Angier Sloane.</p>

<p>"Sure. Let me get a bolt and nut and I'll put it right on myself," said
Angier. "Come with me and I'll get you fixed up."</p>

<p>"Daria," whispered Quinn, "look at that boy. He's cute."</p>

<p>A boy about Daria's age was sweeping one of the aisleways, coming toward
them. Helen had wandered off to check out the lawn-care aisle.</p>

<p>He *is* cute, thought Daria. Daria rarely bothered to notice such things,
since no boys ever seemed to think *she* was cute. To her surprise the boy
smiled broadly at her.</p>

<p>"Hi, there," he said, "you girls from out of town?"</p>

<p>"Uh, yeah," said Daria, "Rhode Island." Daria felt herself smiling at him,
and blushing slightly as well. What was going on?</p>

<p>"Well, that's definitely from out-of-town," grinned the boy. "I'm Tom."</p>

<p>"Uh, I'm Daria. And this is my sister Quinn. We're getting our rear-view
mirror fixed so we can get home tonight."</p>

<p>"Yeah, my dad will have you back on the road in no time."</p>

<p>"Your dad?" Quinn butted in. "So you're related to the state forest, too?"</p>

<p>Daria smirked. She knew what Quinn wasn't used to being ignored by a cute
boy, especially one paying more attention to Daria.</p>

<p>"Uh, well," said Tom, "I guess you could say that. Horace Sloane was my
great-great-grandfather. He owned lots of land around here and donated it
to the state. My grandfather always said we could have been rich if Horace
had sold it to developers. But my dad owns his own business, so we're not
doing too bad. At least Dad doesn't work for the mill. They keep laying
people off."</p>

<p>"But if too many people are layed off," asked Daria, "aren't you afraid that
your dad's store won't have enough business?"</p>

<p>"Afraid?" said Tom, a smile forming on his face, "Nothing is to be feared;
it is only to be understood."</p>

<p>Daria hesitated a moment and smiled back. "That's from Marie Curie!" she
said.</p>

<p>"Who's *she*? An actress?" asked Quinn. Tom and Daria didn't even notice
Quinn.</p>

<p>"Yeah, Marie Curie," said Tom. "how did you know that?"</p>

<p>"Who is John Galt?" Daria fired back, grinning.</p>

<p>"Ayn Rand! Atlas Shrugged!" said Tom.</p>

<p>They both laughed.</p>

<p>"Ahem!!" came a voice from behind Daria.</p>

<p>Daria turned to see a black-haired girl about her own age.</p>

<p>"Oh, hi, Jane," said Tom, a bit guiltily.</p>

<p>The black-haired girl stepped up beside Tom and took him by one arm.</p>

<p>"Tom's my boyfriend," said the girl, "and you city girls can just ... "</p>

<p>"Jane, these are *customers*," pleaded Tom.</p>

<p>"Excuse me?" said Daria, beginning to anger, "Are you saying that we've come
here all the way from Rhode Island to steal your boyfriend?"</p>

<p>"I don't care if you're from Fantasy Island," said Jane. "Just leave Tom
alone."</p>

<p>"Gawd, you're scare-a-noid!" said Quinn.</p>

<p>"That's 'paranoid'," said Daria.</p>

<p>"What-*ever*!" said Quinn.</p>

<p>Helen came up and interrupted them. "Girls, the mirror's fixed and your
father's paying Mr. Sloane right now. We're going to get back on the road."</p>

<p>"OK, Mom," said Daria. "Good to meet you, Tom." She deliberately ignored
Jane, who was staring bullets at her.</p>

<p>----------</p>

<p>"The unbelievable *nerve* of that girl!" said Quinn. They were pulling
away from the hardware store. "Like we were going to take her boyfriend
back home to Providence or whatever!"</p>

<p>"You *did* say he was cute, Quinn," said Daria.</p>

<p>"And you were *thinking* it!" said Quinn. "When did *you* learn how to
flirt?"</p>

<p>"I *wasn't* flirting!" said Daria.</p>

<p>"Yeah, yeah, whatever," said Quinn. "For a minute there I thought you were
going to kiss him ..."</p>

<p>"Kiss him!? *Kiss* him?! Me?! You're as bad as that crazy girlfriend of
his ... "</p>

<p>They were now passing out of Lawnburg, re-entering the Horace Sloane State
Forest. Quinn and Daria were too busy arguing to notice the last cluster of
buildings on the outskirts of Lawnburg, or the sign which read "Lawnburg
Artist's Colony - Amanda Lane, Director."</p>

<p>----------</p>

<p>Later that night, Tom Sloane stared out of his bedroom window at the
Horace Sloane State Forest, barely visible now in the twilight. &nbsp;What if
old Horace had sold the land to the developers? Would the Sloanes now be
rich, or would the family fortune have been dissipated by now? What
would the view from his bedroom look like? Houses and businesses and
office buildings, all with their lights on by this time of evening? Maybe
even skyscrapers?</p>

<p>Unanswerable questions, all. One might as well ask what would have
happened if he had met that intriguing girl from Rhode Island - what was
her name? Daria? - under different circumstances. Like if she lived here.</p>

<p>Lived *here*? Small towns bred people with small minds, and that included
the girls in his class at Lawnburg High. Jane was the only girl around
with any wit or intelligence, and he'd already managed to hook up with her.
He should be thankful for that.</p>

<p>No, girls like Daria don't live around here.</p>

<p>Anywhere but here.</p>
