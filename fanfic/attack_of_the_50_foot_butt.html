<P>NOTE: This would be more suitable as a Halloween episode, where you can change everything and send them on to the next show with no changes.</P>
<P>ALSO NOTE: This story in no way shows the purpose or ideals/ideas of the makers of Daria. Simply the ideals of the author.</P>
<P>ALSO ALSO NOTE: This story has nothing to do with The X-files, etc, etc.</P>

<P>Opening scene, Daria's bedroom. She is on the phone. Split screen diagonally to show Jane as well.</P>
<P>Jane: Hi.</P>
<P>Daria: Hi. Do you remember what I told you about Highland?</P>
<P>Jane: All you ever mentioned was the uranium in the water.</P>
<P>Daria: I just thought I'd tell you something to make you feel happier about living here with mild idiots.</P>
<P>Jane: Oh, I'd say Brittany and Kevin are anything but mild.</P>
<P>Daria: Then get ready for a rough ride. I've actually seen worse.</P>
<P>Jane: Doesn't that break a scientific law of some sort?</P>
<P>Daria: Probably. &lt;pause&gt; There were these two boys.</P>
<P>Jane: Names?</P>
<P>Daria: Beavis and Butt-head.</P>
<P>Jane: Beavis? As in smelly hair?</P>
<P>Daria: What?</P>
<P>Jane: It's a German name. It means smelly hair.</P>
<P>Daria: Never mind. Why don't you take a guess about their stupidity level to get us started.</P>
<P>Jane: O.K. Did they ever injure themselves?</P>
<P>Daria: Beavis is a pyromaniac, has gotten his finger cut off in wood shop, and almost bled to death from a broken nose. Butt-head wasn't as bad, but he got hurt too.</P>
<P>Jane: Wow! Didn't they try to call an ambulance about the nose?</P>
<P>Daria: Who knows.</P>
<P>Jane: Any other examples?</P>
<P>Daria: They were stranded on a plastic island in the center of a pool of shallow water in the mall...for days.</P>
<P>Jane: You're lying.</P>
<P>Daria: I have pictures.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, the &quot;dynamic&quot; duo sit silently in their crime lab...</P>
<P>Cut to: Beavis and Butt-head sleeping on their couch.</P>
<P>Butt-head awakes: Whoa! Hey buttknocker wake up! &lt;smacks Beavis&gt;</P>
<P>Beavis: Ahhhh! Hey, heh, mph, heh. What did you do that for, bunghole!</P>
<P>Butt-head: Huh, huh, huh. Um. I just got a cool idea.</P>
<P>Beavis: Mph, heh, heh. &lt;Bites lip and thinks&gt; What?</P>
<P>Butt-head: Lets like, uh, huh, huh, do an `spearment.</P>
<P>Beavis: Mmmm. O.K. &lt;pause&gt; On what? Heh, heh, mph.</P>
<P>Butt-head: Uh, huh, huh. Like, on us.</P>
<P>Beavis: Ahhh! Damnit fartknocker. &lt;kicks him in the nads&gt; You're not gonna `spearment on me.</P>
<P>Butt-head: &lt;groaning&gt; Beavis, you wuss. Uh, huh, huh, um. I mean we could make us grow huge, and like, then Todd would let us join his gang!</P>
<P>Beavis: Mph, heh, oh yeah. Heh, heh, mph, heh, heh.</P>
<P>Cut to: Isolated cabin on top of a hill.</P>
<P>Cut to: Internal view.</P>
<P>Beavis and Butt-Head are mixing together smoking fluids from beakers. Soda cans and chocolate syrup bottles lay scattered about.</P>
<P>Butt-head: &lt;picking up beaker&gt; This is going to be the coolest thing in my life. &lt;drinks&gt;</P>
<P>Beavis: Hey asswipe! Gimme that! &lt;drinks&gt; Ahhh. Mph, heh, heh, heh, heh, mph, heh. &lt;both pause, silently&gt; Damnit Butt-head, this isn't working.</P>
<P>Butt-head: Damnit Beavis, it like needs time. &lt;smacks him onto the ground with an enormous hand&gt; Whoa! &lt;stares wide-eyed at his hand&gt;</P>
<P>Beavis: &lt;looking at his crotch&gt; &lt;pause&gt; Um, Butt-head.</P>
<P>I don't think its working.</P>
<P>Cut to: Basement of Jane's house. Trent and Jesse play guitars while Daria and Jane watch while sitting on a wooden box. Trent and Jesse are just now finishing.</P>
<P>Trent: Soul woman...</P>
<P>Remaining guitar noise quiets down.</P>
<P>Jesse: Well?</P>
<P>Jane: Um... outstanding?</P>
<P>Daria: Riveting.</P>
<P>Jane: Cool.</P>
<P>Daria: Perfect.</P>
<P>Jane: Bye now.</P>
<P>Both get up to leave. Trent calls after them.</P>
<P>Trent: Hey. I forgot to tell you something.</P>
<P>Daria and Jane turn around.</P>
<P>Jane: Yes?</P>
<P>Jesse: We got a gig at Lawndale's new coffee house. We go this weekend.</P>
<P>Daria: Didn't they close it down?</P>
<P>Trent: They reopened it. But they look at everyone's material before they perform now.</P>
<P>Jane: I suppose you're going to invite us.</P>
<P>Trent: Way ahead of me, Janey. So?</P>
<P>Jane: If Daria-</P>
<P>Daria: We're going.</P>
<P>Jane: &lt;surprised&gt; Excuse us for just a second.</P>
<P>They walk off into a corner and music starts up again.</P>
<P>Jane: You seem excited.</P>
<P>Daria: I need to get out of my house this weekend. My mother thinks it's time to renew our family relationship.</P>
<P>Jane: Uh oh.</P>
<P>Daria: I know.</P>
<P>Jane: What about Quinn?</P>
<P>Daria: I know she'll find a way out of it.</P>
<P>Jane: I mean, how are you going to make sure she stays?</P>
<P>Daria: Good point, but my parents, at least my mom, wouldn't let her miss out on this with a simple date.</P>
<P>Jane: Do you ever feel sorry for doing things like this?</P>
<P>Daria: Only when they backfire.</P>
<P>Cut to commercial after showing slow motion of Butt-head's enormous hand smacking Beavis. Cut to Beavis and Butt-head, now ten stories tall, walking through a large city while smashing buildings. Beavis looks at a woman through a window.</P>
<P>Beavis: Mph, heh. Hey, mph, how's it goin'?</P>
<P>They walk past. Butt-head sees a little girl with a lollipop looking up at him. He picks her up and grabs her candy.</P>
<P>Butt-head: I stole candy from a baby. Huh, huh.</P>
<P>&lt;drops her, puts the entire small lollipop in his mouth&gt;</P>
<P>Beavis: Heh, heh, heh, mph, heh. Hey there little girl. &lt;She spits on his shoe&gt; &lt;in rage&gt; Mmmmm, damnit! &lt;steps on her and grinds his shoe&gt;</P>
<P>Butt-head: &lt;rips sign from the ground&gt; Uh, huh, huh, huh. Hey Beavis, huh. Look at this.</P>
<P>Beavis: &lt;now stomping hard on the spot wherethe little girl was&gt; What?</P>
<P>Butt-head: It says...uh...huh, huh...law...uh... slaw...slu...shlaw...uh, huh, huh...sh, sh, shlong! Whoa. Beavis, Shlongdale is down this road.</P>
<P>Beavis: &lt;stops stomping&gt; Whoa! Heh, heh, mph. Schlong.</P>
<P>Cut to: Daria's living room. Helen and Jake sit on the couch. Quinn is sulking in the chair. Daria walks over to the door.</P>
<P>Jake: Hey, kiddo! Where you going? It's family night.</P>
<P>Daria: I'm going to see Trent- er - this band. &lt;thinking&gt; Crap.</P>
<P>Helen: &lt;face brightened&gt; Oh! Go right along dear!</P>
<P>Daria: &lt;sounding very, very depressed&gt; Thanks.</P>
<P>Daria leaves the house.</P>
<P>Quinn: Why does she get to go out! I had a date tonight!</P>
<P>Jake: Yeah! Why do I have to stay too!</P>
<P>Helen: &lt;sighs&gt; Alright. She must have had a date. She DID mention some boys name...Trent wasn't it?</P>
<P>Quinn: Why does she get to &lt;realizes what has been said&gt; What!! A date! Her! She probably just lied</P>
<P>to get out of tonight!</P>
<P>Jake: &lt;grumbling&gt; Wish I'd thought of that...</P>
<P>Helen sighs heavily and leans back on the couch.</P>
<P>Cut to: Daria getting into the van. Jesse and Jane are already in the back along with the instruments, so Daria sits up front to avoid arousing suspicions.</P>
<P>Daria: Where's the drummer? Or is he just a myth you started to make everyone think you had a full band?</P>
<P>Trent: He's sick again. He was up all night last night drinking to celebrate this occasion.</P>
<P>Daria: This won't mess up your performance, will it?</P>
<P>Trent: Naw. Jesse and I can get along. Unless one of you wanted to play the drums?</P>
<P>Daria AND Jane: No.</P>
<P>Daria: Hey, Jane. Could you come over here a minute?</P>
<P>Jane walks over. She whispers.</P>
<P>Jane: What?</P>
<P>Daria: I really screwed up.</P>
<P>Jane: What?</P>
<P>Daria: My family thinks I'm on a date now...</P>
<P>Jane: With who?</P>
<P>Daria: Trent.</P>
<P>Jane: How?</P>
<P>Daria: I mentioned his name instead of the band's.</P>
<P>Jane: And, why are you worried?</P>
<P>Daria: What do you mean?</P>
<P>Jane: They're not likely to start rumors.</P>
<P>Daria: But now my mother is going to try to find out more about him, eventually invite him over, and I need to find some way to get that idea out of their minds.</P>
<P>Van bumps as the hit a speed bump. Jane falls back and Jesse catches her. She winks at Dariaand smiles. Daria frowns.</P>
<P>Cut to: Inside of the coffee house. A large crowd is gathered to see Helpful Corn tonight. Jesse and Trent are carrying boxes, Jane and Daria each hold a guitar. A large man stops them at the door.</P>
<P>Doorman: Performing?</P>
<P>Trent: Yeah.</P>
<P>Doorman: Song please. &lt;extends hand&gt;</P>
<P>Trent sets down the box and digs in his pocket.</P>
<P>Trent: Here you go.</P>
<P>The doorman looks over the song and stops about halfway.</P>
<P>Doorman: You can't perform this here.</P>
<P>Trent, Jesse, and Jane: What!?</P>
<P>Daria: &lt;blank face&gt; What?</P>
<P>Doorman: I said you can't perform this here.</P>
<P>Trent: Why not?</P>
<P>Doorman: This has vulgar language in it.</P>
<P>Trent: Where?</P>
<P>Doorman: Right here. &lt;points a finger at an area of the paper, Trent looks&gt;</P>
<P>Trent: &quot;Crap?&quot; That's why I can't perform here? C'mon, Jess. Lets go. All because of &quot;crap.&quot; &lt;grabs his song&gt;</P>
<P>Suddenly, the ground shakes with intermittent thundering sounds. In the distance one can hear a sinister laugh...</P>
<P>Beavis: Heh, heh, mph, heh. Schlong...</P>
<P>Cut to commercial after showing slow motion of Jane falling into Jesse's arms.</P>
<P>Cut to: Daria, Trent, Jesse, and Jane run towards the van empty handed. They all jump in and speed off. People from the coffee house run to their cars in a similar way. Two figures can be seen coming from a distance, with one thought on their minds...</P>
<P>Beavis: Schlong, heh, heh, heh, mph, heh.</P>
<P>Cut to: Inside of van. Jesse holding Jane close. Trent with a panic on his face. Daria has an expression of deep thought.</P>
<P>Daria: I know that laugh... Beavis!</P>
<P>Jane: &lt;looks up&gt; What!</P>
<P>Daria: That was Beavis's laugh. If I'm wrong, then tie me down and &lt;looks at Trent and quiets down&gt;</P>
<P>Jane: What was that earthquake back there then? Loud crunch. Sound of metal screeching. A loud grunt as if someone was throwing something.</P>
<P>Trent: Look out!</P>
<P>Something large hits the top of the van. They swerve out of control and pull over in a ditch. They all get out and run. Daria turns around and actually screams. Beavis and Butt-head look down at them.</P>
<P>Both: Diarrhea, cha, cha, cha!</P>
<P>She turns and runs to catch up. She trips and falls.</P>
<P>Daria: Help!</P>
<P>Trent comes running and grabs her. They run as Beavis's bloody shoe lands where they were.</P>
<P>Cut to: Daria's living room. Helen and Jake are in</P>
<P>the same place, but Jake is sleeping. Quinn is on the floor applying nail polish to her toes.</P>
<P>Helen: &lt;sighs&gt; Well, we might as well turn on the TV!</P>
<P>Quinn: &lt;not taking the hint to straighten up&gt; O.K.! The TV turns on to show a news broadcast on all channels, as Quinn tries to flip through.</P>
<P>Helen: Wait a minute, hon.</P>
<P>TV: And now, two giant teen-agers prowl Lawndale, causing mass destruction as they go. Here is our investigative reporter, Bill Buttcokowits, live.</P>
<P>Cut to: TV screen. It is now raining.</P>
<P>Bill: Hello, I'm Bill Buttcokowits.</P>
<P>Beavis and Butt-head walk up.</P>
<P>Butt-head: Uh, huh, huh, huh, huh. Buttcokowits.</P>
<P>Beavis: Mmmmnnn, die you son of a bitch!</P>
<P>A large, and bloody, shoe lands on bill. Shortly, there is nothing but static.</P>
<P>Helen: Dear Lord!</P>
<P>Cut to: Trent running while carrying Daria. She has her arms around his neck. Her wet hair sticks to her face and falls about her shoulders as she bounces. Trent runs inside a small shed and Jesse shuts the door.</P>
<P>Inside, it is dark.</P>
<P>Jane: Anyone got a match?</P>
<P>Jesse: Hold on.</P>
<P>A lighter flame provides some illumination. All are soaking wet. Daria is rubbing her ankle.</P>
<P>Daria: Damn.</P>
<P>Trent: &lt;worried&gt; What?</P>
<P>Daria: I must have twisted my ankle.</P>
<P>Jane: Do you really think we'll be safe here?</P>
<P>Jesse: Not for too long...</P>
<P>Cut to: Isolated shack on a hill, with a shattered roof and two walls. FBI agents search through.</P>
<P>Mulder: Hey Scully. Come take a look at this.</P>
<P>Scully: What is it?</P>
<P>Mulder: This must be the final result. &lt;holds up the beaker, now broken&gt;</P>
<P>Scully: But I don't see how this would have anything to do with it. All we have is some soda and chocolate syrup.</P>
<P>Mulder: I wouldn't be so sure. &lt;holds up bottle&gt;</P>
<P>Scully: &lt;with fear&gt; Cough syrup!</P>
<P>Mulder: Yes.</P>
<P>Scully: Mixed with chocolate syrup alone, that would have made them twice as tall!</P>
<P>Mulder: But if the soda diluted it that much, maybe it will wear off soon. A voice calls off in the distance, those who saw Beavis and Butt-head do America will know it well.</P>
<P>Voice: Full cavity searches all around!</P>
<P>Cut to: Outside of the shed. It is now daylight and the rain has stopped. The door opens as Trent peeks outside. His head goes back in. After a moment, he emerges with Daria in his arms. Jesse and Jane follow.</P>
<P>Jane: Is it over?</P>
<P>Daria: Shh. Listen.</P>
<P>Voice from a nearby bush: Ahhh. Poop!</P>
<P>Voice2: Hey buttknocker. We're like, small again.</P>
<P>Voice1: Mmmnn, damnit!</P>
<P>Cut to: FBI van. Beavis and Butt-head are being loaded inside. Daria, who now has a crutch and a bandaged ankle, leans against Trent anyway. Jesse stands behind Jane with a hand on her shoulder. An agent walks up.</P>
<P>Mulder: Thanks for reporting their location to us. We'll see to it that they get proper medical care.</P>
<P>Daria: So is it over?</P>
<P>The other car doors shut, but the van waits.</P>
<P>Mulder: It should be. But I have to keep searching. The truth is out there.</P>
<P>He begins to walk over to the van. Screams emerge from inside and the back door bursts open to reveal a squadron of Beavis and Butt-head people. Scully jumps out of the van.</P>
<P>Scully: Mulder! They had uranium in theit systems! It's reacting with the cough syrup.</P>
<P>Voice from van: Cavity searches everywhere!!!</P>

<P>THE END</P>
