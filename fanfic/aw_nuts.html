<br>
&quot;Excellent. Where are the reports from last night's reconnaissance?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Right here. The mission was successful. We've secured the new territory
without the enemy's awareness.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then everything is going according to plan.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thanks to the boys upstairs.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No evidence was left, I assume.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;All clear. The entry port has been re-sealed as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Soon we'll have accomplished our goal and all will be ours again!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&quot;Jake,
honey, can you all the exterminators? I think there are mice in the attic
again. With Daria off at college, I want to make sure they're really gone
before we start ripping down the padding in her room. No need for a nasty
surprise,&quot; Helen called to Jake as he finished his coffee and headed to
the front door. She'd been meaning to have a look in Daria's old room but kept
getting sidetracked.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's the squirrels I tell you! Damn squirrels, keeping me up all night
with their rolling, rolling, rolling acorns all through the attic. They're
dropping rocks on my new car, too! I know they're up to something! Ever since
Daria left, they've gotten worse. Damn rats with fluffy tails! Diseased
little…I'll get them!&quot; Jake ranted as he reached the front door.<br>
<br>
&quot;Jake! Your blood pressure! You know the exterminators said it was mice,
there's no evidence of squirrels and they patched up anywhere they could have
gotten in. And squirrels don't make battle plans or drop rocks, that's just
silly. Why don't you just park in a different part of the driveway?&quot; <i>Since
you refuse to clean out the garage.</i> &quot;Now calm down before you meet
your client, or you'll scare him off!&quot;<br>
<br>
Jake took continued to mutter under his breath as he walked out to his
brand-new car. He'd given the old blue Lexus to Daria to take to college and
was secretly glad he'd let Quinn talk him into the sleek black Audi. &quot;Man
can't even park in his own driveway…damn fluffy-tailed rats…&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How's my baby?&quot; he crooned as he wiped a non-existent speck off the
hood of his new sports car.<br>
<br>
<i>Plink. <br>
<br>
Plink, plink.</i><br>
<br>
&quot;What the-&quot; Jake looked up as he heard something falling on his
precious new car's immaculate paint job. A pebble bounced off the roof and
landed in the grass.<br>
<br>
&quot;DAMMIT!&quot;<br>
<br>
<i><br>
Plink.<br>
<br>
Plink.<br>
<br>
Plinkity-plinkplinkplink. Thud, thud, thudthudthud…</i><br>
<br>
A cascade of pebbles and small rocks pummeled the car, knocking tiny paint
chips off here and there.<br>
<br>
&quot;GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH! Damn you, squirrels! That's it! Helen, we're
moving!&quot;<br>
<br>
Helen looked at the commotion from the front window, put her hand to her
forehead and sighed.<br>
<br>
In a tree high above the Morgendorffer home, squirrels chittered excitedly.</span></p>
