<p><font face="Times">London, 2011</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom Sloane made his way out of the subway 
station, walking
   against the crush of people as he continued on his trip home from his job at
   a London-based software design firm. It wasn't where Tom had expected to
   be ten years after high school, but then again he was good at what 
he did, and
   he was a whole continent away from his father, away from being a Sloane, and
   away from Lawndale and all the memories that resided there. He 
frowned briefly
   as an overly ostentatious punk bumped him. The one constant in any 
city he found
   was that people were always at their worst around subways. He went to cross
   the street only to be nearly mowed down by an oncoming Land Rover; he wasn't
   hit but did get soaked by the puddle the car drove through as it 
sped by.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Damnit!" Tom swore. He'd been living in London for
   two years and still hadn't adapted to the traffic patterns. He tried in
   vain to dry himself and gingerly crossed the street, this time paying closer
   attention to what he was doing. Tom arrived at the other side of the street
   without any further incident and walked towards his apartment. Moving through
   the crowd he saw a face that shocked him out his reverie, Daria Morgendorfer.
   Or at least someone who looked exactly the same as his old high school flame.
   He had to look again to make sure he wasn't seeing things, and to 
his amazement
   it was indeed Daria. Tom pulled up short in surprise, but just as 
he was about
   to say something the person walking behind Tom collided with him, 
not expecting
   Tom's sudden stop. Tom turned to apologize and by the time he had 
disentangled
   himself she was gone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Damnit!" he cursed again. He cast his eyes through the
   crowd, trying to spot her, "Not a sign of her, damn!" He said to 
himself, "Was
   that really her? I must have been seeing things, there's no way that could
   have been Daria. Why would she be in London?" Tom pondered the matter as he
   walked up the steps to his apartment. He walked into his residence his eyes
   caught sight of an opened letter sitting on the coffee table. It 
was his invitation
   to his ten-year class reunion at Fielding.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"That must be it," he thought, "I got that letter and it
   got me thinking about Lawndale, so I predisposed to thinking that anyone who
   looked like Daria actually was Daria." He chuckled, "I mean, what 
are the odds
   that in a city this large the two of us would walk past each other 
on the street?"
   Even if, out of all the other places in the world, she was even in London."
   Having assured himself that his former love had not just walked past him, Tom
   busied himself in his kitchen, preparing dinner. He was draining 
the pasta when
   the phone rang. Tom sighed as he put down the colander and reached 
for the phone,
   only one person would be calling now, assuming it wasn't a telemarketer,
   "Hello?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Tom! How the hell are you?" A booming British 
voice said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hi Ian, actually I was just about to eat my dinner&#133;"</font></p><p><font face="Times">"Let me guess, your usual spa 
ghetti with runny tomato sauce?
   Or maybe that American delicacy, the hot dog?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"No, it's err...spaghetti and store bought Alfredo
   sauce."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well, well, somebody's fancying a night of 
haute cuisine.
   Tell you what, why don't the two of us go grab a few other folks, go out
   for a bite then hit a few clubs."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ian&#133;" Tom said wearily.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"For god's sake man, it's a Friday night. Would
   it kill you to live a little?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Your definition of living a little is what most people
   term extreme sports Ian."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"At least when I punch out I won't have wasted 
my life."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"It all depends on your definition of waste."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian laughed, "That's the spirit, so are you in 
or out?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom sighed, "The first round's on you?"<br>
   </font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Of course."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Fine, I know I'll regret this in the 
morning."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"That's how all the good evenings go my man."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"So when do the festivities commence?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Right now," and on cue Tom heard a knock on 
the door.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You fucker," Tom told the phone as he hung it 
up. He walked
   over to the door and opened it. "You've timed how long it takes you to
   convince me to do these things haven't you?" Tom asked Ian as the Brit
   entered the apartment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Doesn't say much good about you now does it?" 
Ian replied.
   Ian was about Tom's height with close-cropped brown hair and cheery blue
   eyes. He was a former aspiring professional rugby player who still managed to
   find his way into a scrum from time to time. Tom met Ian early in his stay in
   London. Ian ran a record store Tom liked to visit. They started talking and
   soon Ian was dragging Tom around the club scene in London. Ian was convinced
   the solution to all of Tom's problems could be found either at a party
   or by getting laid, and not necessarily in that order.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ok man, here's the plan. We're going to go to
   this new club, The Albatross, apparently it's a Coleridge theme nightclub.
   Anyway, we're going to check this place out, toss back a couple, ok, more
   than a couple," Tom looked at him dubiously, "Ok, we're going to get pissed
   and probably get into an argument with some random stranger about 
football which
   will lead to a brawl. There, is that stereotypically British enough 
for you?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Considering that's exactly what happened the last
   time we went out&#133;"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"That ass had it coming. As I was saying, we're going to
   go out and get pissed, and if we're lucky wake up tomorrow next to 
a beautiful
   woman."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And if we're not lucky?" Tom asked dryly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I'll wake up with you in my bed."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hey now, I'll have you know I'm a fine 
catch."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian punched Tom's arm playfully, "Oh shut up you little
   shit. Are we going to go or are you just going to stand there and come on to
   me all night?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Can't we do both?" Tom asked innocently, "I mean you're
   just so manly, I can't contain myself."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Shove it you fucker, are we going or not?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom chuckled, sometimes it was easy to push 
Ian's buttons,
   "Ok, ok, let me grab my shoes and jacket." As Tom gathered his 
things he called
   out to Ian, "Hey, you ever think you've seen an old girlfriend when you were
   walking down the street?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian shrugged, "Sure, all the time, who hasn't? 
I mean that
   time after Eleanor dumped me I even thought some fellows were 
her."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom walked back into the entry room, "I mean really old
   girlfriends, like from high school, or whatever the hell you Brits 
call it."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian shook his head, "No, can't say that I have. You must
   have been pretty hard up about her if you still think you see 
her."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shrugged, "I don't know, it was a fling really, you
   know, one of those high school romances. The mind does funny things 
sometimes."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian nodded, "Yes, it does," He could tell there was more
   to the story, but he knew that now wasn't the time to pry, "Now let's go numb
   the fucker with some beer." Ian grabbed Tom and pulled him out the door. Down
   on the street Ian hailed a cab for the two of them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"So, who are we meeting at this place?" Tom asked after
   Ian told the cabbie where to go.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh, nobody special, just Martin and Rob."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Wonderful, now my evening is complete." Martin and Rob
   were two of Ian's friends. Rob owned a comic book shop adjacent to 
Ian's store,
   and Martin worked for Ian. Both were charitably described as deeply committed
   to their jobs; another valid description, which Tom preferred, was obsessed
   losers. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Come on Tom, Martin and Rob are both fine 
guys, sure they're
   wound a little tight, but that's just because neither of them are 
getting any.
   A condition you share with the lads I might add."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Why does everything revolve around my sex life 
with you?"
   Tom asked, a little too loudly if the cabbies raised eyebrows were 
any indication.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Because it's so damn lacking. My god man, you sped all
   day in your office typing out code, and then you go home to an outrageously
   posh flat...and spend your nights watching bad American television. A place
   like yours is a veritable chick magnet. If I had a place like that I wouldn't
   be lacking for female companionship. Not that I am now mind you, but if I had
   your place, man the chicks would be all over me."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"But what if that's not what I'm looking for? I mean I am
   looking for women, but not like that." He hastily added with an eye towards
   the cabbie.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Then I'd say you've already picked out a lady 
and the rest
   just don't match up...and unless I miss my guess it's that old 
school sweetheart
   you were talking about earlier."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Who, Daria? No, no, no, not Daria, that's a piece of my
   past that's firmly in the past. Besides I don't even know if it 
wasn't her."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"If it was her then look her up, start checking out all
   the hotels in the city. You know hackers, it wouldn't be too hard. And if it
   really wasn't here then maybe your subconscious is trying to tell 
you something."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well I'd say you're fully of shit. But I 
suppose you won't
   give up on this until I tell you the whole story." Tom proceeded to describe
   the history of his relationship with Daria, starting with Jane.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"So, you broke up with the art chick, who you really have
   to introduce me to sometime, and moved right on to this Daria girl? Wow, you
   were a player back in the day."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom frowned, "Don't remind me, it wasn't my finest hour
   as it were. Anyway, Daria and I went out our senior year of high school and
   stopped seeing each other when we went to college." He shrugged, 
"nothing more
   to it than that."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Was she hot?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom winced at his friend's bluntness, "She 
wasn't what you'd
   call a conventional beauty, but she had a way about her. Daria was brilliant
   and totally convinced that most people were stupid..."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"A sad fact I'd tend to agree with."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Don't get too attached, she's the sort of 
person you couldn't
   stand. She had this tendency to suck the joy out of almost anything. And that
   doom and gloom outlook got to be sort of grating after a while."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Then why'd you go out with her for so long?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom sighed, "Because she didn't care that my family was
   rich." He paused, "No, it was more like she wasn't in awe of that fact. Plus
   she had a wicked sense of humor, provided you weren't on the receiving end.
   And it wasn't like we lacked conversation topics, like I said she 
was incredibly
   intelligent. I'll give her this, for someone who was so anti-social she sure
   made life interesting."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Sounds like a perfect match for you. What went wrong?"
   The cab pulled up to the club before Tom could answer. While they 
were standing
   in line for admittance Ian returned to the subject. "So, what went 
wrong between
   the two of you?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shrugged, "Oh, someone might have said something, the
   other might have blown things way out of proportion and here we are, you know
   how it goes."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian looked at Tom dubiously, "Yeah, sure. Look 
man, if you
   don't want to talking about this just tell me and I'll just shut 
the fuck up."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom sighed, "No, that's ok, I don't mid...it's just this
   really isn't the place to be talking about my love life." He waved an arm to
   indicate the people milling around them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Pish, like anyone else is paying attention." He turned
   and addressed the line. "Excuse me, are any of you good people listening in
   on the conversation my friend and I are having?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">A few people shook their heads, most watched 
disinterestedly,
   "Thank-you. You see," he told Tom, "these people don't give a 
bloody rat's ass
   about your miserable love life. Now if we were talking about mine," 
he grinned,
   "we'd have to sell tickets for admission."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom smirked, "Sure, everyone loves a good 
comedy. But seriously,
   Daria and I went out in high school, we helped each other grow as people. We
   broke up on slightly bad terms, and that was that. It happens all the time,
   it's no big deal."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian frowned, as he shuffled forward with the 
line, "Ok...but..."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom sighed, Ian wasn't going to give up, "But 
what?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"But if she really was so inconsequential why haven't you
   had another serious relationship in the intervening ten years?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom opened and closed his mouth several times, trying to
   form a reply, "He looks like a fucking small mouth bass." Ian 
thought.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"What do you mean? I've had plenty of 
relationships."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh, sure, plenty of brief dumb ones."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Says the world renowned ladies man."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Fuck, so I like to go out with a wide range of 
women. I'm
   looking man, I'm trying to find just the right one, and when I do," 
he shrugged,
   "I won't have to go looking around anymore. But until then I've got to check
   out as many as possible to be sure I get the one that is just 
right."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Or it might just be a convenient way to avoid 
commitment."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hey, when I go out at least I'm considering 
the long term
   with them. Which is more than I can say for you. And if you're fresh with me
   I'll bash your head in." This last warning was directed at the very muscular
   bouncer who was patting Ian down.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Whatever, I still say you're full of shit." Tom said as
   they entered the club. "Whoa, check this place out." The interior of the club
   was decorated with a decaying sailing ship motif. Tattered sails 
hung from the
   ceiling, the walls were covered with netting and seashells. The room was lit
   with diffuse bluish-green light that filtered through the sails and 
the portholes
   that dotted the walls. And of course, since it was a club, loud dance music
   pounded throughout. "It's like an Under the Sea Dance gone horribly wrong."
   Tom said, dumbfounded.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I'd say it'd make one question the existence of a loving
   God, not to mention driving a man to drink, which I could really 
use right about
   now."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ok, we've been, it sucks, can we go now?" Tom 
asked moving
   for the door.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Not so fast there buddy," Ian said, catching Tom by the
   arm. "We have to fully experience the local ambiance before we can 
go. Besides
   I reserved a table for us. So come you cowardly bugger, I need a 
drink, a dance
   with a beautiful woman and a good screw afterwards." He dragged Tom over to
   the maitre de's station.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yeargh gentlemen, welcome to 'The Albatross,' I'm glad
   ye could join me on my accursed voyage." The maitre de was dressed up like an
   old sea captain, complete with a grizzled beard and squinty eyes. 
Fake seaweed
   was liberally strewn across his carefully tailored torn clothing. The final
   touch to his outfit was the large, stuffed albatross dangling from a lanyard
   around his neck.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Uh, yes, reservation for four, the name's Williams, um,
   the rest of our party is not with us at the moment."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The costumed maitre de looked at his reservations book,
   "Ah yes, Mr. Williams, the rest of your party be waiting for ye in 
the bar."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Those bastards, starting without me. Lead on 
accursed Mariner,
   bring me to these two delinquents."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yeargh, right this way sir." The actor motioned for Ian
   and Tom to follow him. While they walked towards the bar Tom looked around to
   further acclimate himself to the club. The space seemed to be 
divided into two
   general areas, along both walls were bar and dining spaces. While the middle
   of the building was dominated by a large dance floor, and even at that early
   hour there were people dancing. The DJ was pumping a fast dance 
track to counteract
   the quiet nature of the room's lighting. Tom also noticed that the 
rest of the
   staff wore costumes similar to the maitre de's.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom leaned over and spoke into Ian's ear, "This place is
   pretty bad, I wonder if the people who run it have even read the 
poem."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian glanced at Tom and grinned, "Who cares so long as the
   beer's good and the women are hot."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The maitre de stopped just short of entering 
the bar area,
   "Here ye are gentlemen, your table will be ready shortly, yeargh." He walked
   back to the front of the club, leaving Ian and Tom to fend for 
themselves.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ok, I'm going to get a drink, while you find 
Rob and Martin,
   want anything while I'm over there?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"The usual."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian made a face, "How can you stand drinking 
that Canadian
   piss? Really, you're in England for god's sakes, drink good beer."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Just buy me a damn Moosehead, I'm not in the 
mood to hear
   your beer theories again."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian shrugged, 'Ok, ok, it's not my body you're going to
   be poisoning with that rotgut."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"The world does not revolve around a pint of Boddington's
   you know."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian waved a hand in a dismissive fashion as he 
walked towards
   the bar, "So you say Yank, so you say."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shook his head and started wandering around, looking
   for Martin and Rob. He found them sitting at one of the tables 
scattered around
   the bar, they appeared to be in the middle of a heated discussion.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hey guys," Tom said in greeting, "What's up?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh, hi Tom." Martin said. Martin Willoughby was a small,
   nebbish man. At times he resembled a mouse, ready to flee at a 
moment's notice.
   Although when truly pushed he had a tendency to stand his ground. Martin was
   an audio genius, he could diagnose a problem with a stereo system after the
   briefest listen. He also tended to channel all of his energy into 
his work and
   as such lacked a good many social graces.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yeah, pull up a chair Tom, maybe you can help 
us sort out
   a little disagreement Martin and I are having," Rob Goodin was 
practically the
   archetypal comic book store owner. His physique ranged from 
corpulent to overweight,
   his receding hair was pulled back in a half-hearted ponytail and he 
maintained
   an air of superiority because he could recite from memory the current street
   value of every issue of <i>Cerebus</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom sighed, "Sure, fine, what is it this 
time?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well," Martin said, while adjusting his glasses. "We're
   trying to decide which Doctor acted most like a real Time Lord 
would."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Huh, run that by me again?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Rob sighed, "It's a simple question Tom, out of the seven
   unique incarnations of Doctor Who, which one acted in a way that best fit a
   real Time Lord."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom frowned, "But there are no real Time 
Lords."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Rob shook his head in exasperation, "Well duh, 
I know that.
   I mean as they explained Time Lords in the show."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ahh," Tom replied, still not really getting it, but not
   wanting to continue.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Martin, sensing Tom's lack of comprehension 
chimed in, "See
   it's pretty strait forward. Look at episode..." He launched into a 
long winded
   and convoluted discourse on a particular Dr. Who episode. Tom's eyes quickly
   glazed over and he began to look around, hoping to spot Ian. 
"...and so because
   of that we know that the Doctor's actions fly totally in the face 
of everything
   we know a Time Lord is capable of."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh, well, if you two would excuse me I'll go see what's
   keeping Ian." Tom hastily got up and walked over to the bar.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Dummy," Rob said to Martin, "Why did you have 
to use that
   episode as an example, now episode..." The rest of the conversation 
was mercifully
   swallowed up by the ambient din of the room.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom sighed as he made his way through the 
crowd, "Why does
   Ian get so worked up about my love life when he's those two losers 
to work with?"
   he thought to himself, "Then again, I suppose his odds are better 
with me than
   with those two." He spotted Ian by the bar talking to a brunette. "I should
   have known he'd be hitting on some chick." Tom angled his way over to the bar
   to get himself a beer. He indicated his preference to the bartender 
and leaned
   against the bar, watching Ian do his thing. From where he was 
standing he couldn't
   see the woman's face or make out what the were saying. However based on her
   body language Tom could tell she was far from receptive to Ian's 
advances. Tom
   chuckled into his beer when the woman gave Ian a resounding slap and walked
   off. Tom straightened and walked over to greet his now solitary friend. "What
   the hell did you say to her?" Tom asked by way of greeting.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian looked up and saw Tom, "So you watched that 
little incident?"
   He handed Tom a full bottle of Moosehead,. Tom held up the bottle 
he was currently
   working on. Ian shrugged and put the bottle back on the counter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I saw some of it but couldn't overhear 
anything." </font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian took a swig from his beer, "Well I didn't 
suggest anything
   vile. Just that she'd have a more enjoyable evening with me, 
opposed to whoever
   else she was with. You should go find her, she was a fellow Yank, 
I'm sure the
   two of you would hit it right off."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom nodded at the fading red mark on Ian's cheek. "Hit is
   right. I'm not a rugby player like you, pain doesn't excite me."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian shrugged, "Suit yourself, she did seem like a pretty
   feisty girl, probably a tiger in the sack. I thought that was your 
type."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">A dim memory of a self-styled teenaged 
lady-killer flitted
   through Tom's mind, he shuddered, "Do me a favor, never call a woman feisty
   around me again, ok?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian quirked an eyebrow, "Can I still talk about 
breast size,
   spits or swallows and overall performance in bed?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh sure, it wouldn't be a date post-mortem if you didn't
   tell me that stuff, just don't call them feisty like that"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian clapped Tom on the shoulder, "Atta boy, I was worried
   you were going soft on me. Ok, the adjective feisty is out of my 
vocabulary."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Thanks, now can we get some food?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I suppose, hey barkeep, one more for the road 
if you please."
   Ian held up his mostly empty beer mug. After getting his refill Ian followed
   Tom away from the bar. "Since you're already on your second beer of the night
   I assume you found the boys."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom nodded, "Yes and they were debating Dr. Who 
this time."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Not that Time Lord argument again." Ian 
groaned, "How many
   times have I told those twits that it's the fourth Doctor..."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom winced, he just remembered why Ian hung out with Rob
   and Martin; they were all sci-fi aficionados. Tom took a long pull from his
   beer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian strode up to the table where Martin and Rob 
were sitting.
   "Hello boy," Ian said as he set his mug down on the table. "Arguing over Time
   Lords again?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You're not going to bring up that fourth doctor theory
   again are you?" Rob sniffed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hey now, be careful there, my fourth doctor theory has
   a lot more weight than your..."Ian was interrupted by the arrival of their
   server.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hello there gentlemen how are you doing this evening?"
   The server was a pretty blond whose too small T-shirt reveled a pierced belly
   button.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"To be honest things were looking pretty grim, 
but they're
   picking up now that you've arrived." Ian was beside himself, all thoughts of
   Dr. Who were instantly forgotten.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The waitress laughed, "I'm glad to hear that. 
Now what can
   I get you gentlemen?" She took a pad and pen out of her pocket in 
her apron.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well I'd say 'You when you get off work.' But 
that's such
   an old line there's no way it'd work on such a gorgeous creature 
like you."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The waitress laughed again, "And you'd be right, now what
   do you want to eat?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian considered the menu the club had thoughtfully placed
   on the table under a sheet of Lucite, "I'll take the chicken sandwich, fries,
   an order of your cheese sticks, and another one of these," he held 
up his glass.
   Rob and Martin both placed their orders as well.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And for you sir?" the waitress asked Tom.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom looked up from the menu, "It says here you import all
   your beef from the States?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The waitress nodded, "Yes sir, direct from 
Nebraska."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ok then, I will take a chance and order the 
bacon cheeseburger,
   medium well, with the fries, onions rings, a salad, and another 
Moosehead."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Sure thing, I'll be right back with your appetizers and
   drinks." The waitress put her pad back into her apron and turned to 
leave.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hey miss," Ian called out, "I didn't catch 
your name."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">She looked back and smiled, "The name's Kristen, and you
   are?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian smiled broadly, "Ian, please to meet you."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">After Kristen left Rob looked at Ian in 
astonishment, "Dude,
   she was flirting with you!"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian nodded, "Settle down there boyo, it's been known to
   happen, I am the epitome of smooth after all." Ian buffed his nails 
on the front
   of his shirt. Martin simply stared in awe. Tom rolled his eyes and 
took another
   swig of beer. "So as I was saying the fourth doctor..." Ian picked up his
   discourse right where he left off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh for fuck's sake!" Tom interjected, "Could we please
   talk about something other than Dr. Who? I know it might be hard 
but could you
   just try, for once?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian shrugged, "Sure Tom, no need to be so 
cranky about it.
   So, who here saw the Leeds/Manchester game last night?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom sighed, "Why do I even bother hanging out 
with you guys."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Because we're the only people who'll take you." Martin
   said, so quietly that the rest of the group almost missed it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">When Ian realized what Martin said he erupted 
with laughter,
   "Would you look at that, Martin ripping on Tom. Way to go little man, a point
   for you." He and Martin exchanged high fives.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hey Tom, what's up, you seem to be more 
grouchy than usual."
   Rob asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian spoke up before Tom had a chance to reply, "Oh he's
   just pining for the lost love of his life."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"No I'm not."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Okay, fine, you're just cranky cause you haven't had sex
   in ages."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"How about I'm cranky because my friends are being overly
   pushy about my private life..." He paused, "Okay, you're right I am a bigger
   grouch tonight. I don't know I guess that class reunion letter really threw
   me. I suppose there's just too much baggage associated with 
Lawndale."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian snorted, "Baggage, what fucking baggage?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You know, the baggage of being a Sloane in Lawndale. The
   expectations of your parents to carry on the family traditions. The pressure
   from the community to be a civic leader. You just wouldn't 
understand."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I wouldn't understand huh? Just like I 
wouldn't understand
   having more money than God? Bloody Americans and your 'issues.' Blowing all
   these minor inconveniences in your life out of proportion. Tom, if you wanted
   you could just sit on your ass all day and still make money. You 
came into this
   world a millionaire and that's how you're going to leave it. You've never had
   real 'issues' like being hungry or cold and having to decide which was more
   important."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"It's different," Tom said flatly, "I'm not 
imagining things,
   nor am I trying to get anyone's sympathy. I'm just saying that for 
me Lawndale
   holds a lot of bitter memories because of who I am and who my 
family is."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"So it's different, fine, but that doesn't 
change the fact
   that you've got less to gripe about than the average person."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"See," Tom said, "That's exactly what I'm talking about.
   This assumption that everyone has about money lessening all the other shit in
   life that can drag you down."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"But doesn't it? I mean you have a bad day at the office
   can't you just hop in your get and fly to Cancun to blow off 
steam?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shook his head, "A bad day is a bad day regardless of
   your tax bracket. You don't see me jetting off to the French Riviera at the
   drop of a hat."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"No, you just sulk in your flat..." Their argument was
   cut short by the arrival of Kristen with their drinks and 
appetizers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"There you go boys, the rest of your food will be along
   shortly."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Thank you Kristen," Ian said, smiling warmly. 
"Say do you
   think you could help me prove something to my friend?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well I really should get back to work..."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"This will only take a minute, maybe less."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Kristen looked around, then shrugged her shoulders, "Ok,
   but just for a minute."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Great, thanks. Now my friend here, who is very wealthy,
   is saying that being rich carries a lot of additional emotional 
baggage. I say
   he's being a whiny bitch, after all, he's rich."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Kristen looked thoughtful for a moment, "Is 
this true? Are
   you really rich?" She asked Tom.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I'm afraid so," he replied, "I've got more money than I
   really know what to do with, so it just sits there, getting 
bigger."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I'll have to agree with your friend then, you 
should consider
   yourself the lucki8est guy on the planet and move on."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I don't believe this, just because I have a 
bit more cash
   in my bank account than most people I can't feel angry or sad, or 
anything?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"No, I didn't say that." Kristen replied, "just don't go
   around whining about your problems to people who have to work for a living.
   Now if you'll excuse me gentlemen, I have to get back to work." The waitress
   waved goodbye to Ian then walked over to another table.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian watched Kristen's departure with rapt 
attention, "Isn't
   she great? I think I'll ask her out."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Sure, why not, she's your ideal woman, two breasts, two
   legs and a mouth." Tom commented dryly. Martin and Rob snickered.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian chuckled, "Oh, that was a good one 
Tommy-boy, did your
   girlfriend tell you that? Oh, I'm sorry, that's your left hand." Martin and
   Rob broke into raucous laughter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shook his head, "Ok, I can't beat 
masturbation references,
   you win."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian nodded smugly, "Of course I do, I am the master after
   all. Oh hey, Martin I almost forgot, they announced the ship date on the 'Kid
   A' re-release today."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Martin's eyes grew wide, "They did? When is it 
coming out?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Two months. I think we need to promote it 
heavily."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Kid A re-release? What's that?" Rob asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Radiohead went back into the studio and re-mastered Kid
   A to celebrate it's tenth anniversary. The only thing is it took them another
   year to do it. Apparently they actually re-recorded whole portions 
of the album.
   And the only way you can get it is in physical form, no 
downloads."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Sounds like quite the collectable," Rob was 
always on the
   lookout for another investment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shrugged, "I don't know, how can you improve on the
   original?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Does it matter, Radiohead hasn't released anything for
   three years, this is huge. So, I was thinking we put the display right in the
   front..." Ian and Martin talked shop until Kristen returned with 
their food.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well gents, what new social concern are you 
talking about
   this time?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian smiled at Kristen, "Oh nothing nearly as 
entertaining,
   we're just talking business. I own a little record shop, 'Mended Record.' If
   you're into good music come check us out." He handed Kristen a business card,
   "We have a wide range of stuff so I know you won't be 
disappointed."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Kristen took the card, a small smile played 
across her lips.
   "Oh, I might just do that, enjoy your meals."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom chuckled, "Very slick, you gave her your 
number, pimped
   your business, and set up a meeting outside the club all with one 
little card."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Like I said, I'm the master." The group began 
eating their
   meals. Over dinner the good natured banter continued. Eventually 
the conversation
   again drifted to science fiction.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom sighed, "Well the search for the perfect 
burger continues.
   What is it about this country that makes it impossible to properly 
cook ground
   beef?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I'm not even going to get into this again, 
you're in England.
   Stop trying to find American food. Expand your horizons."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom looked down at the remains of his burger. 
"All I wanted
   was a hamburger, is that too much to ask?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Apparently it is," Ian muttered. He went to take a pull
   from his beer, but found it empty. "Hey Tom, would you mind getting 
me a refill?
   I see you're dry too."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shrugged, "Sure, anything to get away from 
'Red Dwarf.'"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian chuckled, "Admit it , you're a fan too."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom stood up, "Sure, before I moved here and 
started hanging
   out with you guys." He walked over to the bar and placed his order. 
He collected
   the beers and paid the bartender. As he walked back to the table he 
accidentally
   bumped a woman was facing the other way.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hey watch where you're going asshole." The woman said,
   turning around.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh, I'm sorry...Daria?" Tom said in disbelief. And it
   was in fact Daria Morgendorffer. Her hair was a littler shorter, 
she was wearing
   different clothes, "Well obviously her clothes would be different," 
Tom thought
   to himself, "It has been ten years." Her glasses were also 
conspicuously missing,
   but it was Daria.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"How do you know my...Tom? Is that you?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I was going to say the same thing." He looked around and
   spotted an empty table. "Are you here with anyone?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria shook her head, "No, you?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well, yeah, but they can wait, come on let's 
go get caught
   up."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria shrugged, "Ok, sure." Tom led her to the 
empty table
   he had noticed earlier.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"So," Tom asked, "What brings you to London?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Business, the magazine I work for assigned me to write
   about literary travesties, this place fit the bill." </font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You're a journalist then?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria nodded, "For now, it's pretty boring 
though. I'm thinking
   about either working on a novel or going into teaching."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Teaching, really? I never saw you as a 
teacher, honestly."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Neither do I, but it would be something to do until the
   movie deal."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom smiled, "Nice to know some things stay the same. By
   the way, what happened to your glasses?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Eye surgery," Daria replied evenly, "Pragmatism won out
   over vanity." She shrugged, "I had them done a couple years back." 
An uncomfortable
   silence descended on the table, both Daria and Tom waiting to say something,
   but neither of them quite knowing what. "So," Daria said after clearing her
   throat, "Did you get all your grandfather's money?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom nodded, "Most of it at any rate, I only 
graduated summa
   instead of magna," He shrugged, "It's still more than enough money 
for me."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I suppose so..." She searched her fingernails for some
   hidden truth, "Keep in touch with anyone from Lawndale?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shook his head, "Not really."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I can understand that, how's your family?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well, Elsie's doing well enough for herself. 
She finished
   business school a while back and is working at one of the firm's 
branch offices.
   My mom's heading up her committees as usual, and my dad..." he shrugged,
   "We haven't spoken since I came here. He wanted me to form my own company or
   something, I didn't. 'Sloanes are leaders of industry, they don't work for a
   company, they own it.' Or something other bullshit." He sighed, 
"But I'm being
   an inconsiderate ass, how's your family?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well, after Dad's second heart attack my mom convinced
   him that retirement would be a good idea. So now he's the terror of the golf
   course. Mom finally made partner, and still spends more time at the 
office than
   anyone else. And Quinn...she's doing well enough I suppose."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"What's that supposed to mean?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"It means she's about this close to breaking out in her
   acting career, and that bugs the hell out of me."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Is this a given?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria shrugged, "She's been getting great 
reviews from her
   most recent play. It's only a matter of time before somebody casts her in a
   film."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You know what, you should write something for 
her."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Why? Sure we're getting along better than when we were
   kids, but why should I help her achieve her inevitable fame and 
fortune?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Because you could use her to spring-board your career as
   a writer. Sort of like Matt Damon and Ben Affleck."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"So write a killer screenplay that showcases her talent
   as a way to get my foot in the door...Tom you're an evil genius. Why didn't
   I think of that?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You were too consumed with irrational sibling rivalry to
   know what's good for you."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I guess so, thanks for straitening that out for me." She
   reached over and patted Tom's hand, "You know, it actually is good to see you
   again Tom."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yeah, it's good to see you too Daria," he paused, "So,
   how's Jane doing?" he muttered into his beer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Jane's doing well enough. She moved back to 
Lawndale after
   living in New York for a while. She claimed the eclectic nature of the city
   inhibited her creativity." Tom chuckled, "So she's still living at 
the old Lane
   house, and runs a little paint shop/house painting operation to pay 
the bills."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"House painting? Oh, how the mighty have 
fallen."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Not really, she requires complete creative control over
   the project and any murals she does over the course of the job are 
extra."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom laughed, "Ok, that sounds more like Jane."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria nodded, "Of course it goes without saying that the
   color scheme of Lawndale has become more...eccentric."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"It's good to hear she's doing well. Though I 
am surprised
   to hear she's still living in Lawndale."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria shrugged, "I think she likes the thought of having
   someplace permanent to call home, what with the rest of her family scattered
   to the winds."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I suppose, I never thought of it that way." They settled
   back into silence. "So, uh, are you seeing anyone?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria shook her head, "Not really, nobody 
special at least.
   How about you?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Despite the best efforts of my friend Ian I 
remain unattached."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria raised an eyebrow, "Sounds like you have 
a few stories
   to tell."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shrugged, "When you get set up on as many blind dates
   as I have they start to blend together."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria reached into her bag and took out a small notebook
   and a pen. "Come on, just a couple, I'm sure there are some that 
standout."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I thought you were a journalist. Why would anyone want
   to see this reported?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well if I'm going to write a 'killer 
screenplay' I'm going
   to need ideas."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom sighed, "So long as I get a percentage of the gross."
   He finished off his beer. "Ok, there was this one time when Ian set 
me up with
   this acrobat..." Tom launched into his story, "...and then she put 
a cantaloupe
   on top of that. It was the damndest thing I ever saw." </font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hmmm, so the human body can bend like that, 
good to know."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom looked at his empty beer bottle 
thoughtfully, "Hey Daria,
   have you ever thought about us, you know, maybe getting back 
together?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Why, so you could fuck my life up again?" 
Daria was instantly
   on edge.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom sighed "I suppose I had that coming. Ok, I'll admit
   it, I fucked up back then, and I'm sorry for that."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria stared at Tom coldly, "Oh, that makes me 
feel so much
   better now that I know that."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom held up his hands defensively, "Hey now, I said that
   in good faith."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria shrugged, "So, did your therapist 
recommend you apologize
   to all your old girlfriends to get some sort of weird closure?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shook his head, "No, it's nothing like that. I just
   wanted to apologize to you. I guess I felt I owed you considering 
all the grief
   I caused.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria shook her head, "I should feel grateful, 
or something.
   But since your dumping me hardly rates as one of the most traumatic 
experiences
   of my life, you'll have to excuse me if I don't hand you a 
humanitarian award."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom chuckled sadly, "It's comforting to know that you're
   still firmly ensconced behind your wall of cynicism and distrust."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria scowled, "Well pardon me if I seem a 
little distrustful
   of my ex-boyfriend. Who has on multiple occasions proven that he is 
not worthy
   of any trust."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Here's what I think, I think that you're just afraid to
   open up again simply because of one bad experience."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh bullshit!" Daria exclaimed, "In the first place, why
   should I 'open up' to the person who burned me the first time?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Because I've grown as a person..."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria held up her hand, "I'm not finished. Second, where
   do you get off diagnosing what may or may not be wrong with my love life? Tom
   you haven't seen me in ten years. How do you know anything about me? Isn't it
   even remotely possible that I've changed? Maybe I am a more open person these
   days. Did you ever think that I might have a more active social life, with a
   wide circle of friends and acquaintances. Hell, I'm here in a 
London night club
   aren't I? Isn't that proof that I've changed and that maybe, just maybe the
   world doesn't revolve around the needs of Mr. Thomas Sloane?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Uhm, didn't you say the reason you're here is 
because you're
   on assignment for your magazine?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"That's beside the point," Daria said, 
frowning, "Just because
   I'm on assignment doesn't invalidate what I said."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom sighed, "No, it doesn't. And you're right, we haven't
   spoken in a long time, and you could've had this big personality shift. But
   on the other hand, something tells me that's a load of shit."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"What, I'm an anti-social loser who's incapable 
of change?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Again Tom refused to rise to the bait, "Stop 
trying to goad
   me Daria, I know you well enough to see through that at least."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Then help me out here, what did you mean?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I meant you're a very closed off person who 
tends to maintain
   a small, but close-knit, circle of friends and who doesn't see the need to go
   out clubbing every night just because that's what everyone else is 
doing. It's
   a quality about you I've always admired."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria paused, "Oh, well, that's nice of you to say...but
   don't think that means I'm accepting any apologies from you."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh Christ, now you're being stubborn. Did I really hurt
   you that much?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria sighed, "Yes and no. It's not like I locked myself
   in my room and cried for hours on end; but I was upset and mad at you, after
   all you're the one who wanted us to have a relationship in the 
first place."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Now in my defense I'd like to point out that I did not
   technically dump you. All I did was mention that since we were 
attending different
   schools exclusiveness might be a problem. I was just stating the 
obvious."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yeah, I know that...now." The emphasis Daria placed
   on that statement made Tom raise his eyebrows questioningly, but 
Daria continued
   on, ignoring him, "But to an eighteen year old girl it sounded like you were
   breaking up with me...then there was Emily..."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh great, here we go," Tom sighed in 
exasperation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Here we go? You were going out with her."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Only after I thought you had broken up with 
me." Tom shot
   back.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I showed up to apologize to you asshole, only when I got
   there I saw you cavorting with some other woman. That's what hurt, and that's
   why I won't accept your apology now."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom leaned back in his chair, rubbing his 
forehead slowly.
   "Oh hell Daria, I never knew that."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria nodded, "A friend drove me to Dartmouth and I was
   all set to say I was sorry, let's have another try at it. But the first thing
   I saw was you swapping spit with that girl. I went right back to Williams and
   that was that."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I thought you were up there for a lecture, at 
least that's
   what you told me."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria shrugged, "I was planning on doing both, and ended
   up doing neither."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom nodded, "Well that explains a lot, but 
Daria, you have
   to understand that Emily truly was a transitory fling, there were 
no deep feelings
   on either side of that relationship."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria shook her head, "Tom, we've had this 
argument before,
   I don't want to repeat it."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Then we don't have to." Tom said, seizing the opening,
   "Daria, I've said I'm sorry, if this is such a non-issue for you 
then why won't
   you accept a simple apology?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria sighed, "Ok, it was a big deal for me, and you did
   hurt me." She paused, "Oh what the hell, apology accepted, you were 
just being
   you, I can't hold an irrational grudge against you this long for 
just that reason."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hey now...I guess I had that coming to me, 
didn't I?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"That and so much more."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Revenge served at Arctic temperatures?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Damn strait."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom chuckled, "What do you say we start from scratch? Hi,
   I'm Tom Sloane, can I buy you a drink?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria smirked, "No, I don't think we can start 
from scratch
   there's too much history between us for that, but you can buy me 
that drink."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ok then." Tom signaled for a waitress to come 
over to take
   an order. As they waited the two lapsed into idle small talk.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">While the reunion played out Ian grew more and 
more concerned
   about the location of his beer, "What's taking that asshole so 
long?" He muttered,
   "It's a simple task, go to the bar, get two beers and return, it's so simple
   even Martin could get it right."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hey, I'm sitting right next to you!" Martin 
protested.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Sorry man, didn't see you sitting there." </font></p>
<p><font face="Times"> At that moment Kristen came by to collect their plates,
   "And how was everything gents?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian turned and smiled at Kristen, "Oh quite lovely thank
   you."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">She noticed the place Tom had occupied, 
"Where'd your rich
   Yank friend go?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian scowled, "He appears to have gotten lost 
somewhere between
   here and the bar, with my beer."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Kristen laughed, "I can go get you a fresh 
one."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Only if you get one for yourself too," Ian 
said invitingly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well, my shift is pretty much over...alright, just let
   me get out of this uniform and you've got yourself a deal."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Excellent, I shall eagerly await your 
return."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I'll be right back then." Kristen smiled at Ian as she
   walked off with the group's empty dishes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian leaned back in his seat and sighed, "Ah, 
you know what
   lads, life is good." </font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"But what about Tom and your beer?" Rob asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Tom who?" Ian asked momentarily bewildered, "Oh, him. He
   can keep the beer for all I care, but I guess we should find out 
where he went.
   Martin, be a good lad and locate our American friend will you."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Why me?" Martin protested.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"What else are you going to do?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I don't know...why don't we have Rob go look 
for him."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Capital idea, Rob, go help him out."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"What?" Rob shouted, "You're just trying to get rid of us
   aren't you."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Perceptive lad, I knew there was a reason I liked you.
   Now get going, you two are cramping my style."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Come on Martin, we need to give the 'Master' 
room to work."
   Rob dragged his friend away from the table and into the throng of 
people surrounding
   the bar.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">As Martin and Rob searched for him Tom continued chatting
   with Daria. "...so it was about then that the cops broke through the door,
   and of course I was the guy holding the plantain."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria raised an eyebrow, "That's quite a tall 
tale."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"It's all true though, I have the pictures to 
back me up."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Even the part with the midget?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom raised a sleeve to reveal a faded scar on 
his arm, "Especially
   the midget, unfortunately."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well I'm impressed, you've certainly had an interesting
   time in London."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Too interesting, I haven't even told you about the soccer   game we went to last year."</font></p><p><font face="Times" 
 >"I can imagine."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"So tell me, how does the average day in the 
life of Daria
   go these days?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria shrugged, "I wake up, write some stuff to make my
   editor happy, then go back to bed. How about you, beside the 
drunken bacchanalias
   I mean?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Pretty much the same. Subway to work, type code all day,
   go home and practice Zen meditation while Ian rains chaos down on 
everyone surrounding
   him. It's not much, but it's a living."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"That's what I keep telling Quinn. And yes," Daria said,
   answering Tom's raised eyebrow, "Quinn and I are sharing an 
apartment, for now."
   She added hastily.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Now that I never would have guessed, how did this come
   to pass?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"A couple years back my roommate at the time 
moved out and
   Quinn just happened to show up about the same time looking to start 
up her acting
   career. I needed someone to share the rent with and she needed a 
place to live."
   She shrugged, "It made sense at the time."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times"> Tom nodded, "So, how's it working out for you 
two?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"It's kind of like living in a sitcom." Daria commented
   dryly. "Thankfully it's only a temporary situation since she's 
going to be moving
   in with someone else soon. So I'll be rid of her and all her inane friends,
   hopefully."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Still, it must be comforting to have your sister right
   there."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"It is, I guess...don't get me wrong, Quinn's grown up
   a lot, but she's still Quinn, and every now and then she does something that
   really sets me on edge."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I wouldn't expect it to be any other way."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh and you'll never guess who she's moving in 
with."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"A safe bet considering I haven't seen Quinn in ten years
   and never knew her very well even then."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria shook her head, "No, you know him it's..." She
   was interrupted by Martin and Rob's arrival.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"There you are Tom, we've been looking all over for you,"
   Martin said breathlessly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"That's great guys, now can you two get lost, I'm talking
   to someone here." Tom nodded in Daria's direction to emphasis his 
point.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Rob's eyes grew wide as he examined Daria and 
her retro-alternative
   outfit. "Whoa, why hello there, I'm Rob, and what's your name?" He extended
   a hand to Daria.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I'm Daria." She replied, not shaking Rob's 
hand.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom sighed, "Martin, Rob, meet Daria. Daria, Martin and
   Rob. Now guys Daria's an old friend of mine from the States, can we have some
   time alone to catch up?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"But Ian told us to find you." Martin 
complained.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And you did, so go tell Ian where I am."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Actually, Ian was just getting rid of us to 
put the moves
   on the waitress." Rob said sourly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And now I'm getting rid of the two of you so I can talk
   to my friend. Now get lost." Tom told the pair forcefully.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Rob sighed, "Come on Martin, no rest for the righteous.
   The pair stalked off somewhat dejectedly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria watched the twosome leave, "You know, they really
   remind me of those two guys who used to hang around you at 
Fielding."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom nodded, "I know, it's like I'm this big geek magnet
   or something."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Maybe they think you're their king or something." Daria
   commented dryly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shook his head, "Wouldn't surprise me in the slightest.   You were going to tell me some startling revelation 
about Quinn?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hmm? Oh, yes. She's going to be moving in with 
Dave Wylie."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You're kidding, Dave, from Lawndale?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria nodded, "That's the guy. He and Quinn 
just kept hanging
   out after all these years. So they figured they might as well live together.
   I think Quinn says they're in love...or something I don't know." 
Daria shrugged,
   "I still think Quinn's just after his money and Dave's after her 
body."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"What's he up to? We were never as close we should have
   been."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well, he went to medical school, got his M.D., 
then became
   a paramedic. Something about wanting to help people, I don't know, altruism
   is a foreign concept to me."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"So he went through with that. I remember this one time
   the two of us got absolutely shit-faced, this was right after you 
broke up with
   me. Anyway he started going off on how he wanted to go into 
medicine, and something
   about giving people chances, it's all kind of hazy in my mind. But I'm glad
   to see he's doing what he wants to do."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria nodded, "We all kind of lucked out there 
didn't we."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom chuckled, "Having affluent parents sure is 
a handy thing."
   They lapsed into silence. "So, uh..." Tom began, "do you have any 
good stories
   to tell from living with Quinn?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Most I can't discuss since they're part of 
ongoing investigations,
   but there are a few, like the time one of Quinn's old high school 
cronies showed
   up for a visit."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Which one was that?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Stacy, the one without a spine."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Has she grown one?"<br>
   </font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Not that I noticed, but Quinn says she was worse in high
   school. Well she came out to visit her 'wild, single girlfriend braving the
   big city.' From what I gathered, the rest of the Fashion Club realized they
   didn't have any viable life skills so they got married as quickly 
as possible.
   Anyway, one night I come home and find Stacy hitting the bar 
hard."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You have a bar?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria nodded, "Yes, a fully stocked we bar, it came with
   the apartment. So I came home and found Stacy absolutely blitzed, and she saw
   me and just started bawling her eyes out. She was going on and on about how
   her marriage sucked, being a house wife is boring and that her life was just
   generally awful. I managed to get her settled down, until Quinn 
came home, which
   set her off on another crying jag. Only this time she threw in how much she
   envied Quinn and wished she could have a life like that. This freaked Quinn
   the hell out and she started screaming we had to call the cops, because Stacy
   was going to kill us in some freakish obsessive manner. Honestly, for a while
   I thought she was going to kill us too; either that or pledge her 
undying love
   for Quinn. It was a very strange scene."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Sounds like it, how'd you resolve things?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria shrugged, "I told her she'd find the 
answers she was
   looking for at the bottom of the tequila bottle."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ouch, and that didn't kill her?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria shook her head, "If only we had been so lucky. No,
   Quinn called Dave and he took Stacy to the hospital where she spent 
the night."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Christ, now that's a story."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh, but it doesn't end there. After she 
sobered up at the
   hospital I voted to dump her on a bus, but Dave and Quinn outvoted 
me. I guess
   over the course of the night Stacy had let slip she was prone to have these
   little incidents..."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"She was a drunk?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Isn't that was I said?" Tom motioned for her 
to continue,
   "Yes, she was a drunk."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And you wanted to dump her on a bus?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria shrugged, "Her life is none of my concern, besides,
   like I said, I was outvoted. So Quinn helped Stacy dry out. She divorced her
   husband and is now doing something. All in all a victory for the 
forces of goodness
   and light."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom whistled, "I'm impressed, that doesn't 
sound like Quinn."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"The only reason she ever gave for her actions during the
   whole affair was a muttered, 'Could've been me.' I guess it hit 
close to home."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Mmm," Tom agreed, "When was all this?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"About a year ago or so."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom nodded as the conversation came to a lull. 
He was about
   to say something when Martin rushed up to the table.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hey Tom, come quick, we need you."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Whatever it is, it can wait," Tom replied, 
testily.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"This can't, Ian's about to get into a fight 
with some Marines."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom rubbed his forehead in a vain attempt to ward off an
   oncoming headache, "Ok, I'll be right there. Wait right here, I'll be back in
   a few minutes." He told Daria, then left following Martin.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria played with her drink as she waited. 
After a few minutes
   the normal din of a nightclub was interrupted by the noise of a 
brawl. Bottles,
   furniture and even bodies were flying through the air. Daria 
watched disinterestedly
   as the melee spilled onto the dance floor. She stood up and calmly made her
   way to the exit when the police sirens could be heard. As she picked her way
   through the crowd Tom was nowhere to be found.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well that was a sufficiently weird enough 
evening for me.
   I think I'll call it a night before Trent, or any other romantic 
interest from
   my past, shows up." Daria said, deadpan, as she stood on the street. She bent
   over and picked up a piece of paper that brushed up against her. It 
was a flyer
   advertising an old fashioned rave being held the next night. She 
shrugged, stuffed
   it in a pocket, and hailed a cab to take her back to her hotel.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Several hours later, Tom, Ian, Kristen, Rob and 
Martin were
   back at Tom's apartment nursing their injuries. They managed to 
elude the police
   with Kristen's help. After a brief trip to the hospital to make sure no one
   was seriously injured the group went to the closest apartment to recuperate.
   They were all sitting in Tom's living room, Kristen and Ian were on 
the couch,
   Tom occupied his leather recliner, and Martin and Rob were each collapsed in
   overstuffed easy-chairs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ian, I want you to answer one little 
question." Tom asked
   as he adjusted the cold compress bound to his aching ribs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"What's that?" Ian asked from behind the raw steak placed
   over his left eye.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Do you have to start a riot at every club we 
go to?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"What was I supposed to do? Those dumb Marines insulted
   Kristen. I couldn't let that stand."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You ninny, I told you, I don't need anyone to 
protect me."
   She batted Ian on the arm, he winced.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hey there, careful, that part of me is a little tender.
   I know you don't need help, but I wanted to be of help. Besides we all need
   someone to provide assistance from time to time."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh that's so sweet of you. In a very Neanderthal sort of
   way." She kissed him on the lips. "I hope that part's not too 
sore." She added,
   a mischievous twinkle in her eye.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Not at all, in fact I'd say it's one of two spots that
   aren't sore."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Where's the other?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ask me again when we're alone and I'll show 
you." He replied
   with a playful leer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I can't wait."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ok, knock it off you two. I'm trying to be mad 
at Ian remember?"
   Tom said testily.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Eh, what? Oh yes, right, right, go on."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Your little antics interrupted a very pleasant 
conversation
   I was having with a very interesting person."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"So Rob said, who was she and did you get her 
number?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"It was Daria Morgendorffer, and no, I didn't 
get the chance."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Daria? As in the Daria?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom nodded, "The one and the same."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian chuckled, "Christ, isn't that funny."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom frowned, "Oh yeah, a real laugh riot. As opposed to
   the real riot we were just in." He added, somewhat lamely.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Who's Daria?" Kristen asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh, she's Tom's long lost love. He spend the 
entire drive
   over to the club moping over her and then bam, there she is. And I'll be you
   don't even know where she's staying or for how long."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom looked down at his feet, "Uhm, well, not 
exactly."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Figures, that is your style after all."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shrugged, "Not like it really matters, she was still
   pretty pissed at me."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian nodded, "Ahh yes, woman scored and all that. That's
   the problem with women, they carry a grudge," Kristen smacked Ian on the back
   of his head. "Ow, hey watch it, I've got a concussion, remember."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Don't worry," Kristen replied sweetly, "I'll make sure
   you don't fall asleep tonight."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I can't wait," Ian said lecherously.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Again, this isn't something I want to hear." 
Tom said annoyed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And you think I want to hear you mope about your missed
   opportunity with some chick who dumped you ten years ago?" Tom didn't bother
   responding since the answer was obvious.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">An uncomfortable silence hung over the room, 
which Kristen
   finally broke. "Look, uh Tom, I can tell you're pretty down right now, so may
   I make a suggestion?" Tom shrugged. "There's going to be an 
old-fashioned rave
   tomorrow night. You know, abandoned warehouse, lots of music, 
ecstasy, and glow
   sticks. You should go, it might cheer you up."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"A real rave?" Ian asked, "Outstanding, I haven't been to
   one of those in years. Martin, Rob, you boys up for a little booty 
shaking?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Martin shook his head, "Sorry Ian, I already promised to
   run sound for this band tomorrow."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"As you well know Ian, I do not 'shake my booty' as you
   so urbanely put it. Besides I have to update the value of my 
inventory tomorrow
   night."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian sighed, "And the two of you wonder why you don't get
   chicks. Well Tom, how about it?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom rubbed his sore ribs, "I'm not sure I could survive
   another evening with you this weekend."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ah, come on man, Kristen will be there to keep an eye on
   me. You know you want to. It'll be good for you. Out on the dance floor, with
   all those sexy, hot, sweaty, horny women. You can't miss."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And you'll be sure to keep him out of 
trouble?" Tom asked
   Kristen.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Don't worry about a thing. I'm sure I can keep 
him occupied."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"So you'll go?" Ian asked pressingly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shrugged, "I suppose so."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Excellent, you won't regret it." Ian gave 
Kristen a questioning
   look and nodded in the direction of the door. She responded with an emphatic
   nod of her own. "Well then, it was an outstanding evening and I shall see you
   all later. Tom, thank-you for the steak, do you want it back?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"No, no, you can have it."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well then, thanks for the steak, and see you tomorrow."
   Ian and Kristen waved goodbye to the rest of the group and left.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom stood up and yawned, "Well, you two can crash here if
   you want, I'm going to get some sleep."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Rob also got up, "No, that's quite alright, 
I'll get Martin
   home and make sure he doesn't die overnight or anything." He caught Martin
   by the arm, "Come on buddy, we're going home, take it easy Tom."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Good night, and good luck." Tom waved to the 
pair as they
   left the apartment. He went to bed and slept soundly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The next morning Tom awoke with a groan. It 
wasn't so much
   the hangover, which was pretty mild as it was the dull pain all up his left
   side. He got up and evaluated himself in the mirror.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Next time you're in a bar fight, duck when 
someone swings
   a chair at you." Dark purple bruises ran up and down the left side 
of his torso.
   Tom gingerly touched them and winced, "Ok, I'm going to the hospital again,
   get me some painkillers and maybe some leaches." Tom walked into his bathroom
   and took some aspirin from his medicine cabinet. He dry-swallowed the pills
   and started filling the bathtub. While he waited for the tub to 
fill he wandered
   into the kitchen and made some breakfast. Tom stared out his window 
while sipping
   his coffee, the events of the previous night running through his 
head.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"So, Daria is in town at an unknown location 
for an unspecified
   amount of time. How am I supposed to feel about this?" He frowned because he
   didn't know the answer to his own question. Certainly the way in which he and
   Daria had broken up was one of his big regrets. It also was true that Daria
   posed one of the biggest "what if's" in Tom's life. "What if we hadn't broken
   up, where would we be?" Tom didn't know the answer to that either. "But do I
   really want to start a relationship with her again, even if she'd 
let me?" Tom
   shook his head, "A hot bath'll clear my mind." He thought, but 
while returning
   to the bathroom he stopped at the phone. He punched in a number, and waited
   for an answer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hi Matt? It's Tom. Look, I need to ask you a favor? What
   time is it? Uh, I don't know. Oh, 11? Well, most people would consider that
   late you know. Anyway this is a real simple favor, could you check 
all the hotels
   in town and see if a 'Daria Morgendorffer,'" he spelled her name 
for the person
   on the other end, "Is staying at any of them. She'd be from New 
York, age about
   28, probably by herself. You will? Great, could you get in touch with me as
   soon as you know? Call my cell if I'm not here. You've got that number right?
   Ok, thanks a lot Matt, I owe you. Talk to you later." Tom hung up the phone
   and walked into the bathroom.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Daria may or may not hate my guts, and I don't know if
   I'm still in love with her, but it never hurts to be thorough." He thought to
   himself as he slipped into the hot water. He quickly drifted back 
to sleep.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom woke up to a cold tub and a ringing phone. 
Tom scrambled
   out of the tub and reached for the phone, "Hello?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"There's a Daria Morgendorffer checked into the Hilton.
   Residence New York City, single occupant in the room. Need to know 
how she paid?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"No, that won't be necessary."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ok, she's in room 314. She's staying there 
until tomorrow.
   Her phone number is...got a pen?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yeah, give it to me." Tom wrote the number 
down.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Times">"Want to know anything else?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"No, but thanks Matt, I owe you."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And I will call you on that too. Remember, we never had
   this conversation."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"What conversation? See you around Matt."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Take it easy Tom." The line went dead.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"So, now I know," Tom said to no one in particular. Then
   he remembered he was standing in his living room, naked and 
dripping wet. "Good
   thing I don't have any roommates." Tom dried himself off and got 
ready to face
   the remainder of the day. After getting dressed he made a second 
pot of coffee
   and sat on the deck of his apartment. He looked out across the 
London skyline,
   trying to find an answer in the old city's silhouette.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"It'd be easy enough to call her, but would that send the
   wrong message? I don't want her to think I'm obsessing over her or anything
   like that..." He paused, "of course I did just have a hacker find out where
   she's staying. But there's a difference between gathering 
information and acting
   on it." He sighed, "Come on Tom, shit or get off the pot, it's not that hard
   a choice." He looked down at the piece of paper he had written the 
information
   on. "I think it'd be best if I just let this stay the way it is. At 
least this
   way she won't be filing any injunctions against me." He turned the paper over
   but did not throw it out. He chuckled, "I wonder what Ian would have to say
   about all this?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I'd say you need to start locking your front door." Ian
   said from behind Tom. He walked over to where Tom sat and dropped 
into a nearby
   deck chair. "But I am glad to know that you think of me when 
looking for guidance
   in times of personal crises, I am a font of wisdom after all." </font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"The same font that insulted a group of Royal 
Marines last
   night?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian shrugged, "They had it coming. So, what is it you're
   having the big internal debate over?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I'll tell you only after you tell me what you're doing
   here. Oh and the eye's looking much better by the way."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Thanks, liberal use of leaches cleared it right up. As
   for why I'm here, well you seemed like you wanted to keep on 
talking last night,
   and I definitely wasn't in the mood to listen to you prattle, now I 
am."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom chuckled, "Ok, fair enough, as I'm sure you 
could guess
   it was about Daria." He handed Ian the piece of paper, "I did what you said
   and had Matt track her down."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And now you're wavering on calling her. Jesus, you are
   a consistent bastard I'll give you that."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well, it is a hard choice. I mean I don't want 
her to think
   I'm stalking her or anything."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Bullshit, you're just too scared to call 
her."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"What the hell are you talking about?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"That is a fucking bullshit answer you just gave, 'don't
   want to look like a stalker.' Please, she's the one who came to London, she's
   the one who walked by your apartment, if anyone's the stalker, it's 
her. Besides
   you almost have to call her."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Why, just because I know the hotel she's at?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"No, you dense fuck, because I'll bet you left 
things hanging
   last night when you came to bail me out right?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom smacked his forehead, "Damnit, I told her 
I'd be right
   back."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"See, you have to call her, if for no other reason than
   to apologize for your atrocious manners last night."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom sighed, "Yeah, you're right, ok, I'll call 
her."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Excellent, now where's that pot of fine Colombian brew
   you always have going?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"In the kitchen like always," Tom waved his hand in the
   direction of the kitchen.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Very good, let me go avail myself of the java and then
   I'll coach you while you talk to Daria." Ian called out as he walked into the
   kitchen.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You're British, you should be drinking tea." Tom shouted
   at Ian.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"F.O.A.D. my friend," Ian replied, punctuating 
the comeback
   with an extended middle finger. "Sometimes you need coffee." He returned to
   the balcony, a steaming cup of coffee in his hand. "And today I need coffee
   in a bad way."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom chuckled, "The mighty drinker has a 
hangover?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian shook his head, "Nah, more post concussion syndrome
   than anything else. I didn't drink that much."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And normal people usually duck when someone 
tries to bash
   their brains out with a table leg."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian shrugged, "I'm confident my head is hard 
enough to resist
   any damage. Now quit stalling and call the damn woman."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Alright, jeez, keep your pants on, and I mean 
that literally."
   Tom reached for the cordless phone sitting on the table next to him. Just as
   he put his hand on it the phone started ringing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom and Ian stared at each other, neither one 
quite comprehending
   the odd coincidence.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well, are you going to answer it?" Ian 
demanded, "Because
   if you won't I will and you won't like that at all, believe you 
me."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom raised the phone to his ear, "Ok, I'm answering it.
   Hello?" he asked the phone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well, well, if it isn't my expatriate brother. What took
   you so long to answer, sleeping off a bender?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Why hello there Elsie, how good to hear from 
you. To what
   do I owe the pleasure?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian looked up from his coffee when he heard Tom 
say Elsie's
   name. "The fair Elsie is on the phone? Give it here I want to say hello." He
   reached out for the phone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom batted away Ian's hand, "Knock it off, I'm trying to
   talk to my sister," He realized Elsie was trying to say something, "What was
   that Elsie? Bit of static on my end."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Elsie sighed, "I was trying to answer your 
question. A couple
   days ago Mom handed me this letter."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"When did you see Mom?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"A couple of says ago, like I said. Jesus are 
you even paying
   attention?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Obviously I am if I thought to ask, mom's still living
   in Lawndale and you're in Boston."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"But how do you know that's still true? It's not like you
   keep in touch."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"That's the second time in as many days someone has used
   that argument on me, and this time I'm not buying it. If you had moved, you
   would have said something. If Mom and Dad had moved I know I would've heard
   about it. Now can you stop giving me a hard time and get on with 
it."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"What's got you in such a rush?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I've got company over."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Let me guess, Ian."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom frowned, "Well, yes, but I don't see why 
that matters,
   company is company."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian heard Tom say his name. "Elsie is asking for me? Oh
   happy day! Now I must speak with her. It is imperative you hand me 
that phone."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom sighed, "Elsie hang on a sec, I'm going to put you on
   speaker." He pushed a button on the phone and placed it on the table. "Ok, go
   ahead Ian."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hello Elsie, how does this day treat you, oh 
fair American
   flower?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom was sure he could hear Elsie roll her eyes, 
"Hello Ian,
   I'm doing well. Now can I talk to my brother in private?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Of course, whatever you need oh fair one. I'll be in the
   living room," he informed Tom. "Farewell sweet Elsie, you will never be far
   from my thoughts." He walked back into the apartment, coffee cup in 
hand.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom picked the phone up, "He's gone."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Damnit Tom, why do you do shit like that? You know the
   guy puts me on edge."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh come on Elsie, Ian means well."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"When I visited last year all he ever did was 
drool on me.
   It wasn't exactly appealing."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Feel flattered you're the only person I've ever seen him
   spend this long pining for."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh wonderful, so I'm the object of desire of a British
   lech, my life is complete."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"He's not that bad...well ok, he is. If he's 
really bothering
   you tell him to fuck off. He can take a hint."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I didn't say he was bothering me..." Elsie 
trailed off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom sighed, "Mom handed you a letter?" He 
prompted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hm? Yeah, a couple of days ago, she was in 
Boston to attend
   some conference. The letter reads as follows. 'Dear Fielding Alumnus. Can you
   believe it's been ten years since we last walked the hallowed halls 
of our beloved
   Fielding Academy..."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom groaned, "Elsie, no."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">She continued, "...So dust off your Old Navy Performance
   Fleece, dig your Abercrombie cargo pants our of storage and get ready to get
   down with Britney Spears and Eminem because it's time for the Class of 2001's
   tenth reunion.' And then it goes on with RSVP information, but I'm 
sure you've
   read all that."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yes, I have, and no I am not going."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Come on Tom, Mom really wants you to go."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Why? It's not like I have any love for 
Fielding."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"What about Mom then?" Elsie shot back, "For fuck's sake
   Tom she hasn't seen you in two fucking years! Could you forget this 
exile thing
   for just a couple of days for her?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"She's more than welcome to visit me here."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Elsie sighed, "You are an intensely stubborn 
son of a bitch,
   did you know that. Come on, it would just be for a couple of days 
and you wouldn't
   even have to stay at home. If you wanted to avoid Dad you could, although he
   wants to see you as much as Mom does."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom massaged the bridge of his nose, "And so I 
should just
   drop everything and rush home? Is that how a Sloane is supposed to 
act?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"First of all you're full of shit if you say you're too
   busy. That pet software company of yours can survive a couple of days without
   you puttering around doing nothing. Second why the hell should you 
give a flying
   fuck about what a Sloane should do? I thought you were the 
anti-Sloane."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I'm not going to win this argument am I?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Not on your life big brother."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well tell mom that you put up a good fight but 
I'm steadfast
   in my refusal. I've had enough Lawndale reunions lately."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"What's that supposed to mean?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I ran into Daria last night." Tom said 
simply.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Daria? As in Daria Morgendorffer Daria?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yes."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"As in the Daria you dumped another girl to be 
with?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"That's a peculiar interpretation, but yes."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"The Daria you preceded to cheat on just a 
scant year later?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom frowned, "Yes, and why do you need all this 
clarification
   anyway? How many Darias do you think I know." He asked annoyed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh, just Daria Morgendorffer. I just like to 
hear you admit
   to being a jackass." Tom could see the sickly sweet smile on his 
sister's face
   as she said this. "I mean you fucked up in almost every conceivable way with
   her."</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yes, that I did, a fact she reminded me of 
last night."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Elsie chuckled, "I'll bet. So tell me, was Jane 
there?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"No, thank god. That would have been beyond 
awkward."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And they're not, like, living together or 
anything?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"No, Jane's still in Lawndale and Daria's living in New
   York. Why are you asking?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well, those two always seemed to be close, real close,
   if you know what I mean."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yes Elsie I..."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Really, really, really, really, really close," Else said
   cutting Tom off. "I'm talking so close..."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Elsie," Tom said testily, "They aren't 
lesbians."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh, you sure about that?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Positive, why, thinking about a lifestyle 
change?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"No, it's just, well never mind. I'm sorry I brought it
   up."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You know, we could tell Ian that you're gay."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I think he'd either try to 'convert' me back , or demand
   to watch me in action. Pass on both accounts."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom laughed, "Yeah, that sounds about right."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"So how did it go?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"How did what go?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Your little Algonquin Round Table with Daria. Were any
   drinks thrown?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"No, nothing like that, I just got a stern 
verbal lashing,
   and then..." He trailed off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And then?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"A riot broke out in the club and we got 
separated."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"A riot?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yes."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"In the bar?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"In the club, yes."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You were interrupted by a riot, in a night 
club."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yes, well we weren't so much interrupted as I 
helped start
   the riot."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You were talking to Daria."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yes."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And then you instigated a riot?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well, yes."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Why on earth would you do a damn fool thing 
like that?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Because I was trying to get Ian out of a 
scrape with some
   Royal Marines."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"So, you got into a fight with the Royal 
Marines?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Not all of them."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well, that makes all the difference in the 
world."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I'm glad you think so."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Did you even say goodbye to Daria?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Uh, no I wasn't I planning on having to evade 
the police."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Do you have her phone number?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Actually yes."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You ninny, why don't you..." Elsie paused, "You actually
   have her phone number?" Her disbelief was evident.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yes, I do."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Wait a second, did you ask her for the 
number?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"No."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"No, of course you didn't. So how did you get 
it?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Called in a favor with a hacker friend of 
mine."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"It figures, still you got her number. Have you 
called her
   yet to apologize?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"No, you called just as I was going to."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Then why are you still talking to me. Go call 
her."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Because you're my sister and I haven't talked to you in
   ages."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh fuck that, we can talk later. You've got a 
small window
   of opportunity here Tom, don't blow it."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Alright, talk to you later Elsie."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Take care Tom. And please, think about coming for that
   reunion. It would mean a hell of a lot to Mom, she does miss you."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ok, I'll think about it, but I'm not committing myself
   to going."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Sure, fine, at least call Mom and tell her 
your decision,
   either way."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom nodded, "Ok, I will. Talk to you soon 
Elsie."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Good luck with Daria.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom chuckled, "Thanks."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Bye Tom."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Bye Elsie." Tom shut the phone off. He picked 
up the paper
   with Daria's number on it. "Well, it's now or never, take the 
plunge." He dialed
   the number, then waited, and waited. He let the phone ring until the hotel's
   voice mail system picked up.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Fuck!" Tom cursed as he turned off the phone, 
without leaving
   a message. He walked into the living room, a dejected look on his 
face.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"So, how is Elsie doing?" Ian asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shrugged, "Don't know, we had other things 
to talk about."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Such as?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Such as my attendance at my high school class's ten year
   reunion, and Daria."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"What did she have to say about her?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"That I should call her."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well, what's stopping you?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I already tried, she wasn't there. I got voice 
mail."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You didn't leave a message did you?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shook his head, "Didn't know what to say."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well, at least you tried, that counts for 
something."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"What, you're going to accept that on face 
value?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Tom, you're a lousy actor. Plus, I can see 
through windows
   as well as the next guy." Ian pointed to the large bay window that overlooked
   the deck.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh, yeah." Tom sighed, "Oh well, it was a nice 
idea."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"What? Calling her up, professing your undying love for
   her and living happily ever after?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shuffled his feet, "Well, something like 
that yes."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian snorted, "Like that ever happens. Come on 
man, you know
   there's no such thing as 'happily ever after.' We just keep on 
stumbling through,
   just under different circumstances."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom dropped onto his recliner, "Yeah, I know, 
but you still
   hope for it."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian nodded, "I hear that man."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The two friends sat in silence and watched the sky redden
   as the sun began to set.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"So I've been meaning to ask, how'd things go 
with Kristen
   last night?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I nailed her, of course."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Was she any good?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"She was a tiger in the sack, absolute firecracker. Best
   sex I've had in ages."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Really, so she's worth another date?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh definitely, unless your sister is 
available."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hey, stay the hell away from my sister. I don't want to
   hear that shit."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Can I help it if Elsie is extremely fuckable? I bet she
   gives great head..."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ian, shut the fuck up if you want to continue 
breathing."
   Tom demanded angrily. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ok man, I'm sorry," Ian said, genuinely 
contrite. "I guess
   that did go from ha-ha funny to kind of sick in a big hurry."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom smiled, "Well, I can't blame you for being yourself
   now can I?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Damn strait, I'm a hunk of prime sex machine, and that's
   nothing to be ashamed of."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"It depends on how much pride you have I 
suppose," Tom added
   dryly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian laughed, "Now that's the Tom Sloane I know. Come on,
   let's ditch this case of the mopes and get a little pre-rave buzz 
going."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom's stomach growled, reminding him that he hadn't eaten
   since breakfast, "How about dinner first then beer?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh all right, where do you want to go?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Pizza sound good to you?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian shrugged, "About as good as anything else." 
They picked
   up their jackets and headed for the door. "Oh, and don't let me 
forget, I have
   to stop off at the 'pharmacy' before we go to tonight's 
festivities."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom sighed, "Oh come on Ian do you really have 
to do that?"
   He asked as they walked down the hall. "I'm sure there will be 
plenty of goodies
   at the rave."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian shook his head, "No that'll just be that 
weak-ass herbal
   shit, I want the real stuff, and the only way to guarantee that is to go to
   Farkas personally and buy it myself."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shook his had and pushed the call button 
for the elevator.
   "Fine, but I'm not going with you, Farkas creeps me the hell out."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"That may be, but he's the best damn quasi-legal druggist
   in the city." Ian thought for a second, "Tell you what, I'll pick up some pot
   for you while I'm there." They entered the elevator; Ian pushed the 
lobby button..</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I don't smoke pot anymore, remember."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Please don't tell me you haven't thought about toking up
   after the way last night went."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom paused, then sighed, "Ok, get me a little, 
I can practice
   meditation after the rave."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Excellent, you won't regret it. This is going 
to be a great
   night." On cue the elevator dinged and the door opened, "After you 
Tom."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I've got a bad feeling about this," Tom 
muttered to himself
   as they left the building.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The friends at their dinner at a small 
neighborhood pizzeria.
   Ian spent the meal explaining why the referees in English football were out
   to get his favorite team. "It's all a conspiracy," Ian said, "You 
see they know
   that Ipswich is the best team out there. But they want precious 
Manchester United
   to win so they screw us every possible chance they get." Ian 
pounded the table
   to emphasis his point. "Take last week's game for example, that 
asshole Griggs
   goes and crashes into our goalie while that pretty-boy Beckam puts the ball
   into an open net, and the referee refused to call anything! It was blatant,
   clear as day yet the blind moron didn't make the call. Now you tell 
me why that
   would be the case unless they're in cahoots with Man United to get them the
   cup?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh, definitely, you can't trust those zebras 
farther than
   you can throw them," Tom said trying to figure out how to buy every football
   team in the country and disband them, just to get Ian to shut up.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"What do zebras have to do with football?" Ian 
asked, confused.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"It's a term for...oh never mind, just eat your pizza."
   Tom said, sighing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">After dinner they once again hailed a cab and went to a
   distinctly seedier side of London. The cab pulled to a stop outside 
a battered
   storefront. The faded sign read "Farkas' Farmacy." Ian carefully checked to
   make sure no one was watching him before he ducked inside, Tom followed suit.
   The interior of the shop was in stark contrast to the dingy exterior. Bright
   fluorescent lights hummed in the ceiling. The linoleum floors glistened The
   walls were painted in an antiseptic white. The products for sale 
were all neatly
   arranged on the shelves. Ian nodded at the cashier and walked to the back of
   the store.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ahh, Farkas, just the man I wanted to see, I 
have a script
   for you to fill." Ian told the man standing behind the pharmacy 
counter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Quiet, not so loud Ian, you never know who 
might be listening."
   Fred Farkas was a slight, perpetually worried man. He ran a 
legitimate pharmacy
   as a cover for his other illicit activities. His most noticeable feature was
   his hair, which he let grow long to conceal his other noticeable 
feature. Namely
   the fact that he lacked an ear, the result of a business deal with 
Russian gangsters
   that soured. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh come on Fred, I'm just here to collect my 
prescription,
   what's the harm in that?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Farkas grabbed Ian by the arm, "Get in the backroom you
   asshole, before you get us all arrested." Farkas pulled Ian into a room off
   the store floor; Tom followed, closing the door behind him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Farkas sat down behind a large desk and motioned for Tom
   and Ian to sit in the facing chairs. "So what can I get you two 
gentlemen?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ten hits or so of Ecstasy and a little pot to chase it
   down."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Is that all? Shit, I practically could have just filled
   out a prescription for that."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian shrugged, "When have you known me to dabble 
in anything
   harder?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You never can tell, that's what a lot of my 
steady customers
   said, in the beginning."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Doesn't being a drug dealer bother you at 
all?" Tom asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Farkas examined his had, "Not really, I try not to sell
   the really nasty stuff. Most of my clients are people like Ian, or long-time
   heroin users. And I'm very careful with them, I make sure the 
heroin is as pure
   as it can be be; plus I don't make it as strong as the other guys. That keeps
   the OD rate down, and keeps me in business.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Old Farkas here is one personable drug 
dealer," Ian added,
   "So, what's my bill for tonight?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well, let's see, ten Ecstasy tablets..."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Make it sixteen, wouldn't want to run out at 
an inopportune
   moment."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ok, sixteen hits of Ecstasy plus one?" Ian held up three
   fingers, "Three grams of pot." Farkas punched some numbers into a calculator,
   "One hundred sixty seven pounds."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Cash ok with you?" Ian asked reaching for his 
wallet.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Cash is always ok with me." Farkas said, 
taking the bills
   from Ian. He reached into his desk and removed some bills, "And here's your
   change."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Pleasure doing business with you."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Farkas walked over to a safe and opened it. Inside was a
   cornucopia of drugs. He removed a large bottle from the safe. Sixteen pills
   were removed from the bottled and placed into a smaller container. 
After returning
   the bottle to its resting place Farkas took another container from 
the safe.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Uh Fred, could we have the pot in two bags; a 
gram in one
   and two in the other?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ok," Farkas measure out the proper amounts then put the
   marijuana back in the safe, which he closed. Ian's purchases were placed in
   a "Farkas Farmacy" bag. "Would you like your receipt in the bag?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Sure, that's fine."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Farkas handed the bag to Ian, "There you go. Thank you,
   please come again."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian took the bag, "Thank-you very much. I'll be back when
   I need to be." Tom and Ian left the pharmacy and walked out into the London
   night.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"So, where are we going now?" Tom asked as Ian 
hailed another
   cab.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Kristen said she'd meet us at a bar near where the rave
   is being held. You know, a little pre-party get together."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ah of course," the two sat in silence as the 
cab sped through
   the streets of London, "You and Kristen," Tom said suddenly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Me and Kristen, yes?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You think she's the right one?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian shrugged, "Dunno yet, but it's going to be 
a fun ride.
   She's a fun girl and we do seem to have a few things in common, so 
far. Of course
   if Elsie suddenly becomes available Kristen's dropped like rotten 
mutton."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Now you're just trying to get my goat."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yes and no old chum. I like your sister a lot. Of course
   if she doesn't feel the same way there's not much I can do about it, but I've
   yet to see a woman resist my charm when I turn it up all the way." He smiled
   smugly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well prepare yourself for a disappointment because I'm
   pretty sure you've met your match with Elsie."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"That's why I must have her, for our children will be a
   race of super-beings destined to rule the world."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom looked at Ian like he had made a totally ridiculous
   statement, which he had. "You sure Farkas didn't put any LSD in 
that Ecstasy?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"No idea, I haven't taken any of it yet."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom sighed, "That's what I was afraid of."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian laughed, "Come on man, have a little sense 
of fun."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh I have a little sense of fun, but with you it's got
   to be more like a planetoid sized sense of fun, with a taste for the absurd
   on the side."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"How's that, you mean my zany antics?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom smirked, "More like your taste in clothes." The two
   friends looked at each other for a long moment before breaking out 
in laughter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh shit man," Ian said, wiping a tear from his eye, "my
   taste in clothes. That was fucking priceless." The cab came to a 
halt in front
   of a small pub. "Great, we're here." Ian got out of the taxi. "Oh Tom, could
   you pay the good man? I'm all tapped out."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom sighed as he reached for his wallet, "Just 
because I'm
   rich doesn't mean I have to pay every time." He muttered to himself 
as he handed
   the cabby a collection of bills.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">By the time Tom entered the pub Ian was already 
at the bar,
   pounding down a beer, "Well that didn't take long," Tom said dryly. 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian held out his arms, "What? We've got a long 
night ahead
   of us, and I need to make sure I'm properly fortified. Hey barkeep, one for
   my friend here."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The bartender nodded and started to draw Tom a 
glass, "Actually
   could I get a scotch, strait." The burly man shrugged and poured Tom a shot.
   "Thanks."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Whoa, scotch, moving up to the big time. Any 
special reason
   for the change?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom downed the shot in one swallow, "Whew, good stuff."
   He shrugged, "No real reason, I just feel like drinking myself into oblivion
   tonight." He motioned for the bartender to serve him another shot.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Okay, now Tom, there is a difference between a 
good pre-party
   buzz and getting shitfaced, and if you keep this up," He watched as 
Tom slammed
   down his second shot, "You won't even be ambulatory for too much 
longer."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Fuck it, doesn't matter." Tom signaled to the bartender
   to leave the bottle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh don't play this horseshit with me now man. I will not
   sit here and listen to you play little, whiny bitch all evening. 'Oh boo-hoo
   I blew my chance with Daria, I cannot feel any lower. How can I 
find the strength
   to carry on?' That's a load of bullshit and you know it."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ian, how the hell do you know anything about 
this?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Beyond what you've told me? Not a whole hell of a great
   deal, but I do know this, if you really are in love with this chick why the
   hell aren't you at her hotel pounding on the door to her room 
demanding to speak
   to her?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Because she'd rip my fucking head off. You 
don't know Daria,
   she's a very closed off person. It takes a lot to get her to open 
up to anyone,
   and she did with me. Then I went and fucked up, royally, and that 
hurt her."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian nodded thoughtfully, "So she let you get 
close and you
   stabbed her in the back. Yes, I can see the problem," he shrugged, "I suggest
   massive amounts of groveling, and lots of presents." Tom stared at his drink.
   "Provided you still love her that is." Tom shrugged, "It's a simple question,
   do you or don't you?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I don't know ok!" Tom shouted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Then you don't, now finish your drink. We'll 
wait for Kristen
   outside, this place is giving off bad vibes."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom sighed, "Yeah, ok." He stood up, a little unsteadily,
   "Daria's in the past and that's where she'll stay." He did not 
sound convincing,
   "At least for tonight."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian shrugged, "Good enough for me." He put some money on
   the bar, "Come on, let's go."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hey, you said you were broke." Tom protested.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I always carry an emergency beer fund. It 
can't be dipped
   into for piddling stuff like cab fare."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Fucking cheap skate drunks." Tom growled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hey, I'm not a cheap skate, it's just that when you've
   got a friend who won't even miss cab fare, why not let him pay."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom sighed, "Remember when we were talking 
about the burdens
   of the rich last night? This is what I'm talking about. When you've got money
   you're always the one who pays."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh just shut up about that will you. Who paid 
for the drinks,
   hm? Me. Who bought the drugs? Me again. So don't say you're the guy 
who always
   foots the bill because you know that's not true." They exited the 
bar and stood
   on the street corner.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"When's Kristen supposed to show up?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian shrugged, "Soon I'd imagine."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well I hope she does get here quickly, we probably look
   like a couple of male prostitutes standing on the corner like 
this."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Bah, you're not pretty enough to be a male whore. It's
   more like I'm the prostitute and you're the John, looking to get a 
little piece
   without his wife knowing about it."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Uh, there was way too much detail in that reply for my
   liking. I'll just pretend I didn't here it."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You just couldn't think up anything snappy to 
say."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Complete blank." Tom said evenly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian chuckled as he looked up and down the street, rocking
   on the balls of his feet. "You know, I was thinking, maybe we should head out
   on a holiday. Maybe check out Spain, or Monaco. Troll some topless 
beaches for
   a little action. Lose some cash playing baccarat..."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Do you even know how to play baccarat?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"No, that's why I'd lose. Doesn't it sound like a grand
   time?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"If you don't have any strong attachment to 
your money."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian laughed, "Hey man, it's only money. And if it has to
   be sacrificed for my amusement so be it."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"That's why you'll never get ahead in the world. You've
   got to take your finances seriously."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Now that sounds like something your illustrious father
   might say." Ian sniffed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shrugged, "Maybe, but he's right. I live well within
   my means because if I treat my bank account like a bottomless pit, I'll hit
   bottom pretty damn quick."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian chuckled, "That's a good one, think it up 
all by yourself?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You aren't the only font around here."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I guess not. So, what do you say? Should I start making
   the reservations?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom looked down at his feet, "I don't know, I'm 
not really
   in a nude beach mood." He thought for a moment, "But you are right, getting
   out of town for a while might not be a bad idea. Maybe I'll go visit Elsie,
   and possibly poke around for anything permanent over there."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You're thinking about moving?" Ian asked in 
surprise.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Maybe," Tom said, shrugging. "I don't know, I'm starting
   to feel the need to do something different, shake things up a 
little, you know."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"No, I don't." Ian said shaking his head. "I think you've
   just come up with another of your patented bullshit 
rationalizations."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh really."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yes, look Tom you've been, well not exactly running, but
   trying to dodge the portions of your life you haven't liked: Daria, 
your family,
   stuff like that. But everywhere you go all that shit just keeps popping back
   up. So you move on to make it go away again."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom looked at Ian dubiously, "So let me guess I 
should face
   my issues and my life will be all happy?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I never said that, but you do have to wrestle 
your demons
   every once in a while just to keep them off balance and in check."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom watched the traffic pass by as he formed his reply,
   "Then what do you think I should be dong?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"For starters go to that reunion of yours, see your old
   haunts as they really are and not through the distortion of your 
memory. I mean
   you say Lawndale the same way other people say 'cum-guzzling fuck 
bucket.' That's
   not a healthy attitude to have towards anyplace, well except 
France. Especially
   for you since you've really had a very easy go of things."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom sighed, "I suppose, but isn't it possible 
that I don't
   want to go to the reunion because I think it will be a stupid waste 
of my time?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh there's that too," Ian admitted. "So don't 
go to reunion,
   visit your parents instead. It doesn't really matter who you go see just so
   long as you're in Lawndale trying to make a measure of peace with 
your past."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I guess, but not right now. The timing is not right. I
   know I'm being petty about this, but I'm just not ready to go 
back."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Then can I go in your place?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom laughed, "To my reunion?" Ian nodded, 
"Yeah, sure that'll
   just blow everyone's mind."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"That and there will be a lot of bored house wives there.
   I'm sure they'd all love to have a chance to ride the Mystical 
Magical Ian Express
   to Sexual Bliss. This'll be a lot of fun."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom sighed, "Then why do I get the feeling I've just made
   a horrible mistake."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian flashed a grin, "Because you have mate."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"That's what I was afraid of. After you're done posing as
   me I might not be allowed back into town."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"It's been know to happen." Ian said with a laugh. "Now
   where the hell is Kristen? She should have been here by now. This 
standing around
   is growing tiresome."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom scanned the crowd surrounding them "I don't see her,
   are you sure this is the right place?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Positive, see that big warehouse over there?" 
Ian pointed
   down the street, "That's where the rave is being held."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Then maybe she went to the wrong place."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Typical of a woman," Ian said in a condescending tone of
   voice, "No sense of..."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Don't finish that sentence if you value your balls." A
   voice behind them said. Tom and Ian spun around and saw Kristen 
standing behind
   them, her arms crossed across her chest, a frown on her face.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Er, hi there Kristen, we were just wondering where you
   were." Ian said in a smooth voice, trying to placate the angry 
woman.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well I'm here now, so let's go hit the dance floor, and
   maybe you can do something for me as a peace offering."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"A peace offering? For what?" Ian asked as the threesome
   walked down the street, "I didn't say anything out of line."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ian," Kristen said sweetly, "There was no way 
in hell you
   could've finished that sentence in a way that would not have ended badly for
   you."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian shrugged, "But I didn't say anything so it's hard for
   you to prove anything."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"She doesn't have to," Tom said dryly. "You do 
enough damage
   to yourself by standing there."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Kristen laughed, "Your friend really has your 
number."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And I his," Ian replied darkly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"What is that supposed to mean?" Tom asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"It means I know where you sleep you traitorous American
   bastard." Ian growled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Kristen laughed again, "Uh oh Tom, better watch 
out, looks
   like you've pissed off a real dangerous customer here." She grabbed hold of
   one of Ian's arms affectionately.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shrugged, "I'm not too worried, after all 
if Ian kills
   me he'll have to start paying for all his cabs."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian laughed, "You got me there. I certainly 
can't kill you
   while you're still useful to me."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You don't know how relieved that makes me 
feel." Tom deadpanned.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well it better, because I could end you just like that
   if I wanted to." Ian snapped his fingers for emphasis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yeah, sure you could," replied Tom sarcastically.</font></p><p><font face="Times">"Ok boys, that's enough posturing, you'v 
e met the required
   amount to keep your penises. Now can we please get a move on? I'm 
getting bored."
   Kristen said, cutting off Ian and Tom's exchange.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And we can't have that now can we?" Ian said, 
"Come Thomas,
   away. The night beckons!" Ian leapt off dramatically in the direction of the
   warehouse. Quite a few of their fellow pedestrians looked at Ian 
strangely.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom sighed, "I wish I could just say he's 
drunk, but, well,
   he's not." He told Kristen as they walked down the street, 
following Ian.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"He certainly does seem to have a unique perspective on
   life." Kristen replied. "That's why I took him up on that 
invitation last night."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Uhm, yeah, about that. I was just wondering what are you
   expecting out of Ian?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Is this an over-protective friend asking?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shook his head, "Just a curious observer."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Kristen watched as Ian swung himself around a 
lamppost before
   replying, "He's a nice enough chap, but a bit of a cad." She 
shrugged, "Whatever
   happens, happens, and I'm sure while it's happening I'll have a 
good time."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom nodded, "Replace good with never dull and 
you're probably
   right."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Kristen smiled, "Never dull is good."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom chuckled, "You were two were made for each other, I
   can see it now."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I wouldn't go that far...but I kind of hope 
you're right."
   Kristen looked at Tom appraisingly, "You're a good friend Tom, I'm 
sure you're
   going to make some special lady very happy."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom scuffed his feet, "Yeah, well so far I've been pretty
   bad on that score."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I find that pretty hard to believe, you seem 
to be a pretty
   decent guy."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shrugged, "I don't know, things always seem to fuck
   up when I'm seeing someone. I just have really bad relationship 
karma."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Is Tom telling his tales of romantic woe?" Ian 
asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"They are not 'tales of woe.'" Tom shot back. "I was just
   saying I have bad luck with women."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Fuck that, they're tales of woe. Anyway here's 
a hypothetical
   for you Kristen. Say you run into this guy you haven't seen in years. Let's
   also say the two of you were high school sweethearts who broke up 
fairly acrimoniously."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"So what's the question I should be answering 
for Tom?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian coughed, "Who said anything about...oh balls. Ok, if
   you were Daria would you be inclined to get back together with 
him?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Kristen ran a hand through her hair, "Well I can't really
   say, I mean I'm not Daria..."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well, as a woman then," Ian said, pressing the 
issue.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"What the hell does that mean? 'As a woman.' 
It's not like
   we're some sort of group mind."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"But there are common points of reference for all women,
   which lends itself to helping us in this matter."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"That's bullshit Ian and you know it. My life 
and this Daria's
   are totally different. I can't say how she'd react in a certain 
situation just
   because we both have two X-chromosomes. That's like saying I can 
predict Tom's
   behavior based on yours. Which is patently ridiculous."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ok, ok, it's a point well taken. Let me try 
again. Speaking
   as you, if you were in Daria's shoes what would you do?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Does Daria know you want to get back together with her?"
   Kristen asked Tom.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shrugged, "I said something like if she ever thought
   about it, but nothing more than that."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And she said?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Basically she asked why I wanted to fuck up 
her life again."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ouch, I think you have your answer."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shrugged, "Daria is a very opinionated 
person who tends
   to view the world in black and white terms, but if you make a strong enough
   case she'll reconsider. We were actually sharing a moment before we 
got interrupted."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh really," Ian said, "how sweet."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well, she wasn't being actively hostile to 
me."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Baby steps mate."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I think my question is this," Kristen said, 
"Do you really
   want to get back together with her?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"That's my question too," Ian added.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom sighed, "I don't know, it's something I've 
always thought
   I've wanted, a chance to undo one of the great fuckups of my life, 
but now that
   I have the chance, possibly, I'm not sure if that's what I really 
want."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"God damn it all to hell man! This is the shit 
I'm talking
   about. I've never seen you waffle like this. You normally pancake 
so definitely
   through life."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Pancake?" Kristen asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Forget it, he's on a roll." Tom replied.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ooh, 'Animal House' nice reference."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Thanks." Tom said agreeably.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Have we had our fun yet?" Ian asked in a 
scolding fashion.
   "May I continue?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"By all means, please do." Tom said, lightly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I wouldn't be so flip if I were you. Of course 
if you were
   me we wouldn't be having this conversation because I would have 
made up my mind."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You would have?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Damn strait I would have."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom folded his arms across his chest, "So you can't say
   there's no woman in your past who wouldn't leave you with conflicted feelings
   if she showed up right now?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian shook his head, "Nope, not a one."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom turned to Kristen, "How about you? That hypothetical
   Ian asked, what if that was you, wouldn't you feel at least a 
little conflicted?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I guess, it would depend on the ex though."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Doesn't change a thing," Ian said, "So you're 
conflicted,
   'Oh look at the poor tortured man.' Big fucking deal, it doesn't change the
   fact that you have to reach a decision. Do you reach out to the 
woman or not?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"But I tried to do that."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And she wasn't there, big surprise, she's 
visiting London
   and isn't in her hotel room during the day. Wow, what are the odds 
of that?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You agreed with me that I shouldn't call her 
again."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"At that moment you ninny. I didn't mean you should just
   give up."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom scanned up and down the street as they walked, trying
   to form a reply. "Why are you riding me so hard about this anyway? It's like
   we can't go ten minutes before you rag my ass for being 
wishy-washy."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Tom, I'm just trying to get you to make up 
your mind, because
   until you do that you're going to be a royal bastard to hang out 
with, and that
   cramps my style man."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom chuckled, "I'm sorry for being such a drag 
on your party.
   I'll do better the next time a long lost ex-girlfriend wanders back into my
   life."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian laughed, "I'm sure you will. So, what's it going to
   be?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shrugged, "I don't know." He ducked when 
Ian playfully
   threw a punch in his direction. "She's leaving tomorrow at some unknown time.
   I figure at that point the issue will be moot so I'll just take the wait and
   see approach."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian chuckled, "The good old path of least 
resistance huh?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hasn't failed me yet."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I'm sure. So when were you thinking about going out to
   see Elsie?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shrugged, "As usual, I'm not sure, we've got a pretty
   important deadline coming up at work so I'll probably have to get 
pretty serious
   with code until then, but after that I'll talk to Elsie to see when's a good
   time for her. And no you can't come along."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian glanced at Kristen, "Now why would I want 
to accompany
   you on a visit to your sister's place?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yeah, why would you Ian?" Kristen asked 
suspiciously.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well, I asked because he's got the hots for 
her, why just
   this day he was crawling all over me for a chance to speak to 'Fair 
Elsie' and
   wouldn't stop pestering me until I let him say hi." Tom smiled wickedly and
   walked off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You'll pay for this Sloane, oh will you pay." 
Ian shouted
   at Tom's departing form.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Care to explain yourself?" Kristen asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Certainly, see it's just a game Tom's sister and I play.
   I pretend to chase her, and she pretends to hate my guts." He 
paused for a moment,
   "Actually she might really hate my guts, but anyway there's nothing between
   us."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Could there be?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Not while I'm with you." Ian said simply.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Is this true?" She asked Tom, who was standing a short
   distance form them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom nodded, "Pretty much, don't worry, I was just making
   fun of Ian, though he was going to ask if he could tag along."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I was not...ok, I was, but only because I'd 
like to visit
   the States again, not for any secret rendezvous with Tom's 
sister."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ok, it's not like I've hung out with this 
chump long enough
   to care if he's got another girl stashed away somewhere, but I do 
like to know
   where I stand."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"On your own two feet at the moment." Ian replied with a
   smile. "Don't worry, Elsie might be pretty, smart, and rich, but 
she's American
   so all that good stuff is out the window."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Kristen laughed, "I'm glad to hear that in your 
mind a broke
   British waitress is the equal of a rich American heiress."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"It helps that the waitress is right here." Ian 
said, smirking.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Asshole," Kristen replied with a smile. They continued
   walking down the street, arms linked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hey wait a second, you just insulted me." Tom cried out,
   "I'm an American too."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And we don't hold that against you old boy." 
Ian said over
   his shoulder.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yeah well, we can kick your collective ass." 
Tom said petulantly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"But I can kick yours, and I don't see any Green Berets
   around to back you up."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"At least we don't have a monarch."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"We have a long history and a great many traditions that
   enrich our lives, the monarchy being one of them." Ian replied 
smoothly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Too bad we kicked your butts in the 
Revolution."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Did you manage to burn down Buckingham Palace? 
Didn't think
   so."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Doesn't count, that was before the US was a major power.
   I'd like to see you try to pull that little stunt again."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian waved a hand in a dismissive fashion. 
"We've got Shakespeare,
   game over."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Faulkner, Hemingway and Steinbeck," Tom shot 
back.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ok, I'll finish this once and for all, Patrick Stewart
   versus William Shatner. 'Nuff said, Hail Britannia."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Shatner's from Canada, he doesn't count."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Geek test, gotcha." Ian grinned evilly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Bastard, You knew you were going to lose so you bailed
   on it."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I did no such thing, besides everyone knows all the good
   entertainers come from Britain."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Don't even try to make that claim buddy."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Too late, I already did. Face it Tom England 
is where all
   the great innovators came from, Hitchcock, the Beatles, the 
Stones..."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"The Bay City Rollers." Tom muttered.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"No, they're Scottish, big difference."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ok fine, Wham."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"The good far outweighs the bad."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I'd just like to remind you of you actually invented the
   music all your so called "innovators" appropriated, Americans." Tom 
nodded defiantly
   to punctuate his remark.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Unfortunately they were all under appreciated . It took
   the genius of the British acts to get people's attention."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh please, Elvis was under appreciated?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Compared to the Beatles he was."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Before Tom could reply Kristen interrupted, "Uh 
guys I hate
   to break up this little debate, but we're here."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Why so we are." Ian said, stating the 
obvious.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The trio was standing in front of a large 
warehouse a formidable
   bouncer guarded the door, casting a suspicious eye over all the 
potential revelers
   walking through the door.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian reached into the pocket of this coat and withdrew the
   Farkas Farmacy bag. "Before I forget, here's your share of the goodies." He
   handed Tom a small canister.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Thanks," Tom pocketed the marijuana.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And before we go in I think we need to take 
our medication."
   He took the pill bottle out of the bag.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh come on Ian you know I..."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Don't take this stuff? Yeah I know, did I 
offer you any?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"So you're not going to say I should to loosen 
up and help
   me forget about Daria?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well now that you mention it; that sounds like a capital
   idea."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom sighed, "Oh why the hell not, give me the 
damn pill."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"There's a good lad. Don't worry, I'll keep an 
eye on you."
   He handed Tom a white pill. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom looked at it for a long moment before shrugging and
   dry swallowing the pill. "Now what?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Just wait for it to kick in and enjoy the 
ride." Ian replied
   after taking a dose himself, Kristen followed suit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">They slowly crept through the line until they 
finally reached
   the bouncer. He glanced at them appraisingly before opening the 
door and letting
   the trio pass.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The interior of the warehouse was dark and 
loud. Dance music
   pulsated from the large amps ringing the room. Lights flashed with 
weird stroboscopic
   effects. The main dance floor was already filled with people 
dancing and waving
   glo-sticks in some weird attempt to recapture and earlier, slightly 
more innocent
   era.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well this sure looks like a good time," Ian 
shouted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Where's the bar?" Tom asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Over there I think." Kristen replied, pointing 
to a corner
   of the room.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Let's dance!" Ian shouted, grabbing Kristen and dragging
   her onto the dance floor. Tom followed and soon he was doing his 
best impression
   of a dancer. By this time the Ecstasy had taken hold and Tom was 
feeling quite
   happy. Shortly thereafter he felt a hand tap him on the shoulder.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">He turned, "Yeah?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">All he could really tell about the woman was that she had
   black hair, long legs, and not much on, "Hey there cutie, want to 
dance?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"That's what I'm doing right now," Tom replied, a goofy
   grin on his face.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">She laughed, "No silly, with me."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shrugged, "Fine by me, I'll even let you lead." She
   crooked a finger indicating that he should follow her and they 
walked off into
   the dancing throng.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria sighed, she had just turned away the 
umpteenth suitor
   of the evening and the whole exercise was rapidly growing tiresome. 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Why am I even here?" She asked herself. "Oh 
yeah, the other
   option was a lovely evening in my hotel room doing nothing. At 
least here people
   buy me drinks." She idly swirled an untouched glass. "Laced with 
god knows what
   I'm sure, but it's the thought that counts I suppose." She sipped the drink
   she bought herself. "This certainly has been one strange trip. Who would have
   thought Tom was living in London. Maybe I was a little hard on him, after all
   it was ten years ago. On the other hand the bastard deserved it." </font></p>
<p><font face="Times">She let her mind review the day's events. After she woke
   up Daria worked on her article for the literary magazine she was 
currently writing
   for. As she told Tom she wrote about the misuse of classic literature in pop
   culture. What she hadn't told Tom was that this was a regular feature for the
   magazine, and one of the more popular at that. It allowed her to do what she
   did best, excoriate the bland stupidity of the masses, and get paid for it.
   The fact that she did this for a mass produced magazine with a readership of
   several million was not lost on Daria. In fact she often went so 
far as to call
   her readers vapid sheep for depending on her word as to what did and did not
   suck. "Even the intellectually elite are sheep." She once told 
Quinn.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">After putting the final touches on her column she emailed
   it to her editor. She debated with herself what to do and finally settled on
   seeing the sights of London, something she hadn't had a chance to 
do until that
   point. Daria picked up a travel guide at the lobby and set off to 
see the sights.
   Enough of her teenaged morbidity remained so that she made a special point to
   see sights like the chopping block at the Tower of London. She also 
spent quite
   a bit of time at the Royal Library, just browsing all the books 
present in that
   august collection.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I'm going to have to visit again just to spend some more
   time in this place," she mused as she examined a displayed copy of 
"Canterbury
   Tales." She left the library around dinnertime and got a meal at a 
quiet little
   restaurant near her hotel. When she finished her meal she decided to return
   to her hotel room to plan her next move. There was nothing else for her to do
   in London, but it seemed a shame to waste the money her editor had lavished
   on her for the trip.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Back at her hotel room she glanced at the 
clock, "Hmm, it's
   only early afternoon back in New York, maybe I'll give Quinn a call. I've got
   nothing better to do." She reached for the phone and noticed the voice mail
   light was flashing. "Huh, I wonder who called me?" She followed the 
instructions
   for accessing the voice mail and listened to the message; which consisted of
   nothing more than a phone hanging up. "Hrm, must have been a wrong number."
   She entered the number to her apartment into the phone and waited.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hello?" Quinn's voice came over the line.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hi Quinn, it's Daria."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Daria, hi, how's London?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Filled with the ghosts of all who have died an unnatural
   death over the course of the years."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"So in other words, you're having a great 
time."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I suppose, I admit seeing the bloodstains at the Tower
   of London was pretty cool."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"That's just so typical of you Daria. You're in 
one of the
   most fashionable cities in the world and you go visit some dusty 
old ruins."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I got my fill of the night life last night when I was on
   assignment."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh yeah, how was the club?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Freakishly abhorrent as I expected. Coleridge just does
   not translate into a nightclub easily, and those people tried to 
take the easy
   path."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Were any cute guys there?" Quinn asked 
impishly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Why do you want to know, I thought you were happy with
   Dave."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"For you silly. You need to have something else in your
   life beyond your job."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria sighed, "I'm not getting into this debate 
right now,
   but just so you know I did spend a fair bit of time talking with a 
guy."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Really?" Quinn squealed, "Tell me 
everything."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well, he's from the States, California actually, about
   my age. His family is quite wealthy..."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Sounds like a winner to me." Quinn said 
excitedly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And did I mention his name is Tom?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Tom? That's so funny, because you went out with a Tom in
   high school, and he was rich too...wait a second, you're not 
saying?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yes, I ran into the infamous Thomas Sloane at the club
   last night."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh my god Daria! Tell me everything. What is he doing in
   London? Was he wearing fashionable clothes? Is he still good 
looking?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Whoa slow down, if you give me a chance to 
speak I'll tell
   you."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Alright, wait hang on, let me get Dave." Daria 
could hear
   Quinn moving about then yell, "Hey Dave, Daria is on the phone, and she met
   Tom Sloane in London."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"So Dave spent the night again?" Daria asked 
innocently.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yeah." Quinn replied, Daria could hear the blush creep
   up her sister's face. For all her showiness Quinn was very withdrawn when it
   came to talking about her relationship with Dave.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"So long as you two stay out of my room I don't care what
   you do."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Daria, ewwww! That'd be like doing it in Mom and Dad's
   room!"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Doing what in your parent's room?" A male 
voice asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hey Dave." Daria said in greeting.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yo Daria. So, what would be like doing in your 
folk's room?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Daria, do not answer that." Quinn demanded.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Having sex." Daria said with a smirk.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Daria!" Quinn shrieked, "I told you not to say anything,
   oh god, I'm so embarrassed."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Um, why Quinn it's what were doing not..."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Dave, don't start too," Quinn said in a threatening tone.   </font></p><p><font face="Times">"Okay, so why am I 
privy to this outpouring of sisterly
   love anyway?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well, remember Tom Sloane from Lawndale?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Brown hair, rich kid. Went out with Daria, 
right?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"That's the guy, Daria met him at a club last 
night in London."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hey, that's pretty cool. How's he doing?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"No, first tell us how you met him." Quinn 
said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria sighed, "Can I just tell the tale and be done with
   it? These sat link calls aren't cheap." The silence on the other 
end indicated
   their willingness to listen. "Okay, so I'm at this club, mentally writing my
   review of the place when someone bumps into me. I turn around and 
there he is,
   doesn't look a damn bit different. So we get to talking, exchanging 
pleasantries,
   catch up on how each other's family is doing. Then as you might 
expect we started
   hashing out our difference. Why we broke up, who exactly is the 
bigger asshole,
   that sort of thing."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Sounds like a good time." Dave commented 
dryly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"It's the way I like to spend my evenings." Daria replied
   sarcastically.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"What happened next?" Quinn asked, "Did you two 
go out for
   coffee or something? Did you let him kiss you goodnight?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I can safely say the answer to all of those questions is
   a big no. He had to go help a friend, then a riot broke out and I left before
   I could be detained by Scotland Yard for questioning."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Wait a second, you didn't start the riot. Did 
you?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Relax Quinn, I'm innocent of that particular charge. I
   actually think Tom might have had something to do with it though."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Tom started a riot? Just to avoid talking to 
you?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"As strange as that sounds, yes. We didn't even 
say goodbye.
   He just said he'd be right back, then furniture started flying."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"So you didn't get his number or anything like 
that."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Nope, why would I want to anyway?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"So you can talk to him again you dummy."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Again, I fail to see the reasoning."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Daria, Tom was like the best boyfriend you ever had, you
   two are a perfect match. Why wouldn't you want to get back together 
with him?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"For starters because he is a traitorous weasel who can't
   be trusted."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Now pardon me for asking," Dave broke in, "But 
didn't you
   break up with him?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well, yeah, but only because he got a little too close
   to a female friend of his."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ok, I just have dim memories of getting really 
drunk with
   the guy afterwards and him saying you dumped him before that."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"It's one interpretation of history." Daria paused, "It's
   funny, I've been so mad at him, but when we were talking I remembered all the
   not so bad times we had, and what an intense jackass he was to fuck that up."
   She added hastily.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Sounds to me like somebody wants to get back 
together with
   her old boyfriend." Quinn said coyly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"No it does not. Why on earth would I do a damn 
fool thing
   like that?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Because you never wanted to break up with him 
in the first
   place, duh."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Where the hell did you come up with that asinine notion?
   Of course I wanted to break up with him. He was seeing another girl 
for crying
   out loud."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I think what your sister is trying to say is that given
   your druthers you wouldn't have broken up." Dave said, trying to 
keep the peace.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well obviously, you don't break up with some one if they
   don't give you any reason to."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Quinn sighed dramatically, "Daria, you know 
that sometimes
   a relationship just ends and no one is to blame, especially high 
school romances.
   People just drift apart, and if that was going to happen with you 
and Tom then
   it doesn't matter what he did because you two were destined to break up.
   But, if you were still in love with him, then maybe there's a chance the two
   of you would still be together now if you hadn't broken up back then. Which
   is why I asked if you were still in love with him when you broke 
up." She explained
   patiently.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Quinn, what the hell are you getting at?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"That you should forgive the poor bastard and 
get back together
   with him. Fuck Daria, he screwed up once the whole time the two of you went
   out and you were a damn cute couple too, for a pair of unfashionable brains
   that is."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I think," Dave said quietly, "that the person you need
   to talk to is Jane."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Huh, why?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Now my memory of that time is somewhat hazy, but I seem
   to remember always thinking that the reason you freaked out so 
badly back then
   was because the whole incident was too similar to the way you and Tom hooked
   up in the first place. You never really came to terms with how your 
relationship
   with Tom started."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"What does this have to do with Jane?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You still think you're the reason Tom and Jane broke up
   in the first place, and because of that you're inclined to think the worst of
   any possible screw up Tom might make. Or I could just be pulling this out of
   my ass, whatever."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You are," Daria said simply.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ok, but call Jane, talk to her about this, can't hurt.
   Look my shift starts soon so I've got to get ready for that. See 
you Monday?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yeah, Monday."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Cool, take it easy Daria."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Bye Dave." She could hear Dave's extension cut 
off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"He's more perceptive than he has any right to be." Daria
   thought to herself as she replayed their conversation in her mind. "Must be
   from all the drugs."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You should follow Dave's advice." Quinn had 
told her, "I'm
   sure Jane would have plenty of advice for you."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I don't really think Jane wants to hear me 
mope about her
   ex-boyfriend."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"But she would like to hear from her friend I 
bet, and besides
   she was happy for the two of you, after a while at least."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria sighed, "Quinn, when did you start making 
sense?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"About the time you started paying attention to 
what I had
   to say. So are you calling Jane?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Maybe, not right now at least, it's far too 
early for Jane
   to be coherent. Besides, she'll just tell me to give Tom another 
chance."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"So will you?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Tell you what, if I see him again before I go home I'll
   talk to him about it."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Daria, you're not going to sit in your hotel 
room all night
   are you? If you are I'll find Tom's number and tell him to march over there
   and stand in front of your door until you come out."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You wouldn't."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Try me."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ok, ok, you don't have to threaten me. I was going out
   anyway." Daria saw the flyer for the rave she picked up the night 
before. "I'm
   going to this rave thing tonight."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And how do I know you aren't lying to me?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You don't, goodbye Quinn."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I'll call the front desk to see if you're still in your
   room." Quinn threatened.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria sighed, "Goodbye Quinn."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Bye Daria, good luck with Tom." The two sisters hung up
   their phones, leaving Daria by herself with her thoughts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria took another drink from her glass, Dave 
had been right,
   there was only one person in the world she could talk to about 
this,other than
   Tom, and that was Jane. She sighed as she pulled her cell phone out 
of a pocket
   and went off in search of a relatively quiet place to make the 
call.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I wonder if Trent will be there." She pondered idly as
   she punched the number in from memory.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hello, Lane's Painting Service, if it's a surface we'll
   slap paint on it." Jane's voice said, slightly faint, from across 
the world.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hey Jane, how's the business going?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Daria? Hey, great to hear from you. To what do I owe the
   pleasure?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I have to ask you about something you won't want to talk
   about."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ooo, the spine tingles, what's up?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"It has to do with Tom."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Tom?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yes, Tom."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Tom, Tom?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Getting into percussion? Yes, that Tom."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Why are you bringing that bit of ancient 
history?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Because it's not so ancient. I ran into him 
last night."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"In New York?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"No, London."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"London?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yes, London. I'm here on assignment and we ran into each
   other in this club..." She quickly gave Jane a recap of the previous night's
   events.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Wow, that's got to be up there on the cosmic coincidence
   scale."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Tell me about it. I spent the rest of the evening ready
   to pepper spray anyone who even remotely looked like any of my 
other ex-boyfriends."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And such a wide and varied group that is, did 
you include
   Trent?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Did Trent and I ever go out?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well no, but I figured you might want to pad 
your numbers
   a bit."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Gee, thanks for that ringing endorsement of my 
love life."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Anytime amiga." Jane said airily. "So you saw Tom again,
   why call me?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I have a nagging question only you can 
answer."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Which is?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Was I the reason you and Tom broke up?" Daria 
asked quickly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"What?" Jane shouted into the phone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Was I the reason you and Tom broke up?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I heard you the first time." Jane said testily. "Why ask
   me that question now?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"It's just something I need to know the answer 
to."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Wait a second, remind me why you broke up with 
Tom?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I caught him kissing some girl after we had a bit of a
   fight." Daria mumbled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I thought so. To answer your question, no you 
had nothing
   to do with our breakup. We were going to anyway, you just made it 
easier."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh," Daria said simply.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You're thinking about getting back together 
with him aren't
   you."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Why would I do that?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Because you were in love with him, and none of 
your relationships
   since then have even come close."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I suppose. But I must mention that Quinn said the exact
   same thing."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Look Daria, I truly don't give a shit one way 
or the other.
   Tom's ancient history for me. If you want him then by all means he's yours.
   Go for it."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Thanks Jane, I just might do that."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Let me know how things work out. And stop by some time,
   you have to see what I've done to the high school."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"The mind boggles."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Jane chuckled, "Well Li's mind sure did. I 
don't think she
   knew there were that many different shades of blue and yellow."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Good to hear you're still subverting the system from the
   inside."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"It's a dirty job, but somebody has to do it. Take care
   Daria."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You too Jane." Daria switched off her phone and stared
   out over the crowd. "So where are you Tom?" She wondered aloud as she walked
   back to her table.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hey good looking I can be your Tom if you want. We can
   go explore the interior of our souls together." A male voice said 
as she walked
   past.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Sorry, I sold mine for a pair of comfortable 
shoes." Daria
   replied, moving on. When she got back to her table she found that an overly
   amorous had taken up residence there. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Shit," she thought, "and I hadn't even 
finished my drink."
   She walked over to the bar and ordered a fresh drink. A quick survey of the
   surrounding area didn't reveal any free tables so Daria steeled herself for
   a trip across the dance floor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"The things I do to keep my sister out of my life." Daria
   muttered to herself as she started walking through the crowd. She had to put
   her free hand over the glass to keep the contents from splashing all over the
   place. When she was almost across the floor she saw something that caused her
   to nearly drop her glass. "Holy shit!" She said in a loud voice. 
Not quite ten
   feet from where she was standing Tom was locked in an intricate 
bump and grind
   with a very willing companion. Tom looked up and their eyes met for a brief
   moment. Anger welled in Daria and she dashed off the dance floor before Tom
   could say anything.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom for his part stood there, stupefied from the shock,
   and the drugs in his system. His paralysis was broken when his companion ran
   her hand up and down his leg.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Why'd you stop dancing?" She asked in a sultry 
voice, "Want
   to do something a little more stimulating?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom brusquely removed her hand from his body, "Uh sorry,
   I just saw somebody I need to talk to. If you'll excuse me." He ran 
off in the
   direction Daria had fled, pushing his way through the crowd. His 
erstwhile dance
   partner shrugged and began searching for another warm body to 
entertain herself
   with.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom bulled his way through the crowd until he 
finally caught
   up with Daria. He reached out with an arm and caught her by the 
shoulder. "Daria,"
   he asked, "what are you doing here?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"What's it look like? I'm trying to find a good time, and
   from the looks of things you've already found one."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"What's that supposed to mean?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Just that you were looking pretty chummy with that chick
   back there."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And this matters to you how?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"it doesn't. It's just that last night you seemed pretty
   intent on hooking up with me, and now you're doing the bump and 
grind with some
   raver. It's nice to see your well-honed ability to drop anything that won't
   provide you instant gratification is still intact."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom groaned in frustration, "Now what do you 
mean by that?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Just that I've spent my day talking to people and having
   them tell me to give you another chance, but what do I see when I 
stumble across
   you? Somebody else giving you a lap dance."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Daria, I didn't even know her name."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And that's supposed to make me feel better?" Daria asked
   in an incredulous voice.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well yes, because frankly I think you're over-reacting
   a touch. Just because I was dancing with that woman doesn't mean we 
were going
   to do anything more than that. Christ Daria, what do you expect me to do, sit
   in my apartment like some aesthetic monk because of a conversation I wasn't
   privy to?" Tom's growing ire at Daria's attitude prevented him from hearing
   what she was saying.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria frowned, "Ok, that does sound sort of 
silly, but still
   given your history what other conclusion could I draw?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"It's not my fault that you reached an 
incorrect judgment.
   I just came here with a few friends to have an enjoyable evening."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"There's a big difference between going out 
with some friends
   and getting it on with some bimbo you just met." Daria replied 
caustically.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom sighed, "Daria, why do you always have to 
do this?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Do what?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hold me to some impossibly high standard, and 
if I deviate
   even the slightest from it you crucify me."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well excuse me for having any standard at all. I don't
   know what I was thinking; getting back together with you? What a 
load of shit.
   You'd leave the moment you got a little bored. So fuck you Tom Sloane, I hope
   you enjoy your life." Daria stormed off leaving a stunned Tom standing in her
   wake.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria's parting words slowly sunk into Tom's brain. When
   he realized what she had been saying he tried to follow her, "Daria, wait a
   second!" He shouted, but he couldn't see her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Back on the dance floor Kristen noticed the 
commotion Daria
   and Tom were causing, "Hey Ian, isn't that Tom over there?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian looked in the direction Kristen indicated, "Why yes,
   it is. I wonder who the woman is?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Whoever she is it looks like things are 
getting a bit heated."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You're right, I'd better get over there to see 
if he needs
   a hand. I wonder..." He trailed off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Wonder what?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh nothing, want to come along to lend a 
hand?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Kristen shrugged, "Oh might as well." They set off in the
   direction of Tom.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">By the time they arrived Daria had left and Tom 
was sitting
   at a table, looking dejected.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"What's up Tom?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"She's gone, again, fuck it all, why'd I have 
to come here?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Whoa, back up, who was here?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Daria."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Daria? That was Daria?" Ian asked in 
amazement, Tom simply
   nodded. "Fuck man, why were you arguing with her, that was your 
chance man."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You don't think I don't know that?" Tom 
shouted. "She saw
   me dancing with this girl and started shouting at me, and I never recovered
   from that. She even said she was interested in getting back 
together with me."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian looked thoughtful for a moment, "Kristen, stay with
   Tom."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Where are you going?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I've got a little errand to run, I'll be right back. Tom
   why don't you have a drink, maybe smoke a joint, you'll feel better. Oh, and
   which way did she leave?" He asked quickly. Tom pointed in the 
right direction
   without even realizing what Ian asked. "Thanks." Ian strode off in 
the indicated
   direction. He quickly made his way through the crowd, peering 
intently for the
   face he sought.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Now if I were her I'd be heading for the exit 
post haste."
   He thought. He pushed his way to the exit, checking out all the 
patrons leaving
   the warehouse as he did so. "I hope she hasn't gotten a cab yet," He said to
   himself as he exited the warehouse. He looked up and down the 
street and finally
   saw the face he was looking for hailing a cab.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hey Daria!" Ian bellowed. Daria turned and 
started at him.
   "Gotcha." He said to himself as he ran over to where she was standing. "Daria
   Morgendorffer right?" He asked when he caught up with her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Who wants to know?" She asked suspiciously.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ian Williams, pleased to meet you, I'm a 
friend of Tom's."
   Ian said, holding out his hand. Daria did not take it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Good to meet you, now if you'll excuse me, my 
cab is here."
   She started to get into the cab which had just arrived.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Sorry, but we have to talk." Ian shut the cab door and
   indicated to the cabbie that he should drive off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Excuse me, but who the hell gave you the right 
to do that?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Like I said, we have to talk, and it can't 
wait."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And if I don't want to talk to you?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Too bad, we're going to talk. And don't even bother to
   try anything, I play rugby, I can take whatever you can dish out." He smiled
   brightly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well this is a great way to start a relationship." Daria
   deadpanned.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And if I just asked nicely?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I'd walk away." Daria sighed, "Lead on my 
imperious captor."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian looked up and down the street. He spotted 
an all night
   coffee shop and pointed at it. "Why don't we go there. Get a little coffee to
   clear our head while we discuss heavy things."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And just what will we be discussing?" Daria 
asked as they
   walked down the street.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"What do you think?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Tom," Daria sighed, "did he send you?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian shook his head, "Nope, the boy is currently curled up
   in a bottle, I'm here totally on my own volition."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ok, so why are you here?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Because Tom's my friend and I'm attempting to 
do something
   nice for him. After you." Ian held the door to the caf&eacute; open 
for Daria.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And let me guess that nice thing would be me?" 
Daria said
   coldly as they sat down at a table.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Tom said you were a bright girl. Basically yes, I'm here
   to try and talk some sense into you. Coffee, black please." He told 
the waitress.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I'll have the same." Daria said. "Talk some sense into
   me? That seems pretty needless if you ask me."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ok then, forget that. How about you explain something to
   me instead."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Sure, what?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Why the fuck are you and Tom so fucking 
volatile? The two
   of you are together for not even three hours last night but I've 
seen Tom swing
   through more emotions today than I have in the entire two years 
I've known him."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria shrugged, "I don't know, he was always the one who
   was cavalier about our relationship."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Actually, that was a rhetorical question, I 
know why he's
   so strung out."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ok then, since you have all the answers, 
why?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Because he feels bad about the way the two of you broke
   up, and he desperately wants to try again with you."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"He sure has a funny way of expressing that. I 
see him humping
   some strange woman on the dance floor, then we have a blow up about 
it."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ok, as for the woman, that's kind of my fault. I talked
   him into coming here, I spent all day trying to get him to forget about you.
   Plus I gave him that hit of Ecstasy, and considering that he never does that
   it's a wonder he wasn't fucking a lamp post."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Drugs are no excuse for behavior."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh lord no, but seriously, if you think about 
it rationally
   he really did not do anything wrong by dancing with someone. You 
really cannot
   hold that against him."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"But when you look at it as part of Tom's larger history
   it fits with a well established pattern of behavior."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh sweet Jesus." Ian said in disgust. "You're as fucking
   bad as he is you know that?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"No, I don't."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You and Tom, the two of you can concoct these 
total bullshit
   rationalizations to let you do or think whatever the hell you want. You two
   are a perfect matched pair."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I think I should be insulted."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Fine, be insulted, but it's true. There's a 
huge gulf between
   dancing, at a dance party for fuck's sake, and kissing some chick. You know,
   I know that, hell even the fucking Arch-Bishop of Canterbury knows that. But
   you can't have that. Oh no, that interferes with this little 
'history of prior
   bad acts' rap you've got going on. And if that gets disturbed then there goes
   your reason for staying mad at Tom."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"While your righteous indignation impresses me, I fail to
   see the point."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian sighed, "And here I thought you were supposed to be
   this great mind. Ok, I'll break it down for you. Deep down at the bottom your
   heart you want to get back together with Tom." He reached over and 
tapped Daria's
   chest. "But your head," he tapped Daria between the eyes, "doesn't want you
   to for whatever reason, once bitten twice shy I suppose."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Nice story, but a load of bullshit. I don't want to get
   back together with Tom, and even if I did the logistics would be prohibitive.
   I don't want to leave New York, and I bet Tom feels the same way 
about London.
   I don't want to start a trans-Atlantic romance so it doesn't matter what my
   heart wants it's a real world impossibility."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian ripped the napkin he had been playing with 
into several
   smaller pieces. "I'm not talking about rational thought, forget 
about rational
   thought. Let go of your head, and feel damnit."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"It'd be pretty hard to get around if I let go 
of my head."
   Daria deadpanned.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian laughed, "Yes, it would, but do you at least see my
   point?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria shrugged, "I think you're spouting a load of feel
   good bullshit."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian scratched his chin, "Yeah that does sound 
like a pretty
   big line of shit doesn't it." He thought for a moment, "What if I said that
   Tom would be willing to leave London, would that make any 
difference?" The waitress
   arrived with their coffee.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria took a sip from the cup before replying. "Honestly
   I'm not sure. What am I supposed to say? That I've spent the last 
decade pining
   for Tom. That all I've needed is just a chance and I'd rekindle whatever it
   was that we had?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian chuckled, "It'd be a step in the right direction. If
   you were being sincere just then."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Obviously I wasn't."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh, obviously."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Look, Tom Sloane was the first great love of my life, I
   don't deny that. He was the second person I ever really opened up to, I'm not
   denying that either. And sure, you always have a soft spot for 
people like that
   in your past."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Great, then what's the problem?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"That's just it, he's from the past, who's to 
say what worked
   a decade ago will work now? And who's to say things won't end the 
way they did
   back then as well."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"There's only one way to find out." Ian said 
quietly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"So you'd stick your hand into a buzz saw even though you
   know it could end up hurting like hell in the end?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian shrugged, "An animal knows something is going to hurt
   and avoids it, a human knows something is going to hurt, but does 
it anyway."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Thank you for that Mr. Kwisatch Hadderach. Herbert was
   full of shit you know."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian shrugged, "Only if you look at his work 
from a certain
   point of view."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Now I know why Tom hangs out with you. Sci-fi geeks are
   all a like."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I'd like to think that some of us have a bit more style
   than the rest of my unwashed brethren."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I hate to break it to you, but you aren't that 
smooth."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Don't say that until you've seen me at my 
best."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"If it involves you threatening woman so they'll do what
   you want I've seen that."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian chuckled in embarrassment, "Er yes, about that, um,
   I'm sorry if I came on a little strong back there, I was just trying to help
   Tom out and it was the only way I could think of to get my foot in 
the door."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria nodded, "You're probably right, and this has been
   an enlightening conversation, not that I'm giving your little 
theories any credence."
   She added hastily.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Of course not. There's always intellectual merit to that
   which we disagree with."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Exactly," Daria fell silent as she swirled the remaining
   coffee in her cup. "You're a good friend for doing all this." She 
said finally.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Good friend hell," Ian said with a laugh. "I 
was just getting
   tired of him being a whiny little bitch all day. I figured I'd just 
try to move
   this along a little so he'd shut up."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria smirked, "Watch it, being sarcastic is my 
specialty."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well then, I must beg your most humble 
forgiveness oh mighty
   Queen of the Sarcastic Barb."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Thank you." She finished off her coffee, "Well, I'd love
   to stay and chat some more, but I've got a trans-continental flight tomorrow
   so I need to catch up on some sleep." Daria stood to leave.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian caught her arm, "Daria, if Tom were to show 
up at your
   door and profess his deepest sorrow for all crimes, past present and future,
   and show a deep desire to try again at your relationship, you wouldn't slam
   the door in his face would you?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria removed Ian's hand from her arm. 
"Honestly no, I wouldn't
   do that." She started to walk off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian's face brightened, "So you'd take him 
back?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria turned and smirked, "I didn't say that either." She
   left Ian sitting at the table and walked out of the shop.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian chuckled, "Remarkable gal. I wonder how Tom's doing?"
   He paid the bill and left the shop as well. When he stepped onto the sidewalk
   he caught sight of Daria entering a cab. "Hey Daria!" he shouted, "When does
   your flight leave?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">She turned around and yelled, "Six o'clock." 
Before getting
   into the cab and driving off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Still chuckling from their final exchange Ian walked back
   to the warehouse to check up on Tom.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">He found Tom and Kristen standing outside the warehouse.
   Or more properly Kristen trying to support a very intoxicated Tom 
up. Ian rushed
   over to help.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Here, let me give you a hand with that lump." Ian said
   taking a hold of Tom's free side.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"So there you are." Kristen said, "And what have you been
   up to while I was tending to this drunk bastard?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I was trying to repair his love life." Ian 
replied as they
   dragged Tom's prone form over to a cab.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Any luck?" Kristen asked as they maneuvered 
the unconscious
   American into the taxi.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Possibly, but it's up to Tom."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"God help us." Kristen replied.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Amen sister," Ian said as the cab drove off 
into the London
   night.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom regained consciousness the next morning with the help
   of some not so gentle prodding. "Huh, who's there? Go away." Were 
his only comments
   before drifting back to sleep. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Get your lazy fucking ass out of bed Tom, there's work
   that needs to be done." Ian said in a loud voice.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom sat up in bed, holding his head in his 
hands, "Ok, I'll
   get up, just don't bellow."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian handed Tom a pair of aspirin tablets and a glass of
   water. "Here, you go, we need to get you feeling human in a hurry, 
there's not
   much time."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom swallowed the pills and drank the water. 
"Not much time?
   For what." He asked as he took stock of his current situation. He was in his
   apartment, still wearing the clothes from last night. Ian appeared 
to be wearing
   something different so he had not spent the night. "And where're my 
keys?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian help up a key ring and placed in on the table next to
   Tom's bed. "I'm impressed, you don't miss much, even when you're 
hung over."</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom tried to stand, but fell back into bed when 
the dizziness
   overtook him. "It's something you have to pick up if you want to avoid harm
   while spending time in your company."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian chuckled as he helped Tom into the 
bathroom, "Good lad,
   I'm glad all my training is paying off. Now go get yourself cleaned up and we
   can talk more; there will be a pot of coffee waiting for you."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom looked himself over in the mirror as he undressed. To
   put it simply he looked like shit. His eyes were bloodshot and his face had
   a pale, haggard aspect to it. "Damn, now that was some night. What the fuck
   happened to get Ian so worked up?" He tried to sort through what he did and
   did not remember about the night before. The answer came to him quickly. "Aww
   shit, Daria. Fuck a duck!" He groaned to himself as the hot water poured down
   on him. "Damn, I really fucked that up. No wonder I got tanked." He got out
   of the shower and wrapped a towel around his waist. When he left the bathroom
   he was met by Ian, who was holding a large cup of hot coffee.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom took the cup and drank a large gulp of the hot brew.
   "Thanks, so are you here on suicide watch or something?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian chuckled, "No, nothing like that. I'm just 
here to make
   sure you're not too late."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">" You keep saying I've got to move before I'm 
too late Too
   late for what?" Tom asked, puzzled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"For intercepting Daria before she leaves the 
country."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"But she told me to fuck off last night, that's a closed
   book now."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Guess again my American friend. A little 
cajoling by yours
   truly warmed the cockles of her heart and if you bust your ass and get over
   to her hotel you might just find a receptive Morgendorffer waiting 
for you."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Might?" Tom asked between swallows of coffee.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"What, you wanted a gold-plated invitation?" There's only
   so much I can do. Now hurry up and get your ass into some clothes." 
Ian shooed
   Tom into his bedroom.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"But what if she blows me off?" Tom asked 
through the door
   as he got dressed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Then we go get drunk again, and you set your sights on
   someone else. This isn't the time to be worrying about the negatives we're on
   a tight deadline here."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"We are?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yes, she said her flight is leaving around six tonight.
   So figure an hour to get to the airport, another couple to actually 
get to the
   plane. We probably only have a couple hours to find her, and that's 
not taking
   into consideration the time it's going to take for you to get over 
there."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom exited his room, wearing clean clothes and 
feeling much
   better on the whole. "But what if this isn't what I want?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian held out Tom's coat. "Too late for that now, the dice
   have been cast, it's time to see how they fall. Now scoot, you're running out
   of time." Ian pushed Tom towards the door.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You aren't coming with me?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian shook his head, "Only you can make this journey Tom.
   I'll be of no use to you. Besides I have to check up on the store, and make
   sure none of those dunces who work for me have burned the place 
down."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And if I don't go to Daria?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian shrugged, "It's no skin off my nose. I just 
set things
   up for you, if you don't take advantage of that opportunity it's your lose.
   I can't force you to go but you'll be stupid if you didn't."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom nodded, "Thanks Ian, I know I've been a pain in the
   ass these past few days." He held out his had.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian shook the outstretched hand, "That's ok, provided you
   stop being such a horse's ass soon it's all good. And you're 
welcome." The two
   friends made their way down to the street and parted company.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Good luck Tom."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom laughed, "Thanks, I'll need it." Tom stepped in to a
   waiting cab and drove off towards the section of town Daria's hotel 
resided.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"That poor bastard is going to need all the help he can
   get." Ian thought to himself before setting off for his store.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom stared out the window of the cab. "What the fuck am
   I going to say to her when I get there?" he wondered to himself. "I mean, she
   told me to go fuck myself...I think." He frowned, his memory of the 
events that
   had transpired the previous evening was still indistinct. "Daria was there,
   and we fought, but what did we say? Hmm, maybe that's my angle, 
yeah, that might
   work." Tom began mentally drafting his apology as the cab picked 
its way through
   the streets of London.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria was in the bathroom brushing her teeth 
when she heard
   the knock on her door. She walked over to the door, brushing as she went. She
   opened the door and there he was, Tom.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Tom?" Daria asked around her toothbrush and mouth full
   of toothpaste. "What are you doing here?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Daria, I couldn't let you leave without 
telling you something."
   He motioned to the packed bags by the door.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"What?" Daria asked simply.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Don't go, not yet at least. Daria, there's so 
much I want
   to say..." He stopped and ran a hand through his hair as he 
gathered his thoughts,
   "Look, I'm sorry about the way I treated you in the past, I was a 
fool, I made
   some really bad mistakes and I understand totally if you don't want me back,
   but I've grown to realize that there's no one I've ever been with who's meant
   more to me than you. I can't let the chance to fix my mistake slip away. Let
   me show you how much you do mean to me. And if there's even the slightest bit
   of reciprocal feeling in you please let me make it up to you." He 
sagged against
   the door frame. "Daria will you give me that opportunity? All I want is a bit
   of your time. Please?" He asked plaintively.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria stared at him dumbfounded, "I'm going to go wash my
   mouth out," she gurgled. "We'll talk when I get back." She walked back to the
   bathroom slowly and rinsed her mouth out. She returned at the same 
slow place.
   Tom was still standing in the doorway. A strange buzzing sound 
started emanating
   from some unknown location.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Tom," Daria said. "You were a jerk, and an asshole back
   then, and do you know why?" Tom shook his head. "Because you were the first
   person who I considered an equal who I ever felt attracted to. You 
were an easy
   guy to talk to Tom and I appreciated that. And then you seemed to 
be attracted
   to me, how could I resist? What I'm trying to say is that I fell in love with
   you very easily Tom. I jumped into our relationship without ever 
thinking about
   looking where I was going. And the hell of it is that I don't regret it one
   bit. And then it was over and that was that, or so I thought. Then I saw you
   and it all came rushing back, and now I..." Daria didn't finish her sentence,
   instead she grabbed Tom and kissed him fiercely.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom looked at Daria lovingly before speaking, "I'm glad
   you feel that way, why don't you tell Tom."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria looked puzzled, "Huh?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The buzzing increased, "Time to wake up Daria." Tom said
   gently.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">At that moment Daria's eyes snapped open and she shot up
   in her bed, Tom was nowhere to be seen. "Oh fuck." Daria said. She 
reached over
   and pounded on the alarm clock, the source of the buzzing. "Well 
hell, now what
   am I going to do?" She thought to herself, "Fuck fuck fuck." She 
sighed, "Hell,
   I guess it's pretty fucking obvious, shit." She continued to curse to herself
   as she showered and dressed. Daria was drying her hair when she glanced over
   that the desk in her room and noticed the telephone. "Hmm, I 
wonder," she thought
   to herself. She dropped the towel, sat down in front of the desk 
and activated
   the phone. "Good, it keeps track of incoming calls as well," she mused after
   perusing the menu options. After a few more key taps the 
information she sought
   was in front of her. Daria smiled ever so slightly as she printed 
the contents
   of the screen. She then finished getting dressed and walked out of the room,
   taking the "Do Not Disturb" sign off the door as she went. In the lobby she
   paid her bill and left the hotel. A doorman hailed a cab for her. Once in the
   cab she handed the paper to the driver.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Take me here." She said simply.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The driver looked at the paper and shrugged, "It's your
   schilling," he replied as he pulled the cab into traffic. Daria 
stared out the
   window impassively as the cab darted through the mass of cars.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">She sighed, "Well, for good or ill I made a 
choice. I wonder
   where it will lead?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Eh? What's that miss? The cabbie asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria grimaced, "Nothing, just talking to 
myself."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The man nodded, "Love troubles?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria's glare bored a hole into the back of the 
man's head.
   "I was talking to myself because I'm the only person who's opinion I care to
   hear at the moment,"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The cabbie held up a hand defensively, "Okay, okay I can
   take a hint, besides you seem to have already made up your mind."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria nodded, "That's right, I have."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The cabbie chuckled, "Glad to hear it, you 
wouldn't believe
   all the dumb schmucks who come looking to me for advice. Like I 
know everything
   just because I drive a cab and listen to people bitch about their 
petty little
   problems, it's absurd."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I know the feeling, trust me."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The driver chuckled, "I can see you're not too 
keen on talking,
   so would you mind if I turned on the radio?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria shook her head, "Go right ahead." She leaned back
   in the seat, closed her eyes, and waited for the ride to finish.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">At that moment Tom was also sitting in a cab, though with
   much less patience than Daria. He kept fidgeting with his hands and tapping
   his foot. Just to vary the routine he also glanced at his watch approximately
   once every thirty seconds. The cab driver took all of this in with a bemused
   grin on his face. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Got a hot date tonight?" The cabbie asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom looked up at the driver. "Well kind of. I'm trying to
   keep my ex girlfriend from flying back to the States."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The cabbie nodded, "You know you might want to 
let her go,
   give her some time to cool off."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shook his head, "She's had ten years to cool off, if
   I don't do it now I don't know when else I could."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The cabbie arched an eyebrow, "Ten years huh? 
You must really
   be nuts about here to try to rekindle a flame that old."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shrugged, "What can I say, we clicked."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I guess so, though I have to ask, if the two 
of you clicked
   so much why are you in a cab without her, and in such a big 
hurry?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom rubbed his hands on his pant legs, "Well, she doesn't
   quite know we've clicked yet."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The cabbie laughed, "Ah, one of those 
situations, any clue
   how you're going to convince her?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"So far the best I've come up with is intense groveling
   and blaming demon rum for my behavior, and for my current ignorance of said
   behavior." Tom replied.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You poor bastard," the cabbie said, "you're dead meat,
   you know that right?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom nodded sadly, "Yeah, I know, that's part of my plan,
   go there throw myself on my sword and hope for the best."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"The desperate man angle? Yeah, that might work, but can
   I recommend a bar for you if it doesn't?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom chuckled, "By all means though don't tell 
me just yet.
   I'm trying to keep a positive attitude here."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The driver laughed, "Alright mate, you do know 
that relationship
   advice means an larger tip."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shrugged, "If all goes well I'll give you enough cab
   fare to drive to Scotland and back."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The driver chuckled as he pulled the cab up in front of
   the hotel. "Well then, best of luck to you."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom got out of the cab and quickly stuck his 
head back inside.
   "Would you mind waiting for me?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The cabbie shrugged, "You'll be on the meter."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom looked at the man evenly, "I'll buy this 
cab if it would
   keep you here."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well in that case your wish is my command."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom nodded in thanks then dashed off into the hotel. He
   made a beeline for the elevators but groaned when he saw the mass of people
   waiting for their arrival. He stood in the crowd for several long 
moments before
   glanced at the stairwell.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"What the fuck," he thought, "it's only three floors and
   I'm in decent shape." Tom bolted for the stairs and slammed into the door to
   the stairwell, banging it open. He launched himself up the stairs, 
taking them
   two at a time and with such velocity that his momentum carried him into the
   wall when he reached the first bend. He paused momentarily when he 
reached the
   third floor to catch his breathe.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Okay, maybe I'm not in as good a shape as I 
thought I was."
   He wiped the sweat from his brow then continued on. He opened the door with
   a bang and skidded to a stop in front of a floor layout diagram. He studied
   it intently and tore off in the direction indicated. Tom ran down 
the hallway,
   dodging hotel guests and cleaning staff as he went. He turned the 
final corner
   and nearly collided with the cleaning cart sitting outside the open 
door.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Son of a bitch!" Tom swore. He pushed the cart 
out of his
   way and walked into the room.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The cleaning lady, who had been changing the 
bedding looked
   up when she heard Tom. "Can I help you sir?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yes, where's the person who's staying in this 
room?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The maid shrugged, "I don't know sir, the 'Do 
Not Disturb'
   sign wasn't on the door, and there aren't any personal items in here. I'd say
   the patron's already checked out. Sorry sir."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Fuck." Tom muttered. He pivoted on his heels 
and sprinted
   out of the room.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The maid shrugged, "Yanks are so odd," she said 
to herself
   as she continued with her job.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom raced down the hall at break neck speed. He banished
   all thought, instead he focused on getting back to the lobby as 
quickly as possible.
   The elevator was never even considered. Tom headed strait for the stairs. He
   did not even break stride as he hurled himself down them, thoughts 
of personal
   safety momentarily on hold. He shot out of the stairwell like a bullet from
   a gun, only to crash into a bellhop burdened with luggage. Tom 
apologized profusely,
   but only gave perfunctory assistance to the fallen bellhop, who glared at tom
   while the latter man continued on his way.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Not mollified in the slightest by the incident Tom kept
   up his rushed pace to the main desk. Fortunately volume at the desk was light
   so he did not have to stand in line. He came to a stop in front of the desk,
   breathing hard.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"May I help you sir?" the desk clerk asked, 
slightly bemused.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom nodded, "Daria Morgendorffer," he said breathlessly,
   "when did she check out?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The clerk looked down at his computer screen, 
"Morgendorffer,
   let's see." He tapped a few keys, "Here we go, oh my you just missed her, she
   checked out about a half hour ago."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom banged the desk in frustration, "Shit!"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Is there anything you need sir?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shook his head, "Nothing you could tell me." He broke
   for the door before the clerk could respond. Tom ran out of the 
hotel then skidded
   to a stop. "Hold up Tom, stop and think this out." He ordered 
himself, "Daria's
   checked out of here and her flight leaves in about," he checked his 
watch, "four
   hours. Ok, I can catch her before she gets on the plane...shit, I don't even
   know what airport she's going to." He reached for his cell phone and dialed
   Matt's number. "Hey Matt." He said as he started to pace. "I need 
another favor.
   I need you to find some flight information for me as quickly as 
possible."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hey man, you aren't on your cell phone are 
you?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well yeah, why?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Prank call, don't know you, don't know what 
you're asking
   for, I'm hanging up now." Matt shouted into the phone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hey, wait, this is an emergency, same person as before,
   flight to New York, leaves at six, where and what airline. That's all." The
   line went dead in response. "Fuck." Tom swore as he kicked at a 
piece of litter.
   He stood still for several long moments before his phone chirped. "Hello?" he
   asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Just thought you'd like to know the public 
record has twenty
   flights from London to New York leaving at six from both Gatwick 
and Heathrow."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"That seems like a lot."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Popular time for business travelers, they can be home in
   time for dinner. Don't call again." The line again went silent.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom hung his head, there was no way he could figure out
   which flight Daria was on, and guessing didn't seem like a very 
productive use
   of his time. "I guess I'll have to reach out to here when she gets 
back to New
   York and hope for the best." He sighed and walked over to the still waiting
   cab.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The cabbie was leaning against the hood of his taxi when
   Tom walked up. He noticed the fact that Tom was alone. "Didn't go 
so well huh?"
   He asked sympathetically.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shook his head slowly, "She wasn't there."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The cabbie nodded, "So where to now?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shrugged, "I don't really know."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You don't have her flight information?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shook his head "All I know is that her flight leaves
   at six, and that's all."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"And getting from one airport to the next would be damn
   near impossible in the time remaining," the driver mused. He shrugged, "Want
   to go to that bar I was telling you about?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"thanks, but I've had enough to drink this 
weekend already.
   I'll just walk myself home. I need some time to think, sort some stuff out in
   my head."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The cabbie nodded, "Well best of luck to you 
then."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom smiled weakly, "Thanks." He took out his walled and
   retrieved his money card from it, "Hope you don't mind, I'm a little short on
   cash right now." He keyed a figure into the card and handed it to 
the cabbie.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Sir, there's no way I could this much." The cabbie said
   in amazement.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yes you can, just think of it as a tip."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well thank you sir, thank you very much indeed." The man
   said, pumping Tom's arm up and down.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You're welcome." Tom replied while gently disentangling
   himself. Tom left the cabbie standing in front of his cab and set 
off for home,
   alone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom took his time as he walked home. He gazed into window
   displays. He studied the clouds in the sky. But through it all he continued
   to dwell on Daria.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"It's really no big deal," he thought, "I mean now I know
   where she lives so it'll be easy to look her up and say everything 
I was going
   to say today then. Who knows maybe she'll be more receptive when she's in her
   territory." He stopped and examined his hands, "Then why do I feel 
like I just
   missed the fucking boat?" He had wandered into a park that over 
looked the Thames.
   Tom kicked some of the fallen leaves in disgust. "Because we're 
both creatures
   of habit, and the only way to reach Daria is when she's out of her protective
   shell. Plus she'll want to know why I couldn't say anything to keep 
her in London,
   and if I was willing to let her leave why should I bother going to see her."
   He sat down on a small knoll and watched as the sky reddened. "If 
only I could
   call her or..." He paused as realization struck, "She's got to have 
a cell phone,
   and I bet I know who's got the number, or at least can get a message to her."
   Tom hurriedly grabbed his phone and dialed into the London Information Grid.
   From there it was a quick hop to the NYIG, and the information he needed, the
   phone number for Daria and Quinn Morgendorffer. He dialed the 
number and waited.
   It took a while for the connection to be made; even that advanced day and age
   calling a person on the other side of the globe took some time. Tom was glad
   the phone didn't ring too long before being answered.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hello?" a female voice said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Um, hi, er, Quinn?" Tom asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yes, this is Quinn." Quinn replied, sitting up. She had
   been spending a lazy Sunday in bed, "Who is this?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"It's Tom Sloane, remember me, from Lawndale. I used to
   date your sister."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Of course I remember you Tom. Is Daria there, 
is she having
   you call to tell me she'll be staying a little longer?" She clutched the bed
   sheets in anticipation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Err, no." Tom said, puzzled. "I was calling to 
see if you
   had her cell phone number handy, I went to go see her at the hotel, but she'd
   already left, and I don't know what flight she's on so I can't stake out the
   right gate so I figured I'd call her but..." Tom trailed off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Quinn laughed, "Don't worry Tom, I'll go get her number
   right now." Quinn walked into the main room and pushed a few buttons on the
   phone console. "Are you on a phone with a data link?" She asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yeah."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ok, I'll just send the number over the. Oh, do you want
   her flight information as well?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Sure, that would be great."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ok, she's taking United, flight 1121, gate 41 
out of Gatwick."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"United 1121, 41, Gatwick, got it. Thanks a lot 
Quinn."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You're welcome Tom," Quinn said with a smile, 
"Good luck,
   I'm pulling for you."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom chuckled, "You and the rest of the world it seems, of
   course this is Daria we're talking about so I need all the support 
I can get."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Quinn laughed, "Oh, I don't know about that, 
but still I'm
   rooting for you. The two of you were a great couple."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">This time it was Tom's turn to laugh, "Quinn, 
everyone says
   that when couples break up, but I appreciate the sentiment. Now I really have
   to go, running out of time."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Quinn looked at a clock, "Oh god yes. Why are you talking
   to me, go, go."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Say hi to Dave for me." Tom added before 
hanging up.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Quinn turned off the phone and crawled back 
into bed. Dave
   rolled over and wrapped his arms around her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Who was that?" He asked sleepily.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh, Tom Sloane."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Tom huh, What did he want? Had to do with 
Daria right?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Quinn nodded, "Yeah, he wanted to know her cell 
phone number."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Did you tell him she usually leaves hers 
off."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Shit! I knew I was forgetting something." She shrugged,
   "Oh well I gave him her flight information as well, he can catch her at the
   gate."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Dave nodded, "True." He looked at Quinn, a 
mischievous glint
   in his eyes, "Now where were we last night?" Soon all thoughts of Daria and
   Tom were pushed from Quinn's mind.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom stared at the number on his phone's display. Steeling
   himself he highlighted the number and pushed the send button. For the second
   time in as many days he waited for an answer from Daria, only this 
time he was
   greeted with a warm, "We're sorry, the number you're trying to reach is not
   in service at the moment."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Fuck!" Tom cursed. "Wait a minute," he 
thought, "they still
   require you to turn off your cell phone when you're on a plane, maybe that's
   it. Now what was that flight information?" Tom scanned his memory, 
"Right, that's
   it." Tom called up the number for the Gatwick United terminal from 
the listing
   database and set the phone to dial the number. This time he did not have to
   wait long for an answer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hello, United Airlines, how may I help you?" a 
cheery British
   woman asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yes, has Daria Morgendorffer checked into Flight 1121?"
   Tom asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"One moment please sir." The polite voice replied. "Sir,"
   she said a minute later, "it seems that she has not checked in for 
that flight
   yet."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom frowned, "Ok, well could I leave a message 
for her when
   she does?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Certainly sir."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Can you tell her to call Tom Sloane," he gave 
her his number,
   "and could you tell her it's urgent that I speak to her before she 
leaves."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I'll see that she gets the message sir."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Thank you." Tom said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"You're welcome sir, have a nice day."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom mumbled his reply as he turned off the 
phone. "Now all
   I have to do is wait," he mused. He sat on the knoll, fidgeting. Six o'clock
   came and went and still no call. Impatient, he dialed the number 
for the terminal.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Hello, United Airlines, how may I help you?" a 
different,
   but still cheery, voice asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yes I was wondering what the status of Flight 
1121 is?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Flight 1121, service to New York City?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"That's the one."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Flight 1121 is on time, with all passengers on 
board. It's
   on the runway right now in fact."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Did a Daria Morgendorffer board the flight?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">A pause, "No she did not, is there anything 
else I can help
   you with?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"No, you've been more than helpful." Tom again switched
   off his phone and sat back, thoughts swirling in his head. Daria 
had not gotten
   on the flight, what did it mean? "And where the fuck is she?" He 
wondered aloud.
   The oncoming chill of the autumn night cause him to shiver. "Wherever she is
   I won't find her here, go home, call Ian, plan the next move." He 
told himself
   as he walked across the park, kicking at the autumn leaves as he 
went. His mind
   never strayed to far from the central question, "Where did she go? Maybe she
   had another assignment pop up, maybe she took an earlier flight." Tom broke
   into a jog, the sooner he got home the sooner he'd know, that much 
he felt sure
   of.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">By the time Tom finally made it back to his 
apartment building
   night had firmly descended on the old city. Tom bounded up the steps to the
   building and nodded at the doorman as he walked over to the 
elevator.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Mr. Sloane!" The doorman called out. "The elevator's busted,   you'll have to take the stairs."</font></p><p><fo 
nt face="Times">Tom sighed, "Ok, thanks George."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Oh, you have a visitor too." George called out, but Tom
   was already in the stairwell and didn't hear him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom slowly climbed the stairs, he had been on the run for
   most of the day and it had taken its toll on him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Maybe I'll just leave the mystery of Daria alone for the
   moment and take a nap," he thought as he pushed open the door to 
his floor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"So there you are." A familiar voice off to his 
right said.
   "I was wondering if you'd ever get here."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom spun in amazement to face the source of the 
voice, and
   there she was, right in front of the door to his apartment, Daria. 
"Huh, what?"
   Was all his tired brain could manage.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria smiled, slightly, as she held up a piece of paper.
   "The hotel phone system records all incoming calls, even 
hang-ups."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Ah," Tom said, still dumbfounded by this 
change of events.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Well are you going to kiss me or just stand there like
   an abject moron?" Daria asked, bemused.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">This snapped Tom out of his daze and he did as 
he was told.
   When they came up for air he looked at her, still not quite 
believing this was
   happening. "So why are you here?" He asked lamely.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria sighed, "Because in the end it seems I care about
   your more deeply than I realized and that I'd be a fool to let you get away
   this time."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom chuckled, "I was thinking the same thing, and spent
   the better part of today running around London trying to tell you 
that."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"I'm flattered that you would undertake such a 
futile effort
   on my behalf. But don't think this means I'm about to abandon my life in New
   York to come live here."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom kissed Daria's forehead. "We can talk about 
that later.
   Right now let's just enjoy the moment, ok?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria nodded, "Ok."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom's stomach growled, reminding him that he hadn't eaten
   all day. "Want to start this off with a dinner date? My treat."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Daria again smiled that ever so slight smile, which spoke
   volumes to Tom. "Sure, so long as it's your treat, and I get to 
order the most
   expensive thing on the menu, payback's a bitch Tom." Tom just 
laughed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">They left Daria's luggage sitting in Tom's apartment and
   walked over to the stairs, Tom resting his arm across Daria's shoulders. As
   they rounded they opened the door to the stairwell Tom looked down at Daria
   and asked, "Want to go to a high school reunion?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">&lt;The End&gt;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">&lt;Epilogue, three weeks later.&gt;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom fidgeted in his seat for the umpteenth 
time, even with
   all the technological advancements made in aircraft design truly comfortable
   seating still eluded engineers, even in first class.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Would you bloody well settle down. You won't 
make the plane
   leave any faster by twitching," Ian scolded.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom sighed and forced himself to sit still. 
"There, is that
   better?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yes, thank you. Now relax you'll see her soon 
enough."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom fingered the boarding passes sticking out 
of the breast
   pocket of his shirt. They were for a flight from New York City to 
Los Angelos.
   "I know that, but still..." he glanced out the window at the tarmac and the
   airline workers scurrying about. He had demanded the window seat 
upon boarding,
   a request to which Ian had graciously ceded.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Yeah, all this is delaying your triumphant 
return to your
   home town with the love of your life on your arm, and your best buddy at your
   side; newly single and ready to unleash himself on the women of that peaceful
   burg."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom chuckled, "Something like that yeah. It is 
a shame about
   Kristen though."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian shrugged, "It's not my fault she chose to be a fan of
   Man United."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom shook his head in a bemused fashion, "I still don't
   see why her being a fan of another soccer team automatically makes 
her incompatible,
   the two of you were getting along so well."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian sighed patiently, "I guess it's just something you'll
   never understand, but it's for the best this way. And for the last time it's
   not soccer, it's football, get it right fuck for brains."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"If it doesn't involve a helmet and big pads 
it's not football."
   Tom said with a grin.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Stupid American fucks, don't know the proper 
name for the
   proper sport." Ian sighed. "So, tell me will we be meeting Elsie on 
this trip?
   Or Daria's sister for that matter, I hear she's quite the dish."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom smiled, "Don't know about Elsie, and hands off Quinn,
   she's going out with a friend of mine."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Isn't that always the way?" Ian asked with 
mock sadness.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Don't worry, I'll introduce you to my friend Jane when
   we get to Lawndale."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Jane, the art chick of legend?" Ian asked. Tom 
simply nodded,
   "Excellent, this trip shall be most rewarding."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"That it will be, that it will be." Tom said. The plane
   began to taxi and Tom leaned back in his seat, closing his eyes 
briefly. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"Daria's going to be meeting us at the airport, right?"
   Ian asked as the plane taxied down the runway.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Tom nodded, "Yep." The plane began to pick up speed. The
   powerful engines rumbled and with a thud the plane left the ground. 
Tom opened
   his eyes and watched as the plane sped towards the horizon, chasing 
the rising
   sun.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">"How fitting," he thought, "Facing a new day figuratively
   and literally." Tom closed his eyes and fell asleep as the plane continued to
   fly towards the dawning of a new day.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Fin</font></p>

   Babylon, Babylon </p>
<p><font face="Times">&lt;Author's Notes&gt;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">What's All This Then?: </font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Babylon differs from anything else I'm writing, or have
   written, because the idea for it came about very quickly, and it 
totally consumed
   me. I had recently discovered David Gray and this one song, <i>Babylon</i>,
   was chewing on my brain. So I planned on writing a "Taper Friendly" 
story based
   on it, but not until I finished work on a couple other fics I was 
kicking around
   at the time. Then I saw the movie "High Fidelity" and I got smacked 
upside the
   head by a monster bit of inspiration and I was off to the races. This is why
   the "last" Taper Friendly is the second written</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">From Whence Did This Come? </font></p>
<p><font face="Times">As I've said, the song Babylon was the primary 
inspiration
   for this particular story. In face I even tried to loosely fit the plot of my
   work around the narrative of the song. I echo verses in the song at several
   key plot point, and some of the choices I made in the story are 
directly attributable
   to the song's narrative, an authentic Marvel No-Prize to the person who can
   pick out all of those scenes that directly reference the song. The 
other major
   influence, and the thing that realized crystalized what this story was going
   to be about were the films <i>Gross Pointe Blank</i> and <i>High 
Fidelity</i>.
   I borrowed plot points and characterizations from both in fashioning Babylon.
   For instance, the scene in which Elsie is reading the reuinion invite to Tom
   is an almost verbatim transcription of a similar scene between 
Martin and Marcel
   in <i>Gross Pointe Blank</i>, not coincidentaly Martin and Marcel 
were playing
   by real life brother and sister John and Joan Cusack. Martin and 
Rob also both
   came from these films in form as well as spirit. The sub-genre of 
romantic reunion
   comedies are always populated with quirky friends. Babylon is my stab at that
   kind of story, so the surrounding characters had to match. Which 
brings me to...</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ian, The Man, the Myth, the Legend:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Ah, Ian Williams, that devilish rake. Ian's 
primary inspiration
   came from a group of people I know who basically act like Ian does. They're
   young, professionals who still want to live the party life. Also the sort of
   movies that inspired Babylon always have a brash, out-going friend to off set
   the more introspective and moody main character. As luck would have it this
   just so happened to fit Ian's proposed characterization like a 
glove. It's also
   worthy to note that Ian is the first major character I've ever created that
   has come from whole cloth; Ian is not derived from some facet of my 
own personality,
   he came entirely from my imagination and observations of others. 
I'm enormously
   pleased with how Ian turned out. I'm glad to see how strong a 
character he turned
   out, and I have to figure out a way to make use of him in the 
future.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Speaking of the Future Nostradamus:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">I'm sure people are curious as to why I chose 
the particular
   careers for the various Lawndale Alumni. I put Tom in computer 
programming for
   no real good reason, it wasn't crucial to the story and it felt right at the
   time. I initially wanted to make him an investment banker, but 
decided against.
   Daria was made a journalist simply as a knee-jerk fan-fic based 
reaction. There's
   a whole raft of fan-fics out there featuring Daria as a journalist 
of some sort
   and I just went along with the flow. Though I did qualify that 
somewhat by having
   Daria question her career choice. Quinn as an actress, well she's already a
   drama queen isn't she? Jane as a housepainter. Ok, here's the deal. I don't
   think Jane is going to "make it" as an artist, the odds are pretty much not
   in her favor on that one. I just couldn't bring myself to making 
her a successful
   artist. So I decided she'd do the next best thing, paint houses. 
That way she'd
   still get to be around her medium, yet make a living at the same time. Also,
   in a nod to Jane's unique spirit I made her the most artistic 
housepainter you
   ever did see, and implied she had created a successful cottage 
industry in the
   process. Jane's still Jane, she just has a day job now.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">The Trent Issue:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">I guess I confused a lot of people when Daria 
made reference
   to Trent after her first meeting with Tom. I wasn't signaling the arrival of
   Trent, Or that Daria was going to hook up with Trent, that Daria had feelings
   for Trent, or anything else of that nature. Daria was just saying 
that the night
   had been very strange and that the only thing stranger would have been to run
   into another former flame/crush. I used Trent because we all know Daria had
   some kind of romantic type feelings for Trent, something we don't 
know for Rick
   Derris, who Daria went out with a couple of times her sophomore 
year of college.
   That's obviously bullshit because the show has never shown us Daria 
romantically
   link with anyone else, and I hope that illustrates why Trent was mentioned in
   what is really a Daria/Tom shipper fic.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">What is Reality?:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Let me be strait up about something. This isn't 
a "realistic"
   story. I highly doubt the ending I wrote would actually take place. I suspect
   Daria and Tom will break up at some point and then move on with their lives.
   I don't think that everyone's "first love" is the love of their life. Nor do
   I think that getting back together with a person you once went out 
with is the
   smartest idea. Now having said that, let me also say that within the idiom of
   the story the ending does work, and I'm enough of a big softie to not want to
   go that far against form. It would have been an "edgier" story if I had left
   Daria and Tom broken up, but I didn't feel like doing that. Instead 
I left things
   hanging, not necessarily resolved, but we know Daria and Tom still care for
   each other. So it's a sappy ending, big deal, there aren't enough 
happy endings
   in life anyway, let's have one in the fictive world at least.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Shameless Plug:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Let me take a moment to extol the virtues of David Gray
   one more time. He is the finest artist I've heard in quite some time. I still
   can't help singing along to "Babylon," "Please Forgive Me," "Say Hello, Say
   Goodbye," and the rest of his catalog of songs. If you're a fan of 
"alternative"
   music do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of "White Ladder." You 
won't regret
   it. His live shows are just as amazing I'm told and the next time 
he stops near
   my town to put on a show I'm definitely going, along with my taping 
gear.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">I'll Be There For You?:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">One scene I'd like to talk about, because it's birth was
   cool and creative, was Daria's story about Stacy. The idea for that 
bit actually
   came from an episode of Friends when Rachel's mother comes for a visit. Once
   I had that as my starting point the rest just flowed, and there it was, Stacy
   was an alcoholic. It fit narrative, and I think it also fits with 
the characterization
   of Stacy on the show. I was so inspired by that one little anecdote that I'm
   probably going to blow it out into a story all it's own at some 
point.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Bonus Coverage:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Included free of charge is a little "out-take"
   the original opening paragraphs to Babylon, slightly different from 
what i finally
   went with. It's a bit more dramatic</font></p>
<p><i>Tom Sloane walked the streets of London on his way home from work. He had
   been living in England for a couple of years now. His dad had 
gotten him a job
   with one of the more prestigious investment banks in the city and then left
   his son alone. By and large his teenage years in Lawndale were consigned to
   the past. Other people had filled his life after he left and he was living a
   new life. Then he saw her. For a moment he almost tricked himself 
into thinking
   it wasn't her, but he knew. She might have changed her look, but 
Tom knew Daria
   Morgendorfer when he saw her. She was walking towards him, but in the crush
   of people he was sure she hadn't spotted him. </i></p>
<p><i>"What's she doing in London?" Was the first thing that popped 
into his mind,
   "Why London of all the places in the world?" Was the second, followed closely
   by, "Should I say something to her?" By the time he had sorted out 
his thoughts
   she was gone, swept away by the pedestrians. </i></p>
<p><font face="Times">What's Next?:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">No rest for this wicked bastard. I've already 
got moderately
   significant work done on two other stories and I've started on two others. At
   the moment the plan is for me to get the long overdue "Busted 
Stuff" done while
   simultaneously working on a much darker, as yet unnamed piece. However none
   of that is firm and if the motivation for something else strikes I 
shall pursue
   it. I hope everyone enjoyed this little romp, it was a fun one to write and
   I am really happy with the results. Ya'll take care of yourselves.</font></p>
