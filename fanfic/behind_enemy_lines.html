<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Franklin Davers sat against the
bulkhead wall of the slave holding area - well, one of the holding areas, he
reflected - and barely gave notice to the couple having sex barely a foot away
from him in the corner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>In normal times - in a normal
place - he would have been mortally offended by the sounds (by the entire
episode, actually) of the lovely forty-something with huge blue eyes and
overly-long, unkempt gold hair as her slender limbs wrapped around a man barely
half her age and she grunted her pleasure out to the world<i>. I see the Great
Dane's finally decided to go ahead and give in</i>, Franklin thought, no
negative tone to his internal musings as the muscular young Scandinavian drove himself
upon the woman and her cries filled the air... </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Might as well, kid - eat,
drink and bust your cherry, for tomorrow they just may dine on you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>There were at least five
hundred men and women of various ages and races in the large area, most of them
somehow managing to sleep on the warm, heavy blankets provided for them &ndash; the
only concession to comfort the Mantoids made for humans, he noted. <i>Amazing
how people can adapt so quickly, especially when they think there's no way out
of their situation. Modus vivendi, and all that. <o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The woman - Heather, he
recalled - was really familiar, and not just because he'd been intimate with
her once before &ndash; <i>she was some sort of weather person, I know I've seen her
on television somewhere before... just pray she doesn't catch a silver bullet, or
they'll snack on the baby &ndash; that's why they let the people have as much sex as
they want and don't stop any of the rapes. Free-range infant humans &ndash; their
snack of choice. Since I've been here, I've seen them eat over a hundred newborn
babies... and I've seen twenty Mantoids either die or end up crippled in the
fights for the babies &ndash; not to mention that execution. They actually spaced one
of their own because he killed that baby rather than give it up to the winner.
Live babies &ndash; they'll fight and kill for the chance to get one. They have to be
live &ndash; from what I gather, there's a special taste to a live newborn that just
sends them over the moon. Command will definitely want to know about that one,
and we'll need to start placing serious guard details on every hospital nursery
in sight...</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>A hand slid boldly beneath his
robe, and Franklin sighed as he turned back to remove Anita Isakson's hand from
his crotch. "No."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Why not...?" the willowy redhead
asked, her cultured Georgia accent adding a lilt to her speech as she brushed
herself against him in a manner that, in any other setting, would have been the
beginning of a very good night for the both of them. "It's not like you or I
have to worry about cheating on anyone back home..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>She looked at him with eyes the
color of dark emeralds. "There isn't any going back home. Not for any of us."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Franklin saw more than a few of
the men who were awake glance at him with various degrees of annoyance to
outright jealousy and hatred as the young college coed snuggled close to him &ndash; <i>for
protection as much as sex,</i> he acknowledged.<i> It's the same in any bad
situation &ndash; some people take advantage and do the most horrible things, and
others become victims... no, they're already victims, and they allow the evil to
overwhelm them. God help you if you're a beautiful woman, too. You're a
receptacle for a gang-bang if you're lucky, and currency to be traded about if
you're not. <o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>He also noticed that many of
the women were watching &ndash; some with furtive glances, some using their
peripheral vision, and some with unabashed interest... as well as with looks that
clearly said that they wouldn't mind taking Anita's place. He noticed one woman
&ndash; in her late twenties, with haunting Slavic features and a surprisingly toned,
shapely figure - openly appraising both him and Anita with large, dark eyes
that all but shouted '<i>Either one of you. I'll take you both<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&ndash; separate, or at the same time. I don't
mind.'</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Anita gave the woman - Marjeta,
a Serbian linguist working for the United Nations before she was taken &ndash; a
glance of pure hatred, and she responded with a bubbling laugh before she
crawled over to find a place to lie down. She finally placed herself between an
attractive 'girl-next-door' type with long, dark and naturally curly hair who
couldn't have been more than seventeen (Franklin had heard her addressed as
'Sarah'), and a Native American woman with a face and slender figure that could
have instantly won her a modeling contract; the way Marjeta looked the girl
over made her intent obvious. The dark-haired girl sighed as Marjeta kissed the
tip of her nose, moved her head slightly and then opened the girl's tunic,
staring for several seconds at Sarah's full, heavy bosom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Tears began to run from Sarah's
eyes, but she made no effort to resist as Marjeta shared a deep, impassioned
kiss with her; Anita turned away as the Native American woman crawled around
Marjeta and Sarah to join in...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>After several minutes of sounds
Franklin pushed out of his mind, a series of sharp, escalating female cries
echoed through the room. In the dim light, Sarah shrieked, crying out as if in
pain; Franklin turned &ndash; his enhanced senses allowing him to see as if it was
daylight &ndash; as the young woman's curvaceous form began to quake uncontrollably
in the shadows, her half-crazed screams of passion splitting the air.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>As the young woman's cries
continued to ring out through the thin light, several men stared at Anita - and
the women directly around Franklin &ndash; their intent obvious. Franklin gazed
slowly around the area, his expression arctic, and the few men who were brave
enough to even approach Franklin's position stopped in their tracks and turned
away quickly. They all found other women, and soon, more people were
desperately trying to forget as they grasped and intertwined wildly in the thin
light...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>That was why Anita chose him
when he arrived five months ago, and stuck close to him whenever possible. She
was almost eighteen when she was plucked out of her Princeton dorm room three
weeks after her freshman year began, and her slender, curvy form made her an
immediate object for many a male slave &ndash; and fear-driven jealously from more
than a few women, afraid that someone would take her and leave them to go
hungry on the meager rations they were given, or unprotected from all manners
of abuse. That was two years ago &ndash; two years of humiliation, brute slave labor,
and vicious physical &amp; sexual abuse from aliens and captive humans alike...
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Instead of breaking her, the
time here had made her strong, focused, and cunning like a cat with a shiv.
Anita knew how to pick and choose the ones that could keep her reasonably safe,
and her instincts were sharp - sharper than his, Franklin admitted. She wasn't
going anywhere more than a few feet from him... <i>Southern women. In this case,
the stereotype's more than true. That's why she picked me. She's a survivor...
and the others now know better than to try me. Not after I dispatched that
redneck from West Virginia - Odell Jones - with two hits. I can't &ndash; I <u>won't</u>
tell these people how they should compose themselves, not here &ndash; but if I see a
rapist in the act, he's <u>dead</u>. End of story.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Back in the blue. No, you
don't. You're gone. See those marks? You're a worker, unfit for breeding &ndash; so,
they'll work you until you die or someone manages to kill you... for what... it
doesn't matter. This is what we all have now. Work, and sex, and occasionally,
someone comes along who's good at making up stories or has a really good memory
for things, and acts like one of the old-time storytellers or bards. The last
guy like that died a couple of months before you showed up... he got caught in
one of the energy conduits when they decided to switch the solar panels out and
didn't bother to tell anyone that they were starting the power back up. The
right side of his body got burned off. Franklin &ndash; I want you to."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Silence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"You're not betraying anyone if
you do, Franklin. This is the rest of our lives. It's okay if every once in a
while, you take a moment to push all of this to the back of your mind..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"We've talked about this
before, Anita." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>They both hesitated for a
moment as a sharp series of pleasured sounds came from the direction of Marjeta
and Sarah once again. Franklin chose not to notice how Anita pressed herself
against him as Sarah's screams first filled the area, or how she had glanced
over to watch for a moment as Sarah, her inhibitions tossed aside, screamed out
her lovers' names as she thrashed about, totally lost in the sensations her
young body was experiencing, and then watched the entwined couple just across
from them before moving close... </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Anita looked directly at the
three women as they grasped one another, then looked back with resignation on
her face. "Well... it's not as if there's much else to talk about... or do.
That's probably why they keep everyone screwing all the time. No clothes or
fashion, books or DVD's, the nearest good bistro's thousands of miles away &ndash;
straight down &ndash; and do you know how long it's been since I've heard any good
music?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"You're barely out of your
teens. I refuse to believe that you have any idea of what good music is. I've
seen what MTV has to offer."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"You should be glad for MTV &ndash;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Anita, it's not as if our
entire existence revolves around MTV, or we're even here because of it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"What makes you so sure of
that?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"The universe isn't that
insane."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>They were distracted once more
by Sarah's screams of released passion, along with the throaty sounds of the
blonde woman, and Anita spared the writhing couple another slight glance before
placing her hand on Franklin's forearm. "For us, that's just what it is. An insane
universe, and the bugs rule it. Escape with me for a moment."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Everyone else does that. More
than enough reason for me not to."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Anita nodded, a slight look of
disappointment on her face. Off to the side, the blonde woman shuddered as the
young man made an almost comical sound of release before he collapsed upon her.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"That's what I like about you,"
she whispered. "You act like you're waiting for something. You don't act like a
slave... you do everything they tell you, as quickly as they want, and you carry
yourself like everyone else does, but you don't act like you're broken." She
nestled herself against him, something Franklin has started to allow by
unspoken agreement several weeks ago.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"You act like you're just
waiting for a chance. Be careful, though &ndash; a couple of the others have noticed.
If someone gets a chance, they'll rat you out to a guard &ndash; or one of <i>The
Watched</i> - for some Earth food."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"That's one thing I don't
understand," Franklin said, looking down at her. "The aliens don't care if men
are killed, but if a woman is murdered, they have a fit and track the one who
did it down. Why the difference?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"From what I understand,
there's something about how we taste &ndash; same as with the babies," she said, a
slight flutter of nausea going through her stomach as she spoke. "It has to do
with our immune system &ndash; by their standards, we're less polluted and have more
of the natural taste humans are supposed to have. That's why they love eating
newborn babies. Taste great &ndash; less filling."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"You don't look like the type
that's ever had his hand around a domestic beer in the first place," Anita
smiled; it was a warm, gentle smile totally unsuited for the place and
situation they were in. "You're like my older brother Drew. If it doesn't reach
a certain standard, you won't touch it..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>She shrugged. "Besides the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Actually, I was the DJ," she
said, and actually laughed at the look on Franklin's face. "I wasn't dating
anyone, I wasn't going to just take 'pot luck' on a date and I wanted to go. It
also helps that I have my own collection of CD's and mix tapes. A few thousand
CD's, and I worked part-time at the school station-" Her voice suddenly broke.
"I was going to school so I could get my media degree, and then get on-air
somewhere..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Franklin had no words. He lay
with Anita in the thin light of the holding area, and felt his sleeve moisten
as Anita cried silently beside him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>In the dim light that blessedly
shaded most of the copulation from casual view, new screams, moans, and grunts
&amp; cries of release could be heard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>Franklin said nothing as the forty-something blonde &ndash; Heather &ndash;
came over and lay beside him. He could feel the momentary tension from her, as
if she were afraid he would push her away; when he didn't move, she snuggled
close and quickly went to sleep. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"What really surprises me is
that no one steals food from anyone else when the dispensers go on," Franklin
said, moving aside as a large teenage boy with Hawaiian features accepted two
large squares &ndash; about five inches long and an inch thick &ndash; from a dispenser
built into the wall next to the water fountains. (The fountains surprised
Franklin, until Anita pointed out that it was easier for the Mantoids to supply
water that way to the humans, without the need for cups. The Slaver Mantoids
were <i><u>very</u></i> aware of just how intelligent humans were, especially
at adapting anything into a tool... or a weapon.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"No on wants to risk it. The
Mantoids provide enough food to keep us reasonably healthy and working, and
they can tell if someone's being starved. They aren't always watching us &ndash;
there's far too many of us for that &ndash; but they run checks, and if it happens..."
She shivered. "They're all about productivity. Whatever keeps us working us is
good; whatever doesn't... gets made an example of. They're very big about that.
Not that it doesn't happen, but, well, you know how thing are..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Franklin bit into his second
bar. The food bars were actually quite good, he thought; the ones dispensed in
the morning (the creatures actually kept their slaves on a 'morning' and
'evening' regimen &ndash; again, 'productivity') seemed more filling, and gave people
a bit more energy, where the ones dispensed in the evening were always of mixed
flavorings, and sometimes, he could actually taste a bit of alcohol... <i>Someone's
been reading up on how humans kept slaves</i>, he mused, swallowing and taking
another bite. <i>The evening bars are laced with some form of alcohol &ndash; or
something like it. Keeps the people mildly sedated, a bit more compliant... and
also relaxes inhibitions. With the mindset that the Mantoids want to keep the
human slaves in, a bit of alcohol would seem like a good thing...</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>He also thought on how, on
occasion and always during the evening, the food dispensers would put out 'the
blue food bars'. Franklin's face colored with shame as he remembered the first
time he'd eaten them... It was three weeks after he'd arrived and he'd just
thought that they were like the others (the morning bars were light brown, the
evening ones a dark chocolate-brown shade). From the way the others gobbled
them down, he didn't think there was a problem... until almost all of the slaves
in the large area began to copulate within minutes of eating. Anita and several
other slaves had been pulled out about an hour before, so he couldn't ask her
(and didn't quite trust any of the others)...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>When she returned, she ate quickly.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was bad enough, Franklin thought, that
the air in the slave area was heavy with the thickened, musky smell of sex...
and, as hard as he tried, he couldn't tear his eyes away from Anita... the
emerald shade of green in her large, sparkling eyes, the way her scarlet hair
fell over her shoulder, how the otherwise shapeless tunic she wore managed to
still show off her incredible body and the way her firm, full breasts seemed to
be barely contained by the pale material, her nipples easily visible...<i> (Did
I just say 'incredible body? God help me, I sound like I'm back in high school!
What the hell is wrong with me? Whey can't I control myself -?)</i> Anita stood
by one of the line of fountains, drinking behind every bite, and when she
finished, she came back and sat next to him quietly for a moment before she
reached out and touched him on the shoulder. He looked over at her, seeing how
her nipples had hardened as she stroked his arm, eyes glazed over by her
building hunger for him, and he didn't stop her from moving into his arms and
kissing him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Franklin remembered how she
cried out as he took her, then and there, with so many eyes upon them and not
caring, her every scream and cry a whip across his back that drove him
harder... After he had finished with Anita, her screams still ringing in his
ears, he turned to the woman closest to him (Heather, he vaguely recalled) and
pulled her to him, her face clouded by lust as she gave in instantly, her
husky, throaty sounds echoing through the area. After satisfying himself with
her, his eyes fell upon a petite young woman with wheat-colored hair, a proper
English accent and wide brown eyes who had just arrived that day, and was
trying to hide in the corner behind Anita.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>(He heard that her name was Charlotte Spearsman, today was her
eighteenth birthday &ndash; and she had been taken after leaving her birthday party
to get some rest. She made the mistake of pulling off to the side of the road
to take a nap, as her driving was a bit erratic from her dozing off, and was
captured that way.) She looked up with eyes suddenly full of fire as he pulled
her to him, tore her gown away in a single movement, picked her up and pushed
her up against a bulkhead, driving himself fully inside her young, slender form
with a violent thrust that made her scream. Charlotte writhed in his arms,
gasping sounds of ecstasy like the animals they were at that moment, grinding
and writhing upon him with a mindless hunger that the drugs literally unleashed
in them both.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Franklin grunted out his
release and tried to pull himself from the young woman moments after the rising
cries of her climax, but Charlotte's body jerked in hard, sudden spasms as she
clung to him with surprising strength. She half-screamed, half-grunted out her
second climax, eyes wide but unseeing as she shook wildly from the force of her
young body's release, sputtering sounds out as she gripped him inside herself.
Charlotte held onto Franklin as he lay her down on the floor and started
thrusting into her again; a shuddering orgasm made her scream incoherently
until she literally collapsed onto the floor, insensate, eyes rolling back as
her small, firm breasts quivered from her body's spasms. Franklin didn't notice
Charlotte's eyes seemed to clear as she curled herself up, tears flowing down
her face while a Hindi woman in her thirties &ndash; <i>Chandni</i>, he remembered &ndash;
stroked his chest, laid back and spread her legs as he slid atop her. A random
glance away found Charlotte groaning, with Anita kissing her neck and fondling
a breast as Heather brought Charlotte's face to her own...<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Chandni kissed Franklin as Charlotte's
screams of pleasure split the air, breaking down into pained, throaty grunting.
Franklin began to savage the woman screaming beneath him, and Anita slid away
from Charlotte and Heather to join in...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>In their corner of the slave
area, the five of them spent the rest of the night in mindless pleasuring,
Franklin's metahuman stamina allowing him to keep savaging them all, one after
another, before finally, as if in mutual exhaustion, they all drifted off to
sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The next morning, after
untangling herself from Franklin and his newfound, unexpected harem (and
fending off his apologies to all; nevertheless, the blonde boy was the first
slave male to touch one of the four women since that night), Anita explained
that the blue food bars were a reward for very good work. They were liberally
dosed with alcohol that the Mantoids made and supplied for the humans, along
with an inhibition-reducing drug that would have the Pope screwing the first
woman that passed in front of him. The three older women all gathered around
Charlotte, consoling the young beauty, and Franklin felt even worse when he
found out later that he had been the girl's first...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Apparently, they hadn't gotten
any 'blue bars' in several months, and it never occurred to mention them. It
was also a way to ensure that the slaves who weren't selected as breeders had
plenty of babies for the Mantoids to eat (as the breeders bore children who
were kept for even more breeding. Anita mentioned that the Mantoids had them
breeding at fifteen years &ndash; the optimum age for human females to breed, given
proper nutrition, and they could get a child out of them once per year for
twenty to thirty years. No breeder female lived past fifty... the Mantoids
simply extracted whatever viable eggs she had left and then, some lucky Mantoid
and his friends shared the woman over a banquet table. One time, Anita
shuddered as she mentioned how<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>- just
after she was brought aboard - ten women all reached fifty within the same
week. "They acted like it was the Fourth of July," she said, and never
mentioned it again.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The room immediately quieted as
a man with dark rings under his eyes, appearing to be in his late twenties,
appeared at the hatch. "You... you three... you two blondes... you, with the dark
hair... you two... the four of you over there... you, with the long hair &ndash; no, not
you, her - and you. Big boy. Get up and get that hard-on down &ndash; you won't be

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Franklin and Anita finished
their food-bars, and stood as the man pointed at them. "They'll need a cleaning

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Anita looked straight ahead as
the man stopped her before she went through the door, and showed no emotion as
he casually fondled her left breast. "Don't get yourself too messy in there.
After you clean that stuff up, clean yourself up and come to my room." He
looked around the area at the people in the room, still eating their pitiful
breakfast. "Find a couple of girls to bring down with you. You know that I like
a side-show during the main event."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The man let his hand roam
freely over her body as he spoke; Anita let her body respond to the way he
touched her, and his touch became less forceful. "Your new boy's got sense. He
works hard, too. We'll be putting him in the Gardens soon, alongside that
little Brit with the devil-hex on her. He deserves something to keep him
working hard... seeing how he doesn't want to find out how good you are. I mean &ndash;
finding out on his own..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>He gave her breast a last grasp
and then let her pass; Anita had to hurry to catch up with the others. "This is
different," Franklin said, letting her catch her breath. "Usually, they have me
scrubbing the inside of processing tanks or the energy transfer conduits..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"That's because you're strong

when a Watched takes her is a good thing. You're a morale booster... and you do
the work of any three men."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>She glanced back to see Calvin
watching her. "He's not concerned that I stick around you, either. He knows

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Franklin sighed; he saw
firsthand how chivalry had cost a couple of men &ndash; new arrivals &ndash; their lives.
The Mantoids did enjoy making an example &ndash; and then a hearty snack &ndash; out of
humans who gave them the slightest bit of resistance. <i>Someday, I'm going to
make you giant roaches pay. I can't protect her like I could Charlotte &ndash; I've

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I'm glad you're not like most

'be a man."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"One got beaten to a pulp &ndash;
literally &ndash; and then, the bugs rolled him in fresh tomatoes and ate him," Anita
replied casually. "Their idea of 'sweet-and-sour. They love the taste of
tomatoes. Another actually took his bucket full of water, took a big swing and
broke a bug's arm. They stuck him in the main airlock, put a microphone in with
him and sealed it up. He lasted about a day before the air ran out...he went
insane before he died. This isn't... Here, whatever happens, happens. People who
can't accept that die badly."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Franklin saw the girl in front
of Anita &ndash; a pretty, slender girl with short black hair and startlingly blue
eyes &ndash; shiver at her words. "Speaking of tomatoes &ndash; they're giving you a reward
for working hard and not being trouble. They're putting you in the Gardens."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Where Charlotte and I work.

in shape without putting them in danger of being accidentally killed."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Franklin nodded. He knew that
there were three occasions that his metahuman abilities were all that saved him
from death &ndash; a rather gory death in one case, when the Mantoids decontaminated
a processing tank the size of a high school gymnasium by exposing it to hard
vacuum... with several workers still inside. The aliens were annoyed only when
'the Watched' &ndash; the humans they trusted to keep the other humans under control,
and as such, were kept under even greater observation &ndash; found the bodies
inside, forcing them to decontaminate the tank again. (Franklin had turned to
mist as the hatch was opened and slipped out that way. No one ever gave him a
second look.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"They don't mind if you eat
some of the produce, either. They figure 'healthy food, healthy, tasty babies
and healthier breeding stock.' The bugs are all about us tasting good. Also,
the higher up you go, the better the food you get. If I wanted, I could eat
regular food all of the time..." An overwhelming flood of shame peeked out for
the briefest of moments from her face, and she immediately sealed it away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Yeah." Franklin let it go. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Before Franklin could reply,
the unusual, yet familiar sound of running Mantoids came from behind them, and
they moved aside as three of the alien creatures, their mandibles clicking
excitedly as they ran &ndash;And moving quickly even for them, he observed- as they
whisked past. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>As he and the others kept moving
down the hall towards the orientation area, Franklin watched as a mass of
screaming, retching, vomit-splotched men and women rushed off in the other
direction. He noticed how one of the new women &ndash; a girl younger than Charlotte,
actually, with auburn hair and 'man-stopper' glasses that didn't hide the
girl's beauty (<i>poor kid</i>, he thought) - flashed a momentary look of

human being &ndash; a girl, by the look of the shoe that sat askew against a wall

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The Mantoids shuffled out of

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Haven't you noticed how you
haven't been sick since you've been here?" Anita asked, the squeegee squeaking
as she cleared another section of the floor of blood. "The stuff in those
bottles is &ndash; what did Matt call it? &ndash; he said it was basically a broad-spectrum
antibiotic, bit it could kill both bacteria and viruses. He said that if the
bugs had just come to Earth and started selling this stuff, they could have had
anything they wanted. He said that for this, the world leaders would have let
them go to Africa, India, China and all of the other overpopulated areas of the
world and let them full up on people."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"You know, you can drink that
straight from the bottle," she told him, moving aside as he sopped up blood
with his mop. "They put small amounts of that stuff in the food bars, too.
Keeps everyone healthy, and if you drink it straight &ndash; well, it keeps you from
getting sick and kills anything you might already have. It heals a lot of other
things - there were people who had different problems, several who had diabetes
- after the Watched found out, they gave them that stuff in serious amounts for
their first few weeks. I guess it healed them.&quot;</p>

built up a very effective wall of dread in the Mantoids when it came to the
petite Englishwoman; on no less than thirty occasions (and yes, he counted)
he'd killed Mantoids and members of <i>The Watched</i> who had either tried to
kill or maim Charlotte - and the one time one of the <i>Watched</i> had gotten
her into his quarters and tried to rape her... Even the Mantoids avoided
Charlotte after Franklin had literally used that man's blood to paint his
quarters red, then tore his body apart and tossed it into a pile in the
adjoining bathroom, which he made sure was spotless. It was as if they simply
pretended that she didn't exist, since returning her to Earth was out of the
question. A pair of young (and unusually aggressive, not to mention dumb)
Mantoids had come into the slave area after hearing about 'the cursed female'
with the intention of eating her on the spot; Franklin used his mental powers
and killed them where they stood with two massive psionic bursts that literally

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The Mantoid actually coming
along with the work crew was unusual &ndash; unusual enough that many of the slaves
whispered about it. Even beyond that &ndash; <i><u>the Mantoid carried a weapon</u>.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Franklin looked it over with
every chance he got, as the humans were led to a point on <i>The Habitat</i>
(the name for the giant alien station) further from the slave pens than he'd
ever been before. As they were crowded into a heavy elevator (and instructed to
hold onto the straps &ndash; low-gravity environment), Franklin examined the device.
It reminded him of the small barbells aerobics-types used when working out (but
larger, and with the grip shaped for Mantoid claws); on one end, there was a
round, heavy glass globe (about the size of a baseball) with a thick electrode
in the center. <i>It looks like one of those funky plasma lamps that the
stoners buy...</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>There was no mistaking the
purpose of the other end. There was a small metal tube that extended about an
inch from the end of the bottom of the 'Barbell' &ndash; and once, when the Mantoid
turned, Franklin could see the shining, tri-edged spike within. <i>That thing's
a perfect trench knife &ndash; you could split someone's head open with it when you
hit them, or skewer through their skull (or anywhere else) with that spike. Who
knows what that bulb does?<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>He found out minutes later,
when the Mantoid led them into what had to be an aircraft (spacecraft?) hangar,
and one man let his curiosity override common sense. He actually went over and
looked inside what had to be one of the smaller ships on the deck. (They were
supposed to be walking along the area, easily the size of a football field, and
pick up any foreign objects on the floor, as well as clean up any spilled
fluids. The Mantoids were very strict on some areas being near-sterile
environments.) The Mantoid saw him and without a hint of warning, grasped the
device and flash-fried him with a directed pulse of white-hot energy that
flashed away from the bulb like ball lightning and seared him to the side of
the ship! (Later, Franklin saw that only the side of him facing the flash was
charcoal; the other side was totally untouched. Nasty.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Franklin nearly died moments
later; as if to set another example, the Mantoid turned to him (the nearest
human), the tri-spike snapped down from the bottom of the barbell-weapon and
locked into place. The Mantoid lunged downward at Franklin's skull-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>He wasn't there; a burst of

again...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Every human on the hangar floor
suddenly dropped to their knees and cried out in pain as Franklin slammed the
palms of his hands together with all his strength, and the Mantoid's chitinous
form splintered and blew backwards in a fountain of greenish-yellow fluid and
insectoid parts, caught in the point-blank force of Franklin's shockwave!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>His energy spent, Franklin
sagged down on one knee, looking at the incapacitated slaves and the shattered
remains of the Mantoid, now spread over fifty feet in the opposite direction.
About a minute later, other Mantoids came in with barbell-weapons raised,
followed by a trio of Watched, but after looking around, all but one left with
two of the collaborators, and the third Watched directed them to continue
cleaning. Several minutes later, over a hundred humans were brought into the
hangar to help mop up the remains of the Mantoid and ensure that the hangar
floor was clean.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Franklin's hyper-senses let him
listen in on the watched as they talked; the Mantoids assumed that the other
Mantoid died because of a serious fluctuation in the antigravity field-plates
under the hangar floor and let it drop. (Plenty of humans died that way, too,
he overheard.) He kept his face impassive, but listened with satisfaction as
the Watched mentioned that the Mantoids weren't all that happy with having to
keep the humans in nearly-full gravity, and that the Mantoids weren't built to
handle full-gravity for extended periods, even though their bodies were far
more resistant to damage than Earth insects... </p>

to me," she said, scooting back against a wall. "I... sometimes, I just need to
talk, Franklin. Talk to me. Tell me things. On occasion, I just want to... Just...
talk to me."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>He positioned himself on the
wall next to the woman. "Back 'in the blue', like people say here, I'm a
soldier. An officer. I've got four brothers, and my parents named us all after
Presidents. I'm Franklin Delano Davers."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"They wanted girls and had
girls names picked out, but we kept showing up with extra equipment. George's
name was almost a joke, they had another laugh when I showed up, and after John
was born, they just said, 'the hell with it.' Uly was next, and then Jefferson
&ndash; he's at West Point now."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"George breeds specialty cattle
&ndash; his dream is to get several heads of Mishma stock from the Japanese, but the
world will end before that happens. John's a neurologist, and Uly &ndash; Ulysses &ndash;

school or college, and now he's surrounded by beautiful women all of the time."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Anita looked at Franklin
without speaking for a long time, and then pressed herself into his arms. "Tell

can understand their language &ndash; that can be helpful if I try to take the ship.
I understand why it was so important for them to plant a Beta Nightbreed aboard
&ndash; I can turn anyone here that I need, and in days, I'll have an army ready to
strike from within. If we can take this ship, it would be a hell of an orbital
base to strike out at them &ndash; and the tech we could get from examining it...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>He turned towards the trio of
girls that he had seen earlier &ndash; the girl from the cleanup crew, the
auburn-haired one with the glasses, and a very attractive redhead who was
almost certainly the sister of the one with glasses. He had heard everything
that they said with his enhanced hearing, and that actually make him feel a bit
heartened...</p>
