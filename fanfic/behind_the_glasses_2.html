<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A comfortable silence fell between them and for long moments the crackling of the fire was the only sound. Daria smiled. There weren't many people in the world with whom she could share such a companionable silence. Most folks needed to fill every moment with words, but the two of them had been sharing silent times since those evenings and weekends spent in Jane's room back in Lawndale. Daria had always considered it a measure of their friendship's depth. They were comfortable enough in each other's company to be silent together.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"So how is your better half doing?" asked Jane after a while. "How's he taking to retirement?"</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Not well," said Daria. "Sometimes he just doesn't seem to know what to do with himself. He might start doing some teaching again, just a few classes a week."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Probably for the best," said Jane with a wink. <I>(Jane pauses, suddenly looking uncertain. The pause draws out into an uncomfortable silence and Jane smiles, obviously having forgotten her line. She turns to Daria. "So, what's your hubby's name again?")</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Daria smiles and begins to chuckle. "I have no idea," she says. "Since he doesn't appear in this fic, I've never actually met him.")</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>

</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Daria turned her gaze toward an easel that had been set up beside the casket in accordance with Jane's wishes. On it sat one of her distorted self-portraits from high school, a charcoal rendering that she'd chosen just for this occasion. People had been chattering about it all day long and Daria had more than once overheard the word 'masterpiece.' But Daria knew the rending was no masterpiece. It was a masterstroke. A minor doodle put on display to set pretentious tongues to wagging. It was Jane's final joke played on an art world that took itself too seriously and as she expected, it had gone right over the heads of the artistic elite. By next week, somebody would probably be paying a million dollars for that doodle. Good one, Jane.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Daria turned away from the easel and looked down on the casket itself. It was closed, again in accordance with Jane's wishes. The thought of being put on display had always been abhorrent to Jane. Besides, she'd wanted to be remembered as she was in life, not as she was now.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Trent shook his head. "Sorry about all this, Janey," he said. "I shouldn't have allowed it to happen, but they made it all sound no soble. Like it was all going to be about you. I'm sorry."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Daria smiles and looks up at Trent. "No soble?")</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Trent looks back at her, obviously confused at the non-scripted question. "What?")</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">("You said 'no soble,'" Daria replies with a smile. "Instead of 'so noble.'")</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Trent shakes his head. "I don't think so, Daria.")</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">("You did, Trent," comes a muffled voice from inside the casket. "I heard it, too.")</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Trent and Daria turn disbelieving gazes on the casket. Trent shakes his head. "What the . . ." He reaches out and lifts the casket's lid. Jane is lying inside, looking young compared to the faux-elderly Trent and Daria. Jane's eyes are bright with mischief as she looks up at them. "Would you guys mind keeping it down," she says with a smile. "I'm trying to be dead in here.")</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">("Whoa," says Trent. "What are you doing in there, Janey? This is a closed casket scene. You don't need to be here.")</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Jane props herself up on one elbow. "You know that," she says. "Daria knows that and I know that, but you know Jon. With him it's all realism, realism, realism." Jane continues in a mocking tone, obviously mimicking the author. "Everything has to be just right for maximum dramatic effect.")</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Daria lifts a hand to her forehead. "I don't think I can take much more of this. First we're stuck in one of Diane's shipper fics and now we’re trapped on a soundstage with Mr. Drama.")</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">("Hey," says Trent, looking sidelong at Daria. "I like those shipper fics.")</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">("We know you do," says Jane, rolling her eyes. Then she looks over at Daria and smiles. "It's only going to get worse, you know.")</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">("What do you mean?")</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To assist in the investigation, the Lawndale Police decided to utilise the polygraph machine Ms. Li bought with school funds. Hadley and Riker decided that the Lawndale Lions football team was as good as any a group to start interrogating, and that was how Kevin found himself strapped to the machine. &quot;Now, Kevin,&quot; said Riker. &quot;This machine will help us determine whether or not you are telling the truth. If you are, the green light will go on. If you are not, the red light will go on, and you will hear a buzzing noise. Do you understand?&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dylan and Daria stepped into Dylan’s apartment. It was fairly small and messy, with sparse furniture and an old TV. &quot;My mom usually doesn’t get home until like after 9,&quot; he said. &quot;You want a soda?&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Sure,&quot; replied Daria.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Opening the fridge, Dylan said, &quot;Boy, I’m sure that whole ordeal is over. I hope you’re not mad about having been made a scapegoat through all of this.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;That’s OK, I’m used to it,&quot; she replied. As Daria drank her soda, what she was about to do went over in her mind at lightning speed. &quot;Dylan?&quot; she said.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Yeah?&quot; he replied.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Daria took a deep breath. She had never thrown herself at a guy like this before, but she had to admit, Dylan was pretty cool. &quot;Dylan, over the course of the past couple of days, I have gotten to really like you. A lot. I have feelings for Trent too, but he doesn’t seem to reciprocate them. Therefore, I think I want to give you what every teenage boy your age wants. I think we should take our relationship to the next level, and... and...&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;And?&quot; said Dylan, mouth agape.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;And make a porno,&quot; she finished.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;With cum shots?&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Oh yes. Lots of cum shots. In every possible position.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Wow, I didn't see you as the type to throw yourself at a guy like that," said Dylan. "This isn’t some peer pressure thing, is it? Because you know how I stand on peer pressure, being a classroom lecturer for D.A.R.E. and all.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;And you know I never succumb to peer pressure, Dylan. Now are we gonna make unrealistically pornographic love or not?&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Cool!&quot; said Dylan. &quot;I’ll get my condoms!&quot;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the attempted murder of Principal Angela Li, Stacy (&quot;Nibblett&quot;) Rowe was sentenced to six months at the Croydon Juvenile Detention Facility for Young Women. After a couple of weeks there, Stacy was sitting alone at the bleachers during exercise break, wearing the same blue jump-suit as everybody else. She was approached by three quite attractive girls, whose hair was incredibly well-groomed. Stacy was immediately reminded of her friends from Lawndale High, who had yet to call or write or visit.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Hi,&quot; said the leader of the group, a brunette with a sultry deep voice and a hint of Southern twang. &quot;My name is Andie, and this is Lynn and Trixie.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We’re the Fashion Club!&quot; the girls said in unison.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Really?&quot; said Stacy, elated.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We were wondering if you’d like to be our new secretary,&quot; said Lynn, a redhead.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We’ve been looking for a replacement for our last one,&quot; said Trixie, a skinny, dark-haired waif with a monotone drawl.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Sure! I’d love to!&quot; said Stacy.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;You’ll need to copy down everything we say during meetings,&quot; Andie said.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Well, not *everything* everything, if you know what I mean,&quot; said Lynn.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I can do that!&quot; exclaimed Stacy.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Great! You’re in, then!&quot; Andie said.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Wow!&quot; said Stacy. &quot;And I didn’t even have to take a test or anything!&quot; she paused, then continued: &quot;But if you don’t mind me asking, what happened to your last secretary?&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Andie, Lynn and Trixie looked back and forth amongst each other uneasily, then agreed to let their new friend know.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;She was stabbed to death,&quot; said Lynn.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"In the back," said Trixie.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The *other* Fashion Club!&quot; the three girls said in unison, hate in their voices. They looked at the bleachers across the yard, where four other girls with extremely well-groomed hair were sitting and chatting.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jane:</B> I don’t think we SENT her, actually. She WANTED to go. The lure of a humiliating Upchuck clip was too much to resist. And he said, no personal appearance, no deal.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TAKIS:</B> "Love at First Slight" was my debut fic. It was written before I had really entered the whole Internet scene, so I wasn't really aware of the whole 'Shipper thing. It also represents an important developmental fic for me in that I was still working on the basics of subplots, character, length, etc. Anyway, this scene featuring Upchuck is set midway through the fic. It was originally intended to express Daria's personal insecurity and possible jealousy of Trent's new girlfriend Doxie. Finishing the scene, I decided it was a bit too contrived and slightly out of character, so I removed it. This scene was replaced with the hallway scene, which involved a slightly more appropriate Daria/Upchuck interaction.</P>
