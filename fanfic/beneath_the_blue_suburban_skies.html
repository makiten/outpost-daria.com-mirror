<br>by Jill Friedman, the LeopardLady
<br>MTV owns Daria. I don't. They don't own this, though.
<br>For timeline's sake, let's assume Penny is 10 years older
<br>than Jane, and 5 years older than Trent, making her 28.
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Scene:</b> INT Lawndale High classroom.
<br>
<br><b>SUPER:</b> Lawndale High, 1988
<br>
<br><i>The camera pans across the students so we see that they're decked out in 80s clothes, acid
wash jeans and all, and a younger looking Penny Lane is sitting looking bored. The camera pans to
the door, as a much younger looking Mr. DeMartino enters the room. Conversation continues until Mr.
DeMartino makes his way to the desk.</i>
<br>
<br><b>DeMartino:</b> <i>(sounding suspiciously like Mr. O'Neill)</i> Hello, class. My name is
Anthony DeMartino, and I'll be your homeroom and history teacher. Please pass this sheet of paper
around and write down your names. The ditto machine is broken, so we don't have proper attendance
sheets yet.
<br>
<br><i>(the class groans, and passes the sheet around. It makes its way back to the front, and Mr.
DeMartino looks at it.)</i>
<br>
<br><b>DeMartino:</b> Ok, everyone. I appreciate the creativity, but I know there's no one called
"Seymor Butts," "Amanda Huggandkiss," "Penny Lane," or "Abby Rhode" in the class, so nice try.
<br>
<br><b>Cut to:</b><i> Penny Lane, as she groans and raises her hand.</i>
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> Uh...I'm Penny Lane.
<br>
<br><i>(The class chuckles, as the camera pans to a small honey-blonde girl raising her hand.)</i>
<br>
<br><b>Girl:</b> And um...I'm Abby Rhode. <i>(She shares a knowing smile with Penny- they were both
cursed with hippie parents. The class totally loses it. Mr. DeMartino looks like a deer in
headlights.)</i>
<br>
<br><b>DeMartino:</b> Oh! I'm sorry. <i>(the bell rings)</i> Ok, class, homeroom is over, <i>(the
class is filing out of the room before the bell is finished ringing)</i> have a nice day, and a
good start to your Senior year at...<i>(the room is empty, DeMartino drops the smile on his
face.)</i> Ah, screw it.
<br>
<br><i>(A piercing buzz comes through, and we see that this was all a dream sequence, and it
ends...now.)</i>
<br>
<br><b>Cut to:</b><i> INT a small hut in Central America.</i>
<br>
<br><b>SUPER:</b> Guatemala, present day
<br><i>A touseled present-day Penny Lane smacks the battery-powered alarm clock down as she rises.
We see her grab a towel and leave the hut, heading for a waterfall. </i>
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> (staring deadpan at the waterfall) I may not be able to drink it, but at least
it'll keep me clean. <i>(sighs)</i> I've gotta get the hell out of here.
<br>
<br><i>(We see only a head shot as she strips and goes under the spray of the waterfall. The
flashback we just left now continues...)</i>
<br>
<br><b>Cut to:</b> <i>INT Lawndale High hallway. Students are still dressed out of Cyndi
Lauper's closet. Penny is at her locker, and Abby walks up to her.</i>
<br>
<br><b>Abby:</b> And I thought only my parents had a sense of humor that sick.
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b><i>(turning to her with a grin)</i> Oh, my parents didn't stop the torture with
me; my little sister's name is Jane.
<br>
<br><b>Abby:</b> Ouch. What kind of drugs were they on?
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> I don't know, I haven't found their stash yet.
<br>
<br><b>Abby:</b> I found my mom's a year ago, but...it's almost kicked. <i>(Penny raises an eyebrow
in that trademark Lane way.)</i> Yes, Penny, that was an invitation.
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> Well, at least we're getting to the marijuana interest nice and early.
<br>
<br><b>Abby:</b><i>(shrugging)</i> Just laying the cards on the table.
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> I appreciate it. Oh, you'll probably like to know that my parents are almost
never home. Most of the time it's me, and my little brother and sister, Trent and Jane. The elder
Lanes have scattered to parts unknown, and I don't much care.
<br>
<br><b>Abby:</b> Cool. <i>(beat)</i> I think.
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> Jane's a little young for it, but what can you do?
<br>
<br><b>Abby:</b> Well, we still have to finish high school, so...
<br>
<br><b>Cut to:</b> <i>EXT the waterfall. Penny is wrapped in a towel and is making her way back to
the hut. She freezes when she sees a jaguar marauding her home. (such as it is)</i>
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b><i>(exasperated)</i> That's it, I'm leaving.
<br>
<br><b>Cut to:</b><i> A few days later. Penny is at a small, beaten up airport in Guatemala with a
backpack and a duffel bag. She is at a very old-fashioned pay phone, attempting to call home.</i>
<br>
<br><b>Cut to:</b><i> INT Trent's room, he's asleep, and doesn't notice the duck phone quacking
away.</i>
<br><b>Cut to:</b><i> INT Jane's room, she's not there, so no one answers.</i>
<br><b>Cut to:</b><i>INT the kitchen. No one's there.</i>
<br><b>Cut to:</b><i>INT the Guatemalan airport. Penny slams the phone down in frustration.</i>
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> Dammit! Oh well, guess I'll just show up like I did last time.
<br>
<br><b>BG Music:</b> "Homeward Bound," as covered by Moxy Früvous
<br><b>Cut to:</b><i>INT a really shabby plane. Penny is trying to sleep fitfully.</i>
<br><b>Cut to:</b> <i>Later, Penny is trying to read, but a shipment of chickens is clucking in her
ears.</i>
<br><b>Cut to:</b><i> INT another backwater airport, this time in Haiti. She tries to call home
again, but with the same luck as last time.</i>
<br><b>Cut to:</b><i> INT a nice airport, this time in Puerto Rico. Penny tries calling again, but
again to no avail.</i>
<br><b>Cut to:</b><i> EXT Casa Lane, a cab pulls up and Penny gets out.</i>
<br><b>End BG music</b>
<br>
<br><i>Penny walks up and fishes around her bags for a key. Not finding one, she looks under the
mat, and doesn't find one there either.</i>
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> Dammit.
<br>
<br><i>She tries the doorbell and it doesn't work.</i>
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> Oh for the love of...
<br>
<br><i>Just as she raises her hand to knock, the door opens to Jane, dressed for jogging.</i>
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> Penny!
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> Jane!
<br>
<br><i>(The two sisters hug.)</i>
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> What are you doing home? Another volcano? Tropical storm, perhaps?
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> Not really...I just...got tired of the jungle. Figured I'd come home for a while.
You go on your jog, I need a shower. When you get back, we'll sit down and have some coffee, ok?
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> You bring some back with you?
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> Damn straight, I did. Picked it myself, too.
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> Guatemala, right?
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> Yeah, now go on! Coffee waits for no woman!
<br><i>(The two sisters grin at each other as Jane turns and jogs off.)</i>
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b><i>(walking in the house, talking to herself)</i> Well, she's still more like me
than like Summer. Thank God for small mercies...
<br>
<br><b>Trent:</b><i> (barely awake, not really aware of who it was who said that)</i> Who's more
like you than Summer?
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> Trent!
<br>
<br><b>Trent:</b><i> (becoming more aware)</i> Penny! <i>(the two hug)</i> How are you?
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> Dirty. And tired. I'm hitting the showers, and then I'm making coffee.
<br>
<br><b>Trent:</b> Cool. Guatemalan?
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b><i>(walking away)</i> Yeah...
<br>
<br><b>Cut to:</b><i> EXT Jane jogging</i>
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b><i>(thought VO)</i> God, I hope Penny's return doesn't spark another mass
un-exodus like the last time she was home. That was maddening. She seemed really frazzled, I wonder
if she's gotten disillusioned with the Zapatistas or whoever she's rooting for these days...
<br><i>(Jane turns a corner and starts jogging up Glen Oaks Drive and sees Daria about to leave the
house)</i>
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> Yo! Daria!
<br>
<br><b>Daria:</b> Hey, Jane.
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> Penny's home.
<br>
<br><b>Daria:</b> Oh really. Should I dust off the manger?
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> Not yet. It may only be her, for all I know. I hope. You're up early.
<br>
<br><b>Daria:</b> So are you.
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> <i>(shrugging)</i> It's still hot out, so I like to jog before it gets too bad.
What's your excuse?
<br>
<br><b>Daria:</b> I have a history paper to research, so I was about to head over to the library.
Want me to drop you back home? <i>(Daria shakes car keys in the air.)</i>
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> No thanks, I'll see you later. <i>(She jogs off)</i>
<br>
<br><b>Daria:</b> <i>to herself)</i> I'll give mom the heads up that some of the Prodigal Lanes are
returning...
<br>
<br><i>(we see Quinn exit through the front door, and then close it behind her. She has a backpack,
and is carrying more books and papers in her arms.)</i>
<br>
<br><b>Daria:</b> I don't see why we have to go this early. It *is* open until 7:30, you know.
<br>
<br><b>Quinn:</b> The earlier we go, the less people who see me.
<br>
<br><b>Daria:</b> Uh-huh. Get in the car and let's go.
<br>
<br><i>(Quinn and Daria get in the car, Quinn takes out the baseball cap and glasses we saw in
"Quinn the Brain" and puts on her "incognito" outfit. Daria raises an eyebrow at this, then
shrugs.)</i>
<br>
<br><b>Quinn:</b> Drive.
<br>
<br><b>Daria:</b> <i>(sarcastic/bitter)</i> Yes'm Ms. Quinn...
<br>
<br>Cut to: INT Penny's room. She's unpacking a bit, presumably looking for the promised Guatemalan
coffee. As she continues searching, we get another flashback.
<br>
<br>Cut to:<i> INT Lawndale High gymnasium. Penny and Abby are in the blue and yellow PE uniform,
but Abby is wearing a hoodie sweatshirt over it. They are sitting out, looking at a note from
"Amanda Lane" that sits between them, but it's clear from their giggles that Penny wrote it
herself. </i>
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> I can't believe Ms. Morris bought it...oh well. No more gym for the rest of the
school year!
<br>
<br><b>Abby:</b> This is so cool. I hate PE.
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> Doesn't everyone? Phaugh, it's hot in here. <i>(Penny tugs at her shirt)</i>
<br>
<br><b>Abby:</b> <i>(nervous)</i> Uh..is it? Hadn't noticed.
<br>
<br>Penny: Yeah. Jesus, Abby, take that sweatshirt off, you're making me hot just looking at you!
<br>
<br><b>Abby:</b> No, it's ok.
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> Oh, come on! <i>Penny reaches for Abby's sleeve.)</i>
<br>
<br><b>Abby:</b> <i>(violently)</i> I said NO! <i>(all activity in the gym stops, and everyone
turns to look at Abby. She tears up and runs away.)</i>
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> Abby! Come back! I didn't mean... <i>(everyone's now staring at Penny, she glares
back)</i> What! <i>(to herself)</i> Ah, hell... <i>(Penny runs after Abby.)</i>
<br>
<br>Cut to:<i> INT Girls' locker room. Abby has taken the shirt off, and we see bruises all up and
down her arms. We see the door open, and Penny come through, but Abby doesn't notice. Penny walks
closer, and sees the bruises. Her eyes widen, and she walks back to the door and opens it more
loudly.</i>
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> Abby? You in here?
<br>
<br><i>(Abby sniffs and pulls the sweatshirt back on)</i>
<br>
<br><b>Abby:</b> Yeah, I'm over here.
<br>
<br><i>(Penny walks over carefully, knowing she's on dangerous ground.)</i>
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> You ok, hon?
<br>
<br><b>Abby:</b> Fine, why? <i>(She has a challenging look in her eyes that says, "What do you
know, because I'm not talking.")</i>
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> Uh...you just ran screaming out of the gym because you wouldn't take your
sweatshirt off.
<br>
<br><b>Abby:</b> <i>(sadly)</i> Oh. That. It'll never happen again.
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> Abby, please talk to me, what's going on?
<br>
<br><b>Abby:</b> <i>(making a decision)</i> I...um...<i>(sighs)</i> My mom found out I've been
smoking her stash, and she beat me. <i>(wincing)</i> And then my stepdad joined in.
<br>
<br><i>(Penny is dumbstruck. Seeing the bruises was one thing, hearing the story was another.)</i>
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> Oh God...Abby, I'm sorry. <i>(She starts to hug Abby tenatively)</i>
<br>
<br><b>Abby:</b> Don't! Ow. Please. I appreciate it but...ow. She got both shoulders this time--
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> THIS TIME?!? Abby, how long has this been going on?
<br>
<br><b>Abby:</b> For as long as I can remember. My dad used to beat both of us, so she divorced
him. Things were better for a little while after that but...they got worse again. When she married
Mr. Congeniality, they stopped being good at all.
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> Why didn't you tell me? I could have...I... <i>(sighs)</i>
<br>
<br><b>Abby:</b> Who could I tell? Who could you turn to for help that I didn't already think of?
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> I don't know...I...sorry.
<br>
<br><b>Abby:</b> Well, there's no one TO tell, so don't, ok?
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> <i>(sighing)</i> Ok. <i>(changing the subject)</i> Let's get dressed and blow
this popsicle stand. There's only two more periods left, anyway. We could go to the movies?
<br>
<br><b>Abby:</b> Sure. Let's jet.
<br>
<br>Cut to:<i> EXT Casa Lane, Jane is jogging up the block. She reaches into her sock and pulls out
a key and lets herself in. The camera follows her as she walks in the house, sniffing loudly.</i>
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> Yo, Penny! Where's that coffee?
<br>
<br>Penny: <i>(coming down the stairs with a small burlap bag in hand)</i> Right here, Jane. I had
trouble finding it.
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> Ah. Well, now I have time for a shower. <i>(passes Penny and starts up the
stairs)</i> The grinder's in the pantry.
<br>
<br>Penny: Ah, so that's where you keep it these days.
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> Funny.
<br>
<br>Cut to:<i> INT the upstairs hallway. Trent is standing in his doorway, waiting for Jane.</i>
<br>
<br><b>Trent:</b> Hey.
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> Yo.
<br>
<br><b>Trent:</b> Coffee ready yet?
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> Nope, she has to grind it first. So what do you think brought her home?
<br>
<br><b>Trent:</b> Huh?
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> She hates the US. She hates home. There's gotta be a reason she's here.
<br>
<br><b>Trent:</b> Whatever it is, she ain't talkin'.
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> She never did say much. Then she graduated, and pfft, south of the border she
went.
<br>
<br><b>Trent:</b> She was always a loner. Wind and Summer stuck together, and it was always you and
me.
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> Did she ever hang out with anyone else?
<br>
<br><b>Trent:</b> There was some blonde...Abby, I think her name was.
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> Well, no matter, Abby's not here. Penny'll tell us what's up if she wants to. I
won't press her.
<br>
<br><i>(Trent cocks an eyebrow)</i>
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> Well, not too badly, anyway. *sniffs* Oooh...coffee's brewing. I'll be right out.
<i>(Jane heads into the bathroom)</i>
<br>
<br>Cut to:<i> INT Lane kitchen. Trent wanders in, sniffing.</i>
<br>
<br><b>Trent:</b> Smells good, Penny.
<br>
<br>Penny: Thanks. Uh...why don't you go into the living room, and I'll bring you a mug when the
coffee's done?
<br>
<br><b>Trent:</b> <i>(taking the hint)</i> Ok, sure.
<br>
<br><i>(He turns and leaves. Penny turns around and leans over the counter and sighs heavily.)</i>
<br>
<br>Cut to:<i> EXT the parking lot of Lawndale Library. Daria parks the car, and she and Quinn get
out. As they head for the library, Jamie's BMW swings into the lot.</i>
<br>
<br><b>Quinn:</b> Ohmigod!
<br>
<br><b>Daria:</b> What?
<br>
<br><b>Quinn:</b> It's...Je...Ju...Jer...Jamie! <i>(she turns tail and tries to run)</i>
<br>
<br><b>Daria:</b> <i>(grabbing her shoulders)</i> No, Quinn, we're going inside.
<br>
<br><b>Quinn:</b> But...but...he'll see me!
<br>
<br><b>Daria:</b> No one will see you. We'll go into the back in a corner, and no one will find us.
I do it all the time.
<br>
<br><b>Quinn:</b> But people will be LOOKING for me!
<br>
<br><b>Daria:</b> What are you, a fugitive?
<br>
<br><b>Quinn:</b> No, but I'm POP- er...easily recognizable!
<br>
<br><b>Daria:</b> <i>(sighing)</i> I'll tell you what. We'll go in, then you give me your list of
books, and I'll get them for you. That way you won't have to leave the corner.
<br>
<br><b>Quinn:</b> <i>(confused look)</i> List? Of books?
<br>
<br><b>Daria:</b> *PLEASE* tell you have a list of books.
<br>
<br><b>Quinn:</b> Uh...no?
<br>
<br><b>Daria:</b> <i>(sighing again)</i> Let's go...
<br>
<br>Cut to:<i> INT Lane living room. Jane is coming down the stairs in clean clothes.</i>
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> Penny, I tell you, that coffee smells WONDERFUL!
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> Nothing better than fresh grown.
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> Hell no.
<br>
<br><i>(Penny looks around the room and her eyes fall on a stack of what appear to be postcards in
the corner.)</i>
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> What's that in the corner? Cards from Mom and Dad?
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> Neither. We actually don't know who they're from. They've been coming for years,
and they're in some sort of code-
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> <i>(suspicious panic)</i> CODE?!? What's the name on the address?
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> Lumma Lane, why?
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> <i>(Penny goes white as a sheet)</i> LUMMA?!?!? Oh *shit*.
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> What?
<br>
<br><b>Trent:</b> Penny? Are you okay?
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> No, I'm not ok! Those cards are for me!
<br>
<br><b>Trent:</b> But your name is...
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> I know what my name is! It's in
<a name=1r>CODE!</a>

<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> Calm down, we had no idea.
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> Why didn't you tell me about them the last time I was home?
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> I tried, but I couldn't get near you! I got so fed up with everyone being here,
and I went to Daria's. By then I forgot...I'm sorry.
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> <i>(heavy sigh)</i> Shit. Whatever. Fine. <i>(walks over to the stack of cards
and picks them up)</i> If you'll excuse me, I have some reading to catch up on... <i>(she walks
away, leaving Trent and Jane staring after her.)</i>
<br>BG Music: "3 Speed"-The Eels
<br>
<br><b>Trent:</b> Whoa.
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> This can't be good.
<br>
<br>Cut to:<i> INT Penny's room. She's gone to the bottom of the pile and is staring at a card.</i>
<br>
<br>Cut to:<i> the card. We see that it is indeed in code.</i>

paper and sets to work decoding)</i>
<br>
<br>Cut to:<i> flashback INT Penny's room. Penny and Abby are sitting on the floor talking. BG
music continues. </i>
<br>
<br><b>Abby:</b> <i>(rolling up a sleeve)</i> She did it again last night.
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> Oh god. What now?
<br>
<br><b>Abby:</b> She found out we went to the Zen last week. How she knew, I'll never find out.
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> Yeah, you stayed over here afterwards.
<br>
<br><b>Abby:</b> The only way...oh SHIT.
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> What?
<br>
<br><b>Abby:</b> The only way she could have known is if she read my diary. Bloody hell, I'm lucky
I got away with this one bruise...
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> Yeah, no kidding.
<br>
<br><b>Abby:</b> Hell.
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> Now what?
<br>
<br><b>Abby:</b> <i>(idea filtering through)</i> Well...why not write in a code? That way if my mom
or the teachers ever read stuff we write, it'll be unintelligible.

can tell she's in total shock from this find.</i>
<br>
<br>Penny: <i>(muttering)</i> Ten years...I can't believe...wow. <i>(sighs)</i>
<br>
<br>Cut to:<i> INT Lawndale Library. Daria and Quinn are at a table strewn with papers and books,

must make.
<br>
<br><b>Quinn:</b> I'm really enjoying History this year.
<br>
<br><b>Daria:</b> Yeah, DeMartino's a good teacher, as long as you don't drive him crazy.
<br>
<br><b>Quinn:</b> I'd hate to see what he's done to Kevin and Brittany.
<br>
<br><b>Daria:</b> It's actually pretty funny.
<br>
<br><b>Quinn:</b> <i>(businesslike)</i> Ok, so I have a lot of info on the Haight-Ashbury, New York
City, and Detroit in 1967. I haven't found any stuff on other places. Or at least <i>(almost
bitter)</i> none that this crappy library has.
<br>
<br><b>Daria:</b> No kidding. Although, you don't get any better information than from primary
sources.
<br>
<br><b>Quinn:</b> Primary sources? Like an autobiography or an interview or something?
<br>
<br><b>Daria:</b> Yeah.
<br>

was an idiot the way only 13-year-old boys can be, and you were eight. And then Abby left.
<br>

<br>

she went, and her Mom wouldn't answer any questions. She'd slam the door in my face and hang up on

too.
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> And so the Lane wanderlust lived on.
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> Yeah, something like that. I bummed around the States for a while, but nowhere
felt right. When I finally got down to Texas, the next obvious move was Mexico. Suddenly, four
years of high school Spanish made sense. Anyway, once I was south of the border, a lot of stuff
made more sense. My art, my interest in craftwork, all of it. I stopped caring so much about what
had happened to Abby, and about what was going on in the world around me. The best part of Mexico
and Central America is that if you get bored with one crusade, a short bus trip and you can find a
whole new one. God, that sounds awful, but...being a <i>gringa</i> trying to fight for a cause
didn't always work.
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> Wow, you must've seen some crazy stuff.
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> Yeah. I'd trade it all to know where Abby is, though. <i>(can't talk about it
anymore, sighing)</i> But enough about me, what's going on in your little corner of the world?
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> Well, it's not half as interesting, but...I was going out with this really great
guy up until the spring.
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> What happened?
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> He ran to Daria.
<br>
<br><b>Penny:</b> Daria? The friend of yours Trent told me about?
<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> Yeah. Her.
<br>

whole thing rather than the fact of it.
<br>

<br>
<br><b>Jane:</b> Huh?
<br>

on as tight as you can. <i>(close to tears again)</i> I wish I had...

you won't be marked ABSENT from the meeting.
<br>
<br><b>Quinn:</b> <i>(without thinking)</i> You're taking ATTENDANCE now?
<br>
<br><b>Sandi:</b> Well, Quinn, we thought we had to do SOMETHING to make you be more attentive.
After the way you've been acting lately, we thought the only way we could make you come was by
making it more like SCHOOL. Or is your foray into BRAININESS just a phase?

<br>

<br>
<br><b>Daria:</b> So why are you still hanging out with them?
<br>
