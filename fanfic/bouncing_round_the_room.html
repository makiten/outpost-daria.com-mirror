< 
P>Disclaimer: I do not own Daria and all characters related 
and
pertaining to the show, simple enough.</P>

<P>Rating: oh why not 
PG-13, a well-earned PG-13.</P>

<P>Summary: Yet another new student 
shows up in Lawndale, how
will this alter the slippery dynamics 
present at everyone's favorite
fictitious high school? Inquiring 
minds want to know.</P>

<P>Spoiler Warnings:. Despite what you might 
think, this was not
written after Is it Fall Yet?, well not all of it 
anyway. So despite
some rather Superficial comparisons in characters, 
plots etc&#133;this
is an entirely creative work that has nothing to 
do with what
Eichler and Co. wrought&#133;gee am I sounding a little 
too defensive
yet?</P>

<P>Soundtrack: Phish 2000-05-22, Radio City 
Music Hall, more on
this at the end.</P>

<P>&quot;I awoke and 
faintly bouncing round the room the echo
of whomever 
spoke.&quot;</P>

<P>Bouncing 'Round the Room</P>

<P>A Monday 
morning as unremarkable from any other greeted Daria
when she awoke. 
The sound of running water emanating from the
bathroom was enough for 
her to guess that Quinn had beaten her
to the shower. &quot;Well, I 
can get another twenty minutes of
sleep at least,&quot; Daria 
murmured to herself as she rolled
over and shut her eyes. When she 
reawakened the bathroom was silent
so she dragged herself out of bed 
and braced herself in preparation
of another school 
day.</P>

<P>Daria met Jane at the main entrance of the high school, 
&quot;Hey.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hey, so, what's new with 
you?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Not much, spent last night writing that 
silly essay for
Mr. O'Neil while Quinn was trying to explain to my 
parents that
she needs a three-way mirror installed in her 
room.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What's the big deal about 
that?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;In her brand new walk-in 
closet?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Lovely, hey did you hear the news, 
there's going to be
fresh meat for the sausage grinder called 
Lawndale we all know
and love.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Tom finally 
convinced his parents to let him transfer?&quot;
The friends walked 
into the school as they continued their 
conversation.</P>

<P>&quot;Sadly no, it seems that this new kid just 
moved in.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria considered this, &quot;And just where 
does this intelligence
come from if I may ask?&quot;</P>

<P>Jane 
shrugged, &quot;I overheard some folks talking about it
while I was 
waiting for a certain someone to show up for school.&quot;
Jane 
punctuated the comment by staring pointedly at 
Daria.</P>

<P>&quot;What can I say, Quinn beat me to the 
bathroom.&quot;
She paused, &quot;Come to think of it my mom did 
mention something
about a possible new client yesterday, assuming 
we're talking
about the same family here they are 
rich.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Ah, another child of privilege, you can 
never have too
many of them.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Indeed,&quot; They 
stopped in front of Daria's locker,
&quot;Well, assuming Schroedinger 
was right the new kid is currently
inhabiting two states, intolerable 
and annoying.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Ms. Schroedinger I think your cat 
just died. Check it
out.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria looked in the direction 
Jane indicated and saw an unfamiliar
person walking down the hall. He 
was of average height and build
with close cropped yet unruly brown 
hair. He was wearing a pair
of khaki cargo pants, a slightly battered 
looking flannel shirt
and a white t-shirt with a stylized rendering 
of the word &quot;Phish.&quot;
As he moved down the hall, he 
exchanged the sunglasses that he
had been wearing in favor of a pair 
of wire-rimmed glasses; the
sunglasses he deposited in the breast 
pocketof his shirt.</P>

<P>&quot;Hmm,&quot; Jane mused, &quot;Looks 
like Outsidersville's
population just increased by 
one.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;We'll soon find out, it looks like the 
fashion police
are on the case.&quot; Daria nodded in the direction 
of the Fashion
Club who was observing the 
newcomer.</P>

<P>&quot;Hey, mind if I ask you a question?&quot; 
Daria jumped
slightly at the voice behind her. She turned and found 
the new
student standing in front of her.</P>

<P>&quot;You can, but 
I don't guarantee any satisfaction with
the answers 
provided.&quot;</P>

<P>The boy chuckled, &quot;Fair enough, I just 
need some directions,
where is&#133;&quot; He fished out piece of 
paper from a pocket,
&quot;Ms. Li's 
office?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That's easy, down that hall to you 
right.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Just follow the sounds of civil liberties 
being squashed
or the surveillance camera wires, either works.&quot; 
Jane shrugged
her shoulders, &quot;So, what's your name and your 
story, and
tells us the truth. We have ways of knowing when you lie. 
And
you don't want to lie to us, it won't be 
pretty.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I'll have to keep that in mind, but right 
now I'm kinda
late for that appointment, so if you two don't 
mind?&quot; He
nodded to Daria and Jane then left. &quot;Oh, by the 
way, the
name's Dave, Dave Wylie.&quot;</P>

<P>As Dave walked down 
the hall Daria and Jane discussed his merits,
&quot;Hard to say 
really, he didn't give us much of a chance to
get a bead on 
him.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;A riddle, wrapped in an enigma, tied up in a 
conundrum
alright,&quot; Daria concurred. She sighed, &quot;come on, 
we're
going to be late for class.&quot; Daria walked off towards 
the
classroom, Jane in tow.</P>

<P>&quot;And that would be a bad 
thing because?&quot;</P>

<P>As Daria and Jane walked past the 
Fashion Club, they to were
discussing Dave's 
arrival.</P>

<P>&quot;Flannel? Whatever was he thinking? This isn't 
Seattle,
grunge is so out.&quot; Sandi disapproved of the new 
arrival's
choice of wardrobe.</P>

<P>&quot;But his pants were kind 
of fashionable, and he is sort
of cute...in an odd retro-loser 
way.&quot; Quinn was mostly arguing
the point to disagree with 
Sandi</P>

<P>&quot;Quinn, grunge is not retro yet, we're still in 
70's retro,
and after that there is 80's retro, and then 90's 
retro.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh Sandi, you're always so good at knowing 
when fashion
trends will hit.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;As Fashion Club 
president it is my duty to stay on top
of such 
things.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What was up with that t-shirt he was 
wearing you guys?
I don't recognize any label by the called Phish, 
ohmygosh, I'm
slipping in my fashion know-how, pretty soon I won't be 
able to
tell Hilfiger apart from Levis!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Calm down 
Stacy, there is no such thing as a Phish line
of clothes.&quot; Sandi 
tried to calm the secretary down before
she had a full-blown panic 
attack.</P>

<P>&quot;Then what is it? And why would you wear it on a 
shirt?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I don't know, Quinn, as Vice President it 
is your duty
to investigate this matter and report back to us. Also, 
find out
if he is date-worthy or not, though I doubt that very 
much.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn frowned. &quot;Sure thing Sandi, I'll do it 
over lunch.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Do you think retro would make me look 
fat?&quot; Tiffany
wondered aloud as the other three walked off to 
their respective
classes.</P>

<P>During lunch, Daria and Jane were 
discussing the points of
interest of the morning, since there were 
none the conversation
drifted to Dave.</P>

<P>&quot;My sources tell 
me that he's a senior who's bounced around
from school to school, for 
reasons best left unsaid.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Are these the same 
sources that told you that Mr. DeMartino
would be gone the day he 
gave us that pop quiz? Or the ones that
claimed Ms. Li was an android 
sent back to our time from the future
in order to ensure that the 
Brave New World Order comes to pass?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The jury is 
still out on that second one I'd like to
add.&quot; Jane and Daria 
returned to their meal.</P>

<P>&quot;Hey, mind if I join you 
two?&quot; The pair looked up
to see Dave standing by their table, 
tray in hand.</P>

<P>&quot;Last I checked this was still a nominally 
free country,
so I'm not going to stop you.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave sat 
down and regarded the food on his tray, &quot;Your
invitation was 
about as inviting as this food.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's best if you 
don't think of it as food, that only
encourages it.&quot; Jane 
remarked.</P>

<P>Dave took a bite, then grimaced, &quot;I see, so, 
any other
helpful hints for survival?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Do nothing 
to draw attention to yourself, and just remember
it all ends 
sometime.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave considered Daria's comment, 
&quot;Okay,&quot; Seeing that
was he was going to get he moved on to 
another topic. &quot;So,
uh, you two know my name, how about 
yours?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;My mother told me to never tell strangers 
that. It's
not my fault if you slipped up and I'm under no obligation 
to
do likewise.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And yet you let him sit at our 
table and converse with
us.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Helen never said 
anything that excluded that.&quot; Still
no names were 
forthcoming.</P>

<P>Jane took pity on Dave, &quot;I'm Jane Lane and 
my cheery compadre
is Daria Morgendorffer. Welcome to 
Lawndale.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The city so repressed it has no 
statistics.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave regarded Daria quizzically, &quot;Is 
she always like this?&quot;
He asked Jane.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, this is 
one of her good days, feel lucky. So, how
are you adjusting to life 
at Lawndale?&quot;</P>

<P>He shrugged, &quot;Okay I guess, I still 
haven't been to a
class yet, Li has me taking all these 
placement/aptitude tests.
I think this afternoon I have to meet with 
a&#133;Mason, Manson?
Something like that.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's 
Manson, though we haven't been able to prove it,
we think she gets 
her therapy strategy from the Manson 
family.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Damn, you are 
sour.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What can I say, I'm the 'misery chick' of 
Lawndale.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, cool.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Cool, 
that's all you have to say?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, sure, you've 
got your thing going, and you seem
to enjoy it, so 
cool.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh&#133;&quot; An awkward silence fell over 
the table.</P>

<P>&quot;I know, can you two give me the lowdown on 
who's who
and what's what at this place? Just so I don't make any 
heinous
faux-pas and end up on somebody's hit 
list.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well sure, but why 
us?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Cause you're both outsiders, Jane here is 
probably so
some kind of artistic type. Therefore, she's probably 
always looking
just to find her next subject. Now you, Daria, get 
your kicks
by witnessing the banality and stupidity of others so 
you're always
keeping your eyes open around here just for your own 
amusement.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Most impressive, we have a Mulder in 
our midst, and just
how can you tell that I am the 'artistic type' 
Mr. Wylie?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The paint stains on your hands for one 
thing.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane looked down at the traces of paint on her 
hands, &quot;Oh
yeah, bad day. I don't think we need to ask how you 
deduced Daria's
favorite hobby. It is obvious isn't it? So, anyway 
here at Lawndale
you have your usual collection of jocks, pretty 
people and assorted
riff-raff. Over there's the football team,&quot; 
She pointed over
to a table where Kevin was entertaining his fellow 
teammates with
a bad impersonation of Mr. 
DeMartino.</P>

<P>&quot;Why is that guy wearing his 
uniform?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That's Kevin, he's 'the QB.' Do not try 
to understand
his logic, madness lies that way, too many blows to the 
head.
Moving along, over there is Jodie and Mack,&quot; Jane 
indicated
the pair, &quot;Jodie is Ms. Perfect and Mack's the captain 
of
the football team, nice enough people really.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave 
looked around the rest of the cafeteria, &quot;Are they
the only 
minority students in the whole school?</P>

<P>&quot;Unfortunately 
for them, pretty much yes. And they have
to pay for it with 
overwhelming amounts of faux-sensitivity on
the part of the rest of 
the school.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Gotcha, I know just how to deal with 
that, I'll be right
back.&quot; He got up and walked over to where 
Jodie and Mack
where sitting.</P>

<P>&quot;No good can come of 
this.&quot; Daria sighed.</P>

<P>&quot;A white-boy trying to be down 
with the homies, nope this
is trouble.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Should we 
stop him?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Why bother, it's the only way he can 
learn.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave stopped in front of Jodie and Mack, 
&quot;Hey, I'm Dave,
the new guy and I just thought I'd go around and 
start introducing
myself to people, you know, get a feel for the 
school dynamics
and stuff and you two are?&quot; He extended a hand 
to Mack.</P>

<P>&quot;Michael Mackenzie, but everyone calls me 
Mack.&quot;
He shook Dave's hand.</P>

<P>&quot;Jodie Landon, 
Vice-President of the Student Government,
you wouldn't be interested 
in joining any extra-curricular activities
would you?&quot; She also 
shook Dave's hand.</P>

<P>&quot;Maybe, I'll let you know once I get 
a handle on my schedule.
Nice meeting you two, I'll see you 
around.&quot; He waved and
walked back over to Daria and Jane's 
table.</P>

<P>&quot;So that's how you 'deal with minorities' 
eh?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What, treat them like everyone else? Yeah 
sure, what
did you think I was going to try out my Ebonics with them 
or something?&quot;</P>

<P>Jane smiled, &quot;You know, I kind of 
like you, but don't
think the jury isn't still out with 
you.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave chuckled, &quot;Ok, will you let me know when 
a verdict
is reached?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Sure thing, now, to 
continue, that island over there
unto herself is Andrea, if you just 
let her be there won't be
any bloodshed, &quot;Dave raised his 
eyebrows at this comment
but let Jane continue. &quot;The troll over 
there hitting on the
ladies is 'Upchuck.' And if you're wondering, 
don't ask about
any of the seniors, they are a group apart and don't 
want to associate
with those below them.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave scowled, 
&quot;It doesn't matter, I'm not a senior.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria looked 
up from her meal in surprise, &quot;What, but
we heard,&quot; she 
gave Jane a sideways glance. &quot;Er, we
thought you 
were.&quot;</P>

<P>He sighed, &quot;So did I, and I should be, but 
my last school
was really bad, so I took a semester's worth of 
classes at a nearby
college. So the first thing Li says to me is that 
college credit
can't count towards a Lawndale diploma, so I'm a 
junior again.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That is so typically Lawndale, who 
cares if you were
getting a better, more useful education, it wasn't 
the Lawndale
way so forget it.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Are you going to 
do an6ything about it? I know a great
place to get some really juicy 
photos of Ms. Li.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That's all right, I won't fight 
this battle. It probably
wouldn't be the best way to start things off 
here and hell, so
I'm high school a little longer, I still have the 
college credit,
it really doesn't matter much to me.&quot; He 
shrugged.</P>

<P>&quot;I still say a little revenge is in 
order,&quot; Jane
began diagramming a plot for Dave to 
try.</P>

<P>Quinn entered the cafeteria and started looking for 
Dave. When
she saw him talking to Daria and Jane she nearly turned 
around
and left. &quot;Suck it up Quinn, you've got to do this or 
Sandi
will accuse you of not living up to your duties.&quot; She 
squared
her shoulders and resolutely walked over to the 
table.</P>

<P>Daria was the first to notice Quinn, &quot;Oh look 
who's coming,
this should be fun.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave looked up and 
got his first real look at Quinn, &quot;Wow,
who's the 
hottie?&quot;</P>

<P>Before Daria could answer Quinn swept up to the 
table and began
her interrogation. &quot;Hi there, my name's Quinn 
Morgendorffer&#133;.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Morgendorffer, you two 
wouldn't happen to be related
would you?&quot; Dave chuckled when 
Quinn tried to drown out Daria's
reply. &quot;Okay, I get it. Carry 
on.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn glared at Daria. &quot;Anyway, as I was 
saying before
my cousin so rudely interrupted me. I'm Vice President 
of the
Fashion Club and so it is my duty to welcome new students to 
Lawndale.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave leaned back in his chair, &quot;Well, 
that's mighty generous
of you, why don't you pull a seat and you can 
tell me all about
this club of yours.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria made a 
disgusted face and started to leave. Jane stopped
her, &quot;Don't go 
yet,&quot; she whispered, &quot;I want to
see where this 
goes.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn looked hesitant at accepting Dave's offer 
but finally
caved in and sat in the proffered chair. &quot;Well, 
okay, see
the Fashion Club is dedicated to improving the fashion 
sense of
Lawndale.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Please, tell me, how do you 
accomplish this oh so worthy
goal?&quot;</P>

<P>Daria looked at 
Jane, &quot;Is he being sarcastic?&quot;</P>

<P>Jane looked at Daria 
in surprise, &quot;You mean you can't
tell 
either?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn ignored Daria and Jane's commentary, 
&quot;Mostly through
example, we take daily trips to Cashman's and 
make sure to always
wear the latest fashions, that way the less 
fortunate can know
what to wear.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I see, well, 
what brings you here?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Like I said before silly, 
to welcome you to Lawndale,
also to ask you a few questions.&quot; 
She took a pencil and piece
of paper out of her pocket.&quot; 
&quot;Okay, let's start with
your wardrobe, what kind of shoes are 
those?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave raised a leg and rested his foot on the 
table, &quot;Vasque
Clarions, a good all around hiking 
boot.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn looked a little dubious at this statement 
but continued,
&quot;Now the pants are Abercrombie khaki's 
right?&quot;</P>

<P>He nodded, &quot;That's what my grandmother said 
when she gave
them to me.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave's flippancy was not 
amusing Quinn, &quot;Well Abercrombie
is still Abercrombie. How about 
that shirt, is Phish a new design
label, and if so, does Cashman's 
carry it?&quot;</P>

<P>Now it was Dave's turn to act perplexed, 
&quot;Phish, design
label, wha? Oh, oh, the shirt. No, no.&quot; He 
started to laugh.
&quot;Phish is a band I like, I got this shirt at 
one of their
concerts and like to wear it every now and 
then.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn frowned, &quot;A band, ewww, I've never 
heard of them.
That reminds me, you do know the grunge scene dies 
years ago.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The grunge scene what does 
that&#133;&quot; Dave fingered
his flannel shirt, &quot;Oh, my 
flannel, an LL Bean original.
I've had it for 
years.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Whatever, lets see, so far the only thing 
in your favor
are your pants, you're not doing to well 
here.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What about my Ray-Bans?&quot; He asked 
pulling them out
of his shirt pocket. &quot;Don't they count for 
something.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;They just counter the fact that you 
have to wear normal
glasses as well. Just a few more questions more 
for formality's
sake than anything else. What kind of car do you 
drive?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I just got a new, fully loaded Volkswagen 
Beetle. Plus
if I'm real good my dad occasionally lets me take his 
Porsche
out for a spin.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh,&quot; she paused, 
&quot;those new Beetles are cute
cars. What color is 
it?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Uh bright blue.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Ah well, 
it's still a cute car, and access to a Porsche
is a definite plus. 
What kind of job do you have and how much
does it 
pay?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave flashed Quinn a smug smile. &quot;I'm the 
chief content
editor for my dad's teen oriented website, 
'TeenzBeetz.com.' As
for how much money,&quot; he shrugged, &quot;I 
have no idea, most
of it is either on paper only or tied up in trust 
funds. All I
know is that I never hit my credit limit and there's 
always cash
available when I go to the ATM. So I'm probably a 
millionaire
or something,&quot; he frowned, &quot;Maybe more than 
that, who
know, its more than I need that's for 
sure.&quot;</P>

<P>Everyone at the table stared at him in surprise. 
Quinn was
the first to speak, &quot;Money, big plus, do you want to 
go out
tonight, you know, on a trial basis?&quot;</P>

<P>He 
shrugged, &quot;Sure, why not.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn handed him a card, 
&quot;Here's my address, pick me up
around 
seven.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Seven it is then, see you then.&quot; He 
rather obviously
watched as she made her way over to the Fashion Club 
table.</P>

<P>&quot;Dave, yo, earth to Dave.&quot; Jane sighed and 
finally
got his attention by tossing a French fry at 
him.</P>

<P>&quot;Huh, what?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I think Daria would 
like to a word with you.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What the hell is wrong 
with you? Why on earth would you
want to go out with Quinn? She's 
vapid, shallow, totally 
self
centered&#133;&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Cute.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Is 
that that all that matters to you?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;At this 
moment? Yes. Now if you'll excuse me I have an
appointment with the 
school appointed shrink.&quot; He picked
up his tray and walked out 
of the cafeteria, tossing the tray
in the nearest trashcan as he 
left.</P>

<P>&quot;Way to go Daria, burn your bridges before they 
get built.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;He's going out on a date with 
Quinn.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;True, and for that he will fry like a pork 
sausage, but
he's new, so cut him some 
slack.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Maybe, but somehow I just don't think any 
slack is deserved.&quot;</P>

<P>Later that night Daria tried to 
start on her homework, but
gave up when the clock read 6:45. Sighing 
she went downstairs
and turned on the TV.</P>

<P>&quot;Meet the chef 
who asked the food critic over for dinner&#133;Gourmet
dining, next 
on Sick Sad World.&quot; Daria rolled her eyes and
picked up the 
newspaper. She could hear Jake and Helen in the
kitchen, each 
carrying on one-sided conversations.</P>

<P>Shortly after seven, the 
doorbell rang. &quot;I'll get it!&quot;
Jake shouted and he rushed 
over to open the door.</P>

<P>&quot;Hi sir, I'm here for 
Quinn.&quot; Daria could hear Dave's
voice.</P>

<P>&quot;Sure thing, 
she's upstairs. Hey, you're new aren't you?
Come on in, I'm Jake 
Morgendorffer.&quot; He led Dave into the
living room. &quot;Helen, 
Quinn's got a new one!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Not much gets by you does 
it Mr. Morgendorffer?&quot;
Dave threw a quick combination of air 
punches of punctuate his
comment.</P>

<P>Jake chuckled, &quot;You've 
got to get up pretty early in the
morning to get anything past ole 
Jake Morgendorffer.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Usually 7:30 
works.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Daria! Hello, I'm Helen Morgendorffer, so 
nice to meet
you.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hi Mrs. Morgendorffer, I'm Dave 
Wylie.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Wylie you say. You wouldn't happen to be 
related to James
Wylie would you?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;He's my 
father.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Goodness Quinn certainly snapped you up 
in a hurry,&quot;
Barely audibly she continued, &quot;And I really 
have to give
her something special in return.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh 
how sweet, mother whoring daughter.&quot; Helen glared
at Daria with 
a killer expression.</P>

<P>&quot;So,&quot; Jake asked, oblivious to 
the interchange between
his daughter and wife, &quot;What brings your 
family to Lawndale?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;My dad wanted to settle down 
someplace quiet and off
the beaten track in the world, Lawndale fit 
the bill.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You wouldn't happen to know if you 
father is looking
for any legal advice?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, I 
think most of his legal work is handled by Wile-E-Co.com's
legal 
team, but beyond that you'd have to ask him 
yourself.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn, who had been listening on the 
conversation the whole
time from upstairs, chose this as her moment 
to make her entrance.
&quot;Hi Dave! Have you met my&#133;family-type 
people?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave nodded, &quot;Yep, we were just talking 
about my dad.&quot;
He chuckled, &quot;Are you set to 
go?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yep, bye mom, dad, I'll be back before 
11.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And you had better this time Quinn or there 
will be serious
repercussions.&quot; The only reply to Helen's threat 
was a closed
door. Just then Helen's phone rang and she walked off 
into the
kitchen to answer it.</P>

<P>Jake turned to Daria; 
&quot;Well he seemed nice.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes, if you consider 
nice to be stinking rich and 
hormonally
driven.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Daria! That's not a nice thing 
to say about person who
holds so much potential 
influence.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria sighed and went back to her 
paper.</P>

<P>The next day Quinn delivered her report on the date 
with Dave
to the fashion club. &quot;And so, in conclusion, even 
though
he might not be the most fashion sensible person in the 
school,
and he does not fit our common conceptions of popular, Dave 
Wylie
does have a lot of money, and because he does, he is 
somewhat
date-worthy. I think I'll have him take me out a couple more 
times
just to make sure.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Thank-you for that 
report Quinn. It's nice to know that
when called upon the members of 
the Fashion Club will perform
their duties in a timely fashion. Now 
moving along to the next
item on our agenda&#133;&quot;</P>

<P>Daria 
and Jane were having a brief conversation on their way
to class, 
&quot;So tell me, did Trent manage to get out of that
pickle 
jar?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Amazingly enough, yes, and there wasn't even 
any permanent
damage to the jar.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Will wonders 
never cease. Oh look, there's the new kid.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Don't 
you mean Dave?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Why should I know what his name 
is?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Beyond him telling you yesterday? No reason 
at all.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave walked past Daria and Jane, &quot;Hey 
ladies.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hi Dave, how's it 
going?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It goes Jane. Just getting settled in with 
this schedule,
where's Mr. DeMartino's room 
anyway?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Just follow us, that's where we're headed 
too.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Cool, what's this fellow 
like?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;High-strung doesn't even being to describe 
it&#133;.&quot;
Jane provided Dave with some points for survival in 
the Lawndale
history class.</P>

<P>During lunch, the threesome 
discussed the all-important happenings
of the morning. &quot;You 
know, I really thought Barch was gonna
try to shove a test tube into 
you in a really uncomfortable place.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You mean in 
the back of a Volkswagen?&quot; Dave smiled
at his own 
joke.</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, confronting her like that is never a good 
idea.&quot;
Daria ignored Dave's flippancy.</P>

<P>&quot;What? I 
just asked if we should also feel a sense of
rage over the fact that 
the US government screwed Linus Pauling
out of the discovery of DNA's 
structure. It only seems fair to
mention that if you're going to 
bring up Watson and Crick's female
colleague who go no credit for 
their findings.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I just like the way you tried to 
appease her.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jane threw up her arms, 
&quot;Marie Curie
was way smarter than Pierre, Jane Goodall is not a 
tramp, Laura
Dern, Helen Hunt, and Jodie Foster were all very 
believable as
scientists.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave pointed his fork at 
Jane, &quot;Hey, it worked didn't
it?&quot;<BR>
</P>

<P>&quot;It 
would have been more effective if you had managed
to name more than 
two actual scientists.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What can I say, chicks 
aren't good at science.&quot;
Jane punched him, &quot;Ow, damn bitch 
go get me some pie.&quot;
Daria punched him, &quot;Okay, okay, I give 
up.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Say Jane,&quot; Daria asked, &quot;You never 
did tell
me, how was that art exhibit you said you and Tom were going 
to
see?&quot;<BR>
</P>

<P>&quot;The exhibit, oh yeah, well, you see, 
we never quite made
it that far.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh 
really.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, his car broke 
down.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You don't say.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I keep 
telling him that his best bet is to just load
the thing up with gas, 
touch it off and then claim it was an accident
to get the insurance 
money.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Maybe you could get to do it in front of 
the school.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh believe me I've tried, but the boy 
just doesn't want
to commit an act of 
terrorism.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Wuss.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Don't I know 
it. So, we ended up just watching TV instead.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;So 
you replaced one intellectually stimulating activity
for another, 
okay.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That's about right. Oh, Dave, you should 
come over to
my house sometime, Tom wants to meet you and I'm sure my 
brother
Trent would too, assuming he's awake.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave 
nodded, &quot;Well, my schedule's booked pretty solid,
but I'll see 
what I can do.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria noticed Quinn walking over to 
their table. &quot;Oh look,
here comes the fashion princess, twice in 
as many days, must be
a record.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What could she 
want?&quot; Jane glanced over at Dave,
&quot;Oh yeah, your date, how 
did that go?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave shrugged, &quot;She yammered my ear 
off about fashion
all night at this overly expensive frog-joint, but 
the view was
nice, if you know what I mean.&quot; Dave wiggled his 
eyebrows
suggestively.</P>

<P>Daria sighed in disgust. &quot;You 
know there are times when
I think that Barch is on to 
something.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave's retort was cut off by Quinn's 
arrival, &quot;Why hello
Dave, how are you doing 
today?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Howdy Quinn, I'm getting along, and how 
are you this
fine day?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn waved a hand dismissivley, 
&quot;Oh, I can't complain,
Dave, the reason I came over here,&quot; 
she gave Daria and Jane
a dirty look, &quot;was to see if you wanted 
to go out tonight.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, as tempting an offer 
that is, I really can't accept.
I'm going to the Dave Matthews Band 
concert over at Irvine Meadows
tonight.&quot; Dave paused, seeing the 
downcast expression on
Quinn's face, &quot;You know, I do have an 
extra ticket why don't
you come along?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn brightened 
at the offer, &quot;Dave Matthews? Oh he's
cute, I hope that play 
that 'Crash Into Me' song, that's my favorite.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave 
chuckled, &quot;I'll take that as a yes?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes, of 
course, yes. Where are the seats?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Dead center, 
about 10 rows back, great seats. I'll pick
you up about a half-hour 
after school, I like to be at the show
as soon as possible.&quot; 
Quinn nodded and rushed off to go plan
her outfit.</P>

<P>&quot;What 
just happened there?&quot; Jane asked.</P>

<P>&quot;I sold out my 
morals and just invited a teeny-bopper
'Crash-Head' to a Dave 
Matthews Band concert.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But at least the view will 
be good.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave grinned, &quot;Oh hell yeah,&quot; He 
held up a hand looking
for a high-five. When none were forth coming 
he looked around
and saw Daria and Jane staring at him icily. He 
slowly lowered
his arm. &quot;Uh, okay, I'm going to run away 
now.&quot; Dave
collected his lunch and dashed off.</P>

<P>&quot;So, 
the new guy's dating your sister, any 
thoughts?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Not really, she's going with him 
because he's rich and
he's going with her because he's male. Sounds 
like a match made
in heaven to me. And why the hell should I care 
about them?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No reason I can think 
of.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Good, then let's drop 
this.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Alright.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's not like 
I'm my sister's keeper, nor really 
Dave's
friend.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;This is true, though I feel a but 
coming on.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria sighed, &quot;But I've got a feeling 
this will all end
badly and I'll get stuck picking up the 
pieces.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Always the pessimist, look on the bright 
side.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Which is?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Quinn's going 
out with a hippie.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria's mouth slowly drew into a 
smile, &quot;You're right,
this should provide a few laughs.&quot; 
Daria considered her lunch
briefly, &quot;You know, of course, that 
we're still stuck having
to face the ordinary rigors of life until 
those two flame out.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;True, Sick Sad World at my 
place tonight?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Wouldn't miss 
it.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn walked through the halls of Lawndale with the 
rest of
the Fashion Club. She was only paying minimal attention to 
the
conversation; instead, she was planning her outfit for the 
concert
tonight. &quot;It is a concert, so I can't just wear 
anything,
but then again I really don't want to make this Dave guy 
think
I'm getting dressed up for him, cause let's face it, he is a 
loser,
even if he is rich.&quot; She frowned, ever so slightly, 
&quot;But
he is sort of cute, in a loser sort of way. It's not like 
he's
a total fashion disaster&#133;he just doesn&#146;t dress 
quite
right&#133;&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Quinn, hello Quinn are you 
paying attention?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Of course I am Sandi, now what 
were we talking about?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, if you had been 
paying attention you would have
known we were debating the merits of 
strappy or non-strappy sandals
for next summer.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn 
flinched a little at Sandi's rebuke. &quot;Oh, 
definitely
strappy.&quot; She glanced at Tiffany and Stacy to see if 
she
had made the right choice.</P>

<P>Sandi nodded, &quot;That's 
exactly what I told those two, it's
good to see that at least the 
Vice President has some fashion
sense.&quot; Quinn inwardly sighed 
with relief. &quot;By the way
Quinn, What was more important than our 
little discussion?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, the new boy, Dave, asked 
if I wanted to go see tonight's
Dave Matthews Band concert and I was 
trying to figure out what
to wear.&quot;</P>

<P>Sandi sniffed, 
&quot;The Dave Matthews Band, you do know that's
a hippie band don't 
you? Potheads go to those shows.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What's wrong 
with potheads?&quot; Tiffany asked in her
usual laconic 
manner.</P>

<P>&quot;For one thing they're always eating fattening 
snack food.
Plus they wear tie-died clothing all the time.&quot; The 
foursome
shuddered.</P>

<P>&quot;But Dave Matthews is too cute to be 
a hippie, and there's
that song, 'Crash Into Me,' it's so cute, it 
just can't be hippie
music, and that other song, 'Say Goodbye' it's 
just like so romantic,
I just love my copy of 'Crash,' it just can't 
be hippie music
because then I'd be a like a hippie, and I'm not a 
hippie, I'm
popular, and if I were a hippie then I wouldn&#146;t be 
popular,
but I am popular, so I'm not a hippie but I like the Dave 
Matthews
Band, so&#133;&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Enough Stacy, you've made 
your point, I think, Dave Matthews
Band isn't quite hippie music, but 
it is close so Quinn, as President
of the Fashion club I order you to 
only appreciate the fashionable
songs at the concert and to ignore 
the more hippie elements. Also
you are to go and show the unwashed 
hordes how to be fashionable.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, thank-you Sandi 
for giving me your blessing to go,
like I wouldn't go if you said 
otherwise,&quot; she added under
her breath.</P>

<P>Quinn rushed 
home once school was over to change. The half-hour
seemed to fly by 
and before she knew it, the doorbell rang. &quot;Oh
no, he's 
here!&quot; She stuck her head out the door, &quot;Daria,
mom, Dad, 
could somebody get that?&quot; There was no answer,
&quot;Shoot, 
Daria's probably over at Jane's and Mom and Dad are
still at 
work.&quot; She glanced at her reflection in the mirror,
&quot;Well, 
I guess I'm presentable.&quot; Sighing she walked
downstairs and 
opened the door, as she expected Dave was standing
there, &quot;Uh, 
hi Dave.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave looked up and seemed startled to see 
Quinn at the door.
&quot;Hey Quinn, ready to 
go?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Just about, I Just need to find some 
shoes.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave glanced down and saw that her feet were 
indeed bare. &quot;Why
so you do, my advice is to wear something 
comfortable and close-toed.
So your feet don't get sore and it 
doesn't hurt as much when you
get stepped on, sneakers work 
great.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn laughed politely, &quot;I'll keep that in 
mind, why don't
you come in and have a seat while I finish getting 
ready.&quot;
Dave shrugged and entered the house. As he walked across 
the living
room he took off his sunglasses.</P>

<P>Quinn looked over 
at Dave and noticed this, &quot;What happened
to your 
glasses?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave tapped his face, under an eye, 
&quot;Contacts, I always
wear them when I got to a 
show.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn nodded, &quot;Okay, well, have a seat, I'll 
be right
back.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave shrugged and sat down on the couch. 
He casually tapped
his sunglasses against his leg, beating out a 
quiet cadence to
some internal rhythm. &quot;Damn,&quot; he thought 
to himself,
&quot;this is gonna take a while, why am I doing 
this?&quot; He
glanced up the stairs, &quot;I hope there's something 
going on
with her besides a pretty face or this is going to be a long 
night.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn was sitting on her bed considering shoes, 
one pair was
an elegant set of heels that she had been planning on 
wearing,
and the other were her infrequently worn sneakers. She 
sighed
and reached for the sneakers, &quot;It's hard to be cute 
with
a broken toe,&quot; she reasoned, Quinn skipped down the 
stairs
to meet with Dave, &quot;Okay, I'm set.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave 
rose from the couch, &quot;Great, let's go shall we?&quot;
As the 
pair walked to Dave's car he cast a critical eye over Quinn,
&quot;I 
would just like to say that you are looking especially
lovely this 
fine evening Ms. Morgendorffer.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, why thank-you 
Dave, I do try you know.&quot; Quinn
glanced at Dave and noticed he 
still hadn't put his sunglasses
back on, &quot;He does have gorgeous 
eyes,&quot; she thought to
herself. &quot;They're so blue, 
and&#133;&quot;she paused, searching
for the right word, &quot;kind I 
think. I've never seen anything
quite like 
them.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Penny for your thoughts?&quot; Dave asked, 
breaking Quinn's
concentration.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, I was jut thinking 
how you should go without your
glasses more often. They break up your 
face too much, and they
just do not go with your 
look.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave chuckled as he got in his Bug, &quot;Oh 
really, and just
what is my look?&quot; He unlocked Quinn's door and 
she let herself
in.</P>

<P>&quot;Why the 'I want to be an outsider, 
but I also want to
be popular' look.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave backed the 
car out onto the road and drove down the street,
&quot;Come 
again?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn sighed dramatically, &quot;You're trying 
to live in two
different worlds, the popular world and the brainy 
outsider world.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And just how do you come to that 
conclusion?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, lots of reasons, your clothes 
were the big tip off
though.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;My 
clothes?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, see you showed up at school 
yesterday wearing pants
from Abercrombie and Fitch, which aren't like 
the ultimate height
of fashion, but they also aren't wretched either, 
but when I asked
you about them you tried to blow me off with that 
bit about a
gift from you grandmother, like you didn't care what kind 
of pants
you were wearing&#133;&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Both of those 
statements are true I'd like to add, they
were a gift, and who makes 
my pants really doesn't matter to me.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;If that was 
true then why did you wear the Abercrombie?
You were trying to give 
the impression that you were a 
'cool'
person.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hey, I'm a very cool person, just 
ask any of my friends.
And besides, do hipsters these days wear Phish 
t-shirts?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No, they don't. And that's part of it. 
Both of your shirts
convinced me what you were about.&quot; She kept 
talking over
Dave's unvoiced question. &quot;I'll start with your 
flannel,
that was another attempt of your to look like a fashionable 
person,
but a really fashionable person wouldn't wear that kind of 
flannel,
nor one that beat up. Let me guess, you think it's like 
lucky
or something, right?&quot; Dave nodded sheepishly. &quot;I 
thought
so. Now for the Phish shirt, that threw me because I didn't 
know
what Phish was, but it was obvious that you were like trying 
to
show off how cool you were by declaring your allegiance to 
whatever
Phish stood for. And when I found out what Phish was it ball 
became
clear; you were trying to show just how cool you were by 
dropping
the name of some obscure band.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Okay, 
let's assume all that is true, and I won't say
it is, where are you 
getting this two world's business?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn laughed, 
&quot;That's the easiest part. You hang out
at school with Daria and 
Jane and you're going on a date with
me.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave shrugged, 
&quot;SoI ate lunch with your sister and her
friend, big deal. So 
I've gone out with you, big deal. Why do
these things have to be 
mutually exclusive, can't a guy be smart
and 
popular?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn glared at Dave, &quot;Who says that 
Daria's my sister?
Did she say that? Because it's a lie, she's just 
my cousin, I
don't even know why she lives in my 
house.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave chuckled, &quot;Come on Quinn, only an 
abject idiot would
fall for that story. Fact, you live in the same 
house, share a
last name, you both call the same woman mother, and 
the two of
you even look a little alike. It's obvious you're 
sisters.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn blinked, &quot;Oh, well, don't tell 
anyone else okay?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave snorted, &quot;Why should I? 
It's not like I really care,
but what does it matter who your sister 
is?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It would ruin my 
reputation.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Because you sister is Ms. 
Doom-and-Gloom? I doubt it.
You've also done a bang-up job of ducking 
my question. Can a person
be smart and 
popular?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, sure they can, but there are 
different kinds of smart
people, and you're really deep down one of 
the geeky, outsider
types. And those people aren't 
cool.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave chuckled, &quot;Okay then, so I'm a nerd at 
heart, why
are you in this car with me.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Because 
for a nerd you are cute, in a kind of helpless
way,&quot; She thought 
to herself, &quot;Because how often to
you get a chance to see a 
concert like this? Besides you aren't
a total loss, you do seem to be 
able to dress yourself at least
competently, even if you do lack a 
little style.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave drove the car in silence, mulling 
over what Quinn had
said, &quot;Okay, so I'm not saying what you said 
is a hundred
percent accurate, but I suppose it was 
insightful&#133;moderately
insightful at least. So you mean to tell 
me you can create a full
profile of a person just by their 
clothes?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn nodded, &quot;Oh yeah, it's like a 
second nature to me.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But what if a person who's 
normally a 'geek.'&quot; He
took his hands from the wheel to mime the 
quotation marks, &quot;Dresses
up in public like a popular person? 
Would that instantly make
him or her popular?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn 
sighed, &quot;I can tell people who are posers apart
from the 
naturally popular, they carry themselves 
differently.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;So you're saying that some people 
are just inherently
popular and others aren't.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn 
brightened, &quot;Exactly, just like not everyone is
smart, not 
everyone is, or should be, popular.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave frowned, not 
sure if he wanted to concede the point yet,
&quot;But what about the 
arbitrary nature of popularity? What's
considered popular or 
fashionable in one place is considered the
antithesis of popularity 
elsewhere, or even at the same place
in a different 
time.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn gave Dave and exasperated look; &quot;Did I 
say that
popularity was universal? No, but the people who would be 
popular
in one place will be popular elsewhere, the appearance might 
change,
but charisma is charisma.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hmm, seems like 
something of a cop-out to say that a
popular Zulu warrior would also 
be popular if he were a Caucasian
teenager simply because he's 
popular among his warrior buddies.&quot;
Dave thought about this as 
the miles went past. &quot;Okay then,
what if to be popular you had 
to do something that went against
your nature?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn 
shrugged, &quot;It's my nature to be popular so I don't
see a 
problem.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave gave Quinn a sidelong glance, &quot;So 
you'd kill somebody&#133;no
wait, bad example, let me try again. So 
you'd sleep with somebody
you didn't like in order to stay 
popular?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn smiled coyly, &quot;I'd just make 
abstinence popular.&quot;</P>

<P>For a long moment Dave managed to 
keep his face still, then
a smile took hold and he burst out 
laughing, &quot;Be careful
what you with for dude,&quot; he told 
himself, chuckling.</P>

<P>Quinn looked at Dave strangely, 
&quot;What was that all about?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, back at your 
house I was hoping there was more to
you than was on display last 
night. Little did I know you were
not only a philosopher, but 
possessed a keen insight into the
human psyche. I have really got to 
stop underestimating people.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn looked somewhat 
putout by Dave's comment, &quot;I suppose
I'll take that as a 
compliment.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;By all means do since I meant it as 
such. Like you said,
&quot;I'm a brain at heart and I like to have 
intelligent conversations
with people.&quot; He paused, chuckling, 
&quot;And if nothing
else you've given me something to think about. 
You've got a good
head on your shoulders Quinn, don't be afraid to 
use it.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn blushed slightly and stared at her shoes. 
&quot;Why should
I be?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;To keep yourself out of 
your sister's shadow?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn glared at Dave; &quot;I am 
not in Daria's shadow.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave shrugged, &quot;I know I'd 
feel like I was if my sister
was the smartest person in 
school.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I&#133;don't&#133;want&#133;to...talk...ab 
out&#133;that.&quot;
Quinn growled.</P>

<P>Dave glanced over at 
Quinn and was surprised to see she was
almost shaking with rage, her 
fists clenched by her side, and
a far too neutral expression on her 
face. &quot;Okay then, we
won't. Uh&#133;&quot; He groped around 
searching for a new topic
of conversation. &quot;Why don't we just 
listen to some music.&quot;
He fiddled with the stereo and soon the 
sounds of the Phish song
&quot;Contact&quot; were floating through 
the car.</P>

<P>Quinn cocked her head as she listened to the lyrics, 
&quot;What
is this?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's Phish, the song's called 
Contact, I thought it was
appropriate.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh,&quot; 
She paused searching for a comment. &quot;It's&#133;whimsical,
and 
kind of catchy.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That it is, thought not totally 
typical Phish, at least
not live Phish&#133;&quot; He caught himself, 
&quot;You really
don't care to hear about that do 
you?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Why don't you just let me hear them and then 
I'll make
up my mind.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave shrugged, &quot;Fine with 
me, now let's see here&#133;ahh
yes, I think the second night of the 
Radio City Music Hall stand
will do nicely.&quot; He punched a few 
buttons on the car stereo;
gradually the funky beat of &quot;My 
Soul&quot; filled the car,
&quot;All I ask is that you don't pass 
immediate judgement. It
kind of grows on you. Should've gone with 'A 
Live One,' much better
intro&#133;&quot;he trailed off when he 
realized Quinn was staring
at him. &quot;Why don't I shut up now and 
listen to the music,
I recommend closing your eyes and letting it 
wash over you.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn looked at Dave strangely. 
&quot;Why are you getting so
worked up over this? It's just a 
band.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, but, I've got a lot of myself wrapped 
up in these
guys, so if you don't like them then it's akin to you not 
liking
me.&quot; Dave squirmed in his seat as he discussed this 
personal
topic.</P>

<P>Quinn smiled playfully, &quot;And when did 
you need me to like
you Dave?&quot; Red bloomed on Dave's cheeks, 
&quot;Don't worry,
I'll be good for now and just listen to these 
hippies of yours;
then I'll pass judgement on 
them.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave nodded and settled back into his seat, 
letting the groove
sink into him, within minutes he looked absorbed 
by the music.
Quinn shrugged and leaned back in her seat. Even if it 
really
wasn't her kind of music, the bucket seat was comfortable. 
She
closed her eyes and drifted off. Looking back on it Quinn 
was
never sure if she fell asleep or not. She couldn't remember 
a
single song, but had a recollection of hearing a loose and 
unhurried
collection of guitar bass, keyboards and drums. She stirred 
from
her reverie by a gentle shaking.</P>

<P>&quot;Hey Quinn, we're 
here.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;We're here, already?&quot; She looked 
around and saw
they were in a large parking 
lot.</P>

<P>&quot;Already? I've been driving for two hours. Come on, 
I
want to get set-up and grab some food before the rest of the 
crows
shows up. Plus there are some folks I have to 
meet.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn groggily got out of the car and waited for 
Dave to join
her. He was gathering a rather large amount of stuff 
form the
back of his car. When he was finished he had two bulky bags 
slung
over his shoulder and was holding a collapsed 
tripod.</P>

<P>&quot;Ewww, what's all that 
stuff?'</P>

<P>&quot;It's my taping rig.&quot; Dave replied with a 
big grin
on his face. &quot;This is my mic stand, and my recording 
equipment
is in the green bag. The other bag has my laptop so I can 
get
the tracks ready for processing as quickly as 
possible.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You're going to tape the concert?&quot; 
Dave nodded delightedly,
&quot;And they let you do 
that?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh sure, lot's of band do, so long as I 
don't see a profit
on the venture, which I don't. Now come on, the 
show starts in
two hours.&quot; He grabbed Quinn with his free hand 
and dragged
her across the parking lot.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh great, what 
have I gotten myself into now?&quot; Quinn
groaned to herself as she 
struggled to keep up with Dave. All
around there were people 
college-aged and younger milling around,
drinking laughing, throwing 
Frisbees, and just generally enjoying
the gorgeous weather. Dave led 
her to one such gathering. There
was a circle of people surrounding a 
tall microphone stand with
a flag flying from the top. The small 
group seemed to recognize
Dave on sight and greeted him 
warmly.</P>

<P>&quot;Hey, it's the rich-boy. So, what expensive 
gee-gaw are
you going to impress us with 
tonight?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, nothing too fancy, I'm just going to 
experiment with
recording strait to a hard drive.&quot;</P>

<P>The 
group nodded, &quot;That's pretty cool.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave glanced 
over at Quinn who was trying to stay at the edge
of the circle, 
&quot;Hey guys, I'd like you to meet Quinn. Quinn,
this is Alex, 
Craig, Mike, Jeff and Allen. They're also 
tapers.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Um, hi.&quot; Quinn waved faintly, she 
was surrounded
by A/V nerds.</P>

<P>The group murmured its 
collective greetings. The man Dave had
identified as Jeff reached 
into a cooler and retrieved two bottles,
&quot;Beer?&quot; Dave 
shrugged and took one, &quot;How 'bout
you, Quinn 
right?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn paused and looked around, noticing that 
everyone had
a beer as well, &quot;Oh well, when in Rome.&quot; She 
also took
the offered bottle. She cautiously took a swig, it was good 
beer.
&quot;You guys don't mind that I'm 
under-aged?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Shit, Mike over there's underage and 
he's already on
his fifth, we just won't offer you a bowl, unless you 
want one?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;A bowl? Marijuana? Ewww, that makes you 
like eat fatty
foods, and is really bad for the 
eyes.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hey Dave, where's Caitlin?&quot; One of the 
group asked
after looking at Quinn.</P>

<P>Dave scowled, &quot;I'd 
rather not talk about it now.&quot;
He gave the man an angry flare 
for bringing up the topic. Quinn
took notice and resolved to find out 
just who this &quot;Caitlin&quot;
was. Dave chugged the rest of his 
bottle and tossed the empty
into a nearby bin. &quot;Well, we'd best 
be going, haven't had
dinner yet. It was nice seeing you guys, good 
luck with your tapes.&quot;
Dave picked up his gear and motioned for 
Quinn to follow him.</P>

<P>&quot;Hey dude, don't go now, we were 
just about to smoke a
few, sure you don't want to join 
in?</P>

<P>Dave shook his head, &quot;Ah, not tonight, I've decided 
to
lay off a little on that stuff, new town, new start, you know
how 
it goes.&quot;</P>

<P>Alex nodded, &quot;that's cool, good taping 
man, don't let
the Crash-head wreck your tape.&quot; The rest of the 
group said
their good-byes.</P>

<P>Quinn waved to the group. 
&quot;Nice meeting all of you.&quot;
Dave and Quinn walked off 
towards the entrance of the amphitheater,
Quinn sipping on her beer 
as they went.</P>

<P>Dave looked at Quinn and chuckled, &quot;Sorry 
about that back
there, I know they weren't exactly, 'your people' but 
I had to
say hello, you know, for appearances sake.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;So they aren't your friends?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, yes 
and no&#133;we all tape shows, and sort of
hang out when we 
do&#133;but I wouldn't say they're friends 
per
se.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn looked at Dave intently, &quot;You don't 
have many friends
do you?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Your intuitive nature 
is getting just a little too damn
personal,&quot; He growled. Dave 
came to a sudden halt, causing
Quinn to nearly walk into 
him.</P>

<P>&quot;What's the big idea&#133;&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No 
containers in the venue, finish your 
beer.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh,&quot; Quinn drained her bottle and 
tossed it into
a nearby recycling bin. &quot;Ok, let's 
go.&quot;</P>

<P>They passed through security without incident. As 
they were
walking to their seats Dave had an idea. &quot;Say Quinn, 
here's
a thought problem for you. If a person is popular in a 
certain
subset of the population does that make him popular to the 
population
as a whole?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn laughed, &quot;you really 
haven't thought about this
before. No, if you're the king of nerds 
that doesn't mean you're
popular with everyone else, you're still a 
loser.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave shook his head, &quot;Damn you all, 
somebody my people
will be free from your oppression.&quot; Dave's 
stomach grumbled
rather loudly, &quot;Damn, I need food. Come on 
let's go grab
a hot dog or something and see if the cash I laid out 
for this
fake ID was worth it.&quot;</P>

<P>Meanwhile, at the Lane 
house, Jane was finishing up an art
assignment for school while Daria 
casually flipped through the
paper. &quot;Anything of note in 
there?&quot; Jane asked Daria.</P>

<P>Daria did not even look up 
from her paper, &quot;Just the usual,
people are worried about 
everything except what is really 
the
problem.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Isn't that always the way. Say when 
you're done with
it could you hand me the help wanted 
section?&quot;</P>

<P>Daria raised an eyebrow at the request, 
&quot;You're not seriously
looking for work are 
you?&quot;</P>

<P>Jane shook her head, &quot;Oh heavens no, but 
sometimes whenever
Trent's in a major rut I read some choice want ads 
and that always
seems to get him going.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria smirked, 
&quot;nothing like knowing how bad your other
options are to get the 
creative juices flowing; I hear that's
what Mrs. Shakespeare did as 
well.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane chuckled as she flipped through the paper. 
Suddenly she
stopped and folded the paper over, &quot;Hey Daria, 
check this
out.&quot; She handed the paper to Daria.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh 
no, I don't need that kind of motivation.&quot; She
pushed the paper 
away.</P>

<P>&quot;I'm serious Daria, check this out. I think you'll 
like
it.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria reluctantly took the paper from Jane and 
read the indicated
ad aloud. &quot;Wanted, one teen with his or her 
finger on the
pulse of the teen nation to serve as content provider

Dari 
a looked at Jane, &quot;you've got to be 
kidding.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P>&quot;Oh come on Daria, you'd be 
perfect for the job, just
think of it. You, Daria Morgendorffer could 
become the voice of
your generation. Just think of all the people you 
could reach
with your unique message. Plus stock options go a long 
way towards
getting the hell out of 
Lawndale.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;While your points are all valid, I 
think you miss the
vital element in all of this; I'm in no way 
representative of
today's youth. They'd take one look at me and start 
laughing.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Daria, they're advertising in the 
Lawndale want ads,
pulse of today's youth they have 
not.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria thought for a long moment, &quot;What the 
hell, all I
have to lose is my pride, and that withered away long 
ago. Let's
go work on my resume over some 
pizza.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Excellent idea, I'll call Tom and have him 
give us a
ride.&quot; Jane picked up her phone.</P>

<P>&quot;He got 
his car fixed?&quot;</P>

<P>Jane hung the phone up, &quot;Oh damn, 
that's right. Hang on,
I'll go get Trent.&quot; She left the room, a 
few minutes later
she returned, without Trent. &quot;Damn, he's not 
around either.&quot;
Jane shrugged, &quot;Oh well, wanna watch some 
TV?&quot;</P>

<P>Daria picked up the remote, &quot;My thoughts 
exactly.&quot;</P>

<P>Back at the concert Dave managed to get food, 
and beer, for
both he and Quinn. He also had been forced to buy Quinn 
a blue
Dave Matthews Band tank-top with a feather motif on the 
front,
and a gray T-shirt with a large, stylized butterfly on the 
back.
They were at their seats and Dave was fussing with his 
recording
gear. Quinn was doing her best to distance herself from the 
tangle
of cables Dave was fighting. It didn't help that almost 
every
minute it seemed like someone was asking Dave if he was 
taping
and could they get a copy. Dave had, of course, foisted the 
transcription
work to Quinn. It wasn't going too badly until she 
heard a familiar
voice say, &quot;Hey dude, you taping the 
show?&quot; Quinn turned
around and saw Jeffy.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh crap, 
if he sees me here with Dave then everyone at
school will know I went 
to a concert with a geek.&quot; She considered
running but then calm 
descended on her, &quot;Wait a minute, I
can always say that I went 
because Dave's rich and offered me
great seats which is even the 
truth.&quot; Reassured that her
social status would remain unharmed 
Quinn listened to the rest
of the exchange.</P>

<P>&quot;&#133;Yeah, 
so that's my rig. If you want a copy of the
show just leave your name 
and email address with Quinn over there.&quot;
Dave nodded in Quinn's 
direction.</P>

<P>Jeffy looked at Quinn for the first time and his 
dim face brightened,
&quot;Hey Quinn, what are you doing 
here?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn laughed nervously, &quot;Oh, Dave offered 
me a ticket
and what kind of loser would turn down tickets to a show 
like
this?&quot;</P>

<P>Jeffy looked at Dave closer, &quot;Say, 
you're the new kid
at Lawndale, I'll just give you some blank tapes 
at school tomorrow,
ok?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave shrugged, &quot;Sure, 
fine, whatever.&quot;</P>

<P>Jeffy waved to Quinn, &quot;Bye Quinn, 
If I had known you were
a fan I would have gotten you a ticket, is 
there anything you
need right now?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn shook her head 
regally, &quot;No, you may go back to
your seat.&quot; Jeffy walked 
off.</P>

<P>Dave tracked the departing teen as he made his way 
through
the crowd, &quot;Friend of yours?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn shook 
her head, &quot;He's one of my admirers.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Ah, a 
boy-toy. I hope you don't expect me to be at your
beck and call like 
a man servant.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Why shouldn't you, after all I did 
agree to go to this
concert with you.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave shrugged, 
&quot;And for that thank-you, I hate to go to
shows alone, but don't 
think you're doing me any great favors,
I could've just as easily 
asked your sister, or anybody else for
that matter. It don't need you 
to validate my existence. My question
is, are you the same 
way?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn frowned, &quot;And just what is that 
supposed to mean?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave held up his hands defensively, 
&quot;Forget I said anything.
Let me show you my rig before the show 
starts.&quot; Quinn shrugged
and watched as Dave removed a microphone 
from the retracted stand.
&quot;This is the business end of the deal, 
a matched pair of
Neumann AK-40 cardiod microphones,&quot; he tapped 
the front of
the microphone, &quot;They connect to the body 
here,&quot; he
tapped the back of the microphone, &quot;To make the 
KM-140 mic,
list price around 2000 dollars for the pair,. He 
reattached the
microphone to the stand and then held up the cable 
running out
of the mic. &quot;This is obviously cable, specifically 
it's Audio
Magic Excalibur II, hand crafted silver cabling, cost me 
nearly
800 bucks for the twenty foot pair.&quot; Quinn's eyes 
widened
in surprise, Dave picked a silver and blue box out of his 
bag,
&quot;This is my preamp, it provides the power need to run 
the
mics, it's a Lunatec V2 and also costs around 2000. From the 
preamp
the sound goes through the A/D converter, this little beauty 
changes
the analog signal from the mics into a digital one. I'm 
really
happy with mine, it's an Apogee AD-1000, they stopped making 
them,
this one cost me over 3000 dollars to get this one used. And 
finally
we have the jewel of my collection, and Hhb PDR-1000 
PortaDAT,
this is the finest portable digital audio tape deck ever 
made,
cost me an arm and a leg to get it too. Just for giggles I'm 
also
running a digital feed to my laptop, which skips the DAT 
deck
and lets me burn to CD without any sort of 
conversions.&quot;
Dave saw the glazed look on Quinn's face, 
&quot;Sorry for getting
techie on you. I won't do it 
again.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I had no idea how expensive all that stuff 
was.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave grimaced, &quot;It's an extremely expensive 
addiction.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn was still thinking about all the 
clothes she could buy
with the money Dave had invested on his rig 
when the opening bad
came on. Through the band's set, a group which 
Quinn had never
heard of, she thought about the evening up to that 
point, more
specifically, Dave. &quot;he's so strange, I can tell he 
does
care about what other people think about him, but he also 
tries
so hard to be an outcast.&quot; She watched as he carefully 
adjusted
something on his equipment, &quot;And this taping business, 
he's
like that kid in elementary school who'd always bring cookies
to 
class so I'd like him.&quot; Quinn paused, &quot;What a 
second,
that's it, he is the cookie kid. Just with a very large 
credit
card&#133;I wonder how much stuff from Cashman's I could get 
out
of him.: She spend the rest of the set day-dreaming about 
new
outfits, all paid for out of Dave's bottomless 
pockets.</P>

<P>The opening band finished their set and the roadies 
swarmed
the stage. Dave turned off his gear and got it ready for the 
main
act. &quot;Hey Quinn, I'm going to go get something to drink,
do 
you want anything?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;A diet soda 
please.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave nodded, &quot;Gotcha, don't let anyone 
mess with my stuff.&quot;
He walked off towards the concession 
stands. He stopped and walked
back to his seat, &quot;Oh, in case I'm 
not back when the show
starts let me show you how to turn this thing 
on.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But I don't know anything about those 
things.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Don't worry, it's all set up, just turn 
the preamp, a/d,
and deck on like so,&quot; he demonstrated, 
&quot;then just hit
the record and play buttons like so. There, you 
try.&quot; Quinn
did, and to her surprise it worked. &quot;See, 
that's easy, if
you really want to go above and beyond the call of 
duty you could
also watch the levels, those are the little bars on 
the DAT's
display, just make sure they aren't hitting zero, that's 
bad.
If they do, turn these knobs on the preamp down, that's 
really
all there is. Think you can handle all 
that?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn shook her head, &quot;Not 
really.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave chuckled, &quot;Just be sure to get the 
recording started,
I can fix the levels after the 
show.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What about your 
laptop?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh yeah, almost forgot. It's in sleep 
mode right now.&quot;
He thought about something for a moment, 
&quot;Don't worry about
it. I can splice the sources together after 
the show. Just don't
forgot, preamp, A/D, deck, record/play. I'll be 
as quick as possible&#133;Damn,
one more thing, you might want 
these,&quot; he handed her a pair
of ear plugs, &quot;I don't like to 
court hearing loss and the
show can be kind of loud.&quot; Quinn took 
the plugs and put them
in her ears, they were the high quality ones 
that rock 
musicians
wore.</P>

<P>&quot;Thanks.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Don't 
mention it.&quot; With that Dave finally went off
in search of 
beverages.</P>

<P>Quinn passed the time by getting acquainted with 
Dave's recording
equipment. She really didn't care about it, or for 
it, but messing
up his tape would definitely not reflect well on her 
and might
hurt her chances for another date. While she was doing this 
an
older gentleman walked up.</P>

<P>&quot;Hey there, taping the 
show?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Uh, yeah.&quot; She should've said no, but 
this guy was
cute so she felt like she had to impress 
him.</P>

<P>&quot;Cool, what are you running?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn 
paused, trying to decipher the jargon, &quot;Um, 
mics.&quot;</P>

<P>The man laughed, &quot;That much I figured out, 
what kind?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn desperately tried to remember 
everything Dave had told
her, she glanced down and noticed that Dave 
had left a notebook
open by his gear. On the page was the date, 
location and something
called source, &quot;That must be it,&quot; 
she thought to herself,
&quot;Uh, Neumann KM-140's, Lunatec V2, 
Apogee AD-1000, HHb PDR-1000
PortaDAT.&quot; She tried to be as 
discrete as possible as she
read the list off.</P>

<P>&quot;That's 
very impressive. Tell me, what do you think of
the Neumanns, are they 
better than Schoeps Mk4's?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn had no idea what he 
was talking about, &quot;Oh, the
Neumanns are by far superior. I 
wouldn't be using them otherwise.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Fair enough, 
here let me give you my number, give me
a call and we can debate mics 
in full at a later date.&quot; He
handed Quinn a business card. Quinn 
took the card and slipped
it in her purse.</P>

<P>&quot;Sure 
thing.&quot; They waved and the man walked off.
&quot;Cool, this 
thing might be good for something after all.&quot;
She sat back in 
her seat with a satisfied smirk on her face. At
just about that exact 
moment the band hit the stage. Quinn shot
up and quickly turned on 
all the components of Dave's gear, the
counter started ticking away 
and Quinn breathed a sigh of relief.
&quot;Thank goodness I didn't 
screw that up. Oh my god, he's so
cute!&quot; Quinn exclaimed when 
she saw Dave Matthews.</P>

<P>&quot;Hey, not so loud, you'll wreck 
my tape.&quot; A quiet
voice in the din said behind her. She turned 
around and saw Dave
armed with a fully loaded tray of food and 
beverages. &quot;Your
soda madam,&quot; he handed Quinn her soda and 
set the tray down
on his seat. &quot;So you got the tape started, 
great, let me
just get the computer going and we can enjoy the 
show.&quot; He
said this mostly to himself since it was nearly 
impossible to
be heard over the roar of the crowd. Dave made a few 
adjustments
to his gear and flashed Quinn a thumbs up sign. Dave then 
motioned
for Quinn to enjoy the show.</P>

<P>Daria was hunched over 
her computer, working on her resume.
Tom had called Jane and the two 
had gone somewhere in a car borrowed
from Tom's parents. Daria had 
enough sense to know when she was
a fifth wheel and talked home after 
a few moments of awkward small
talk. Jane made it clear that she 
wanted to be alone with her
beau.</P>

<P>So Daria walked home, 
&quot;So what if I'm by myself, at least
my friend's happy. So I 
should feel happy for her&#133;'yay.'
That was about as convincing as 
the knights in Monty Python,&quot;
she sighed. &quot;Oh great, now 
I'm referencing Monty Python,
wonderful. But I should be happy for 
Jane&#133;look at me I'm
happy.&quot; Her face remained impassive. 
&quot;There, now suck
it up Morgendorffer and go home and write that 
resume before the
police pick you up for vagrancy.&quot; Daria walked 
up to her
house and opened the front door. Inside she found Helen and 
Jake
in the kitchen. Helen was unpacking a collection of Chinese 
food
containers from a large paper bag while Jake was browsing 
the
paper. Neither of them had noticed when Daria entered the 
room.
&quot;Mom, Dad, I'm home.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake looked up from his 
paper, &quot;Oh, hey kiddo, how was
your 
day?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, nobody suffered any permanent damage, 
but beyond
that whatever else you hear is unsubstantiated 
rumor.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That's&#133;er&#133;great kiddo, keep up 
the good work.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria looked at the pile of Chinese food 
on the table, &quot;I
see we aren't even bothering at any trappings 
of domesticity tonight.&quot;</P>

<P>Helen sighed, &quot;Really 
Daria, I've had a hard day at work
and Eric wants me back in an hour, 
we're expecting a fax from
Japan and somebody has to be there to 
respond immediately. So
it was Chinese or let your father 
cook.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Point well taken, pass the lo mein.&quot; 
Daria picked
up one of the white boxes and started to 
eat.</P>

<P>&quot;Huh, I too can cook, who says I 
can't?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Jake, eat your dinner before it gets cold. 
It's your
favorite.&quot;</P>

<P>Jake's face lit up, &quot;Oh boy, 
moo goo gai pan!&quot; He
grabbed a carton and happily hummed 
&quot;Moo goo gai pain,&quot;
to himself.</P>

<P>Helen shook her 
head sadly, until she noticed Quinn's absence.
&quot;Daria, where's 
your sister?&quot;</P>

<P>Daria frowned, &quot;Do I look like 
Quinn's date book?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No, but since the two of you 
do go to the same school
she might have mentioned something to 
you.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria sighed, &quot;Ok, this time I do know, but 
this does
not mean I'm responsible for her. She went to a concert 
over in
Irvine.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What? That's two hours from here! 
When she gets home
she is in serious trouble. And just who did she go 
to this concert
with?&quot;<BR>
</P>

<P>&quot;Uh, Dave Wylie, the 
guy who was over last night.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, James Wylie's 
son? Well, he's a responsible enough
boy, I'm sure nothing bad will 
happen&#133;though I will have
to remind Quinn to leave us a 
note.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What? He's only been in tow for two days, 
and you only
met him for five minutes tops yesterday, how the hell do 
you know
if he's responsible or not?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Daria, 
language! James Wylie is a very respected member
of the community, 
and he just put the firm on a hefty retainer
to handle his local 
legal matters, I'm sure his son is a 
perfect
gentleman.&quot;<BR>
</P>

<P>&quot;Excuse me, I'm going to 
go upstairs and brush up on my
Marx&#133;&quot; She looked at her 
food, &quot;and Mao.&quot;
She picked up the food and trudged 
upstairs.</P>

<P>&quot;Moo goo gai pan, moo goo gai pan&#133;&quot; 
Jake continued
singing to himself, oblivious to the argument around 
him.</P>

<P>&quot;Jake! Would you stop that?&quot; Helen snapped, 
she angrily
speared a piece of chicken with her fork and ate it 
distractedly.</P>

<P>Daria sighed and read what she had typed, 
&quot;Interests:
Plotting the proletariat's toppling of the 
bourgeoisie hegemony.&quot;
She groaned and started pressing the 
delete key. Her conversation
with her mother over dinner was still 
fresh in her mind, and the
implications of it bothered her. &quot;Oh 
to hell with it.&quot;
She closed down her word processor and picked 
up her food carton.
She poked through the remains of the lo mein, 
looking for any
morsels. She found a mushroom and savagely speared it 
with her
fork, tearing the soggy carton in the process. &quot;Well 
this
has just been a wonderful evening.&quot; She tossed the 
ruined
carton into the trash. While chewing on the mushroom Daria 
glared
at the fortune cookie sitting on her desk. &quot;The way 
things
are going it'll say I'll contract Ebola or some other 
hemorrhagic
fever. What the hell, a cookie's a cookie, even if this 
one doesn't
have any chocolate chips.&quot; She opened her cookie and 
read
the fortune. &quot;'A new love will be found unexpectedly, 
happy
long journey. Lucky numbers 10, 28, 11, 13.' Hmm, I wonder if
I 
got Quinn's fortune by mistake.&quot; At that moment Daria's
ICQ 
chirped, she looked at the screen, it was a message from 
Tom.</P>

<P>&quot;Hey Daria.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hey, weren't you 
going to do something with Jane?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, she's here 
too. I was thinking about having my room
re-painted so I needed some 
advice from an expert.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Say hi to her for 
me.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;She says&#133;help, help I'm being held 
hostage in a
posh mansion, and I'm being forced to look at paint 
chips! Hey
Daria.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Very funny you 
two.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Jane wants to know how your resume is 
going?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It'dbe going better if I wasn't plotting 
to overthrow
the corrupt bourgeoisie swine 
simultaneously.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Been hitting the Marx and Engles 
a little too hard? Remember
the key is 
moderation.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's not that, the new kid in school 
just whisked Quinn
off to some concert and my parents aren't even 
remotely upset
because the guy's father is a wealthy client of my 
mother's firm.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Is this that guy Dave Jane was 
talking about?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The one and the 
same.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;From what Jane says he seems like a pretty 
cool guy.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well maybe I just take longer to warm 
to people, but
I like to hold off on judgement until I know they 
aren't a total
asshole.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Seems like we've had this 
conversation before.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And I was right that time 
too.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But I didn't turn out to be a complete 
asshole now did
I? I'm sure this Dave fellow is perfectly harmless. 
Oh crap, got
to go, Jane wants to show me something, bye 
Daria.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Bye Tom.&quot; Daria sighed and reopened 
her resume in
progress, she wrote for a little while before quitting 
the program
again, &quot;Who am I trying to kid?&quot; She picked up 
a book
and lay on her bed, reading.</P>

<P>The concert progressed 
along at its own pace. Quinn squealed
every time the band played a 
song she recognized and was silent
for everything 4else. She was 
getting a little tired of standing
but nobody seemed too inclined to 
sit down. Dave appeared to be
enjoying himself, though it was hard to 
tell, he rarely applauded
and never said a word. A couple of times 
Quinn had wanted to ask
him the name of a song, but the noise in the 
amphitheater was
just too loud. Every now and then a member of the 
opening band
came out and performed with Matthews. This seemed to 
really excite
the crowd, but Quinn didn't really understand what the 
big deal
was, though the guest bass player was very good and the 
banjo
was interesting. During one of those extended solos Quinn 
glanced
over at Dave. He was totally entranced, eyes closed, body 
swaying
in time with the music. The band ended its set and exited 
the
stage. After the obligatory waiting period they returned to 
the
stage, with the extra musicians, and launched into the 
encore.
Quinn was startled by the sudden &quot;Yes!&quot; Dave 
shouted.
The song the band was playing was a quiet one, the crowd was 
hushed,
sensing something special. Quinn didn't know the song but 
was
enchanted by its haunting lyricism. When the song ended they 
started
a second. This song went on for a long time as everyone on 
stage
lent his own spin to it, eventually the melody morphed into 
a
completely different song. When the last notes of the song 
drifted
away Quinn thought the concert was over.</P>

<P>However 
Matthews stepped up to the mic, &quot;Hey ya'll they've
got this rule 
about how long you can play here&#133;but we just
said fuck that, 
when you've got all these fine musicians on stage
and the groove's 
going you've just got to keep on dancing. So
like, this is the last 
show with Bela Fleck and the Flecktones,
the fine Bela Fleck and the 
Flecktones, so we thought we'd send
em off with a proper good-bye, 
this being their last stop with
us and all&#133;&quot; With that the 
band began another tune.
It started out with an almost Middle-Eastern 
feel too it, then
suddenly exploded into an aggressive melody. The 
song built to
a fevered pitch and then trailed off to a lilting 
conclusion of
Matthews and the banjo player, until that too faded 
away. With
a final, &quot;Ya'll take care of yourselves,&quot; the 
band exited
the stage and the crowd roared its approval. Even Quinn 
was caught
up in the moment as she clapped and cheered. The lights 
came back
on and the crowd began to make its way out.</P>

<P>Dave 
was carefully dismantling his equipment in the swirling
chaos around 
them. &quot;Well, how'd you like it?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It was 
great, Dave Matthews was so cute, and he played
all the songs I knew, 
Even the ones I didn't know were ok.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;If I were 
you I'd be feeling pretty lucky right now.
This was a special 
concert, a couple of those songs have only
been played a handful of 
times live, and I have it all on tape.&quot;
He patted his case and 
grinned. &quot;Now for the fun part, getting
out of this 
madhouse.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn surveyed the crowd, &quot;Just stay 
close to me.&quot;
As she walked through the crowd it parted for her, 
like an icebreaker
in the Baring Strait. Dave chuckled to himself and 
bolted through
the opening Quinn made. They were at Dave's car in no 
time.</P>

<P>&quot;I don't suppose I could lash you to the roof of 
my car
so we could try that trick on the traffic jam at the 
gate?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn laughed, &quot;Oh no, it only works on 
crowds.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Damn, well, we're gonna be here for a 
while. There's
a cell phone in the glove compartment if you want to 
call your
folks and let them know roughly when we'll be back, it'll 
probably
be at least three hours. I'm going to hook up my deck up to 
the
car stereo so we can take a listen to the tape and see how 
it
came out.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh damn, my parents,&quot; Quinn dug 
the cell phone out
of its hiding place, it was a small, cutting-edge 
phone. &quot;How
typical,&quot; she thought, &quot;an expensive 
gadget just left
in a glove box.&quot; She dialed the phone and 
braced herself,
&quot;Hi mom, it's Quinn&#133;yes, I am, no we're in 
the parking
lot&#133;No! Mom! We're stuck in traffic&#133;I know, I 
should've&#133;well
I was invited just today, there wasn't any time 
to&#133;I know,
next time I promise&#133;when? Dave says three 
hours&#133;I remember
the curfew, can't I have an exception? What? 
Sure.&quot; She handed
the phone to Dave, &quot;My mom wants to talk 
to you.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave shrugged and took the phone, &quot;Yes 
Mrs. Morgendorffer?
That's right traffic snarl&#133;I will drive 
safely. I promise
strait to your house&#133;no problem at all Mrs. 
Morgendorffer&#133;Nice
talking to you.&quot; Dave shut the phone off 
and tossed it back
into the glove box. &quot;It's nice that your mom 
cares about
you.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I guess, I just wish she'd keep 
her nose out of my business.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave smiled wistfully, 
&quot;I suppose, but trust me you'll
miss it.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I 
doubt it. Say Dave could I get a copy of this show
for my friend 
Stacy, she's a big fan of Dave Matthews&#133;&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Say 
no more, I'll have a copy ready tomorrow. Oh come
on you fucker, let 
me through.&quot; Dave directed this last comment
to the driver who 
swung out in front of him. They slowly made
their way out of the 
parking lot, Dave's ire growing by the minute.
&quot;Unbelievable, 
the one universal constant in life, every
other driver is insane. You 
fuck-tart!&quot; He hollered at another
driver.</P>

<P>Quinn, who 
was used to such tirades, simply leaned back in
her seat and waited, 
&quot;Hey Dave, would you mind putting on
that CD you were playing on 
the drive up?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The Phish concert?&quot; Dave 
asked, surprised.</P>

<P>&quot;Yes, it was like, very calming. It'd 
be great music to
fall asleep to. I felt so refreshed after listening 
to it this
afternoon.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Uh, sure no problem. I 
usually spend the drive home analyzing
that night's tape, but sure we 
can listen to Phish instead.&quot;
Dave turned on the car stereo and 
called up the right CD.</P>

<P>&quot;Thanks,&quot; Quinn shut her 
eyes and let the music take
hold. Dave chuckled to himself and 
continued to curse at the traffic,
though in a muted tone. By the 
time they were on the highway Quinn
was asleep.</P>

<P>Dave gently 
nudged Quinn's shoulder, &quot;Hey Quinn, we're
back, wake 
up.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn started, &quot;Hmm, what? Oh great.&quot; She 
got out
of the car, Dave followed.</P>

<P>&quot;Here, I'll walk you 
to your door.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh you don't have to do 
that.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I insist, sleep deprivation makes me feel 
chivalrous.&quot;
They walked to the door in 
silence.</P>

<P>&quot;Dave, thanks for taking me to the concert, I 
really did
enjoy myself.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I'm glad. I had fun too. 
Hang on a sec, let me give you
something.&quot; He ran back to his 
car and returned shortly with
a CD jewel case. He opened it to reveal 
three CD's. &quot;It's
that Phish concert we listened to, I thought 
you might like having
a copy.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You shouldn't have. 
Are you really sure you want to give
me this, don't you want 
it?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's no problem, really. I can just make 
myself another
copy.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That's like so sweet, 
thanks.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hey Quinn, I was wondering, next week the 
opening band
at the concert tonight is going to be putting on a show 
nearby,
want to go?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn didn't really want to, but a 
plan quickly came to mind,
&quot;Sure, but only if you agree to get 
me tickets to the Backstreet
Boys concert in two weeks. For me and 
the rest of the Fashion
Club, floor seats.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave thought 
for a second, &quot;Deal, see you tomorrow.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn 
leaned up and gave him a quick peck on the cheek. &quot;See
you 
tomorrow Dave.&quot; Quinn watched as Dave walked back to
his car, 
then drove off.</P>

<P>The next day Quinn was delivering her report 
on fashion at
a Dave Matthews Band concert when Dave sauntered up. He 
was wearing
his usual attire, though his glasses were conspicuously 
missing.</P>

<P>&quot;Hey Quinn.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, hi Dave, we 
were just talking about the concert 
last
night.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Ah, discussing the music theory 
behind the chord progressions
in 'Crash Into Me?'&quot; The Fashion 
Club looked at him blankly.
&quot;Okay, forget I said anything.&quot; 
Sensing he was in trouble
he groped for a safer topic, &quot;Erm, hi, 
I'm Dave Wylie, I
don't think we've been 
introduced.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That's right, you haven't,&quot; 
Quinn said hastily.
&quot;Dave this is the Fashion Club. Um our 
president, Sandi Griffin.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hi there, pleasure to 
meet you. Tell me, is this a for-life
gig, or do you have term 
limits?&quot; Quinn winced at Dave's
flippant remark.</P>

<P>Sandi's 
eyes narrowed, &quot;Hello Dave, I would think a person
with the 
amount of money you have would be, like, a little 
more
fashionable.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave shrugged, an easy going smile on 
his face, &quot;Oh you
know, when you've got more money than God it 
really doesn't matter
what the little people think.&quot; He smirked 
at Sandi, who glared
at him.</P>

<P>Quinn coughed, &quot;Ahem, uhm, 
this is Stacy Rowe, she's the
secretary.&quot; Quinn just wanted to 
get this over with, considering
the way Dave behaved towards Sandi he 
would alienate the entire
Fashion Club in record 
time.</P>

<P>&quot;Ahh, yes, Ms. Stacy, I have something for 
you.&quot;
He reached into a pocket and withdrew a CD case. He handed 
it
to Stacy. &quot;A copy of Last night's Dave Matthews Band 
concert,
a little bird told me you were a 
fan.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;oh, thank-you, this is so cool. Dave 
Matthews is just
so adorable, I love him so much! I can't believe 
this, thank-you,
thank-you.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hey, no problem, I'm 
just sharing the groove.&quot; Again
the group looked at Dave like 
there was something growing out
of the side of his 
head.</P>

<P>&quot;Finally, this is Tiffany Blum-Deckler, she's out 
coordination
specialist.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave nodded, 
&quot;Howdy.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hello,&quot; Tiffany replied in her 
laconic fashion.</P>

<P>&quot;Say, Tiffany, if you want to hang out 
at my place next
4.20 I've got some absolutely dank Dead to listen 
to, I mean some
really choice Dick's Picks.&quot;</P>

<P>Tiffany 
looked at him blankly, &quot;4.20? Dead?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, 
you know&#133;&quot; Quinn dragged Dave away from
the rest of the 
group. They couldn't hear what was said between
the two. When Dave 
and Quinn returned his eyes were wide open,
&quot;I had no 
idea&#133;I mean look at here&#133;how can she
not be?&quot; he 
muttered to himself. &quot;Uh, forget I said
anything&#133;&quot; he 
glanced at his watch, &quot;Well, look
at the time, I seem to be 
overstaying my welcome, so it was nice
to meet the three of you, talk 
to you soon I hope. See you soon
Quinn. Sandi, Tiffany, Stacy take 
care.&quot; He waved to the
foursome and made a hasty 
exit.</P>

<P>&quot;Well, he's pretty much a loser; Quinn I hope you 
aren't
planning on going out with him 
again.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Actually Sandi I agreed to go see another 
concert with
him next week.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What? Quinn have you 
lost your mind?&quot;<BR>
</P>

<P>&quot;Oh no Sandi, you see if I go 
to the concert with him
he'll get the four of us tickets to see the 
Backstreet Boys.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Ah, so you're using him for his 
money and access, that
is the true hallmark of a Fashion Club member, 
especially if it's
for the good of the Fashion 
Club.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I knew you'd see it that way 
Sandi.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That boy is like a meal ticket Quinn, if 
you ever forget
that I guarantee you that other people won't, and be 
more than
happy to take him off your hands.&quot; Sandi let the 
not-so veiled
threat hang in the air as she changed 
subjects.</P>

<P>After Dave's encounter with the Fashion Club he 
headed to his
next class, along the way he ran into Daria and 
Jane.</P>

<P>&quot;&#133;So that's why the great Paint Experiment 
has to
go down as a failure, lack of patron support for the 
artist's
vision.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;How dare Tom have an opinion on 
how his room should look.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah well don't ask for 
my advice if you aren't going
to follow it.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I'll 
keep that in mind Rasputin.&quot; Daria noticed
Dave, &quot;Why 
there's our resident capitalist swine.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave stopped 
short of the pair, &quot;Ouch, comrade, I'm deeply
hurt you doubt my 
commitment to the Revolution. Have I done something
to offend 
tovarisch?&quot; For the last portion of his comment
Dave affected a 
bad Russian accent.</P>

<P>Jane shook her head, &quot;Nyet.&quot; 
She paused, &quot;Can
we do this in English? I get confused enough 
when people stick
to just one language, let alone 
two.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave chuckled, &quot;Si senorita, ingles es muy 
bueno.&quot;
Daria and Jane both regarded him coolly, &quot;Ok, ok, 
that was
too glib, just tell me how I've pissed you 
off?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's your money, under normal circumstances 
my parents
would have at least been a little mad at Quinn for that 
stunt
last night, but because it was with you they were 
fine.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave sighed and ran a hand through his hair, 
&quot;And you're
upset at the obviously flawed logic. Yeah, I hear 
you and agree
with you. Look, let me put it this way, I didn't ask to 
have a
father who has more money than most nations and believe me, 
while
that's great you can't imagine the price that both of use 
have
paid,&quot; Dave's face crumbled with long remembered pain. 
&quot;So,
yes, I get preferential treatment because I'm rich. It 
sucks and
it is stupid, but I'm not going to turn away a gift 
horse&#133;&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Just look out for the wooden 
ones.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, quite. But hey, I've got money, it 
provides me
certain luxuries so I'm going to take advantage of 
them.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Like my sister?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, 
I'll let her bleed money, tickets and other crap
for the honor of 
being seen in public with her. Don't worry about
Quinn Daria, she's 
using me as much as I'm using her.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That's 
healthy,&quot; Daria said coolly.</P>

<P>Dave shrugged, &quot;Not in 
a traditional sense, no. But we
both understand where things stand. 
We've got an unspoken agreement
that benefit's us both, where's the 
harm in that?&quot; With that
Dave ducked into O'Neill's classroom, 
leaving Daria and Jane in
the hallway.</P>

<P>Jane shrugged, 
&quot;He has a point.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria shook her head, &quot;This 
will all end badly, and I'll
have to clean it up, 
somehow.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, yeah, yeah, can we got to class, 
please?&quot;</P>

<P>And so life settled into a routine, of sorts. 
For every concert
by a band like Bela Fleck and Flecktones or 
Widespread Panic Dave
took Quinn to he either attended or provided 
her with tickets
to seeteen bands of the moment, like Christina 
Aguilera or 98
Degrees. For every shopping spree at Cashman's Dave 
financed Quinn
would sit through a moe concert. Quinn ignored her 
other admirers
simply because Dave could attend to all her needs. 
Despite this
the two still did no interact together a great a deal at 
school.
Even though they were considered by many to be the school's 
newest
&quot;power&quot; couple, the blending of Dave's wealth and 
Quinn's
raw popularity, they kept to themselves to a large degree. 
Daria
naturally viewed the whole thing at a distance and with 
great
disdain.</P>

<P>&quot;It's like one of those medieval arranged 
marriages,&quot;
She said to Jane one Day. &quot;Marriages for 
diplomacies sake
and not love's.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane frowned, 
&quot;And when have you cared about Quinn's 
love
life?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Never.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Then why 
are we talking about this? Unless you're secretly
pining for Dave. 
Concealing your wonton feelings for that hunk
of rich, disaffected 
teen behind a protective wall of denial,
cynicism and 
sarcasm.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria looked at Jane evenly, &quot;You've 
found me out, my
lust for Dave Wylie knows no bounds. Every time I 
see him with
my sister just tears at my soul.&quot; She stopped, 
&quot;And
if you believe that I have a lovely bridge for 
sale.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Better not be the one in Brooklyn, I 
already own it.
Ok, so if you don't care about the participants in 
this little
affair then why are you talking about 
it?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Because it exemplifies what is wrong with the 
world.
If Dave wasn't a rich boy my sister wouldn't even know his 
name,
but instead she's using him to get all the little baubles 
that
strike her fancy. And Dave is using that fact to make 
himself
more popular simply because he's the guy who's going out 
with
Quinn Morgendorffer.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Just admire the fine 
symbiotic nature of two parasitic
relationships and let it go. 
They'll flameout nastily, Dave will
lose his coolness and Quinn her 
sugar daddy, the equilibrium of
nature will be restored and life will 
continue onwards.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I suppose, but that doesn't 
mean I'm not ticked off about
it.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane slouched in her 
seat, &quot;Do tell.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria sighed, &quot;Ok, I admit, 
the reason I'm mad is because
of that job.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Didn't 
get it huh?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No, that's just it, I have no idea 
either way. I haven't
heard back from them. It's been almost a month. 
They could have
at least told me 'thanks for the resume, we're sorry 
but we don't
like you.'&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Gee Daria, for a second 
there I thought you didn't even
want the job.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I 
didn't but you'd think that they'd at least consider
me for an 
interview before rejecting me.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You'd think but 
then again I've stopped being surprised
at the stupidity of the 
world.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Too true&#133;so, what were we talking 
about before I
started railing about Dave and 
Quinn?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You know, I've forgotten, let's go get a 
slice to spark
our memories.&quot;</P>

<P>There is a school of 
thought that claims if you could see it,
all of time would be an 
infinite string of branching lines. Each
line and branch representing 
a decision and the course of events
that follow. However, to the 
person living their life often only
one of those infinite choices is 
apparent, and there is no way
to tell the truly momentous from the 
mundane when they occur.
Such divisions only become apparent after 
the fact. Such was the
case one night when Dave had taken Quinn to 
see the band String
Cheese Incident at a local club. Quinn was 
enjoying herself, more
or less, though not because of the club or the 
other attendees.
The room was filled with smoke, legal and illicit. 
Dave had, at
one point, mentioned that he wore old clothes to club 
shows because
he always walked out smelling like an ashtray. Quinn 
had a change
of clothes in car for after the show. In addition to the 
smoke
the audience had a particular fragrance all its own, to be 
blunt
they stunk. Unlike the more mainstream Dave Matthews Band, 
String
Cheese Incident attracted a wide range of aging flower 
children
and neo hippies, a good portion of whom did not believe in 
personal
hygiene. Quinn was relived to find Dave almost as disdainful 
of
them as she was.</P>

<P>&quot;God damn,&quot; Dave exclaimed when 
a particularly fragrant
individual walked past. &quot;Ok, so you 
don't have to smell like
a rose but taking a shower once a month 
won't kill you.&quot;</P>

<P>Knowing full well that Quinn would not 
react will in the crowd
Dave found the pair an out of the way corner 
of the room for them
to watch the band. Thanks to the particulars of 
the group's taping
policy he had left the majority of his recording 
equipment at
home.</P>

<P>&quot;All I need is my deck and a 
cable,&quot; he told Quinn.
&quot;The band supplies the rest. It's 
the main reason I want
to see these guys.&quot;</P>

<P>Despite all 
the detractions Quinn was enjoying herself. For
one thing she was on 
her third drink and was pleasantly buzzed,
one of the first things 
she had gotten from Dave was a high quality
id. Beyond the chemical 
stimulation Quinn enjoyed the music. To
her surprise she found that 
she liked the listen to the intricately
flowing jams of bands like 
Phish or String Cheese Incident. They
were nowhere near as good as 
Brittany Spears or the Backstreet
Boys, but in their own way Quinn 
appreciated them. Also, Quinn
was glad Dave was there. She was 
totally outside her realm and
his presence was comforting. At one 
point during the show they
were jostled together; Quinn found it far 
more comfortable to
stay where she was than to move away, so she 
stayed. Dave looked
a little startled, but slowly wrapped an arm 
around Quinn's shoulder.
They stayed that way for the rest of the 
show.</P>

<P>After the band's last set and encore Dave gathered up 
his deck
and the pair drove to a nearby motel for a quick shower and 
a
chance to change out of their smoky-apparel. Afterwards Dave 
drove
them back to the Morgendorffer residence.</P>

<P>&quot;So, 
you've been here a month, how do you like Lawndale?&quot;
Quinn 
asked, making small talk.</P>

<P>&quot;Well, it certainly is a low 
key town.&quot; Dave paused,
&quot;It's everything my dad was looking 
for in a town.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn frowned, &quot;How's 
that?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh well, like I've said before, my dad and 
I moved around
a lot. Lawndale's our fourth town in four years, and 
originally
the plan was that we were going to move to a quiet place 
where
I could spend my senior year and would be perfect for my dad 
to
retire in. Thanks to that bitch of a principal things have 
changed
slightly, but I guess I can endure two years of 
Lawndale.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You're lucky, I've got three more years 
here.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;In addition to all the years you were here 
before I showed
up.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;One 
year.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;One year?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;One 
year.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Really, I don't think I knew 
that.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, we like moved here last 
year.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;From where?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;This 
absolute armpit of a town in Texas.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Texas? My 
father's from Texas, where about did you 
live?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Highland, and I'm so glad we don't live 
there anymore.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Highland, is that anywhere near 
Arlen?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Um, yeah, why?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That's 
where my dad's from originally, Arlen.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But, 
you're not, I mean I could tell that much, you don't
even have a 
trace of a Texan accent.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Neither do 
you.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, I could if I wanted to,&quot; she 
drawled, &quot;But
this isn't Texas so why would anyone think that 
was cool?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Silly me, anyway, I've never lived in 
Texas so that's
why I don't have an accent.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I 
guess moving around kind of prevents you from picking
one 
up.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh no, the moving has all been recent, up 
until four
years ago the family lived in 
Vermont.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Then why don't you sound like that cute 
Matt Damon guy
in 'Good Will Hunting?'&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You mean 
why aren't we listening to Car Talk while I'm
complaining about how 
Nomar and the rest of the Red Sox are doing?&quot;
He replied in the 
unique accent of a Bostonian,&quot; &quot;Simple,
that was a South 
Boston-type accent&#133;&quot; He trailed off
and sighed, &quot;I'm 
being wonkish again aren't 
I?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Wonkish, overly 
studious&#133;oh never mind, short answer,
what you said, it's easier 
to disguise an accent than having to
endure the ridicule of your 
peers.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You do like to use big 
words.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave laughed, &quot;Yeah, I suppose so. Must be 
because I feel
like if I had to learn them why not use 
them.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No, don't apologize, I kind of like that, 
my sister talks
the same way, but she's always talking down to me. I 
used to look
up every word she called me to try and figure out how to 
get back
at her, but now I don't bother, she can't help the way she 
is,
so I think the best way to handle the situation is to simply 
rise
above her petty comments and jabs.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave laughed, 
&quot;Oh man Quinn, you're the only person I
know who can say stuff 
like that. You're worldview is just so
unique. Most people would say 
that Daria is an incredibly deep
person who makes truthful, incisive 
comments about life, and isn't
blinded by the sheen from popular 
culture.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And most people don't live with Daria on 
a daily basis.
Every question, simple request, even civil attempts at 
starting
a conversation are met with some snide, smug, sarcastic 
remark.
Like 'Daria, please pass the salt.' 'I would, but given the 
fact
that the entire universe is going to implode, and before 
that
the sun is going to expand and consume the earth, and before 
that
an asteroid will hit that will wipe out all life on earth, 
and
before that mankind is going to destroy itself either by 
nuclear
holocaust or environmental disaster I really don't feel like 
it.'
She goes out of her way to be depressed, miserable and a 
total
grouch to be around. Why should people like her if she 
doesn't
like them?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Isn't that the point? Daria 
knows enough to understand
that the most important person to please 
is yourself.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh come on Dave, everyone wants 
people to like them,
that's just human nature. You can't deny that 
you don't want people
to like you.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well some 
people sure, but it's not like I need the whole
world to love me, 
just a select few.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Trust me Dave, Daria cares 
about her self-image and what
people think of her, she just doesn't 
act on it.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave looked perplexed, &quot;Uh, I'm 
confused, just what exactly
are you saying?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn 
stared at Dave blankly, &quot;How the hell should I 
know?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But you were the one talking&#133;I figured 
you had some
point.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well duh, my sister's a 
hateful shrew who delights in
alienating people because she thinks 
she's better than us simply
because she gets better grades, never 
thinking that some people
might have other interests beyond 
school&#133;&quot; Quinn trailed
off.</P>

<P>Dave concentrated on 
driving the car for several minutes before
finally rousing himself to 
speak, &quot;Well all I have to say
is consider yourself lucky you 
have your sister as a rival.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What does that 
mean?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I guess it can't hurt to tell you the 
story, and let
me preface this by saying I'm not telling you this for 
any sympathy,
just so you know, and maybe gain a little appreciation 
for your
family.&quot; He paused and collected himself, &quot;Okay, 
so
you know that my family just consists of my dad and that 
something
cause the two of use to become nomads, well this is that 
story.
About four years ago my family lived in Vermont, my dad was 
an
exec with a tech firm in Boston, my mom was a local district 
attorney
and my sister and I went to an area private 
school.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Sister, you've neversaid you have a 
sister.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave nodded, &quot;Abby, she'd be about your 
age I guess. Anyway
it was the four of us, James, my father, my 
mother, her name was
Laura, me and Abby. And we had a great life, we 
were comfortable,
you know. I'd be lying if I said it was all 
sweetness and light
in the Wylie household, but my parents were still 
in love, Abby
and I got along, most of the time. I really didn't have 
any complaints...then
it happened.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It?&quot; 
Quinn asked, thought she knew where this was
going.</P>

<P>&quot;It 
was a winter night, the roads were icy, the guy had
too much to 
drink, the usual story. My mom was picking Abby up
from a school 
function&#133;&quot; He stopped and collected himself
again, &quot;If 
the police accounts are to be believed they died
on impact, didn't 
feel anything. The bastard wasn't even scratched,
and the real kick 
in the pants was that it wasn't even that son
of a bitch's first case 
of vehicular homicide. I'm personally
against the death penalty, but 
when you consider the quality of
the two lives that asshole wiped out 
with his fucking carelessness&#133;I
would gladly exchange his wasted 
worthless life for theirs&#133;&quot;
He paused, &quot;My mother was 
just an awesome woman, smart, funny,
committed to us and her job, 
there's not a day that goes by when
I wish I could ask her advice on 
something that's troubling me.
And my sister, she was smarter than 
me, she had so much potential.
She was either the next Mia Hamm, 
President, a Nobel Prize winner,
or CEO of the richest company in the 
world, maybe she was going
to be all of those.&quot; He stopped again 
to wipe tears from
his face. &quot;Sorry, always happen when I think 
about them&#133;after
the accident Dad quit his job and we started 
drifting. He founded
Wyl-E-Co and it went through the roof, so now 
we're looking for
a new home.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh Dave, that's so 
sad. I had no idea.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;How could you? I don't like 
to tell people the story.
I'm not looking for sympathy or 
understanding. I'm trying to move
on and live my life as best I can 
without two people whom I loved
dearly. Always talking about them 
won't help that. But just remember
this, no matter how much your 
sister annoys you, or your parents
get on your case, they love you, 
Daria included, and you love
them too. So consider yourself lucky 
Quinn, you've got a complete
family unit, a dysfunctional one, but a 
family nonetheless.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn stared out her window as she 
thought about what Dave
said, &quot;I guess so, but that doesn't mean 
I'm about to start
trying to get along with Daria, she's the one 
whose being stubborn.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Sure, fine, whatever, just 
don't take your family for
granted, that's all I'm 
saying.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;So&#133;&quot; Quinn said, groping for a 
new topic. &quot;Um,
would you believe I can't think of anything to 
say?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave chuckled, &quot;I don't either, you know 
silence can be
golden.&quot; Shortly thereafter Dave was navigating 
the streets
of Lawndale. &quot;Almost there now,&quot; He commented, 
Quinn
simply nodded. Dave pulled his car into the Morgendorffer 
driveway
and killed the ignition, &quot;Well it was a pleasant 
evening
Quinn, and I know I enjoyed the concert. Look, I know these 
bands
really aren't your kind of music, but I hope you at least 
aren't
totally bored or anything.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn shook her head, 
&quot;No, I had fun too Dave.&quot; The
two sat in silence for a 
moment. &quot;Hey Dave, why don't you
come in for something to drink, 
it was hot in that club and I
know I'm parched, besides I'm sure you 
could use a rest form all
that driving.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave stifled a 
yawn, &quot;Yeah, that sounds nice.&quot; The
two walked into the 
house.</P>

<P>Quinn led Dave into the kitchen and got a bottle of 
water from
the refrigerator, &quot;Here you 
go.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Thanks,&quot; Dave opened the bottle and 
started to drink
it on the spot.</P>

<P>Quinn got her own bottle 
from the refrigerator. &quot;Why don't
we drink these out in the 
living room, it'll be more comfortable
and we can watch 
TV.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave nodded and staggered in to the living room 
where he collapsed
on the sofa and grabbed the remote. Quinn followed 
him out and
sat down nearby. Dave randomly flipped through the 
channels until
he stumbled across a special on MTV. &quot;Hey cool, 
it's one
of those video retrospectives.&quot; They watched the TV in 
silence
for a while, &quot;You know, I was born too 
late.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hmm?&quot; Quinn asked, 
sleepily.</P>

<P>Dave waved at the TV which was playing a clip from 
some alternative
band. &quot;That's the music I identify with, the 
new stuff coming
out now,&quot; He shuddered. &quot;Sure, I was alive 
when grunge
was big, but I didn't really notice it, I was barely ten 
for crying
out loud. I guess I'm just the last Gen-X'er, or 
something&#133;&quot;
He trailed off.</P>

<P>&quot;You know, I can 
see that. That was like the first thing
I thought when I saw 
you.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What was that?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That you 
were like some reject from some lame Nirvana
cover 
band.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave laughed, &quot;It's funny you should say 
that, Phish has
actually covered Nirvana 
tunes.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;See, I was right.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;All 
except for the lame part, and I've never actually
tried to join Phish 
so I can't be a Phish reject&#133;&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You laugh more 
than most of the brainy/loser types I
know.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And 
just how many do you know?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Um, Daria, her friend 
Jane and&#133;you know, those are
the only two I 
know.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Then how can you make such a broad claim 
about geeks
everywhere based on your dealings with two 
pessimists?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, I can.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave 
chuckled, &quot;That's what makes you special Quinn, I
don't always 
agree with them, but you've got your convictions
and you stick to 
them, in your own way.&quot; Dave yawned, one
of those full-body 
yawns that threaten to break a person in two.
&quot;I really should 
be going, plus I doubt your parents would
be too happy to see me at 
this hour.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Don't worry about that, they're gone 
for the weekend
on some sort of retreat.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That's 
good,&quot; Dave tried to stand up, and failed,
&quot;Because right 
now I'm too tired to move.&quot; Dave turned
his attention back to 
the television. As he watched he found it
harder and harder to keep 
his eyes open. Eventually he fell asleep
with the sounds of Semisonic 
playing softy in the background.</P>

<P>&quot;Hey Dave, I just 
wanted to tell you I did have a great
time tonight, and I think 
you're a great guy and I've had a lot
of fun this past month.&quot; 
Quinn looked over at Dave and saw
that he was already asleep. She 
shrugged, leaned back on the couch
and drifted off as 
well.</P>

<P>Several hours later Daria came downstairs in search of 
a drink.
She found the TV still on, casting a flickering light over 
the
entire room. She looked over at the couch and say Dave and 
Quinn.
Over the course of the night Quinn ended up using Dave as a 
pillow
and Dave draped an arm over Quinn; they looked happy in 
their
slumber. Daria looked at the pair and was almost 
touched.</P>

<P>&quot;I wonder if I should wake them up?&quot; She 
thought
to herself, &quot;Nah, it's not my place.&quot; Daria got 
her
drink and went back to bed, after turning off the TV.</P>

<P>The 
next morning was awakened by the sunlight streaming into
the room. He 
started a little at the unfamiliar surroundings and
from the weight 
of Quinn on him, but settled back when he remembered
where he was. He 
looked at Quinn with a mixture of tenderness
and sadness on his face. 
Moving gently, so as not to wake her,
he disengaged himself from 
Quinn's sleeping form. Then, with even
more care he picked her up and 
carried her to her room. Dave placed
her on her bed, and tracked down 
a message pad. After he found
one he wrote Quinn a brief message, 
which he left by her bed.
Taking one last look at Quinn Dave let 
himself out of her room
and made his way to the door.</P>

<P>On his 
way out he ran into Daria, who was getting up for the
day. 
&quot;Well, look who it is, get a good night's sleep 
last
night?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave blushed, &quot;It's not quite what you 
think&#133;&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Relax, I saw the two of you 
downstairs.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, we were both pretty beat after 
the concert. Anyway
I'll see you at school next week&#133;&quot; He 
paused, &quot;Hey
Daria, want to go grab some breakfast? I know a 
great place to
get coffee and a 
cruller.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I&#133;guess,&quot; Daria replied 
slowly. &quot;Why?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I need to talk to someone 
about something, and Quinn
is the wrong Morgendorffer at the 
moment.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Sure, let me get dressed 
first.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave nodded, &quot;I'll be at my 
car.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria sighed and got dressed as quickly as 
possible. When she
walked out of her house she saw Dave leaning 
against he car, eyes
close. &quot;So are we getting coffee or do I 
get tot watch you
meditate all morning?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave's eyes 
snapped open, &quot;Coffee, definitely coffee.&quot;
He unlocked the 
car and started the ignition.</P>

<P>&quot;You aren't one of those 
psycho, hell-bent for leather
drivers are you?&quot; Daria asked as 
Dave swung the car out of
the driveway.</P>

<P>&quot;Not until I 
have my coffee.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Okay&#133;um, what's this all 
about then?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Not until I have my 
coffee.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria sighed, &quot;Oh, ha-ha coffee addict 
humor, very funny.
Now tell what's up or I'm jumping out of the 
car.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That wasn't humor, look, this is something 
that's going
to require me to be at least functional level to allow 
me to&#133;&quot;
he paused, searching for the right word, &quot;say 
what I want,
see, I can't even talk 
right.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Alright, it can wait&#133;uh, read any 
good books lately?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I'm trying to fight my way 
through 'On War' at the moment.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Planning a 
military takeover of Lawndale?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Nah, I could do 
that without Clausewitz's help.&quot;
He shrugged, &quot;I dunno, I'm 
reading it more to say I have
than any burning desire to learn 
anything.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I find that Clausewitz looses something 
in the translation.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;So you know 
German?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Uh, no, that's just what you're supposed 
to say in these
sorts of situations.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Daria, when 
have you been a person who does what you're
supposed 
to?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Most of the time. You don't know me very 
well.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I guess not.&quot; Dave drove up to the 
coffee shop and
pulled into a parking spot. &quot;We're here, if I 
may state the
obvious.&quot;</P>

<P>The two teens entered the shop. 
Dave selected a booth in a
corner, &quot; I'll go up and place our 
orders, what do you want?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Large coffee, black, 
nothing fancy.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Okay, I'll be right back.&quot; 
Dave walked over to the
counter. Daria took the opportunity to 
examine the shop. It was
a typical coffeehouse in the Starbucks vein. 
There was plenty
of space for people to talk, study, or sleep. A neon 
sign in the
door proclaimed the shop was open twenty four hours and 
several
of the patrons looked like they were taking full advantage 
of
those hours.</P>

<P>&quot;Ah, the coffee shop, haven to the 
pseudo-intellectual,
caffeine junkie, and overworked student.&quot; 
Daria thought to
herself as she took in the scene.</P>

<P>Dave 
returned carrying two very large mugs of coffee and a
plate full of 
doughnuts balanced on one of the mugs. &quot;One
large, black coffee 
for you madam.&quot; Daria took the uncovered
cup from 
Dave.</P>

<P>&quot;Thanks,&quot; Daria took a sip of her coffee and 
made
a face. &quot;Yikes, this is strong.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave drank 
from his cup and winced as well, &quot;Yeah isn't
it great? Let's you 
know you're alive, the only way to wake up
in the 
morning.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I think I'll stick to my alarm clock. 
Okay, you have
your coffee, talk.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave took a bite out 
of a doughnut, &quot;Where to begin, as
I'm sure you guessed this has 
to do with me and Quinn&#133;&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That much I did 
know, since I've been saying you two
were going to train 
wreck.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, yeah that remains to be seen. 
Basically like I
told you before the two of us had an agreement Quinn 
goes to stuff
I like if I bankroll her, and that worked out great for 
me because
that was all I wanted. Going out with Quinn gave me some 
measure
of popularity and really Quinn's demands were chump 
change.&quot;
Dave shrugged, I mean it was only money. So we had a 
great system
going.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Since you're using the past 
tense I'll assume something
went wrong.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave sipped his 
coffee before continuing, &quot;The problem
is that I've found myself 
actually enjoying Quinn's company. It
turns out you and your sister 
are cut from similar cloth after
all; it's just that Quinn's using 
her powers for evil, as it were&#133;and
no, I'm not saying that 
Quinn is some latent intellectual, or
an idiot savant, she's just 
real perceptive, and can get a really
good read on a person, 
sometimes, not to mention she can do spot
on mimicry of people.&quot; 
He stopped and examined the remaining
coffee in his mug. &quot;See 
what I mean? I'm even validating
her to you.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And 
you don't think Quinn feels the same way?&quot; Daria
wanted to 
finish this conversation as quickly as possible and
get on with her 
day. Quinn's love life really didn't interest
her.</P>

<P>&quot;I 
have no idea, and that's not the problem at 
hand.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well what is 
then?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Caitlyn 
Martin.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Who?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Caitlyn 
Martin.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Who's Caitlyn 
Martin?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Caitlyn Martin was the love of my life at 
my old town.
Last I knew she still was, sort of&#133;&quot; He 
stopped and
sighed, &quot;Let me try this again. Okay last year I 
went to
a lousy school, but I did meet this great person, Caitlyn. 
We
hung out a lot, went to concerts, that sort of thing. 
Eventually
we pretty much fell in love and saw each other constantly. 
I mean
we were inseparable. Kate is an amazing young woman, smart 
beautiful,
the whole package&#133;&quot; his voice took on a dreamy 
quality,
&quot;&#133;she has the most amazing silky blonde hair, and 
these
blue eyes you can just loose yourself 
in&#133;&quot;</P>

<P>Daria sighed, &quot;Okay, enough, I get the 
idea, can you please
get on with it before I 
vomit.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, sorry, well the year came and went and 
my dad said
we had to move again, for tax reasons mostly, also 
because the
town was a hole, and Kate and I never really broke off 
our thing,
so I guess we're still and item&#133;technically, sort 
of&#133;&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What does that 
mean?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;In all honestly I haven't heard from her 
since May, when
I left. The two of us didn't part of the best of 
terms, but we
didn't really break up.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;So you're 
unsure about what your growing feelings for
Quinn mean in contrast to 
this other, older relationship.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave nodded, 
&quot;Something like that, yes.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I'm not really an 
expert of this matter, but it seems
to me that if you haven't been in 
contact with this girl for four
months then maybe you should stop 
holding a torch for her.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I suppose, but Christ, 
give up Caitlyn for Quinn? That
isn't a fair 
deal.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And here I thought Quinn had hidden 
depths.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;She does, but Caitlyn was somebody 
special, we had one
of those unique bond type 
things.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Pardon me for asking, but what's the 
problem? If Caitlyn
is so wondrous drop Quinn like a bad habit and 
rekindle the old
flame.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave once again stared into his 
cup, &quot;I'm not sure I want
to do that either.&quot; He said 
softly.</P>

<P>Silence hung over the booth for a long while, finally 
Daria
spoke. &quot;I'll admit I haven't exactly been your most 
ardent
supporter since you moved to Lawndale; mainly because I 
didn't
know you, and after this little chat I can't say my opinion 
of
you has improved. I think your choice is obvious, pick 
somebody.
If you don't and just keep sitting on the proverbial fence 
then
you're going to end up in serious trouble. Beyond that I 
think
the boat has sailed with this other girl, so as much as it 
pains
me to say it, I think you're stuck with Quinn, may god have 
mercy
on your soul.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave sighed, &quot;Yeah, I suppose, 
thought it really is hard
to give up on Caitlyn just like that, maybe 
I should get in touch
with her and see where things stand 
before&#133;&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Absolutely not.&quot; Daria said 
forcefully. &quot;Quinn
would never stand for it, with her she's 
never second best and
if you even remotely suggest that she'd send 
you packing in a
heartbeat. I know my sister well enough to guarantee 
you that.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave grimaced, &quot;That does sound like 
Quinn.&quot; He drained
his cup, &quot;You set to 
go?&quot;</P>

<P>Daria shrugged, &quot;I suppose, what are you going 
to do?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, I'm going to take you home and then 
see if Quinn's
up.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Have you reached a 
decision?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave smiled sadly, &quot;Nope, but I did 
leave her a note saying
I'd be back to say goodbye, I mean what kind 
of an ass whole I
be if I didn't?&quot;</P>

<P>Daria smirked, 
&quot;In any other situation I'd say you were
an ok guy 
Dave.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave smiled, &quot;And 
now?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Alright you're still an acceptable person, 
even if you're
two-timing my sister,&quot; She paused. &quot;Come to 
think of
it, that's your most redeeming quality.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave 
sighed as he held open the door for Daria, &quot;Your
sister isn't 
that bad Daria.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria shrugged, &quot;I know, but she 
doesn't make it easy
to live with her.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave laughed, 
&quot;She says the same thing about you.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria smirked, 
&quot;I guess we are more alike than I thought.&quot;
Dave laughed 
and unlocked the car.</P>

<P>Dave drove them back to the 
Morgendorffer household. Daria
let them into the house. Dave walked 
into the living room and
rocked on his feet 
nervously.</P>

<P>&quot;I'll go see if Quinn's 
up.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Thanks Daria.&quot; Dave started to whistle 
tunelessly,
before long Daria came back 
downstairs.</P>

<P>&quot;Take a seat, she's in the shower so it'll 
be a while.&quot;
Daria headed for the door. &quot;Good 
luck.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Where are you going?&quot;</P>

<P>Daria 
looked around, &quot;Out. I have a feeling I don't want
to be around 
here.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave chuckled, &quot;That's probably a wise idea. 
Take it easy
Daria, thanks for the chat.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Don't 
mention it, discussing human frailty is a favorite
hobby of 
mine.&quot; Daria picked up her backpack and walked out
the 
door.</P>

<P>Dave sat on the couch, aimlessly staring around the 
room. He
sighed and walked outside to retrieve the newspaper. He 
settled
back down on the couch and began to read. By the time Quinn 
came
downstairs Dave had already read the comics, sports and was 
starting
on the front page.</P>

<P>Quinn was somewhat surprised to 
see Dave sitting on the couch,
&quot;Oh, good morning Dave. I wasn't 
expecting to find you here.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave folded up the paper 
and smiled, &quot;What you didn't
believe my 
note?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn shrugged, &quot;It just said you'd be 
seeing me today.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What can I say, I don't have 
anywhere else to go.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn shuffled her feet, &quot;So, 
what do you want to talk
about?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, I just wanted 
to say I had a great time last night
and I'll see you Monday.&quot; 
Dave stood up and moved to the
door.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh&#133;well I did 
too.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, bye Quinn.&quot; Dave hesitated for a 
moment then
pulled Quinn into an affectionate hug. He kissed her and 
then
quickly left before Quinn could respond.</P>

<P>Later that day 
Quinn was at Stacy's house describing the previous
night's 
experiences. &quot;Oh, it was horrible, the audience was
full of 
hippies, and not just posers, real smelly hippies. Wearing
filthy 
tie-died clothes and their hair was all braided in ratty
dreadlocks, 
and it just so didn't work for them, especially since
none of them 
had bathed in like forever.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh Quinn it sounds so 
awful, it's really great of you
to put yourself through such 
hardships for the Fashion Club, we
are getting those tickets for 
NSync right?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Dave said he'd have them by the end 
of the week.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, that's great, this is going to 
be so cool. I'm just
sorry you had to go through that ordeal with the 
hippies.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, you know, I have my duty to my 
friends, besides
Dave was there so it wasn't all 
bad.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Really? You mean you like 
him?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn stopped for a moment, &quot;I guess, I don't 
know, he's
a nice enough guy, and he has been really cool about 
getting us
to shows and stuff.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But he's a geek, 
why would you want to seriously go out
with a 
geek?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;He's not a geek. Sure he's smart and 
doesn't like a lot
of popular stuff, but he does un-geeky stuff too, 
like go to all
those concerts, and he drinks and 
stuff.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Doesn't make him any less of a 
loser.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And he's given you all that Dave Matthews 
stuff, for
free.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh my god, that's right. Ok he's 
not a total loser&#133;still
Sandi doesn't like him, what do you 
think she'll do if she thinks
you're going out with him because you 
like him, and not because
you want stuff from 
him?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn frowned, &quot;Sandi can go suck a 
lemon&#133;don't tell
her I said that. I'm going out with Dave 
because I kind of like
him, but more importantly I am getting stuff 
from him, so why
change things?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Quinn you are 
just so clever.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I know, now tell me, what do you 
think I should war to
school next week?&quot;</P>

<P>The following 
Monday progressed as usual for Quinn, with teachers
droning on and on 
about things she didn't see the point to 
care
about.</P>

<P>&quot;Now class,&quot; DeMartino bellowed, 
&quot;I know it's
a little early to mention your research papers, but 
I figure if
I start talking about it now it might seep into your 
pea-sized
brains and you'll actually remember it for a change. Your 
papers
are due six weeks from today, you may pick your topic, but 
it
must be at least ten pages in length and it must be at least 
remotely
researched. Good luck, I have a feeling you're going to need 
it.&quot;
During DeMartino's diatribe Quinn was busily examining her 
finger
nails. On her way to lunch she ran into 
Dave.</P>

<P>&quot;Hey Quinn how you doing?&quot; Dave asked as he 
pulled
her into a brief hug.</P>

<P>&quot;Hi Dave, I'm fine, thanks 
for asking.&quot; Quinn replied
as she hastily pulled herself 
away.</P>

<P>&quot;Say Quinn, would you mind stopping by my house 
after
school? There's something I want to talk to you 
about.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I can't I have a Fashion Club meeting 
after school.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Can't you ditch this one? Please, 
it's important.&quot;
Quinn's indecision was visible. &quot;I'll 
throw in dinner as
well.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Ok, I think I can give 
Sandi a good excuse.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Great, I'll pick you up out 
in the parking lot?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn shrugged, 
&quot;Fine.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Thanks a lot Quinn, see you 
then.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Bye Dave.&quot; Impulsively Quinn gave Dave 
a peck on
the cheek and continued on her way to lunch.</P>

<P>After 
school Quinn found Dave waiting beside his car. &quot;Hi,
this is 
sort of exciting. I haven't seen your house yet.&quot;
She said as 
she slid into the VW.</P>

<P>Dave shrugged as he steered the car, 
&quot;There's not too
much to see, just a lot of empty 
rooms&#133;it's pretty much just
my dad and me living 
there.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You don't have any servants? I know if I 
were rich I'd
surround myself with servants, I'd love to have a 
butler.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Nope, not a one, it's something we don't 
need on a day
to day basis&#133;well ok, I lied we do have a cook, 
that's more
because it's usually a bad idea for me and my dad to try 
to cook.&quot;
Dave paused, &quot;That was a terrifically 
stereotypical thing
for me to say wasn't it?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn 
shrugged, &quot;I still don't see why you don't have
more 
servants.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave sighed, &quot;I dunno, it's just not who 
we are I guess,
well, there are my dad's aides, they count I 
suppose&#133;so I'm
lying to you, we do have servants, just not 
traditional ones&#133;&quot;
He paused,, &quot;Why in hell are we 
talking about this?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I don't know, you brought it 
up. I figured that Mr. Brain
knew what he was 
saying.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Quinn there are times when even the 
brightest genius
talks out of his 
ass.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh.&quot;</P>

<P>They drove on until Dave 
pulled in front of a wrought iron
gate. He leaned out of the car and 
typed a number into a keypad
positioned by the gate. Noiselessly the 
gate swung open and Dave
drove the car up a long driveway. They 
eventually stopped next
to a very large house, &quot;Well, this is 
it, the new Wylie Manor.&quot;
The house was of a style best 
described as modern Victorian. An
array of satellite dishes bristled 
on one end of the lawn and
a large assortment of wires snaked out of 
the house. &quot;Come
on, I'll give you the nickel tour.&quot; Dave 
lead Quinn inside.</P>

<P>The interior of the house was elegantly 
appointed, yet at the
same time lifeless, like it was a catalog for 
wealthy homeowners.</P>

<P>&quot;This is the reception area, where 
my dad has social functions,
I don't spend anytime here, the other 
side of the house is the
nerve center for the family business, so I'm 
sure you don't want
to see that. Let's go check out the habitation 
zone.&quot; He
motioned for Quinn to follow him through a set of 
double doors.</P>

<P>&quot;How big is this place?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave 
shrugged, &quot;I've never bothered to ask, big enough
and then some. 
Okay, we're now in the living quarters, there's
a gym and rec room 
downstairs, the first floor's library and study
space. My dad has the 
second floor and I have the third.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You have a 
whole floor to yourself?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave shrugged, &quot;It's 
really no big deal; my bedroom, a
bathroom, a personal study, and 
some storage space. I mean I have
a fourth of a third of the total 
floor space, it's not that much
if you think about it, one 
twelfth.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Still you must have amazing closet 
space.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I suppose, never really 
checked.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, you just have to show them to 
me.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Uh, ok, this way.&quot; Quinn followed Dave 
up several
flights of stairs and into his room. Dave's room was 
exactly as
Quinn had imagined it, only larger. The walls were 
decorated solely
with band posters. In one corner of the room a large 
array of
computer equipment sat. In another a small recording 
studio's
worth of audio equipment. Dave's bed was positioned in 
between
them while the other wall was dominated by a large bay 
window
that overlooked the back half of the estate. There were 
bookshelves
filled with CD's and DAT's. While the floor was littered 
with
books, papers and other bits of flotsam and jetsam. Quinn 
walked
over to what looked like the closet door and threw it 
open.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh my god, this is the most beautiful thing I've 
ever
seen&#133;well not the clothes but look at all this 
space.&quot;
The closet was cavernous, Dave's clothes took up just a 
small
portion of the available space.</P>

<P>&quot;Hey Quinn, mind 
pulling up a seat, we need to have that
talk.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hm, 
what?&quot; Quinn asked as she pulled herself away
from the closet. 
&quot;Oh, sure.&quot; She sat down on the bed
and Dave rolled a chair 
over from his computer workstation. &quot;Now
what's this all 
about?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, we've been hitting shows and doing 
other stuff
for about a month now, and I'd like to think that in that 
time
we've built some measure of rapport.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Uh, 
sure.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave stood up and walked overto his desk. He 
picked up a framed
picture and returned to his chair. &quot;It's 
because of that
rapport&#133;hell, I like you Quinn, you're an 
interesting person
to be around, and because of that there's 
something I really have
to tell you.&quot; He handed Quinn the photo. 
&quot;This is Caitlyn
Martin, we went out last 
year.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn looked at the picture, it showed a pretty 
blonde with
blue eyes who wore glasses. Quinn shrugged, she was much 
cuter,
&quot;So?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Dave rubbed his hands together, 
&quot;So, I'm not sure
if I'm done with her or 
not.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You mean you're still seeing her?&quot; 
Anger flashed
in Quinn's eyes.</P>

<P>&quot;No, no, nothing like 
that at all. I haven't talked to
her since I moved&#133;we just left 
things unsettled.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Dave, what does this have to do 
with me?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, I'm thinking about seeing where 
things stand with
her.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, then what about 
me?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I'm not saying you're a bad person Quinn, but 
Caitlyn's
special.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I see, and I'm not 
special,&quot; Anger began to creep
into her voice.</P>

<P>Dave not 
quite realizing his mistake pressed on. &quot;It's
just that Caitlyn 
is&#133;well, we understood each other, we connected,
it's hard to 
explain.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;If she's so great why were you going out 
with me?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Why do you think? For starters you asked 
me out, and
then after that, hey I was going out with the great Quinn 
Morgendorffer,
why should I rock that boat, it's a ticket to 
acceptance. Why
were you going out with me?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;For 
you money, but that's different.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh really, I 
fail to see it.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Guys go out with me because they 
like me, I go out with
them for what they give me for that privilege. 
That's how it works.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave's anger started to show now 
as well. &quot;Okay, thanks
for clearing that up, now all I need to 
know is how that's different
from a hooker and I'm all set.&quot; The 
two of them were standing,
glaring at the each 
other.</P>

<P>&quot;You son of a bitch.&quot; Quinn growled, 
&quot;How dare
you call me that.&quot; She balled her fist and swung. 
She hit
Dave square in the jaw, sending him crashing to the 
ground.</P>

<P>Dave stood up slowly, rubbing his jaw. &quot;I guess 
I had
that coming. Quinn I'm sorry.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn crossed her 
arms and didn't look at Dave, &quot;I'd like
to go home 
now.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave nodded, &quot;Fine, um, I am sorry, how about 
dinners
on me for the rest of the week?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn shook her 
head, &quot;No, I don't think so.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave sighed, 
&quot;Look Quinn I want to make it up to you.&quot;</P>

<P>She 
looked at Dave evenly, &quot;You can, by going to 
hell.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Okay, fine, be that way.&quot; Dave said as 
he threw
up his hands in frustration. He walked over to his desk and 
picked
up an envelope. &quot;Here are those tickets for you and 
your
cronies, enjoy them cause they're your last from 
me.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Fine, I don't need your tickets. We'll see 
how long you
last being shunned by everyone before you come back and 
apologize.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave laughed, &quot;Apologize? I already 
tried just now, twice.
If you think I'm going to do so again you're 
delusional. If people
at school stop talking to me, fine. I don't 
give a rat's ass what
anyone in the insipid place things about me, 
you included.&quot;
Dave caught himself and sighed, &quot;I think you 
should be going
home now Quinn, come on I'll give you a 
lift.&quot;</P>

<P>The drive back to the Morgendorffers' was 
completed in silence.
As soon as the car came to a stop Quinn started 
to get out. Dave
grabbed her shoulder in an effort to restrain 
her.</P>

<P>&quot;Quinn I&#133;&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Let go of me, 
you geek. I don't know why I ever thought
a nerd like you would be a 
person to go out with.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Because I'm 
rich?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hm, yes, that was it, too bad you turned 
out to be such
a loser.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;If that's the way you're 
going to be about this fine,
I'm sorry to see that this is how things 
turned out.&quot; He
let go of Quinn. &quot;But I guess what else 
should I have expected
from a spoiled brat like 
you.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn's face flashed with anger and she stormed 
out of the
car. She turned, &quot;You can just fuck off!&quot; Quinn 
walked
inside her house, slamming the door dramatically as she 
went.</P>

<P>Dave angrily raked a hand through his hair, 
&quot;Fuck!&quot;
He shouted as he pounded the steering wheel. He 
sighed, put the
car into gear, and drove off.</P>

<P>The next day 
Dave was talking to Mack during lunch, &quot;I'd
be more than happy 
to trade some Ben Harper for a G. Love and
Special Sauce show or 
two.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Great, I've been dying to hear some of their 
summer shows,
you've got my list right?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave nodded, 
&quot;Yeah, I'll have your discs 
tomorrow.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Cool.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave extended a 
hand, &quot;Pleasure doing business with 
you
Mack.&quot;</P>

<P>Before Mack could respond Quinn and the rest 
of the Fashion
Club walked past. &quot;Oh look, it's Lawndale's 
favorite stoner,
found the color of the music yet 
Dave?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave smiled wryly, &quot;Hey Quinn, clothes go 
out of style
yet?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn huffed in exasperation, 
&quot;For your information I'm
never out of 
style.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave's smile turned into a sickly grin, 
&quot;Sorry to say
it sweetheart but around here you just did, now 
run along and
torment some other poor slob, you're boring me 
kid.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn's fists tightened with rage, &quot;I don't 
have to stand
here and be insulted by a loser.&quot; With that she 
pivoted on
one heel and stormed off.</P>

<P>&quot;Gee, for someone 
who is so rich you sure are a bigger
loser than I ever thought 
possible.&quot; Sandi sniffed as she
walked 
away.</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah&#133;loser,&quot; was Tiffany's only 
comment.</P>

<P>&quot;Um, yeah, you're a real dork&#133;but thank 
you so much
for those Dave Matthews Band concerts, that was so nice 
of you&#133;&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Stacy we're leaving, hurry up 
please, or do you want
to be seen associating with a known 
geek?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Eek, coming Sandi.&quot;</P>

<P>Once the 
Fashion Club was out of range Mack turned to Dave,
&quot;What the 
hell was that?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave shrugged, &quot;Quinn and I broke 
up for lack of a better
word and I guess that means my name is 
mud&#133;is it too late
to join the football 
team?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Uh, yeah, the season's already half over, 
but why would
you want to do that?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Seemed like 
it'd be a good way to lay low for a while,
you know, lose myself in a 
group. Plus it'd be damage control
from the oncoming 
assault.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh come on, she's just blowing off 
steam, she wont&#133;&quot;
Mack paused, &quot;Oh, I see what you 
mean.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave absent-mindedly pushed a stray lock of hair 
out of his
eyes as he thought. &quot;Well, other than a sport I'm 
drawing
a blank on something for me to do, how about 
you?&quot;</P>

<P>Mack sighed, &quot;Yeah, me too. I can ask Jodie 
if she can
thinking of something for you.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Cool, 
thanks man.&quot; They slapped hands.</P>

<P>&quot;Hey, no problem, 
you're a pretty cool guy Dave; Lawndale
needs a few more folks like 
you.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh Mack, stop, you're making me blush, 
you'll just sweet
talk me right into bed&#133;uh never mind. Take 
care man.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;See you later Dave.&quot; Mack watched 
as Dave casually
sauntered out of the cafeteria.</P>

<P>&quot;What 
was that all about?&quot;</P>

<P>Mack turned in surprise, but 
relaxed when he saw Jodie, &quot;Oh,
nothing&#133;hey Jodie, you ever 
think that rich white-boys are
going to become the next fashionably 
persecuted minority?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Huh? What do you mean, they 
have everything.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I know,&quot; Mack mused, 
&quot;That's the problem.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What's got into 
you?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Mack shook his head, &quot;Forget it, not 
important.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hey Mack-daddy, check this 
out&#133;whoa! Help, I'm stuck.&quot;
Kevin's voice rang out across 
the cafeteria.</P>

<P>Mack sighed, &quot;Excuse me, I have to go 
extract my quarterback
from a garbage can.&quot;</P>

<P>Later that 
afternoon Mr. O'Neill was attempting to lead a class
discussion on 
their current reading assignment. &quot;Now class,
what can you tell 
me about Aldus Huxley's 'Brave New World'?&quot;
Kevin raised his 
hand, &quot;Yes Kevin?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That the future is going 
to be real cool with everybody
having sex and 
stuff.</P>

<P>&quot;Um, well yes, but what point is Huxley trying to 
make
when he describes the rampant promiscuity in the Brave New 
World?&quot;
This time Brittany raised her hand. &quot;Yes, Brittany 
what are
your thoughts?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I thought it was just so 
romantic when the two people
ran away from everyone else and went to 
live on that island.&quot;</P>

<P>O'Neill chuckled painfully to 
himself, &quot;Now Brittany that
was the ending the TV movie 
adaptation, it's not how the book
ends.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's 
not?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh no, in the book John hangs himself and 
the Brave New
World continues on like nothing 
happened.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But that's so sad, I like my ending 
better.&quot;</P>

<P>The besieged teacher looked pleasingly towards 
Daria and Dave's
side of the room, &quot;Does anyone have anything 
else to add?&quot;</P>

<P>Daria sighed and raised a hand. 
&quot;Huxley was writing a
cautionary tale about the dangers of an 
overly capitalistic society.
The funny thing is that nobody paid 
attention and now we live
in a brave new world, complete with soma 
and over active consumerism.
All that's missing is the test tube 
babies. If we aren't cramming
Ritalin down kid's throats, we're 
eating Prozac like Pez. And
just so that even though the world's 
going to hell in a hand basket
we can put on a smiley face for 
everyone else to see.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, I don't know about 
that, drugs certainly do have
their time and place.&quot; Dave 
interjected.</P>

<P>&quot;Sure, if you have a real psychological 
problem, but not
if you're just in a funk.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Even 
then, just to give you a little something to help
smooth over the 
rough patch till you're back on your feet, what's
the harm in 
that?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What's the harm? You're denying basic human 
emotions,
what's happy if you aren't sad? You can't have one without 
the
other.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But why not just shoot for the happy 
medium and go through
life content. Look, say you're a generally 
happy, well-adjusted
person, then something really bad happens, like 
your dog dies.
That's an awfully sad thing and you'll always miss 
your dog, but
in time it won't be as painful because you have to live 
your life.
But, until then you're going to cry your eyes out cause 
you're
that broken up about it. What I'm saying is why go through 
all
that? Just pop a pill, smoke a joint, whatever, any time you 
feel
the grief coming on and eventually the grief will fade and 
you'll
be back to normal.&quot; The rest of the class just stared 
as
Dave and Daria argued.</P>

<P>&quot;That's wonderful, if it 
wasn't a load of crap. Just because
you can find an out doesn't mean 
you have to use it. What you've
said sounds like an excuse a junkie 
would come up with. We feel
emotions for a reason and trying to 
circumvent them is a bad idea.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What about when 
the pain is so bad you feel like it's
going to drag you under? I'm 
not saying we need a soma filled
society, but, doctors believe that 
pain impedes the body's healing
process, so that's why the prescribe 
painkillers, why should the
psyche be any different? Maybe mental 
pain hurts the healing process
as well, and stuff like Prozac is a 
pain killer.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That's absurd, you're suggesting the 
equivalent of taking
morphine for a skinned 
knee&#133;&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hehehehe, while this is really a very 
positive debate
the two of you are having can we get the discussion 
back to Brave
New World?&quot; O'Neill said hastily, trying to regain 
order.
&quot;Now, does anyone else have something to add?&quot; The 
room
was silent, &quot;No one? Come now, this is one of the great 
novels
of the Twentieth Century, surely it struck some chord with 
you
when you read it.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's a little hard to talk 
about a work of fiction that's
a reality for the reader.&quot; Daria 
commented.</P>

<P>&quot;Ooo, can I be an Alpha? I've always wanted 
to be an Alpha.&quot;
Jane added. The rest of the class sat in 
silence until the bell
rang.</P>

<P>&quot;We&#146;ll pick this up 
where we left off tomorrow.&quot;
O'Neill said hopefully to the 
departing students. &quot;Oh, Daria,
Dave can I talk to you for a 
moment?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, sure.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave shrugged 
noncommittally.</P>

<P>&quot;That was a really inspired debate the 
two of you were
having, do you think you two could write up position 
papers and
then read them to the class, for some extra 
credit?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave glanced at Daria out of the corner of his 
eye, &quot;Gee
I'd love to, but I really don't need any extra credit. 
Thanks
for the offer though.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I refuse on the 
ground that it involves public speaking
and unfairly singles out my 
opinion on the topic; thus implying
that my fellow classmates are 
lacking in worth,&quot; Daria said
flatly.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh dear, 
you're right.&quot; The teacher wrung his hands,
&quot;Do you think 
the rest of the class would be 
receptive&#133;&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No!&quot; The two teens said 
forcefully.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh well, thank-you both for your 
time.&quot;</P>

<P>After the teens exited the classroom Daria turned 
to face Dave.
&quot;Do you really believe that line of guff you gave 
about drugs?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave shrugged, &quot;Hey, I'm a stoner 
aren't I? Why disappoint
my fans?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Your fans, what 
the hell are you&#133;you told Quinn
about that other girl and it 
blew up in your face.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave shrugged again, &quot;Had 
to, what kind of a dick would
I be if I 
didn't.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;True, you get honesty points&#133;ok, 
that answers my
question.&quot; Daria paused, &quot;Um, don't let 
anything Quinn
says get to you, she doesn't know any 
better.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave waved a hand dismissively, &quot;Like I 
care what a bunch
of self-involved teens think about me, but thanks 
for your concern.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Don't mention 
it.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Ever?&quot; Dave asked 
impishly.</P>

<P>&quot;All I ask is that when you write your 
memoirs, and you
will, don't bring this up.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave 
chuckled, &quot;Take it easy Daria.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You 
too.&quot; The pair headed off to their separate
classes.</P>

<P>As 
is often the case in life, that which is new and different
quickly 
becomes routine. The alterations in the fabric of people's
existence 
soon simply became a part of the pattern. This was definitely
true in 
Lawndale, where the acrimony between Quinn and Dave faded
into the 
background. Quinn never failed to get shot in at Dave
whenever their 
paths crossed. Dave, for his part, gave as good
as he got, though in 
truth neither party sought the other out.
Quinn returned to her 
normal routine while Dave launched an image
improvement campaign, of 
sorts.</P>

<P>&quot;I'm going to make myself popular, in a 
way.&quot; He
explained to Daria one day while she was at his house 
going over
school work. &quot;I'll try my hand at the swim time right 
now,
maybe run track in the spring. Plus I'll throw parties, lots 
of
parties.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Don't you think you're being a little 
obvious? Besides
what do you care about 
popularity?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave shrugged, &quot;For one thing I doubt 
many of our fellow
classmates have read the Prince and hell, what 
else is there to
do? And I was going to do the swim thing anyway, for 
entirely
different 
reasons.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Namely?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's easier 
to forget how much your life can suck when
you're totally exhausted. 
Physical pain always takes precedence
over 
emotional.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria raised an eyebrow, &quot;While I don't 
doubt that I don't
see how it applies here.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave took 
off his glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose.
&quot;I emailed 
Caitlyn, asked her what's up, you know, the 
usual
stuff.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Let me guess, she's seeing somebody 
else and doesn't
share your sentimentality.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Damn 
strait, not only is she seeing somebody else, but
it's the star 
football player to boot, and they started going
out not a week after 
I left.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;At the risk of look like an ass I will 
point out that
you shouldn't have gotten in touch with her,&quot; 
Daria paused,
&quot;Um, you're ok right?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave chuckled, 
&quot;What, are you afraid that I'm suppressing
all my rage about my 
fucked up love life and that the pressure
will cause me to snap in a 
violent manner. Most likely at school,
lashing out, seeking 
retribution for all the grievous wrongs the
various social cliques 
have inflicted up upon me? That I might
settle Quinn's hash with a 
hail of bullets and that you might
get caught in the 
crossfire?&quot;</P>

<P>Daria squirmed in her seat, &quot;Well, uh, 
something like
that, yes.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave laughed, &quot;Do I 
really give off that much of a disturbed
white boy 
vibe?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's your preternatural calm, serial 
killers are always
the quiet ones.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;So I guess 
that means I have to keep an eye on you.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria smirked, 
&quot;I admit to nothing, and no I didn't think
you were primed to 
fly into a killing rage. Though I was a little
worried you might do 
something stupid and rash, like start swearing
at Ms. Li or 
something&#133;you aren't right?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I wasn't 
planning on it, but now that you mention it.&quot;
Dave shrugged, 
&quot;I dunno, I guess deep down I really was over
Caitlyn I just 
couldn't admit it, and well, considering how fast
and far Quinn 
booted me that's not really a big loss either, it's
like my therapist 
says, look for the positive.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You have a 
therapist?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave nodded, &quot;Yeah, pretty much ever 
since my mom and
sister died. I was pretty fucked up by that.&quot; 
He regarded
his hands, &quot;Still am.&quot; He shook his head, 
&quot;Feeling
sorry for myself won't get me anywhere, let's go get 
some pizza
and look over that econ stuff.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You're 
buying right?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave chuckled, &quot;I always seem to end 
up paying when it
involves the Morgendorffer 
girls.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Just remember, I'm the cheap one&#133;that 
didn't come
out right did it?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave laughed, &quot;No, I 
don't think so, but I see what you're
saying, getting pizza with you 
and Jane while we go over school
work is a hell of a lot lighter on 
my wallet compared to dinners
at Chez Pierre.&quot; Dave got up from 
his chair and walked over
to the door. Daria 
followed.</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, about that, there's something I've been 
meaning
to say.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well spill it 
then.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria sighed, &quot;I can't believe I'm saying 
this but Quinn
did go with you to a concert by a band named String 
Cheese Incident.
You didn't force her to go and I'm sure you would 
have taken no
for an answer.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave grimaced, &quot;So 
what you're saying is any girl who
would voluntarily go to a String 
Cheese Incident concert is one
to keep?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No, but 
that does sound better.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave sighed, &quot;I really 
fucked things up didn't I?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No more than anyone 
else, now go buy me pizza.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave chuckled, &quot;Yes 
ma'am.&quot;</P>

<P>As the week progressed people started to hear 
murmurs about
an imminent gathering. Flyers were soon seen for 
&quot;The Party
for a Party's Sake Party.&quot; No name was given to 
reveal the
identity of the host, but people knew. The rumor mill 
began to
churn out information to satisfy the demand for details. 
There
was going to be a keg, drugs would be plentiful, everyone 
would
have to take a hit of LSD to get in, the band Phish would 
being
flown in to provide the music, and so on. Naturally the 
party
was high on the agenda of that week's Fashion Club 
meeting.</P>

<P>&quot;Alright, Dave Wylie's party, do we 
attend?&quot; Sandi
asked imperiously.</P>

<P>&quot;I say we don't 
Dave Wylie is such a loser, he'll probably
serve cheese and expect we 
all play board games or something.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Gee Quinn, if 
he's that big a loser why did you go out
with him for like a whole 
month?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn frowned, &quot;I don't see you complaining 
about all
the free stuff he gave you because I went out with 
him.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well I heard that the entire football team 
is going.&quot;
Stacy said, trying to avoid a 
fight.</P>

<P>&quot;And the cheerleaders too,&quot; Tiffany 
added.</P>

<P>&quot;Well, then it sounds like this will be the 
social gathering
of like, the week. We as members of the most 
prestigious club
in Lawndale cannot miss any opportunity to 
demonstrate our superiority.
Agreed?&quot; Stacy and Tiffany nodded, 
Quinn just scowled. &quot;Then
it's settled, we will be at Dave 
Wylie's party, but for Quinn's
sake, no dates, we don't want it to 
look like we think this is
that important.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Okay, 
fine just so long as I don't have to see Dave.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Of 
course Quinn, I always have your best interest in
mind. Now Stacy, 
what's next on our agenda?&quot;</P>

<P>The week passed and the day 
of the party grew near. The day
before the event flyers were found 
posted over the school providing
the location of the gathering, the 
Wylie property, as well as
making it quite clear that the affair was 
open invitation. Jane
showed Daria the flyer after 
school.</P>

<P>&quot;Did you get a look at these 
things?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I tried not to, but considering they were 
all over school,
they were kind of hard to 
miss.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I must say I was surprised, throwing a 
kegger seems like
a rather obvious ploy to get the acceptance of our 
peers..&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;As Dave said, we are talking about 
Lawndale High students,
subtlety is lost on them. They'll go drink 
the beer and it won't
even occur to them that there might be some 
ulterior motive behind
it.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Want to 
go?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I refuse to participate in any activity 
involving my
fellow students, you know that.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Good 
thing too, because Tom and I already had something
planned for that 
night.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What would you have done if I said 
yes?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Would you, ever, in a million 
years?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That's not at issue 
here.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Ah my friend, that is where you are wrong, 
for you live
in a hypothetical world, while I live in the real world, 
and I
know that you would never bother yourself with a 
party.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Uh Jane, I hate to burst your bubble, but 
you spend more
time imagining things than I 
do.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh hell, you're right, at least give me this 
moment will
you?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What moment is 
that?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The one where for a brief fleeting moment I 
was more
practical than the great pragmatist Daria 
Morgendorffer.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;By all means go ahead, and while 
you're doing that I'll
head home and watch the spectator sport of the 
Twenty-first century.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Would this be watching your 
parents trying to be archetypal
parental role 
models?&quot;</P>

<P>Daria shook her head, &quot;No, that was last 
century. The
new sport is watching Quinn get ready for this 
party.&quot; She
waved the flyer Jane had been 
holding.</P>

<P>&quot;Ah yes, I can see how that would provide hours 
of entertainment,
provided you had the proper perspective, and an 
endless supply
of droll comments.&quot; She looked pointedly at 
Daria. &quot;Well
I'll be damned if you don't have both.&quot; She 
chuckled, &quot;Have
fun kiddo.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria frowned, 
&quot;How many times have I told you not to
call me that you 
bitch.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane shrugged, &quot;I dunno, but it's just so 
much fun.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria sighed, &quot;I need to get a new set 
of buttons for
you to push.&quot; Daria stood and walked to the door, 
&quot;See
you tomorrow?&quot;</P>

<P>Jane chuckled, &quot;Ah Daria, 
a day without your company would
be like a day without a cloud. I'll 
give you a call.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;See you then.&quot; Daria let 
herself out of the Lane
household and walked home. As she expected, 
Quinn was in her room
trying on a wide range of outfits. Daria snuck 
into her sister's
room and quietly sat down.</P>

<P>&quot;Damnit, 
this one's too formal, I don't want anyone to
think I care about 
actually being at this stupid party.&quot;
Quinn tossed a dress on 
her bed, she held up another outfit and
considered her reflection. 
&quot;Ugh, no, shows off too much chest,
.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Why 
even bother going at all?&quot; Daria asked.</P>

<P>&quot;Huh, what? 
Who said that?&quot; Quinn spun around. &quot;Oh,
it's you Daria, why 
the hell are you in my room?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Because I like 
watching you wrestle with moral decisions.
Now tell me, why are you 
going to this party if you so obviously
don't want 
to?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn sighed dramatically as she looked through her 
closet.
&quot;Because Daria, all the cool people at school will be 
there,
so I have to go.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Even though the whole 
event is being sponsored by a person
you can't 
stand?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn looked at Daria, the exasperation plain on 
her face,
&quot;Daria, it's an event to be at. It doesn't matter that 
Dave
is the host. It's a cool gathering despite the fact that 
he's
there and it's just my lot in life to suffer through 
it.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn thought about what Quinn said for a moment, 
&quot;You
know Quinn, for once I actually do feel your pain.&quot; 
Before
Quinn could comment Daria continued, &quot;I know if I had 
to
sit through an evening with your peers I'd give serious 
consideration
to either heavy sedation or a full frontal 
lobotomy.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn sniffed, &quot;I suppose this is a 
bonding moment, since
neither of actually wants to go to this 
party.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria stood up and walked out of the room. 
&quot;The difference
is that I'm not going and you are.&quot; She 
paused at the door.
&quot;I suggest you protest your attendance by 
wearing all black,
or not getting dressed up at 
all.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Daria!&quot; Quinn shouted, &quot;Did I ask 
for you opinion?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No, but I know a hell of a lot 
more about having to do
things I don't want to than you do. So I 
thought I'd lend a hand,
you know pretend I'm a concerned big 
sister.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, well, don't think I'm not grateful, 
but the day I
take fashion tips from you will be, oh never.&quot; 
With that
Quinn shut the door in Daria's face. Daria shrugged and 
walked
back to her room. Quinn sighed and returned to the task at 
hand.
She kept considering and discarding clothes until her eyes 
fell
on a long forgotten shirt. A smile crept across Quinn's face 
as
a plan slowly coalesced in her mind. Quinn started to put away
all 
the outfits she had already tried on, she had found the 
perfect
outfit to wear.</P>

<P>The party, when it arrived, was a 
large affair set in an old
servants house on the Wylie property. 
Music blasted in every room
as high schoolers in various stages of 
inebriation staggered around.
Quinn and the rest of the Fashion Club 
arrived fashionably late,
as would be expected, and by that time the 
party was in full swing.</P>

<P>&quot;Wow, look at all the people 
here.&quot; Tiffany commented,
&quot;It's like the whole school, just 
without the teachers.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, I wonder where Dave 
is, I want to thank him for
throwing such a great party&#133;&quot; 
Stacy trailed off when
she saw Quinn's glare. &quot;I think I'll go 
find something to
drink.&quot; Stacy scurried off into the 
crowd.</P>

<P>&quot;Really Quinn, what is your problem, we're at the 
biggest
party of the year and you're acting like a total 
loser.&quot;
Sandi regarded Quinn's outfit, &quot;And dressed like 
one too.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn was in fact dressed in attire similar to 
what one normally
found Dave wearing. Though in a way that was 
uniquely Quinn: khaki
cargo pants, plaid over shirt, and of the Dave 
Matthews Band shirts
that Dave bought for Quinn at their first 
concert.</P>

<P>Quinn shrugged, &quot;Why should I bother caring 
Sandi, I know
what Dave is trying to do and I'm protesting by not 
getting dressed
up.&quot; She winced internally, knowing this was 
exactly what
Daria said she should do.</P>

<P>Sandi arched an 
eyebrow, &quot;Oh really.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, he's just trying 
to buy our acceptance with a party
and free beer. Well I'm not buying 
it; Dave's a jerk and I'm not
going to let people forget it.&quot; 
During Quinn's monologue
Sandi and Tiffany both wandered off into the 
throng. Quinn realized
this and turned around, looking for them. She 
jumped when she
saw Stacy standing near her, two bottles in her 
hands.</P>

<P>&quot;Look Quinn, wine coolers, isn't that just the 
greatest,
want one?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn growled in frustration, 
grabbed a bottle from Stacy's
hand and stormed 
off.</P>

<P>&quot;What?&quot; Stacy asked in bewilderment, &quot;Was 
it
something I said?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn made her way through the 
crush of the party, trying to
find a spot to herself. Along the way 
she saw Mack trying to stop
a very drunk Kevin from attempting to 
tackle a large dresser.</P>

<P>&quot;Hey man, don't do something 
stupid and get yourself hurt
again, the team needs 
you.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's cool, Daddy Mack,&quot; Kevin slurred, 
&quot;I'm
the BQ, er QB.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Don't call me&#133;oh 
forget it, go ahead and break your
bony white ass, see if I 
care.&quot; Mack walked off.</P>

<P>&quot;Hey Macky-dad, come back 
I&#133;&quot;Kevin slumped down
and passed out.</P>

<P>Quinn sighed 
and continued her trek through the crowd. Suddenly
a door in front of 
her burst open and Jeffy, Joey and Jamie stumbled
out, followed by a 
cloud of smoke.</P>

<P>&quot;Hey Quinn,&quot; Jamie said, &quot;We 
were just going
to get some snacks, do you want 
anything?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, I've got a real hankering for 
some chips and salsa.&quot;
Joey added, Jeffy just 
giggled.</P>

<P>&quot;Um, no thanks I'm fine.&quot; The three teens 
stumbled
away from Quinn. She sighed and sipped her drink. &quot;What 
a
load of horse shit this all is,&quot; She said to herself as 
she
gazed out at the debauchery.</P>

<P>&quot;And how is that 
different from any other party you've
been to?&quot; A voice behind 
her asked.</P>

<P>Quinn jumped, then turned around, &quot;Oh, it's 
you.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That it is,&quot; Dave said with his 
customary chuckle,
&quot;So nice of you to make it. What do you think 
of my little
soiree?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I think it's a blatant 
attempt to score points with all
the right people by getting them 
drunk. Just buying popularity
is so uncool.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave 
sighed, &quot;Come on, let's go someplace quieter to 
talk.&quot;
Almost on cue Dave ducked to avoid being hit by a flying 
bottle.
&quot;Close but no cigar Chucky!&quot; He shouted. 
&quot;Shall
we repair to a sitting room?&quot; He held out a hand and 
indicated
that Quinn should follow him. She did, reluctantly, and 
Dave lead
her into a small room off the mail hallway. &quot;Ok, so 
you're
saying I'm throwing this party to increase my social status 
in
Lawndale and you're just so damn clever that you saw through 
my
little ruse. I'm guessing the clothes are some sort of 
protest
move?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Why should I bother wearing my best 
to a party held by
a loser?&quot; Quinn retorted.</P>

<P>&quot;Fair 
enough,&quot; Dave said as he walked around the
room, the sounds of 
the party could be heard through the door.
Dave stopped and faced 
Quinn. &quot;What if I told you that wasn't
why this party is taking 
place.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn laughed, &quot;Then I'd say you were lying 
since it's
obvious you aren't going to be popular any other 
way.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave shook his head, &quot;Quinn, when are you 
going to learn
there's more to life than popularity?&quot; He started 
pacing
again. &quot;No, I threw this party for two reasons. One was 
just
to have a party, a real big blowout of a party. The other was
to 
make a point. Quinn I'm not going anywhere, you're going to
have toaccept that you can't chase me away by insulting me and
making me 'unp 
opular'.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What are you saying exactly, that you 
want us to be friends?&quot;<BR>
</P>

<P>Dave held up his hands 
defensively, &quot;No, nothing like
that, I still think you're acting 
like a spoiled brat.&quot; Quinn
glared at him. &quot;But I do want 
to come to some sort of agreement
and basically stay out of our 
respective ways.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn thought about this for a moment. 
&quot;So what you're
saying is that we should just ignore each 
other?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave nodded, &quot;Exactly, we each do our own 
thing, and never
the twain shall meet. Just stop harping on me and 
I'll do likewise.
Lawndale's big enough for the both of us don't you 
think?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I guess,&quot; Quinn said slowly, 
&quot;But you're banned
from all Fashion Club sponsored 
activities.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave shrugged, &quot;I don't think I went 
to any in the first
place.&quot; He held out a hand. &quot;Do we have 
a deal?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn thought about it for another long moment 
before shaking
Dave's hand. &quot;Deal.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave nodded, 
&quot;Good, I'm glad that's settled.&quot; He
paused, &quot;Look 
Quinn I'm sorry this was the way things turned
out, you are a really 
cool person and I did have a fun time hanging
out with 
you.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn shrugged, &quot;Actually the only reason I 
ever went
out with you was because you were rich.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave 
nodded again, &quot;Yeah, I guess you were.&quot; He 
shrugged,
&quot;Whatever.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, whatever.&quot; 
Silence, such as was available,
hung over the room. Quinn stood up, 
&quot;Well, I should be going.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave nodded yet again, 
&quot;That's fine&#133;where are 
you
going?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Home,&quot; her mouth quirked into a 
smile, &quot;this
party is like so lame.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave chuckled, 
&quot;Oh come on, you don't want to see your
friends make complete 
asses out of themselves?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I'm just holding up my 
end of our bargain, and besides
keg parties are just so last season. 
I don't know what possessed
you&#133;&quot; Quinn continued her 
monologue as she walked out
the door.</P>

<P>Dave chuckled as he 
watched Quinn depart, &quot;Boogie on Fashion
Woman.&quot; He said to 
himself as he got up and rejoined the
party.</P>

<P>Over at the Lane 
house Daria was hanging out with Jane and
Tom, mainly because she 
didn't have anything better to do. Jane
abruptly cocked her head to 
one side, like she was trying to hear
something extremely 
quiet.</P>

<P>&quot;What's up Jane?&quot; Tom asked.</P>

<P>Jane 
shook her head, &quot;I don't know, but I got the feeling
something 
important just happened.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Was it like millions of 
voices suddenly crying out as
one and then being cut off?&quot; Tom 
said blandly.</P>

<P>&quot;You know what I always say about hokey 
old religions.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That they're no match for a good 
blaster?&quot;<BR>
</P>

<P>Daria looked at Tom evenly, &quot;No, 
that they're poorly written,
over-hyped pieces of cliched amalgams of 
older, and better work.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hey now, we will not be 
having a repeat of the infamous
'Dagobah Debates' in my room. I just 
finished cleaning up after
the last one.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria 
shrugged, &quot;Fine by me, I'm not the one who gets
so defensive 
about a silly movie.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hey, it's not just a 
movie&#133;&quot; Tom trailed off
sensing this was a fight he 
couldn't win. &quot;So what was that
all about 
Jane?&quot;</P>

<P>Jane waved a hand dismissively, &quot;Oh it was 
nothing, probably
just someone walking over my 
grave.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Or the onset of 
epilepsy.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Cool, I've always wanted to be an 
epileptic, or maybe
it was a leper, something that would give me real 
cachet in the
art world.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, that'd be one way 
to get noticed.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;A little hard on your body 
though. I keep telling her
to just do some grandstanding.&quot; Tom 
chimed in.</P>

<P>&quot;But I am a pure artist, I'm not trying to 
becomeinfamous,
I'm trying to achieve immortality. Tom here just 
doesn't understand
art.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Then why do you keep 
telling me to blow up my car?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That's not art, 
that's a community service.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Uh guys, I hate to 
break up this great Socratic discussion,
but are we going to do 
something?&quot;</P>

<P>Jane looked at Tom, he shrugged, &quot;Pizza 
King sound good?&quot;
Tom nodded, 
&quot;Daria?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Works for 
me.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Great, let's go.&quot; And so they 
did.</P>

<P>Later that evening when Daria came home she was 
surprised to
find Quinn there. &quot;Wow, what happened, the cops 
break up
the festivities ahead of schedule?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No, I 
just wanted to go home, it was a stupid party 
anyway.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Should I call the hospital, are you 
feeling alright?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn sighed, &quot;There's no need to 
be so dramatic. I didn't
want to be there in the first place. I 
showed up, stayed a while
and then came home, it's no big deal. 
Besides it was just going
to be a lot of people saying how cool Dave 
is for holding the
party, which was the whole reason he's having it, 
despite what
he says. So why should I help him?&quot;</P>

<P>Daria 
shifted her feet, &quot;Yeah, about that, um, Quinn,
Dave's really 
not as bad as you're making him out to be. Why don't
you just lay off 
him a touch. Maybe even give him another chance.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn 
shrugged, &quot;Come on Daria, get with the program.
Dave's a brain, 
could you ever see me going out with a brain?
Ewww. Ok, fine, he's 
not going anywhere. And fine because he's
rich he's going to have a 
certain amount of popularity. But that
doesn't mean I have to like 
it, or him. I just have to be civil.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria shook her 
head, &quot;Quinn, the amount of time you put
into making this stuff 
up is impressive.&quot; She yawned, &quot;Now
if you'll excuse me I'm 
going to bed.&quot; Daria walked upstairs,
leaving Quinn sitting on 
the couch.</P>

<P>So another day came to a close in Lawndale. A day, 
that taken
as a whole, was like any other, with the blending of the 
mundane
and the extraordinary that can be found in any day. And as 
Lawndale
slept that great unseen force known only as life busied 
itself
in preparation for the next day, as it always had and always 
would.</P>

<P>The End</P>

<P>Play &quot;Bouncing 'Round the 
Room&quot; by Phish while the
credits roll.</P>

<p>The woman was a 
dream I had though rather hard to keep<br>
For when my eyes were 
watching hers, they closed, and I was
still asleep.<br>
For when my 
hand was holding hers, she whispered words and
I awoke<br>
And 
faintly bouncing around the room the echo of whomever spoke<br>
I 
awoke and faintly bouncing round the room the echo of 
whomever
spoke.<br>
The place I saw was far beneath the surface of 
the sea<br>
My sight was poor but I was sure the sirens sang their 
songs
for me<br>
They dance above me as I sink I see them through a 
crystal
haze<br>

And hear them bouncing round the room the never 
ending coral
maze<br>

<P>That time and once again I'm bouncing 
around the 
room.<!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION--></P>

<P>&lt;Author's 
Notes&gt;</P>

<P>Well, that was fun. For something that started out 
as just
a light bit of stretch writing, &quot;can I write something 
in
which nothing blows up?&quot; it did take on a life of its 
own.
Beyond that, there are a few points I'd like to 
mention.</P>

<P>Why Dave? While Dave Wylie isn't a total Mary Sue, I 
did drew
on some personal experience when creating the character, but 
as
a whole Dave is not me, just thought I'd like to share that. 
As
far as why throw the character into the mix? I'm of the 
opinion
that if I want to see the characters interacting 
&quot;normally&quot;
I'll just watch the show. The addition of a 
character lets you
play around with dynamics and screw around with 
stuff. <FONT FACE="Wingdings">J</FONT>
Plus, as it turns out Dave 
does bear a striking resemblance to
Tom, though I hope I have done 
enough to make the characters distinct.
Not to mention David, 
rasmafrasin bad luck there on my part huh?</P>

<P>What's with that 
title? It's a song from Dave's favorite band,
Phish, a group that I'm 
something of a fan of as well. I don't
have any good reason for using 
it beyond that I like the song.</P>

<P>What's the soundtrack 
business? Ah yes, the major conceit in
my writing. Simply put each 
story's soundtrack will be a live
concert from the band that performs 
the song named in the title.
Why? I don't know, but it sounded cool 
when I thought of it. So,
for example, the soundtrack for this show 
is the second night
of Phish's stand at Radio City Music Hall, easy 
enough right.
By the by, B&amp;P's to anyone who wants the show named 
as the
soundtrack. Just my way of spreading the good tunes, so 
everyone
can share the good tunes. <FONT 
FACE="Wingdings">J</FONT></P>

<P>It's a sign of the times: I was 
looking at the tourdates for
Phish recently and I noticed that Irvine 
Meadows Amphitheater
no longer exists, it's now known as the Verizon 
Wireless Entertainment
Complex, or something like that. Such is life 
in the brave new
millennium I suppose. This has, of course, nothing 
to do with
anything related to the story, but I felt like sharing 
that nugget.</P>

<P>What's up with the location? For a long and 
complicated set
of reasons, I have arbitrarily located Lawndale in 
California.
It's really the only state that I can quickly think of 
that best
fits the geographical information provided by the show. 
It's in
a temperate region that's close to desert and high 
mountains.
The only reason this is important is because I had to make 
a decision
about concert venues to send the characters to, after all 
having
all these bands come to Lawndale would be too big a 
stretch.</P>

<P>For the record: If the parts in here about 
popularity sound
a little forced and somewhat cliched, there's a 
reason. Simply
put I don't put much stock in the concept of 
&quot;cliques.&quot;
Maybe I'm too far removed from my high school 
experience, ooo
a whole 5 years, but I never really felt like I was 
ever in a
real &quot;clique.&quot; Sure I hung out with my small 
circle
of friends, but by the same token those friends had friends 
outside
that group who in turn had friends outside that group, one 
big
interlocking thing. I find the notion of a rigid caste system
in 
high school to really be a false one perpetrated upon us by
the 
media. Or to put it another way, my friends were jocks as
well as 
brains, I even played varsity tennis for two years, not
that I was 
any good at it. Sure when I was younger I was made
fun of for various 
reasons, but never so much in high school.
Basically I never thought 
of high school as &quot;hell&quot; per
se while I was there so that 
colors my thoughts of it. Which means
it's hard for me to write in a 
Daria vein since I think that the
show is bunk in this regard. <FONT 
FACE="Wingdings">J</FONT></P>

<P>What's the deal with those 
stereotypes?: Somebody commented
to me about the inaccuracy of some 
of my comments regarding hippies
and grungers. While those folks are 
correct and not everyone who
is a hippie wears tie-dye(hell, Mr. Bob 
Weir of the Grateful Dead
hates tie-dye and never wears the stuff), 
doesn't bath, etc, I'm
not saying that, this is Quinn's reaction, or 
in some instances
Dave's handling of Quinn's reaction. Believe me, 
I've been to
SCI shows, Quinn would not react well in that sort of 
environment,
regardless of the BO quotient. An additional addendum to 
this
is that I recent attended a Phish concert (2000-09-18 
Blossom
Music Center) which only further strengthened my previous 
statement.
Not all Phans of Phish dress like hippies (actually much 
like
Mr. Bob Weir the members of Phish dress pretty 
&quot;normal&quot;&#133;well
except for Fishman), but good lord a 
great number of 'em do; Quinn
would hate the scene at a Phish 
show.</P>

<P>Fan-boy continuity canon police alert: For a variety of 
reasons
this actually fits quite nicely into the tail end of season 
4,
yet before the big drama of the last two episodes and the 
movie.
That is, if I get around to jiggering it all together 
right.</P>

<P>Cliff Notes? Uh, if I botched anything regarding Brave 
New
World, well, it's like this. I haven't read the book since 
high
school so if I screwed up the ending or anything, well tough,
I 
didn't really see the need to get my hands on a copy and get
all 
serious about it. Probably should have, but I guess I just
lack that 
attention to detail.</P>

<P>Fan-Boy Appendix: In case you were 
wondering, and I know you
weren't, here are some setlists for the 
shows Dave and Quinn saw</P>

<P>Dave Matthews 
Band<br>
Whenever/2000<br>
Verizon Wireless Amphitheater,<br>
Irvine 
CA</P>

Warehouse (Stop Time Intro)<br>

#41 (Sojourn of Arjuna Jam) $ 
-&gt;<br>
Drum Jam &amp;<br>
The Last Stop (Reprise Outro) 
$</P>

<P>Entire show with Butch Taylor on keyboard</br>
^ with Bela 
Fleck on Banjo</br>
# with Victor Lemonte Wooten on bass</br>
* with 
Jeff Coffin on Saxophone</br>
&amp; with Futureman on Synth-Axe 
Drumitar<br>
$ with Bela Fleck and the Flecktones<br>

<P>Don't look 
for that show, it's more an amalgam of the best
of the best, still it 
would be an insanely amazing show, especially
since songs like 
Dreaming Tree and Spoon have only been played
a handful of times 
w/the full band. Some people would say there
are too many radio 
songs, but had to have em in there for Quinn.
Yeah, I know, a lot of 
Bela, but hey, it's my &quot;Dream concert&quot;
I can have as much 
banjo as I feel like it damnit <FONT FACE="Wingdings">J</FONT>
It 
would also be about a 4 hour concert given the jam potential
of a lot 
of those tunes. Ok, I've gone way beyond fan-boy here,
I'll 
stop.</P>
<P>String Cheese Incident</br>
Wherever, 
Whenever</P>

<P>Set 1
Rolling in my Sweet Baby's Arms</br>

5 - Travis on

<P>This is more of less the setlist from an actual 
String Cheese
Incident concert that I attended last spring, great 
show and my
DAT is killer, look for this one to make an appearance 
later on
in the series if I ever get that far. Though I did add a bit 
more
&quot;jazz&quot; than you'd normally find at a SCI 
show.</P>

<P>What's with the ending? Well, Kevin Smith is a big 
creative
influence, I mean wow, my characters basically stand around 
and
talk, isn't that the entire direction to just about all 
Smith's
work? At times I felt like writing a &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; 
and
at times I didn't(But I did throw in at least one Kevin 
Smith
reference, see if you can spot it.), so the ending is two 
parts
a compromise of that and one part lead in for something else 
I
have in mind. <FONT FACE="Wingdings">J</FONT> So stay tuned for
the 
follow-up, Busted Stuff.
