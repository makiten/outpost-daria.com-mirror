to be her escort to the dance and had even promised to wear a decent shirt - if
he could borrow one from Trent, who had access to his father's wardrobe. After

(even Helen had to admit that Ruth could cook better than any member of her

ending up as a hippie. But at least your parents dumped their ideals about

sleeveless black dress with green ornaments at the sides and a dark blue

and joy, she heard the unmistakable click of a photo being made and saw her
mother sitting on the edge of the bed, holding a camera and smiling her head
off. "<SPAN style="COLOR: maroon">Sorry, Daria, but Amy asked me to do that. How

we drove her to her prom - and I was the one fetching her at 3 am when her
partner had tried to open it and she had knocked him out cold before walking two
miles to the next telephone. It's quite a story, but you better ask her about
it</SPAN><SPAN class=GramE>."</SPAN> Daria smiled. "<SPAN

w:st="on">Highland</st1:City>, <st1:State
w:st="on">Texas</st1:State></st1:place>. After several long talks, Dad sold his
business and bought a partnership in a <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:State

paused for a moment. "<SPAN style="COLOR: green">He hated <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:State w:st="on">Texas</st1:State></st1:place>, his new job and
especially his partners, who were a bunch of lazy rednecks constantly working at
the very border of legality. One year later, they crossed it big time without
Dad's knowledge. The FBI found out and took all the partners - also including
Dad - away for several long interrogations before the official trial. Dad
managed to convince the judge that he had no share in the dealings of his
partners, so he was released. However, the firm had to pay a million dollars for
violating several trade and civil laws. As one of five owners, Dad's share was
two hundred thousand, which we could only afford because Mom worked overtime at
her job for several months. Dad's firm was liquidated and he had to find a new
job. By that time, the whole state had heard about the trial against his old
firm and he had a hard time convincing people that he was innocent. Finally, he
became an assistant to one of his former rivals after Mom had pulled some
strings. His new boss gave him a very hard time for two years until we moved
here - again because of Mom's work. Since that time, Mom has had the higher
income and the better jobs. Dad never really forgot that his reputation and his
business would've crashed completely if Mom hadn't prevented that - and he must
have thought many times about the good business back in Boston he left to give
his wife a chance to start her own career. All that can do bad things to a man's
self-esteem, especially because Mom reminds him every time he takes a
risk</SPAN><SPAN class=GramE>."</SPAN> <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

designer suit</SPAN><SPAN class=GramE>."</SPAN> "<SPAN style="COLOR: red">You
will, believe me. He doesn't like to talk about it, but Dad hasn't always shot
photos of birds or trees for nature magazines. Nine years ago, some big Italian
designer hired him as a last-minute replacement for another photographer who
literally left a white line all over the customs area at JFK when he entered the
country. Dad did his job well and, as a gift on top of the fee, he got a
hand-tailored suit worth about ten grand from that designer. Since <st1:place

</SPAN>Later that day, Jake drove his mother to the station to see her off
before he stopped by at his office at Halcyon Hills. When he entered it, his
gaze fell on the family picture on the wall. It had been shot 9 years ago on a
trip to <st1:place w:st="on">Cape Cod</st1:place> they had made to celebrate his
biggest success yet. He looked closer: there was seven-year-old Quinn in a
bright pink dress, wearing a "Come to <st1:place w:st="on">Cape
Cod</st1:place>"-hat and smiling for the camera. Daria stood next to her,
wearing a blue shirt, green shorts and a cap. The nine-year old was clutching a
copy of Moby Dick she had declared 'fit for the trip'; she was also smiling
slightly. Behind the girls, a younger, very relaxed Helen beamed proudly into
the camera, holding up a shell Quinn and Daria found that day. Since Jake had
taken the picture himself, only the female Morgendorffers were on the
picture.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

</SPAN><I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><SPAN style="COLOR: navy">It's
funny how everything's changed in the last decade</SPAN></I>, Jake thought. <I
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><SPAN style="COLOR: navy">In 1990, everyone
looked so happy and all the problems of the nineties were so far
away.</SPAN></I> He looked at the picture again and felt the usual twitch of
nostalgia creeping up his neck, but then he shook his head. <I
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><SPAN style="COLOR: navy">That's nonsense!
My girls are grown-up now and as far as I know, they are happy. Daria has
overcome her isolation and found good friends in Lawndale; Quinn has passed the
stage of being a fashion fanatic and is not ashamed to show her intellect
anymore - so I don't have to dread the day when some smartass designer comes up
with a design she can not wear. </SPAN></I>He smiled at this thought.<I
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><SPAN style="COLOR: navy"> And Helen is
succeeding at her career - this time without sacrificing mine for it.</SPAN></I>
He eyed the old picture once again before leaving his office. <I
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><SPAN style="COLOR: navy">If the Jake of
1990 would have been on the photo too, knowing what his family would be like
nine years later, I bet he would have smiled his head
off.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></I></SPAN></P>

style="COLOR: navy">From what I know, John Morgendorffer - our grandfather - was
born in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
w:st="on">Austria</st1:place></st1:country-region> around 1890 as <I
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Johann</I> <I
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">von</I> Morgendorffer, second son of a rich
baron. He was a very clever child with special excellence in English. Since his
elder brother Martin was destined to inherit the title as well as all other
family possessions, John was forced by family tradition to enter the Imperial
Army as a cadet although he would have preferred to study his favorite subject
in <st1:country-region w:st="on">America</st1:country-region> or
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>. According to what Mom told
me, John hated the military and looked for a way to leave when war broke out in
1914. He was lucky enough to be a captain in the General Staff planning section,
so he didn't see any combat for three years. When the <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region> entered the war in 1917, the
Germans asked their allies for extra troops to fight the new enemy in <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region></st1:place>.
John was promoted and appointed to be part of a group concerned with possible
actions against <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region></st1:place> forces. In late 1917, he went to
St. <SPAN class=SpellE>Mihiel</SPAN> with that group to check out possible
future theatres for the Austrian forces as well as to interrogate American POWs
caught by the Germans. Two days after his arrival, Major von Morgendorffer was
caught by an American patrol - or, to tell the truth, he deserted, taking the
only chance he might ever get to leave the army and see America</SPAN>."
<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoBodyTextIndent style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><SPAN lang=EN-US
style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">"<SPAN style="COLOR: navy">When the U.S.
command realized that John knew not only the operation plans of a possible
Austrian intervention, but had also learnt about the complete German plans in
the American sector, they offered him a deal: if he told them everything he
knew, he would get a ticket to America, the U.S. citizenship and a small
allowance for his help. He accepted and arrived in <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:State w:st="on">New York</st1:State></st1:place> in early 1918;
one year later, he met his future wife Susan who worked as a waitress in a bar
he occasionally visited. After the war, they moved to <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Oklahoma</st1:place></st1:State> when John was
hired as teacher for German and European History at a private school with the
help of the Department of the Army, which owed him more than he ever understood.
In 1924, their only son was born - our father Martin, who got his Christian name
in honor of Baron Martin von Morgendorffer, his Austrian uncle far beyond the
<st1:place w:st="on">Atlantic</st1:place></SPAN>."<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place> by ship to visit his Austrian family
with his wife and son. One day before they wanted to start, he got a phone call
from an old friend imploring him to cancel his plans and to never return to
Austria again because a right-wing group of ex-officers had set a price on his
head for betraying his country - and that both his father and brother had damned
John's name and sworn to deliver him to this group if he ever returned to
Austria</SPAN><SPAN class=GramE>."</SPAN> Anthony's left eye became bloodshot.
"<SPAN style="COLOR: teal">These scoundrels</SPAN><SPAN class=GramE>!"</SPAN>
<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoBodyTextIndent style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><SPAN lang=EN-US
style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">Jake nodded sadly. "<SPAN
style="COLOR: navy">John stayed at home, but it must've been a hard shock for
him, especially since he lost his job one year later because of the depression.
In the next years, he and his family lived at the edge of poverty. In 1934, the
department of the Army offered to take ten-year-old Martin as pupil in
<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Buxton</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Ridge</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName
w:st="on">Military</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
w:st="on">School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> including board and lodging.
Although John still hated the military, he had to accept this extraordinary
benefit. He soon regretted it when his son was molded into a bullying, brutal
soldier-kid at Buxton Ridge and started to loathe John for having deserted to
the enemy in wartime. During the thirties, John's health went down due to
several reasons. His son's behavior was probably one reason; the fact that he
couldn't find work again was another. The last straw - according to my
grandmother's diary I found after Dad's death - was a reading a newspaper
article published in 1940 after Germany had defeated France, which named among
leading Nazi officials a 'Baron Martin von Morgendorffer, old party member and
honorary <SPAN class=SpellE>Brigadef&uuml;hrer</SPAN> of the SS forces' - John's
older brother."<o:p></o:p></SPAN></SPAN></P>

"<SPAN style="COLOR: navy">John committed suicide in late 1940, leaving behind a
note explaining that he killed himself because he'd failed to make a difference
in any way. His widow Susan later found work in the Pentagon when the Army
needed women fluent in German to translate enemy documents; she died in 1944
from cancer. Martin entered the Army in 1942 and was not present at his father's
funeral. He neither attended his mother's funeral because he landed in the
<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:State w:st="on"><SPAN
class=SpellE>Provence</SPAN></st1:State></st1:place> with his unit on the very
day of it. When he came back from Europe, he had no family or close friends

where he met my mother before he went to <st1:country-region

seldom spoke about his Austrian ancestry - mostly since he never met them - but
once, when he saw a picture of some Tyrol village in a prospectus, he told me
that he'd been in that village in May 1945 and that a villager had told him that
another man called Morgendorffer had visited the local pub one week before,
leaving behind a Nazi uniform full of medals. Like many <SPAN
class=SpellE>G.I.s</SPAN>, he had collected memorabilia among the way through
<st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>, but this very day, he was out of cash,

really know much about life outside my town and family. He gave me a crash
lesson which crashed everything I'd awaited from or about life till then. As
soon as my pregnancy was clearly visible, my parents sent me away to escape the
local gossip and forced me to take up a job as a dishwasher. When I learnt that
the man whose child I bore had gone back to <st1:country-region

went to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

earn his way through college by serving as gunner in a Huey. When his helicopter

not when he used his car. Now after Ms. Li took over the post of principal in
late 1993, she made a rousing party at her place in Oakwood and most people got
pretty drunk, including Tim. When the party finally broke up, I offered him a
ride since I'd stayed sober the whole evening. He declined it because his wife
needed the car the next morning to drive to her job. Despite his inebriation, he
managed to drive the whole route back and almost up to his place - but when he

asphyxiating himself with the exhaust fumes of his car entering through a hose.
I hadn't seen him that morning and came to his place to look for him - just in
time for saving him again, this time from his own guilt. He accepted
psychological help and slowly went back to his former life of teaching, but
he'll never again be the same joyous, care-free man I knew. That's the reason
why I worked against <SPAN class=SpellE>Barch</SPAN> trying to lure him into
marriage, by the way. She doesn't know about Laura since she came to Lawndale
High one year later and was still married with her husband back then. Nobody
ever told her about Tim's dead wife, so she just regarded him as what he is now:
a friendly shy man who listens to her and doesn't interrupt her when she's
ranting about men in general. After some time, she marked him out as possible
prey. Since I feel obliged to protect him like I did twice before, I won't let

Jake and I finally admitted two things to ourselves: that we had grown very
close to each other and that we wanted more from life than the daily political
discussions and the ritual squabble about whose turn it was to give the organic
waste to the animals. We married in June 1975 in a ceremony at the next lake,
just like several commune couples had done before - including <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Willow</st1:place></st1:City> and Coyote, who had
become the most militant members on most of our topics, from macro biology to
world politics. The difference in our case was that we announced some days later
that we would leave the commune and start at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName

Jake earned himself a MBA with honors and we started thinking about children
although I was still in law school. Daria was born in February 1981 and Jake
became an assistant in a consulting firm in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
w:st="on">Boston</st1:City></st1:place> to learn the necessary skills for his
own business later. We moved to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City

Jake starting his own business the same year. In 1984, I started to work again
and everything went well until we moved to <st1:State
w:st="on">Texas</st1:State> in 1990 because I got a good offer from a law firm
in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Highland</st1:place></st1:City>. For
Jake, it meant to leave his flourishing business and starting again from space
one; the girls had to adapt to a completely new location and I got as many
chances to become a full partner as I got back in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
w:st="on">Boston</st1:City></st1:place>: nil. One year later, Jake's business
crashed over illegitimate actions of his partners and his reputation suffered so
hard that, in the end, he had to work for one of his former rivals who treated
him bad to make up for past defeats he had suffered against Jake. He managed to
leave that firm in 1993, but since his reputation was still bad from the scandal
his partners had caused, his new business went slowly while I still tried to
become partner at my firm</SPAN>."<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

party for all I heard, food and drinks included. Now after midnight, the host
opened a bottle of Yugoslav vodka provided by his Dad and offered it to
everyone. Most people just had a sip and decided to switch back to other, less
aggressive drinks, but Pat and Trent liked the taste of the vodka and shared
three quarters of the bottle between them</SPAN>."<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

so they went to our place to sleep there. When they arrived here, Pat was
already white as a wall and collapsed on the floor after coming in. Trent called
an ambulance and woke me up since our parents were away, but when the paramedics
came, she was already in a deep coma, and after they had tried for an hour to
bring her back to life without success, they gave

too. I summoned my folks from wherever they were back then and spent the next
days consoling my numb brother, which went OK - until the post mortem arrived,
saying Pat had been pregnant for two months and the allergic shock had only been
lethal because it had burst the baby's umbilical cord and thus inflicted a
severe internal hemorrhage, killing both mother and child</SPAN><SPAN

w:st="on">Trent</st1:City></st1:place> drew closer to his friends who tried in

teachers who'd gone against her way of running the school and wanted to set a

science teachers as well as Morris, who'd struggled with my other siblings and
had branded Trent to be just another Lane troublemaker - despite his good grades
in English, History and other subjects. After Dad proved this to Li, she had to
concede that Trent wasn't the kind of bum our three older siblings had been, but
couldn't be persuaded to give in about the graduation issue for official reasons
- until DeMartino threatened to inform the PTA and the superintendent of schools

my so-called love life</SPAN>." She gulped down some soda. "<SPAN
style="COLOR: green">You remember that Tom, Kay and I went looking for colleges
some weeks ago and first visited Bromwell to have interviews with the admission
officer. Tom went first and dazzled the woman by mentioning about hundred of his
relatives who practically built and made the place, which gave him the
birthright to become a member of the chosen few to be admitted this year. No
offence meant, Elsie</SPAN>." "<SPAN style="COLOR: #99ccff">None <SPAN
class=GramE>taken,</SPAN> Daria. In fact, you're right about the whole nepotism
thing stinking like hell, but since Dad's been pushing Tom towards Bromwell for
the last ten years, I guess he's accepted his fate. Carry on</SPAN>." "<SPAN
style="COLOR: green">Anyway, he came out - after almost an hour of talk - and
the first thing the interviewer asks me is 'Are you as full of Bromwell lore as
Tom?' before I was even sitting</SPAN>." "<SPAN style="COLOR: red">Ouch</SPAN>"
"<SPAN style="COLOR: green">Well, I needed some time to remove my mental
blockade about the stupid questions like what I'd hope to reap from the unique
Bromwell experience, then it went more or less smooth</SPAN>."

coffee, but then we met a friend of your father who works there</SPAN>." Elsie
laughed. "<SPAN style="COLOR: #99ccff">Let me guess: <SPAN
class=SpellE>Braggin</SPAN>' Bill Woods, the biggest airhead of the east coast,
right</SPAN>?" "<SPAN style="COLOR: green">That's him. When he saw us, he
invited us to lunch for the next day and - after expressing his disbelief that a
Sloane could even think about considering another option besides Bromwell and
ignoring me as a possible student - we settled for breakfast instead, which
meant staying the night. I was less than thrilled about it, especially when your
mother got us three rooms in the 'Horatio Alger Sloane Wing' with a single phone
call, showing me again how things work there</SPAN>."<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

wing, Elsie; those damned <SPAN class=SpellE>Shearersons</SPAN> from <SPAN

were stuck in Bromwell for the evening. What happened then</SPAN>?" "<SPAN
style="COLOR: green">Well, Tom's mother insisted on entertaining Tom and me with
stories about life at Bromwell; you know, where to eat, what to do, which places
to avoid - the whole freshman program. It wasn't until quarter to twelve until
we all went to our rooms</SPAN>." <SPAN class=GramE>"<SPAN

style="COLOR: red">Sorry, Daria.</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN style="COLOR: red"> Please
continue</SPAN>." "<SPAN style="COLOR: green">When I was finally alone in my
room, I was so frustrated with the whole day and the Bromwell machinery that I
was mad at Tom for bringing me there and mad at myself for accepting. In fact,
if I'd have had a car of my own, I might've left immediately. Then someone
knocked at my door and shook me out of my gloom</SPAN>."<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

be dead meat</SPAN>." <SPAN class=GramE>"<SPAN style="COLOR: #99ccff">Sure,
Daria</SPAN>."</SPAN> <SPAN class=GramE>"<SPAN style="COLOR: red">Of
course</SPAN>."</SPAN> Daria sighed again. "<SPAN style="COLOR: green">It was
Tom, of course, planning to apologize for everything from the interview up to
the behavior of both his mother and Professor Woods towards me. He had scrounged
a bottle of red wine from somewhere as a peace offering - I'm sure from some
servant who'd already organized booze for the preceding Sloane generation - and
offered to drink some of it together. We killed most of the wine and... got
intimate, so to say. I guess it was both the frustration and the need to hold on
to something... or someone, in that case</SPAN>." <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoBodyTextIndent style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><SPAN lang=EN-US

comment. "<SPAN style="COLOR: green">Let me just answer the questions in your
mind according to curiosity and dirt. One: yes, we knew what we were doing
despite the wine. Two: yes, Jane, it was fun... and you should try it yourself
some time. Three: no, Elsie, you're not going to be an aunt; we used protection
- each time, which provokes question four: no, we did not screw around like two
horny gorillas although we repeated 'it' later that night - twice, to be exact.
<SPAN class=GramE>Finally question five: Tom stayed the whole night with me
before he sneaked out in the dawn to get back to his room and to destroy the
evidence<SPAN style="COLOR: windowtext">."</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN>

style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">Elsie smiled. "<SPAN style="COLOR: #99ccff">And
that's where your nefarious hormone- and wine-soaked plan failed, Daria. Did you
two really think that a Bromwell servant would find some wine for Tom without
checking first with Mom whether she allowed it or not? She told Dad that the man
asked for her consent, and she took a lucky guess about Tom's plans. In fact,
she said - but don't tell Tom, please - that if he'd ordered a six-pack of beer,
she'd have declined since he would've drunk it alone in his room and caused a
scandal at breakfast.</SPAN>" "<SPAN style="COLOR: red">How could she be sure
that Tom wouldn't court Daria with beer</SPAN>?" Jane asked slyly. Now Elsie
grinned from ear to ear. "<SPAN style="COLOR: #99ccff">Mom told Dad that if
their precious only son would've intended that, it would've meant that eighteen
years of high-rate education had gone down the drain</SPAN>." All three girls
laughed before Elsie pushed back her chair and rose from her place. "<SPAN
style="COLOR: #99ccff">I have to leave now. Thanks for the insight in my dear
bro's love life</SPAN>." "<SPAN style="COLOR: red">Thanks for bringing it
up</SPAN>." Jane joked, which earned her a kick from Daria's left foot. Elsie
was already two paces away from the table when Daria called after her. "<SPAN

"<SPAN style="COLOR: #99ccff">Yes</SPAN>?" <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoBodyTextIndent style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><SPAN lang=EN-US

"<SPAN style="COLOR: green">Listen... give Tom my regards and... if he still feels
bad, tell him I'm sorry. I guess I never told him, but apart from Jane, he's
been the best friend I've made around here - and it's been a real pity that we
didn't meet sooner. Just... tell him that if you think he needs it, okay</SPAN>?"
Elsie frowned. <SPAN class=GramE>"<SPAN style="COLOR: #99ccff">Anything
else</SPAN>?"</SPAN> "<SPAN style="COLOR: red">Tell him Jane says hi</SPAN>."
"<SPAN style="COLOR: green">Jane, you're absolutely no help. <SPAN

we return home for the vacation. Now leave before I get even mushier</SPAN>."
Elsie grinned. "<SPAN style="COLOR: #99ccff">I'll be happy to. Have a nice

When she entered it, she faced Quinn who had run towards the entrance after
hearing the sound of the lock. The redhead looked eagerly at her sister, <SPAN

you buy anything</SPAN>?" Daria pushed off her boots and smiled at Quinn. "<SPAN

an A for effort; I only asked him to keep you away from "Memorable Days" at the

However, Jane still needed one and asked me to help her finding a dress - and to
ensure that you wouldn't enlighten us with your encyclopedic knowledge about
color and style combinations</SPAN>." Quinn frowned again. "<SPAN
style="COLOR: green">Sorry, sis, but you know I'm right. What will you wear, by
the way</SPAN>?" "<SPAN style="COLOR: fuchsia">I'm not sure yet, but I've
succeeded in narrowing it down to five choices. Shall I show them to

style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">The parking lot of Lawndale High was already
almost full when the <st1:City w:st="on">Plymouth</st1:City> drove up in front
of the main entrance, so <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
w:st="on">Trent</st1:place></st1:City> unloaded his passengers and drove on to
look for a space at the gym. Jesse looked at Jane. "<SPAN

don't you?</SPAN>" "<SPAN style="COLOR: red">Yeah, I know. <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Trent</st1:place></st1:City> hasn't been here
since he came to pick us up during the teacher's strike and was recruited by
O'Neill to write a forceful protest song</SPAN>..." Jane smirked. "<SPAN
style="COLOR: red">Let's wait for him in the lobby. I don't want the popular
people to think we outcasts weren't allowed in</SPAN>." She crossed the road
with Jesse and Daria following her. Just as they reached the entrance, the doors
opened to reveal Jodie, wearing a grape-colored dress and looking very
exasperated. She smiled at the three. "<SPAN style="COLOR: purple">Hi, guys.
Nice to see even you're here to pay a last respect to 'the place that enabled
you to grow from adolescents into mature, intelligent Americans of tomorrow'.
Please forgive me if I sound corny, but if you'd been forced to proof-read Ms.
Li's speech for tonight, you would sound exactly the same</SPAN>." She looked at
Daria. "<SPAN style="COLOR: purple">Do you think your mother could defend me in
court if I strangle that hag with my own nylons</SPAN>?" Daria smiled. "<SPAN
style="COLOR: green">She probably would - and I'd be happy to give evidence that
you committed justifiable homicide. Shouldn't Mack be at your side to keep you
back - or to help you with the nylons</SPAN>?" <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoBodyTextIndent style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><SPAN lang=EN-US

herd on his team buddies. After last year's disaster, she wanted to assure that
none of the jocks will try to ruin the fun with animal waste or rotten
fruits</SPAN>." She noticed Jesse. "<SPAN style="COLOR: purple">Who are you, by
the way</SPAN>?" Jane shoved him forward. "<SPAN style="COLOR: red">This is
Jesse Moreno; he graduated with my brother and will be my escort for
tonight</SPAN>." Jesse shook hands with Jodie. <SPAN class=GramE>"<SPAN
style="COLOR: purple">Nice to meet you, Jesse</SPAN>."</SPAN> She grinned
suddenly. "<SPAN style="COLOR: purple">You wouldn't be the elder brother of
Danny Moreno, the sophomore who tried DeMartino's patience last month by asking
him to sponsor the introduction of a 'Manly Rock Music Club'</SPAN>?" "<SPAN
style="COLOR: #3366ff">Yeah, I am. Did you hear that Mr. D. accepted to piss off

stopped in front of the entrance. <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place

followed by a tuxedo-wearing Kevin, who looked surprisingly lean without his
usual shoulder pads and his football pants. Jodie made a pained face, <SPAN
class=GramE>then</SPAN> she whispered to Daria and Jane. "<SPAN
style="COLOR: purple">It's probably my last encounter with them as an item, so I
should play nice and say hello to them. See you later</SPAN>." Jane looked after
the departing Jodie, <SPAN class=GramE>then</SPAN> she shook her head. "<SPAN

over ten years now, but I'm still amazed at her kindness towards her fellow
humans - especially the ones who'd never even think about repaying that kindness
to her or anyone else</SPAN>." She hooked her arms around the waists of the
other two. "<SPAN style="COLOR: red">Let's go inside to wait for <st1:City

it. I saw his pink pimpmobile stopping at the corner some seconds ago</SPAN>."
"<SPAN style="COLOR: green">Don't you want to see Andrea in a ball robe</SPAN>?"
Daria asked. "<SPAN style="COLOR: green">Wait a moment, in Andrea's case that
would be a Baal robe</SPAN>." Jane shook her head again. "<SPAN
style="COLOR: red">I know her for over ten years too, but unlike Jodie, she's
never been the talking type with me. In any case, <SPAN

<P class=MsoBodyTextIndent style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><SPAN lang=EN-US

w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Trent</st1:place></st1:City>. In these ten
minutes, two people had asked Jesse if he was a bouncer, Stacy had showed up -
with Joey at her side - to ask Daria if Quinn would come to the prom (and which
boy would be her escort) and Tim O'Neill had welcomed them, being overjoyed that
even the '<SPAN class=SpellE><I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><SPAN

'<I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><SPAN style="COLOR: lime">and, let me
add this, also the teachers who educated them over those past years'</SPAN></I>
for a last time. Finally they saw <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><SPAN
class=SpellE>Trent</SPAN></st1:place></st1:City><SPAN class=SpellE>'s</SPAN>
lean figure appear in front of the entrance and step through the doors - happily
talking with Anthony DeMartino. The two men scanned the room before they waved
and walked over to Jesse and the girls. Several people looked surprised at
<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Trent</st1:City></st1:place> in his
expensive suit, but even more whispered with their friends when they saw Anthony
giving Daria a short embrace which his niece returned. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoBodyTextIndent style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><SPAN lang=EN-US

turned away to welcome Jesse and Jane, Daria looked around and saw at once that
the people most flabbergasted were Sandi, Stacy and Tiffany, who stood next to
the faculty lounge door. Finally Sandi walked over to Daria. "<SPAN
style="COLOR: #00ccff">Say, Quinn's sister... is hugging teachers a new thing
among unpopular people or did I miss something</SPAN>?" Jane smirked. "<SPAN
style="COLOR: red">I'd like to fill you in, Sandi, but I think <SPAN
class=GramE>it's</SPAN> Daria's privilege to do so</SPAN>." "<SPAN
style="COLOR: #00ccff">Huh? I don't understand</SPAN>?" Daria smiled at Sandi
(which was already enough to make the younger girl uncomfortable) before she
spoke. "<SPAN style="COLOR: green">Please let me introduce my long-lost uncle
Anthony, Sandi. I think you know him</SPAN>." Sandi looked as if a dinosaur had
just flattened her wardrobe. "<SPAN class=GramE><SPAN

too</SPAN>?" "<SPAN style="COLOR: green">Since you know that we two are full

I don't understand! How can he be your uncle<SPAN class=GramE>...</SPAN> I

<P class=MsoBodyTextIndent style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><SPAN lang=EN-US
style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">Stacy came over to them after noticing Sandi's
astonished face. "<SPAN style="COLOR: #993366">What has happened, Sandi? Can't
Quinn come</SPAN>?" "<SPAN style="COLOR: green">I just told her DeMartino's my
and Quinn's uncle, so she's still fighting to cope with it</SPAN>." Daria said.
"<SPAN style="COLOR: green">And no, Quinn will come to the prom, but I won't
spoil her surprise about who's escorting her</SPAN>." She gave Sandi a short
push. "<SPAN style="COLOR: green">Go take her to the next girls' bathroom,
Stacy. I think she might need a moment to digest the information</SPAN>." Stacy
took her friend by the arm to guide her, supported by Tiffany who had approached
also and the three girls walked away from Daria when they saw Quinn entering.
Sandi immediately brushed off the other two, straightened herself and walked
back towards Quinn, adopting a look of faux concern. "<SPAN
style="COLOR: #00ccff">Hello, Quinn. It's brave of you to come even though no
guy asked you to be his date tonight</SPAN>." She leant towards her friend.
"<SPAN style="COLOR: #00ccff">You know, we could persuade Stacy to let Joey be
your escort for tonight. If we tell her that his black hair clashes with her
brown, she'll probably accept</SPAN>." Quinn frowned, <SPAN
class=GramE>then</SPAN> she smiled at Sandi. <SPAN class=GramE>"<SPAN
style="COLOR: fuchsia">Oh, Sandi.</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN style="COLOR: fuchsia">
It's so sweet that you'd like to help me with finding an escort - at Stacy's
expense, of course - but I don't think it's necessary</SPAN>." She turned and
knocked at the door. "<SPAN style="COLOR: fuchsia">I asked a very good friend of
mine if he wanted to be my escort and he accepted. I think you know him,
Sandi</SPAN>." The door opened and David stepped in, giving Quinn a kiss on the
cheek.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoBodyTextIndent style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><SPAN lang=EN-US
style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">Sandi was petrified for a moment, before she
started to stammer something inaudible and ended up just staring at David like
someone trying to fight a serious hangover. David glanced over to Quinn - who
visibly enjoyed every second of the situation - then he took Sandi's limp hand
and shook it. "<SPAN style="COLOR: #ff6600">I'm delighted to meet you again,
Sandi. Quinn told me that she made so much progress this year. I hope we'll meet
each other again later so that you can tell me about your studies</SPAN>." Sandi
stared at him, then she stepped back, muttering "<SPAN class=SpellE><SPAN
style="COLOR: #00ccff">Uhmyesl</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN style="COLOR: #00ccff">...
sorry...<SPAN class=SpellE>Igottagotothebathroom</SPAN></SPAN>." before she ran
towards a door at the other end of the hall. Quinn smiled at David, <SPAN
class=GramE>then</SPAN> she turned to see something that amazed her even more
than Sandi's reaction: the sight of her own sister in a stunning dress, laughing
her head off along with everyone else present, including Stacy and
Tiffany.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

her out already with the news of our family addition, but I must admit that I'm
quite proud of myself</SPAN>." She took two glasses and handed one to David.
"<SPAN style="COLOR: fuchsia">Thanks for this, David. I'll never forget Sandi's
face when you asked her about the academic progress she'd made since last
year</SPAN>." "<SPAN style="COLOR: red">Though it was almost as good when she
stumbled back out of the door she had fled to with Jamie on her heels</SPAN>."
Jane remarked. "<SPAN style="COLOR: fuchsia">Yeah, and then him asking her if
she was so eager to dance with him that she'd even follow him to the boys room.
<SPAN class=GramE>Hilarious.<SPAN

you are as a fellow conspirer</SPAN>." "<SPAN style="COLOR: #ff6600">I thought
you'd never ask, my dear</SPAN>." He took her hand and guided her towards the

she turned to her friends. "<SPAN style="COLOR: green">I still wonder if he's
got any serious designs about her, but even if he has, he'll treat her better

answer</SPAN>?" "<SPAN style="COLOR: olive">I told him I knew and I
congratulated him. Don't take this the wrong way, Daria, but there have been
times when I'd gladly traded your concerned and supportive parents for my own
air-headed set which rather traveled around the world than care for their kids
during the last years</SPAN>." He looked thoughtful. "<SPAN

with them - not to talk about Danny and all the changes he'll mean to their life

you, Jane</SPAN>." Daria warned before she looked at <st1:City

you'll dance too, <SPAN class=SpellE>amiga</SPAN></SPAN>." Jane shrugged. "<SPAN

<P class=MsoBodyTextIndent style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><SPAN lang=EN-US
style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">Fortunately for Daria (and Trent), the DJ was
just playing something easy to dance to, so they managed to dance for several
minutes without making bigger mistakes. Jesse and Jane were visibly enjoying
themselves and, since Jesse was really an excellent dancer, they were the center
of attention after the first song. When the music stopped for a moment, neither
of them realized it until the people around them started applauding - and a
camera flashed. Jane looked at the source of the flash and immediately saw the
camera in Daria's hands. Jane scowled for a moment, <SPAN

"<SPAN style="COLOR: green">Regarding how Jesse spun you around, I think I

really recovered - and now he's wasted already so much time that I'm wondering
whether he'll ever do. He manages to hide it better than before, though</SPAN>."
"<SPAN style="COLOR: teal">Yes, I saw that when I met him outside. What's he

and the four friends went back to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><SPAN

car. As they drove through the night, Daria looked out of the window, deep in
thought. <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><SPAN style="COLOR: green">So
that's it. That was the big prom that some of my classmates have been talking
about all through high school.</SPAN></I> She smiled to herself. <I

perspective changed over the years. When I arrived here, I was dead certain the
Four Riders of the Apocalypse allied with the Nine <SPAN
class=SpellE>Nazg&ucirc;l</SPAN> would not be able to drag me to the prom. After the
first year, Jane and I had vowed to go there hand in hand and play the 'happy
couple' for all the idiots who believed we were lesbians. Then Jane met Tom and
I thought I'd be on my own - only to find the situation reversed some time
later. After all, it went really smooth... and I believe my fellow students also
had an evening whose memories each of them will treasure - or damn -
forever.</SPAN></I> <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoBodyTextIndent style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><SPAN lang=EN-US
style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">She leant back in her seat as the pictures of
the night passed through her mind: Sandi had mysteriously vanished after her
first dance and left Jamie free to stalk other prey while Stacy had danced for
hours with Joey and they had left together practically hanging onto each other -
<I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><SPAN style="COLOR: green">they were
probably at Lover's Lane now</SPAN></I>, Daria mused. Tiffany and Jeffy had also
gone their separate ways soon after the first dance, Tiffany leaving later since
two of her friends had already gone and Quinn had been inseparable from David
for the whole evening. <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><SPAN
style="COLOR: green">Maybe there is something between them</SPAN></I>, Daria
thought for a moment, but it seemed more like her sister had - <I
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><SPAN
style="COLOR: green">finally</SPAN></I> - found a real friend like she had had
all the time in Jane. Her thoughts wandered to her fellow graduates. Britanny
had danced with Kevin, but everyone present who'd seen before through the past
years could tell that her heart was no longer in this - <I
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><SPAN style="COLOR: green">and Kevin must've
felt this too</SPAN></I>, Daria thought, since she'd seen him leaving later,
looking rather downcast. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

a football stadium with hundreds of chairs on the lawn and a podium with several
seats. Behind the podium stood a huge picture of Jake's father in full colonel
uniform with seven Purple Hearts, one Distinguished Service Cross, two silver
and two bronze stars and several rows of combat ribbons. Jake cringed inwardly
at seeing the determined expression on his father's face that had (far too
often) meant trouble for him during twelve years of his childhood. He looked at
his mother and was not surprised to see her smiling at the sight of the "heroic
picture". <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><SPAN style="COLOR: navy">She

smallish elderly woman with graying hair in the back seat and a lean,
middle-aged man on the driver's seat wearing a rumpled grey suit and sunglasses.
Since neither of them looked like they were allowed to enter the base, the

"<SPAN style="COLOR: olive">Ladies and Gentlemen, members of the Armed Forces,
I'm Colonel George S. P. Blunt, CO of the 99<SUP>th</SUP> National Guard
Brigade. I'm honored to welcome you all for this special ceremony for a true
American hero who fought for his country in three wars and rose from private to
the rank of colonel before he gave the ultimate sacrifice a soldier can give to
his country: his own life. We are here to honor Martin Dylan Morgendorffer, who
volunteered for service at the age of eighteen and enlisted in the
36<SUP>th</SUP> Infantry Division. He fought with this division for three years
in Italy, France and Southern Germany, earning three purple hearts, one silver
and one bronze star as well as the bars of First Lieutenant and the nickname of
"Mad Dog" derived from his Christian name initials. After the Second World War,
he stayed in the army, right here in our newly-built <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Fort</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName

colonel made a short pause before continuing. "<SPAN style="COLOR: olive">In
1950, Captain Martin Morgendorffer was transferred to the 25<SUP>th</SUP>
Infantry Division in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
w:st="on">Korea</st1:country-region></st1:place> as a company commander. Again
his performance was spotless, this time resulting in two more purple hearts,
another bronze star and the Distinguished Service Cross for his three-day raid
into hostile territory beyond the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
w:st="on"><SPAN class=SpellE>Naktong</SPAN></st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType

w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Korea</st1:country-region></st1:place>
with the temporary rank of Major in 1953. In the same year, he left the active
service in favor of a position in the National Guard and married his fianc&eacute;e
Ruth Kent. In 1954, he became father of a son whom he named after one of his
highest superiors in World War II: Jacob <SPAN class=SpellE>Devers</SPAN>
Morgendorffer. I am happy to say that Colonel Morgendorffer's widow and son have
both come here today to witness the ceremony in his honor</SPAN>."

turned and gestured at Jake and Ruth, who both rose and got a short applause
before they sat down again. "<SPAN style="COLOR: olive">In spite of his regular
work, Martin Morgendorffer always kept a keen interest for the army and his
country. When the 99<SUP>th</SUP> National Guard Brigade was founded in 1956, he
played a vital role in its induction and held several important posts in it:
after being its first operations officer, he took over the command of the first
battalion and finally became deputy commander of the brigade in 1964. One year
later, his country called him back to service and for the third time in
twenty-four years, he answered the call without hesitation</SPAN>." He looked up
for a moment, <SPAN class=GramE>then</SPAN> he spoke again. "<SPAN
style="COLOR: olive">Lieutenant-Colonel Morgendorffer, as he was by then,
received an extremely difficult command: a garrison in the Mekong Delta, which
was infested with enemies fighting a guerilla war against the South Vietnamese.
For three years, Martin Morgendorffer held this garrison with American and ARVN
soldiers and proved the truth of his nickname "Mad Dog". This earned him another
Silver Star, two more Purple Hearts and a full colonelcy. In 1969, his name was
on the list for promotion to the rank of brigadier general in spite of being a
National Guard Officer of 45 years. One week before his assignment would have
ended, Colonel Morgendorffer died in a VC bomb trap which was laid out for him
personally</SPAN><SPAN class=GramE>."</SPAN> <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoBodyTextIndent style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><SPAN lang=EN-US
style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">Now the colonel took a deep breath. "<SPAN
style="COLOR: olive">As a young private, I was a member of Colonel
Morgendorffer's 'Task Force Firebird' and had the privilege to meet him as well
as to experience his handling of critical situations. He became one of the
reasons I decided to stay with the army and become an officer. Today, I'm
standing here as CO of the unit Colonel Morgendorffer built up almost from
scrap. It is a great honor for me and every day, I'm trying to follow his
example of leadership and courage</SPAN><SPAN class=GramE>."</SPAN> He turned
around to the gigantic picture behind him and saluted. "<SPAN
style="COLOR: olive">Thank you, Sir. I wish our country had more people like
you</SPAN><SPAN class=GramE>."</SPAN> The audience clapped as the colonel looked
at Jake, giving him a sign to step towards the microphone.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoBodyTextIndent style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><SPAN lang=EN-US

adjusted the microphone and smiled as he saw Anthony and Nora sitting at the end
of one of the middle rows. <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><SPAN
style="COLOR: navy">Let's start the show</SPAN></I>, he thought as he looked at
the people in the audience who were now waiting for him to begin to speak. <I
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><SPAN style="COLOR: navy">Now we'll have
some honest words about your merits, Dad. That's for all the years of

<P class=MsoBodyTextIndent style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><SPAN lang=EN-US

warm words about my father, Colonel Blunt. I think you were able to present his
military achievements and merits better than I ever could</SPAN><SPAN
class=GramE>."</SPAN> He cleared his throat. "<SPAN style="COLOR: navy">Ladies
and Gentlemen, you just heard that my father entered the army at the age of
eighteen and died at the age of forty-five while being on duty in <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:country-region
w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:country-region></st1:place>, which means that
three-fifths of his life were spent in the service of his country. I think that
the army was the most important thing in my father's life. Even in the late
1950's, when he worked as contractor in the town we lived back then, he kept
close connections to the Army through friends and colleagues who had stayed
there and all his actions and manners were dominated by his past career in
uniform. His idea of a perfect life was to spend it in the service of his
country, and - when this time should have come - to die fighting for his
country. I believe that, if he had known that this was his fate, he would have
been glad and thankful</SPAN><SPAN class=GramE>."</SPAN> <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoBodyTextIndent style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><SPAN lang=EN-US
style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">Jake readjusted his hands before continuing his
speech. "<SPAN style="COLOR: navy">Indeed, when I was a boy, I never understood
why my father had ever left the place he called 'the perfect work for <SPAN
class=GramE>him' whenever</SPAN> he talked with me about his time of service.
<SPAN class=GramE>Those of his friends who had stayed in the army after the
Korean War and who visited us occasionally, never understood this either, as far
as I could gather from their talks with my father.</SPAN> He always said that,
as a guard officer, he still was a part of the army, which meant he would be
present if his country needed him. But his friends saw as well as I did that a
few weeks of duty each year could not make up for a past where every day had
been dedicated to the army. Therefore, my mother and I were happy for him when
he was sent to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:country-region></st1:place> in 1965, not knowing he would
never fully come back except as a coffin decorated with the flag he gave his
life for</SPAN><SPAN class=GramE>."</SPAN><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoBodyTextIndent style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><SPAN lang=EN-US

man who wore a shabby coat with several medals wiped his face to hide a tear,
and even Ruth, who knew what her son would say next, felt touched by the speech.
Jake surveyed the audience with a short glance. <I
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><SPAN style="COLOR: navy">I have them where
I wanted them. <SPAN class=GramE>Now for the honest part of this.</SPAN>
</SPAN></I>"<SPAN style="COLOR: navy">It was not until ten days back that I
learnt the real reason why my father left the army in 1953. Back in 1950, my
father was subpoenaed for a trial at <st1:PlaceType

two months later that she was pregnant</SPAN>." Now the audience was a beehive
of whispering and mumbling as Jake looked on his notes. "<SPAN

name to the girl and, Morgendorffer being a very unusual name, she remembered it
even two months later. However, when she called <st1:place

father's visit and phoned the second woman who had called for him and had left a
number - his fianc&eacute;e, my mother. She called Korea and, after insisting on
talking to Captain Morgendorffer, they had a rough talk which ended with him
hanging up, being too cowardly to continue</SPAN>." <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

returned from Korea in 1953, my mother met him and gave him a choice: either he
would marry her, leave the army and find a way to make the girl forget him and
his crimes forever, or she would contact the girl herself and ensure that he
would have to face punishment both from military and civil justice for what he
did. He chose the first way and asked for release from active service and
transfer to a National Guard outfit, which my mother accepted as a compromise.
Then he went down to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType
w:st="on">Fort</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName
w:st="on">Campbell</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> and offered the girl 10.000 $ in
exchange for a written statement clearing him from any responsibility for the
child, a two-year-old son. When the girl, who had been thrown out of school as
well as her home for getting herself pregnant, declined this, he forced her to
sign the statement and take the money before he vanished again, never to return
to that place</SPAN>." <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoBodyTextIndent style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><SPAN lang=EN-US
style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">"<SPAN style="COLOR: navy">My parents married
in 1953, shortly before I was born. By then, my father had got work as a rain

w:st="on">Fort</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName
w:st="on">King</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>. In the following years, it became
clear that the choice my mother had forced her husband to make had meant to take
away the only place and pastime he had ever truly loved, for which he never
forgave her. Since he could not train and educate young recruits the way he had
done and had intended to do until death or old age should stop him, he focused
on the only target he still had for his lessons - me. My mother did not
appreciate the way he treated me, but she feared that, if she told him to stop
it, he would leave us. From 1954 to 1966, we lived a miserable life, my father
suffering because his wife had virtually ended his career, my mother suffering
because her husband hated her for that and me suffering because my father tried
to mould me into a perfect man and soldier who should one day become all that he
himself had never achieved. This also involved enlisting me in military school
from age 10 on, although he knew I hated every second I had to spend there. Even
when he went to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:country-region></st1:place>, I still had to stay there.
When I finally got out, it was only because my mother decided to take me out of
it after my father died in 1969<SPAN

<P class=MsoBodyTextIndent style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><SPAN lang=EN-US
style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">Jake glanced through the audience. The higher
officers looked shocked about his speech, but the lower-ranking people and
almost everyone in civilian clothes seemed sad and touched about his words. <I
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><SPAN style="COLOR: navy">And here comes the
crowning detail</SPAN></I>, he thought as he cleared his throat to signal that
his speech was not finished yet. "<SPAN style="COLOR: navy">For almost fifty
years, I could not understood my parents' actions against me or each other, not
knowing about my father's crimes which doomed several people as well as himself
to live a sad life</SPAN>." He raised his voice to prepare for his next words.
"<SPAN style="COLOR: navy">Please let me introduce two people on which Martin
Dylan Morgendorffer inflicted an even more terrible life than on his lawful wife
and me, needing just one night and a short visit three years later to do so.
This is Miss Nora DeMartino from Roaring Spring, Kentucky, and her son Anthony
DeMartino, who was born in 1951 - nine months after Captain Morgendorffer used
his mother as a cheaper alternative to a prostitute and then chickened out of
his responsibilities</SPAN>." <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoBodyTextIndent style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><SPAN lang=EN-US
style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">Both Nora and Anthony rose from their chairs;
Nora looking very awkward, her son with a determined expression. Jake smiled at
them before he concentrated his gaze on the colonel in the first row who had
turned his head as well as many other people, looking totally flabbergasted as
Jake addressed him directly. "<SPAN style="COLOR: navy">Colonel Blunt, dear
members of the Armed Forces, ladies and gentlemen. My half-brother, his mother
and I hereby ask you to reconsider the idea to honor Colonel Martin Dylan
Morgendorffer by giving his name to a military building or institution. There
may be a reason to acknowledge his purely military acknowledgements during the
Second World War, the Korean War or the Vietnam War, although I can not imagine
that his leadership in training and combat will have been different than his
behavior towards his wife, his son and Miss DeMartino as well as her son
Anthony</SPAN>." <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoBodyTextIndent style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><SPAN lang=EN-US
style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">He cleared his throat. "<SPAN
style="COLOR: navy">Let me say just one more thing: For forty-six years, I
wished that my father had stayed in the army because I thought that he might
have been a better father and husband if he had continued the only career which
ever satisfied and pleased him. When I learned, ten days ago, why he had been
such a failure in civil life and what he had been capable to do even while being
part of his beloved army, I could only imagine which atrocities he might have
done if he had lived longer and risen to the rank of general, commanding
thousands of men in peacetime or war. I am sorry for wrecking a celebration for
which many people must have worked very hard, but I can only repeat what I said
before: Martin Dylan Morgendorffer was a ruthless man who never cared for others
except if they proved useful for his military or private aims. His premature
death saved me and my mother from a lot of grief, but he nevertheless used his
time to cast at least four people into decades of despair</SPAN><SPAN

<P class=MsoBodyTextIndent style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><SPAN lang=EN-US

Several civilians passing by gave them a friendly nod or a smile, which made

Jake. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoBodyTextIndent style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><SPAN lang=EN-US
style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">Suddenly, Jake got a hard slab on the back from
behind. When he turned around quickly, he faced an older man with many medals
and ribbons on his green uniform and a murderous expression on his face. The man
looked at the <SPAN class=SpellE>DeMartinos</SPAN> for a moment, <SPAN
class=GramE>then</SPAN> he fixed Jake again. "<SPAN style="COLOR: lime">Good
evening, Morgendorffer. Do you remember me</SPAN><SPAN class=GramE>?"</SPAN>
Jake measured the stranger for a moment, <SPAN class=GramE>then</SPAN> he shook
his head. The man grinned and waved a <SPAN class=SpellE>thumbless</SPAN> hand.
"<SPAN style="COLOR: lime">Last time I saw you, I told you we'd meet again.
Still not able to climb a rope, I think</SPAN><SPAN class=GramE>?"</SPAN> Jake
stared at him. "<SPAN style="COLOR: navy">Ellenbogen</SPAN><SPAN

you remember me, don't <SPAN class=GramE>you!</SPAN> What do you think you just
did out there</SPAN><SPAN class=GramE>?"</SPAN> Jake looked to his companions,
then he smiled. "<SPAN style="COLOR: navy">Well, you just heard it yourself,
Ellenbogen. What do you think it sounded like</SPAN><SPAN class=GramE>?"</SPAN>
Ellenbogen made a step towards his former pupil. "<SPAN style="COLOR: lime">You
defiled your father's oath and his honor, you punk! If he'd still live, he
would</SPAN>..." Jake cut his former instructor off with one motion of his hand.

you</SPAN><SPAN class=GramE>."</SPAN> Ellenbogen fumed. Just as he drew back his
arm to strike Jake, Anthony stepped behind him, blocking <SPAN
class=SpellE>Ellenbogen's</SPAN> move and pulling back his arm. "<SPAN
style="COLOR: teal">Sorry, Mister, but I can't have you attack my
brother</SPAN><SPAN class=GramE>."</SPAN> Ellenbogen looked back to him. "<SPAN
style="COLOR: lime">You're his half-brother, right? Leave me alone, you little
bastard</SPAN><SPAN class=GramE>!"</SPAN> He spat out towards Nora, who had
watched the encounter silently behind Jake. For one moment, Anthony's eye became
bloodshot, <SPAN class=GramE>then</SPAN> he shoved the other man away. Before
Ellenbogen could stop his momentum, he tripped over Jake's right leg and landed
on the ground with Anthony towering over him. "<SPAN style="COLOR: teal">Your

the news</SPAN><SPAN class=GramE>."</SPAN> Anthony looked at him almost
pitifully, <SPAN class=GramE>then</SPAN> he pushed the old NCO back on the
ground before he pulled him up by his jacket collar again. "<SPAN

for that</SPAN>." Ellenbogen laughed. "<SPAN style="COLOR: lime">And how do you
want to do that, you damned civilian</SPAN><SPAN class=GramE>?"</SPAN>
<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoBodyTextIndent style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><SPAN lang=EN-US

front of his opponent's face. "<SPAN style="COLOR: teal">Don't underestimate me,

the new blocks because the man they wanted to honor was found out to be a sadist
who took advantage of drunken underage girls. If you don't play along, it will
also say that a frustrated NCO of Fort King attacked the man who brought this
message without any further provocation and because of an old grudge. What do
you think will Colonel Blunt tell the papers - and how many minutes will he need
to summon you to his office to hand in your resignation? How old are you,
Ellenbogen? Too old to apply for another job after a dishonorable discharge from
the army, right</SPAN><SPAN class=GramE>?"</SPAN><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

week to hand in a resignation due to age and exertion to the Colonel. If you're
still here next Sunday, we'll have your rank and your decorations for what you
just tried to do and what you did to me back at Buxton. The choice is yours, but
like my brother just said: Don't underestimate us</SPAN><SPAN

around Jake's shoulders. "<SPAN style="COLOR: teal">You heard him, you
blockhead. Now drop dead</SPAN><SPAN class=GramE>."</SPAN> Ellenbogen nodded
hurriedly to the women before he walked off at a fast pace. Nora laughed and

something inaudible which made Jake turn to him. "<SPAN style="COLOR: navy">What

"<SPAN style="COLOR: #99cc00">It answers the first question Colonel Blunt had:

1953, he benefited from a law that officers transferring to National Guard units
received an amnesty from every present or future investigation against them for
crimes committed while in the service. That law was rescinded later, but it did
apply to your father. Moreover, thirty of the charges filed against him are
about his role in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region

he did to Ms. DeMartino in 1951 would have been one of the few things which
could've removed him from service at once. The early fifties were a different
age, for the military as well as for civil life. Being accused of - if I
remember correctly - giving an underage girl alcohol, then taking advantage of
her and, on top of that, first weasel out of the consequences and then coercing
the girl to keep quiet would've reduced General <SPAN
class=SpellE>MacArthur</SPAN> himself to the rank of colonel in 1953; a young
captain risen from the ranks doing that would've been busted with a dishonorable
discharge after five minutes trial - and the sheriff's men would've waited for
him at the gate, I guess. By consenting to leave the army, he ensured at least
that he could maybe return one day with a clean record</SPAN><SPAN

Medieval History and Creative Writing at Connecticut State College. In 2003
Charles was forced to take over the family's newspaper chain after his father
died from a heart attack in a hotel room he shared with his 'secretary', a girl
