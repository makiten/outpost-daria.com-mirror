<P>Summary: What happens when one 
amp breaks? Plenty.</P>

<P>Spoilers: Set pre-Fire so anything up to 
that.</P>

<P>Soundtrack: Dave Matthews Band, 8-23-2000, Hershey 
Stadium,
tasty Schoeps Mk4v source of a nice DMB Summer 2000 gig. As 
always
email for a B&amp;P and it's yours.</P>

<P>Busted 
Stuff</P>

<P>&quot;A rolling stone gathers no moss, just leaves a 
trail
of busted stuff.&quot;</P>

<P>Trent strolled down to his 
basement practice room. Along the
way he casually glanced around the 
house, &quot;Hmmm, no Janey,
must be a school day,&quot; he mused to 
himself. &quot;Yeah, Must
be a school day/I hope it's not 
Wednesday/Cause then it'd be Hump
Day/And my baby left me on Monday. 
Hmm, not bad,&quot; he thought.
&quot;Just needs some guitar...&quot; 
He plugged a guitar into
his aging amp. The young musician was so 
wrapped up in his new
song that he failed to notice the puff of smoke 
the amp emitted
when he turned it on.</P>

<P>&quot;Now let's see, 
why not B-minor for this on.&quot; Trent
strummed a chord on his 
guitar experimentally. The amp shook a
little and gave off more 
smoke. Satisfied with the result Trent
turned up the volume on the 
amp and launched into his latest musical
effort. The result was 
spectacular, though not in an intentional
way. The amp joined the 
choir invisible in a most dramatic fashion.
Smoke and flames billowed 
from the top of the amp while the front
and rear panels shot off. 
Trent fumbled around looking for the
fire extinguisher. He found it 
and hastily sprayed the burning
amplifier. The fire was extinguished 
and Trent was left with a
room full of smoke, and the ruins of his 
amp.</P>

<P>&quot;Whoa, bummer.&quot; He thought for a moment, 
&quot;Damnit,
we've got a gig tonight.&quot; Trent sighed and tried 
to reassemble
his amp. The task quickly proved to be too 
difficult.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh hell, I've got to take it to Doug, he can 
fix it.&quot;
Trent looked at the amp, then at the stairs, &quot;Hmm, 
better
wait for Janey to come home to give me a hand.&quot; Trent 
walked
back up to his room to wait, the smoke in the basement was 
bad
for his voice.</P>

<P>Over at Lawndale High an exploding amp 
would probably have
been a welcome diversion for Quinn. She was, at 
the moment, enduring
another of Mr. DeMartino's 
lectures.</P>

<P>&quot;Why do we have to listen to all this stuff 
that happened
in the past?&quot; She thought to herself, &quot;I 
mean, it's
already happened, it's not there's anything we can do 
about it.&quot;
She watched disinterested, as DeMartino upbraided one 
of her classmates
for not having the correct 
answer.</P>

<P>&quot;I'm sorry Timmy, but contrary to popular 
belief, Leonardo
was not a mutant turtle! I suppose I should feel 
sorry for you,
since you obviously lack any ability to separate 
fantasy from
reality, but frankly at this point my only concern is 
that you
don't get my order mixed up at McDonalds! Which is obviously 
where
you future lies!&quot; Mercifully for the class the bell 
rang
before DeMartino could light into any additional 
students.</P>

<P>As Quinn walked out of the room DeMartino stopped 
her, &quot;Ms.
Morgendorffer, could I have a word with 
you?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn stopped, &quot;Uh, 
sure?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Thank you for fitting me into your busy 
schedule of academic
non-participation. I just wanted to bring to 
your attention how
poorly you are doing in this class,&quot; Quinn 
shrugged. DeMartino
continued, &quot;Normally this would not concernme, if you want
to waste your academic career that's fine by me. Howev 
er, thanks
to a new policy this year, I'm required to inform students 
when
their failure is imminent. In fact if you don't get an A on 
your
research paper then you will fail this class. So I suggest 
you
start researching.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But isn't there anything 
else I could do, for extra credit
or 
something?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Please forgive me if I fail to see how 
you plan on passing
the course if you don't complete the basic 
requirements. Your
paper is due tomorrow, good luck.&quot; DeMartino 
started to chuckle
to himself.</P>

<P>Quinn sighed and walked out of 
the classroom. &quot;Well this
is just great.&quot; She thought to 
herself. &quot;How am I going
to get an A on this stupid history 
paper?' She paused, &quot;I
know, I'll just have Daria write it for 
me,&quot; Quinn sighed,
&quot;It will cost me that dress I wanted to 
buy, but I'll manage...somehow.&quot;
Quinn walked to her next class, 
trying to figure out how to convince
her sister to do her work, or at 
least how much it was going to
cost her this time.</P>

<P>Jane 
dropped her backpack in the middle of her living room.
Tom was coming 
by soon and she wanted to jot down a few ideas
before he showed up. 
As Jane walked up to her room she noticed
the house was unusually 
quiet.</P>

<P>&quot;Hmm,&quot; she mused, &quot;Trent's car is still 
here
so he's not out with the band, but he normally is awake by 
now.
I wonder what he's up to?&quot;</P>

<P>Her question was 
answered when Trent wandered into her room.
&quot;Hey Janey, what'cha 
doing?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hey Trent, nothing much, 
why?&quot;</P>

<P>Trent shrugged, &quot;My amp blew up on me 
today.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, that explains the silence, but what 
does it have
to do with me?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I need someone to 
help me get it fixed.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Trent, no. I won't, I've 
got stuff planned, Tom and I...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Are going to do 
what? Janey, all you and Tom ever do
is hang out and watch 
TV.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Like you're more ambitious in your social 
outings.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hey I'm not saying you two are doing 
anything wrong,
but can&#146;t it wait for another day? Janey, this 
is important.
The band's got a gig tonight so we have to leave like 
right now
if we want to make it back in 
time.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What do you mean? The music store's not ten 
minutes from
here.&quot;</P>

<P>Trent shook his head, &quot;No we 
have to take the amp to Doug
Boade over at Boade Hi-Fi, near 
Fremont.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane raised an eyebrow, &quot;Why so far 
away?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Because his amps have that special kick my 
music demands.
It's like there's another setting on the 
dial.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane cocked an eyebrow, &quot;Okay, that was a 
little too Spinal
Tap for me.&quot;</P>

<P>Trent laughed 
spasmodically, &quot;Good one Janey, Seriously,
Doug does good work, 
plus he's cheap.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane sighed, &quot;And none of the 
other guys can help you
out?&quot;</P>

<P>Trent shook his head, 
&quot;No, they're all busy with 
other
stuff.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Alright, alright, I'll help you out, 
but this is the
last time, you hear me.&quot; Jane shook her first at 
Trent.</P>

<P>&quot;Uh, why?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I don't know, it 
just seemed like the right thing to
say. Come on, let's get this 
done.&quot; The siblings went to
drag Trent's amp out to his car. 
&quot;Damn Trent, how much does
this thing weigh?&quot; Jane asked 
between breaths.</P>

<P>&quot;Not as much as Jesse's.&quot; Trent 
grunted. After much
work they managed to squeeze the bulky piece of 
electronics into
the back of Trent's car.</P>

<P>&quot;Hang on a 
second Trent, I want to leave Tom a note.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Good 
idea, that way he won't think you've been kidnapped
or 
something.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Or something yeah. I'll be right 
back.&quot; Jane dashed
off into the house. She returned a short 
while later with a piece
of paper and a roll of duct tape. The paper 
was attached to the
front door with a strip of the tape.</P>

<P>Jane 
got into the car. &quot;All set?&quot; Trent asked.</P>

<P>Jane 
nodded, &quot;Yeah, let's get this over with.&quot; Trent
started the 
car and they drove off.</P>

<P>Not quite a half-hour later Tom drove 
up to the Lane house.
He got out of his car and walked up to the 
front door, whistling
as he went. He tried to open the door, but 
found it locked. He
frowned, then noticed the note Jane had left for 
him.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh hell,&quot; he exclaimed, tearing the note off 
the
door. He trudged back to his car and tried to start it. The 
engine
caught, rattled, then was silent. &quot;Damnit!&quot; Tom 
shouted,
pounding on the steering wheel. Tom sighed, got back out of 
the
car and started walking to Daria's house.</P>

<P>Quinn had just 
arrived home herself when the doorbell rang.
She had ducked out of 
the daily Fashion Club meeting early in
order to catch Daria before 
she went anywhere.</P>

<P>&quot;Daria, I need to ask you for 
a...&quot; She began before
the doorbell cut her 
off.</P>

<P>&quot;Could you get that Quinn, you're closer.&quot; 
Daria
called out from the kitchen.</P>

<P>&quot;Quinn sighed in 
frustration, opened the door, and found
Tom standing there. 
&quot;Who're you?&quot; Quinn asked.</P>

<P>&quot;Uh, hi, I'm Tom, 
is Daria around?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I don't know why you'd want to 
see her, but yeah she
is. Daria!&quot; Quinn shouted, &quot;There's 
somebody here to
see you.&quot; Quinn walked off into the kitchen 
leaving a slightly
bewildered Tom standing on the front 
stoop.</P>

<P>Daria arrived shortly thereafter and stopped short 
when she
saw who was standing there, &quot;Tom? What are you doing 
here?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's a long story, can I come 
in?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What? Oh, sure, of course.&quot; Daria led 
Tom into the
living room and they sat down. She took the couch; he 
took the
futon. &quot;So, what's your tale of 
woe?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Ok, Jane and I were supposed to get together 
at her house.
Only when I show up she's not there. Instead there's 
this note
saying that she had to go to Fremont with Trent for 
something,
and that she won't be back for 
awhile.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I'm sure Jane has a perfectly good 
reason.&quot;</P>

<P>Tom held up a hand, &quot;That's not all, when 
I got back to
my car to leave I tried to start it and the engine 
died. So now
I need to call the garage to tow that hunk away and try 
to fix
whatever's wrong with it this time.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And 
you need to use my phone?&quot; Daria asked, filling
in the 
blanks.</P>

<P>Tom nodded, &quot;I need to use your phone, if you 
would be
so kind.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria shrugged, &quot;Sure, doesn't 
bother me any. Come on,
we can use the phone in my 
room.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;So that was your sister?&quot; Tom asked, 
trying to make
conversation as they walked up to Daria's 
room.</P>

<P>&quot;Yep, that was Quinn...um sorry about having to 
wait outside;
if it doesn't involve her Quinn doesn't even know it 
exists, and
that includes people.&quot;</P>

<P>Tom chuckled, 
&quot;That's ok, sometimes encountering the self-centered
can be 
educational, in a how not to behave sort of way.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria 
shrugged, &quot;In moderation sure, but try living with
the Queen of 
the Shallow End and see how you like it.&quot;</P>

<P>Tom chuckled 
again, &quot;That's quite all right, I have a
hard enough time 
dealing with my sister as it is. I don't need
any more 
problems.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I didn't know you had a 
sister.&quot;</P>

<P>Tom nodded, &quot;Yeah, Elsie, she's about your 
sister's age.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Major pain in the 
ass?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Isn't that the definition of a littler 
sister?&quot;
Tom replied easily.</P>

<P>Daria smirked, &quot;Just 
don't tell Jane that, I don't think
she's 
understand.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You're probably right,&quot; Tom said 
sagely, &quot;people
in her position never 
do.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What the hell is that supposed to mean?&quot; 
Daria asked
as her eyes narrowed 
threateningly.</P>

<P>&quot;Nothing, nothing,&quot; Tom stammered. 
&quot;Just that
you're right when you say that Jane, as a younger 
sibling, wouldn't
see the humor of the 
joke.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Right,&quot; Daria said, unconvinced, 
&quot;Why are you
really here Tom?&quot; She asked 
suddenly.</P>

<P>&quot;My car broke down and I need to call the 
garage for a
tow.&quot; Tom replied, bewildered, &quot;Why else would 
I be
here?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I don't know but you sure as hell 
aren't making many
phone calls.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And you haven't 
shown me where it is.&quot; Daria looked
around, they were standing 
outside the door to her room. &quot;Oh,
right, come on in.&quot; She 
mumbled as she opened the door.</P>

<P>&quot;Nice room,&quot; Tom 
commented, &quot;Very much in keeping
with your 
style.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And what does that mean?&quot; Daria 
demanded</P>

<P>&quot;Just that it's the kind of room designed to 
tweak people's
noses, something you like to do. And what is up with 
you?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Me?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, you. Ever 
since I got here you've been acting all
weird around me. I thought 
we'd reached a truce.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria shrugged, &quot;That's what 
I thought too, and then you
show up, bad mouthing my best friend. So 
excuse me if I seem a
little bent out of shape. Here's the 
phone.&quot;</P>

<P>Tom took it, but did not place a call, 
&quot;Hold on, there's
a difference between being a good friend and 
being blind to a
person's faults. I mean when Jane...&quot; He caught 
himself before
finished his sentence.</P>

<P>&quot;Jane what?&quot; 
Daria said darkly.</P>

<P>&quot;Um, never mind, I'll just be making 
that phone call and
be heading home.&quot; Tom said 
hastily.</P>

<P>Daria hung the phone up on Tom. &quot;Tom, tell me, 
Jane what?&quot;</P>

<P>Tom expelled a large sigh, &quot;Ok, right 
after the two of
us started going out Jane would occasionally, never 
very often,
express her frustration over how closed minded you were 
towards
our going out. It was really once or twice, not a big 
deal.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Once or twice eh?&quot; Daria asked, 
eyebrow arched.</P>

<P>&quot;Ok, ok, it was every time we went out 
until the two of
you patched things up.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria thought 
about this for a moment, then shrugged, &quot;I
guess I can't get too 
worked up over this little revelation, I
was a bit dense about the 
whole thing.&quot;</P>

<P>Tom simply nodded, he figured Daria 
wouldn't be interested
in hearing the actual phrases Jane had used 
during her diatribes,
&quot;Cold, intractable bitch,&quot; was the 
most polite of the
epithets Jane had hurled at her erstwhile 
friend.</P>

<P>Daria sighed, breaking Tom's train of thought. 
&quot;You're
point is well taken, I forgive you and promise to play 
nice. So
long as you aren't secretly planning to screw Jane in an 
uncomfortable
place or something equally 
nefarious.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Ye gods no,&quot; Tom said, making a 
face. &quot;That's
the first I've ever heard of such a plan. Besides, 
I don't even
own a Volkswagen.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria smirked, 
&quot;Good, because you wouldn't like the 
consequences.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You'd take out whatever was left 
over from when Jane
was done with me after Trent worked me 
over?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Assuming he could stay awake that long, 
yes.&quot;</P>

<P>Tom chuckled, &quot;then consider myself warned. 
Now if you
don't mind I need to place a phone call.&quot; Tom dialed 
the
number of a local mechanic. Daria could hear Tom say, 
&quot;It's
me, not there, not there, yeah, that's the place. Ok, yeah 
just
take it away and work your magic. Will you let me know when 
it's
ready? Great, thanks.&quot; Tom hung the phone 
up.</P>

<P>&quot;Let's see if I can guess.&quot; Daria said, 
&quot;Your
house, Fielding, and Jane's house?&quot; Tom nodded 
grimly. &quot;Your
car breaks down that 
much?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes, I'm on a first name basis with the 
mechanics.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Why don't you get a new 
car?&quot;</P>

<P>Tom shrugged, &quot;I don't know, I just like it. 
It's fun
to drive when it works, and it's got a lot of 
character.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;More character than body it 
seems,&quot; Daria said dryly.</P>

<P>&quot;That it does,&quot; Tom 
said chuckling ruefully. &quot;But
it still gets me from here to 
there and back, most of the time,
and it's become sort of a 
challenge, how much longer will the
car hold out.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria 
shook her head, &quot;Plus it pisses off your 
parents,
right?&quot;</P>

<P>Tom nodded, &quot;Yeah, that 
too.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;So, how long until they pick it up?&quot; 
Daria asked.
Before Tom could reply Quinn came barging into the 
room.</P>

<P>&quot;Daria I need you to do me a 
favor...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Quinn,&quot; Daria said in annoyance. 
&quot;Can't you
see I have company?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn looked over 
at Tom. &quot;Oh, you're still here. Who
are you and what does a boy 
want with Daria?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Quinn, this is Jane's boyfriend, 
Tom. He's a friend,
his car broke down, he's using the phone to call 
a tow truck.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, &quot;Quinn wrinkled her nose, 
&quot;He must be a
loser then, I've never seen him at school, not to 
mention that
he goes out with Jane, eww.&quot; She shuddered 
slightly.</P>

<P>Daria frowned, &quot;That's because he goes to 
Fielding Quinn.
Now please leave me before you make a further ass of 
yourself.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But you haven't agreed to help 
me.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;How could I agree to something if I don't 
know what it
is? Besides the answer is 
no.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Daria!&quot; Quinn whined, &quot;You have to 
help me.
If I don't get an A on my next history paper I'll fail 
history!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Why should I care? You obviously 
don't.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Because retards aren't popular, and if I 
fail DeMartino's
class I'll be a retard.&quot; Quinn said, like it 
was the most
obvious thing in the world.</P>

<P>&quot;Try telling 
that to...&quot; Daria sighed, &quot;Never
mind, it's not worth the 
effort to debate the point. Bye Quinn.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But I'll 
pay you, how ever much you want,&quot; 
Quinn
pleaded.</P>

<P>&quot;Sorry Quinn, I'd love to help you 
defraud the school
system but Tom asked for my help 
sooner.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh come on Daria, I'm your sister, and 
he's just your
friend's boyfriend.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Exactly,&quot; 
Daria said as she pushed Quinn out of
the room. &quot;Have a nice 
day.&quot; She started to shut the
door.</P>

<P>Quinn jammed her 
foot in the door, keeping it open. &quot;Please
Daria, I'm 
desperate.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria sighed, &quot;Ok, look, why don't you 
go ask Dave Wylie
for help, pretty good at 
history.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Dave?&quot; Quinn said, aghast, &quot;I 
can't ask him
for help.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's Dave or fail, your 
choice.&quot; Daria shut the
door in Quinn's face and jammed a chair 
against the door to keep
Quinn out. She turned to face Tom. &quot;I'm 
really sorry about
all that.&quot;</P>

<P>Tom shrugged, &quot;That's 
ok, it's so rare to see a person
so totally lacking in social grace 
out in the wild that when you
do it's a moment to be 
savored.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria smirked, &quot;Yeah, I get to savor it 
everyday, lucky
me.&quot;</P>

<P>Tom chucked, &quot;Well, what do we 
do now that you've so craftily
barricaded us in your 
room?&quot;</P>

<P>Daria looked over at the door and blushed when 
she realized
what she had done, &quot;Um, Quinn will probably be gone 
in a
short while.&quot;</P>

<P>Tom laughed, &quot;That's ok, I 
wasn't planning on going anywhere
special anyway. So, read any good 
books lately?&quot; The two
sat down and began to discuss 
literature.</P>

<P>Quinn paced furiously in her room. &quot;How dare 
Daria do
that to me?&quot; Quinn thought to herself, &quot;I'm her 
sister,
she has to help me, it's like a law or something.&quot; She 
kicked
one of the pillows on the floor, &quot;And now I have to go 
ask
Dave for help. That arrogant, rich jerk Dave. I'd almost 
rather
ask Upchuck for help.&quot; She stopped when she realized 
what
she had just thought. &quot;Ewwwwww!&quot; She shouted. 
&quot;Forget
that, Dave will be fine. I just think he's a jerk. You 
can do
this Morgendorffer, you have to pass.&quot; She kept 
repeating
this to herself as she left the house and started walking 
to the
Wylie residence. She was till saying her mantra when she 
pushed
the intercom button at the gate.</P>

<P>&quot;Y'ello, This is 
Jimmy.&quot; A jovial voice said.</P>

<P>&quot;Uh, hi, is ah, Dave 
in?&quot; Quinn asked.</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, one sec, let me see if I 
can go find the boy. You
can wait for him in the house, front door's 
unlocked.&quot; The
gate swung open and Quinn walked up to the house. 
Sure enough,
the front door was unlocked and Quinn let herself in. 
She stood
in the large entryway, fidgeting nervously until she heard 
a door
open.</P>

<P>&quot;Quinn? What are you doing here?&quot; Dave 
Wylie asked
as he walked up to her.</P>

<P>Quinn swallowed 
nervously, &quot;Um, Dave, I need your help
with my history paper. 
Will you help me? I'll pay you.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Quinn, you're 
offering to pay me?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh yeah, that is pretty silly 
isn't it?&quot; Quinn said,
laughing nervously. &quot;Will you help 
me anyway? Daria already
said no and told me to see 
you.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave looked thoughtful for a moment, then he 
shrugged, &quot;What
the hell I've got nothing better to do. Sure, 
I'll help you out.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn smiled brightly, &quot;Great, 
I'll pick it up before
school tomorrow then.&quot; She turned to 
leave.</P>

<P>Dave caught her by the arm, &quot;Wait a minute, where 
do you
think you're going?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Home, you're going to 
write my paper aren't you?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave shook his head, 
&quot;'Fraid not I said I'd help you write
it, not that I'd write it 
for you. Come on we've got work to do.&quot;</P>

<P>A horrified 
expression appeared on Quinn's face. 
&quot;But,
but...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's this or 
nothing.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn sighed in defeat, &quot;Ok, ok, we'll do 
it your way.&quot;
She let herself be lead away by Dave, a 
crestfallen expression
on her face.</P>

<P>Jane stared out the 
window of Trent's care as he drove them
to Boade Hi-Fi. She sighed, 
&quot;This is a mistake.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What do you mean? Do you 
think we should've taken the
left that that fork?&quot; Trent asked, 
turning his head to look
at Jane.</P>

<P>&quot;No, it's not that...I 
meant standing up Tom like this.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Janey, it was an 
emergency, and you did leave him a note.
He's a good guy, he'll 
understand.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, but lately I've gotten the 
feeling that he's growing
a little bit impatient with artistic 
flights of fancy.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Then maybe the art needs to 
come after your relationship.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But that goes 
against everything I know, haven't Mom
and Dad always told us that 
the art always comes first?&quot;</P>

<P>Trent smirked, &quot;And 
when have Mom and Dad been right about
anything?&quot;</P>

<P>Jane 
scowled, &quot;Damn, that's a good point.&quot; She sighed,
&quot;But 
I'm not sure I can do it.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Then I guess you have 
to ask yourself, how important
is your relationship with 
Tom?&quot;</P>

<P>Jane didn't answer, instead she just looked out 
the window.
Trent grunted and refocused his attention on the 
road.</P>

<P>Back at the Morgendorffer house Daria and Tom were 
sitting
in the living room, chatting to kill time.</P>

<P>&quot;So, 
what's it like going to a private school?&quot; 
Daria
asked.</P>

<P>&quot;Probably a lot like public school, except 
everyone wears
the same clothes.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Quinn's worst 
nightmare,&quot; Daria said dryly.</P>

<P>&quot;I'm sure, I'm not 
too thrilled about it either, but what
can you do?&quot; He 
shrugged.</P>

<P>&quot;You could not go.&quot;</P>

<P>Tom shook his 
head, &quot;That's not an option. Parental expectations
you 
know.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Not really but 
ok.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, I have to go to the right prep school 
so I can
keep the old family name in good 
esteem.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I'm sure Jane has some interesting things 
to say about
that,&quot; Daria said without thinking.</P>

<P>Tom's 
face tightened, &quot;Well I have some interesting things
to say 
about her family situation as well.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh hell Tom, 
I didn't mean to bring that up.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That's 
ok.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And I really don't want to hear what you're 
about to
say.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Daria, who else am I going to talk 
to?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I don't care, I just want to be left out of 
this. Getting
involved would only get me 
burned.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I appreciate that, but I just want to say 
this, you don't
have to listen. I think Jane's great, but she's 
starting to drive
me nuts with all of her 'following the muse' crap. 
I respect her
desire to be an artist, but she takes it too far at 
times.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria's eyes narrowed, &quot;What does that 
mean?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Just that some times I'd like it if she 
stopped playing
at being an artist and just be my girlfriend, just 
for a little
while at least.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Playing at being an 
artist? Tom that's who she is, if
you can't handle that then you 
shouldn't be going out with her,
because she's not going to 
change.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;She's seventeen who knows what they want 
to be when they're
seventeen?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Jane does, she's 
never wanted to be anything but an artist
and you'll never be able to 
separate your girlfriend from the
artist because there is not a 
distinction between the two.&quot;</P>

<P>Tom sighed, &quot;Yeah, I 
supposed you're right.&quot; He looked
at a nearby clock, &quot;Well, 
the tow truck's probably picked
up my car by now. I should get 
going.&quot; He stood up, &quot;Thanks
for letting me use your 
phone.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You're welcome.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;This 
was a fun afternoon, car trouble notwithstanding,
we should do it 
again sometime.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, sure.&quot; Daria replied 
flatly.</P>

<P>&quot;Wow your enthusiasm just bowls me over.&quot; 
Tom said,
chuckling.</P>

<P>&quot;What can I say, I'm just giddy 
with anticipation.&quot;
Daria walked Tom to the door. &quot;Bye 
Tom.&quot;</P>

<P>Tom waved, &quot;Bye Daria. See you later.&quot; 
He walked
down the path to the sidewalk and turned for 
home.</P>

<P>Daria watched as Tom walked down the sidewalk. She 
sighed,
then shut the door and got started on her homework. &quot;I 
wonder
if I did the right thing just then,&quot; She 
pondered.</P>

<P>Quinn was having very similar thoughts as Dave 
rummaged through
the shelves of the Wylie 
library.</P>

<P>&quot;Let's see, European history, any specific 
era?&quot;
Dave asked.</P>

<P>&quot;What?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Your 
class, is it focused on any particular portion of
European history, 
or the whole thing?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn shrugged, &quot;I don't know, 
all of it I guess. Why
does it matter?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well you'd 
look pretty silly turning in a paper on the
Norman Conquest if your 
class was about the German Reformation.&quot;
Quinn stared at him 
blankly, &quot;Okay, never mind.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;This is just 
DeMartino's class, I doubt he cares about
what we write about, if he 
even bothers to read the paper.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;This is 
true,&quot; Dave mused, &quot;I guess the question
becomes what do 
you want to write about?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I still don't see why I 
have to be here,&quot; Quinn
groused, &quot;You could have finished 
this already if you weren't
trying to get me to work with 
you.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave looked over at Quinn, &quot;Because, this way 
you might
actually learn something instead of just flouncing your way 
through
a rough spot.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But what if I don't want to 
learn anything?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Then just do what I say and let 
that be that. If you
don't want to be an active participant that's 
your deal, but I
don't want to help you cheat.&quot; He shrugged, 
&quot;I'm not
a big fan of cheating.&quot; He returned to the 
bookshelf, &quot;Wait
a second, this might just fit the bill.&quot; 
He took a book off
of the shelf, &quot;Tell me what you think about 
this.&quot; Dave
opened the book up and showed it to 
Quinn.</P>

<P>Quinn shrugged, &quot;Big deal, it's some guy wearing 
funny
old clothes.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Ok, sure, but what do those 
clothes say?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That he has no sense of style, 
ick.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Let me try to put this a different way, what 
do you clothes
say about you?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;My clothes?&quot; 
Quinn asked, Dave nodded. &quot;Well
they say that I'm fashionable, 
popular, and cute.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Right, now how about a person 
wearing a hand-tailored
Armani suit?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That they're 
rich?&quot; Quinn said tentatively.</P>

<P>&quot;Right again, now 
why?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn shrugged, &quot;Because that's what's 
fashionable, and
they cost a lot so only rich people can wear 
them.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes, now don't fashions 
change?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well d'uh.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;So, isn't 
it possible that this was fashionable back
when this guy was 
alive?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn frowned, &quot;I guess, but still, 
eww.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I agree, it doesn't look too 
comfortable,&quot; Dave
said, chuckling, &quot;But don't we wear a 
lot of uncomfortable
clothes in the name of fashion as 
well?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well yeah, sure.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;So 
knowing this is what was considered fashionable tell
me what do you 
see?&quot; Dave handed the book to Quinn.</P>

<P>Quinn took the book 
and stared at the picture for a while longer.
&quot;It's someone who 
wants to appear important.&quot; She 
declared.</P>

<P>&quot;Okay,&quot; Dave said, a satisfied smirk on 
his face,
&quot;Why do you say that?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;By the 
clothes, they might look awful, but they're high
quality material, at 
lot of silk in there.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;How can you tell that by 
looking at a picture?&quot;
Dave asked, surprised.</P>

<P>&quot;By 
the way the fabric drapes, that's silk alright,&quot;
Quinn said, 
confidently.</P>

<P>Dave nodded, impressed, &quot;Anything 
else?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well d'uh, all the jewelry. And the fur 
lining on that
cloak, very expensive.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What about 
the colors?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn cocked her head, &quot;What about 
them? They're nice
I guess, but a little too much. You don't want to 
overpower people
with too much color you know. It, like dominates 
everything and
keeps people from seeing how cute your clothes 
are.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I have to stop forgetting you devote a full 
99% of your
brain to fashion,&quot; Dave said in amazement &quot;So, 
how does
it feel to come up with the topic of your 
paper?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What?&quot; Quinn exclaimed, &quot;But we 
were talking
about clothes.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Clothes aren't 
history?&quot; Dave asked innocently.</P>

<P>&quot;I thought you 
were going to write about a war or 
something.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Enh, it's been done, trust me, if we 
write this paper
you'll have you&#146;re a for 
sure.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn looked dubious, &quot;I don't know, it 
seems too easy.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hey clothing is an important part 
of history. Didn't
you once tell me that you could read a person by 
their clothes?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But what does that have to do with 
history?&quot; Quinn
asked, frowning.</P>

<P>Dave sighed, 
&quot;There's more to history than battles and
'great men.' The small 
things like what people wore, or ate are
just as important as who was 
the king of 
what.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Why?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Because that tells 
us how regular people thought back
then, not the great philosophers, 
but normal people like you or
me, and that is the thesis of your 
paper.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh...don't you want to write that 
down?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Nah, the room's got a built in recording 
system, everything
we've said is on tape; my dad likes to be able to 
record ideas
the moment they come to him.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn looked 
around the room, trying to spot the microphones.
&quot;Oh that's 
great, he doesn't like have any cameras in the
room, does 
he?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Uh no, why?&quot; Dave asked, 
frowning.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, no reason.&quot; Quinn said 
lightly.</P>

<P>&quot;Ok, well, why don't we get started on the next 
picture
ok?&quot; Dave turned the page to another 
portrait.</P>

<P>&quot;Hey Janey, we're here.&quot; Trent 
said.</P>

<P>&quot;Huh?&quot; Jane asked, 
startled.</P>

<P>&quot;You weren't sleeping were you?&quot; Trent 
asked, slyly.</P>

<P>&quot;No, I 
was...thinking.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;About Tom?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Of 
course about Tom!&quot; Jane snapped, &quot;What the
hell else would 
I be thinking about?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, there's that leak in 
the roof. It's starting to
get pretty 
bad.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Really?&quot; I'll call somebody tomorrow to 
fix it,&quot;
Jane commented as they got out of the 
car.</P>

<P>&quot;Don't worry about it. I've got it taken care 
of...oof!&quot;
Trent gasped as he pulled the ruined amp out of the 
back of his
car.</P>

<P>&quot;You do, do you?&quot; Jane asked as 
she tried to maintain
her grip on the amp.</P>

<P>&quot;Cool, a 
palindrome,&quot; Trent chuckled. &quot;I met
a guy at the last gig 
who said he'd fix the roof for free.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Like I said, 
I'm calling a roofer tomorrow,&quot; Jane
replied 
acidly.</P>

<P>They wrangled the amp into the store. The interior of 
Boade
Hi-Fi was a jumble of audio-visual equipment of all types. 
Trent
gaped at the rows of guitars and mammoth amps.</P>

<P>&quot;If 
I had a couple of those Mystik Spiral would be huge.&quot;
Trent said 
confidently.</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, in the extermination business,&quot; 
Jane snickered.</P>

<P>&quot;That's no fair, those rats died of 
natural causes.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Trent! What'd you do to that amp 
this time?&quot; A voice
said from across the room. Jane couldn't see 
the source of the
voice from where she was 
standing.</P>

<P>&quot;B-minor Doug, can you fix 
it?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I can fix anything, bring it on back 
here.&quot; The
siblings carried the amp into the workroom. After 
Jane set the
amp down on a workbench she got her first, good look at 
Doug Boade.
The adjective that best fit the man was stringy. His thin 
face
was accentuated by the scraggly beard and ponytail he 
sported.
He wore a tattered Grateful Dead T-shirt and a tired pair of 
blue
jeans.</P>

<P>&quot;Just your typical friend of the Lane 
family,&quot; Jane
thought to herself.</P>

<P>&quot;Man Trent, you 
really knocked the stuffing out of it
this time,&quot; Doug said, 
analytically.</P>

<P>&quot;I guess it'd been acting up for a while, 
I just thought
the smoke was from our fog 
machine.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Trent,&quot; Jane said patiently, 
&quot;you don't have
a fog machine.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh yeah, I 
knew I was forgetting something.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Who's the lady 
with the sharp tongue?&quot; Doug asked.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, this is my 
sister, Jane. Janey, meet Doug Boade.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hey now, 
good to meet you,&quot; Doug said 
pleasantly.</P>

<P>&quot;Charmed,&quot; Jane replied.</P>

<P>Doug 
returned his attention to the amp. &quot;So, can you fix
it 
man?&quot; Trent asked as Doug poked the innards of the 
amp.</P>

<P>&quot;Sure, I can fix it, the only question is time. 
When do
you need it ready by?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Tonight, we've got 
a gig.&quot;</P>

<P>Doug shook his head, &quot;No can do Trent, 
you're looking
at a week's repair time at best, probably longer. 
You've blown
most of the tubes n here and replacements are hard to 
come by.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Aw man, I guess we could do an acoustic 
show tonight,&quot;
Trent said, downcast.</P>

<P>&quot;Actually I've 
got a proposal for you. This is a rare
amp, pretty valuable too. I'd 
be willing to give you a brand new,
top of the line model for this 
thing.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I don't know, I like the sound of this 
one...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Throw in a practice amp and you've got a 
deal,&quot;
Jane interjected. She and Doug shook 
hands.</P>

<P>&quot;Aww Janey, why'd you do 
that?''</P>

<P>&quot;Two reasons. One, so you can practice without 
endangering
the house, and two, so we don't have to lug that damn 
thing around
anymore. The new one will be smaller, 
right?&quot;</P>

<P>Doug nodded, &quot;Sure will be, now let's go 
find you a new
amp.&quot; Doug led the pair out to the showroom 
floor. Trent
look back longingly at his old amp.</P>

<P>&quot;Dave 
can we please stop looking at these pictures? If
I look at one more 
picture of some overweight guy wearing tights
I'll scream,&quot; 
Quinn complained. Dave had set up a slide projector
and was using 
that to display even more portraits for Quinn 
to
analyze.</P>

<P>&quot;Well, I guess we better stop then 
huh.&quot; Dave said
with a smile, &quot;So, what do you think the 
central theme was?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn shrugged, &quot;They wore 
fancy clothes to impress people?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Exactly,&quot; 
Dave said, snapping his fingers. &quot;Now
all that's left is to type 
this paper. Come on, we can do that
in my room.&quot; He pushed a 
button on a recessed panel and withdrew
a small 
cassette.</P>

<P>&quot;And how long will that 
take?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh no long at all, we just have to 
translate what you
said into something that would pass muster as a 
paper.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But Dave, it's almost dinner 
time.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It is?&quot; Dave asked, perplexed. He 
looked at his
watch, &quot;Oh, well I guess to some it might 
be.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What's that supposed to 
mean?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave shrugged, &quot;Since it's just my dad and I 
we don't
eat meals at any regular time, or together, he's usually off 
doing
something related to the business so meals are usually on a 
catch
as can basis.&quot; He paused, &quot;Okay, dinner's are 
really
just ask the chef for whatever you want whenever you want 
it,
but the other way sounds more 
dysfunctional.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Really, he makes whatever you ask 
for?&quot; Quinn asked.</P>

<P>Dave nodded, &quot;Pretty much, 
though he is getting a little
upset at my dad asking for hot dogs all 
the time.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Does he have a foreign 
accent?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave shook his head, &quot;Not unless you count 
New York as
a foreign country.&quot; Dave led Quinn through the large 
house
towards the kitchen.</P>

<P>&quot;Hey Dave, why are you doing 
all this for me anyway?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What I can't just be 
acting out of the goodness of my
heart?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well no, 
you have to be getting something out of this.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You 
really don't believe in charity do you?&quot; Dave
thought for a 
second, &quot;No wait, don't answer that. I don't
think I want to 
know the answer.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn frowned, &quot;You mean your dad 
doesn't pay you to do
stuff?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Sure, it's called my 
allowance, but beyond that he asks,
I do, usually. You know, that 
explains a lot.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The way 
you act, every thing is business with you. Let
me guess, normally you 
pay Daria to write your papers.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, 
so?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave shook his head, &quot;Never mind it's none of 
my business.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What the hell is that?&quot; Quinn 
demanded, &quot;You
start to criticize me and my family and then just 
stop and say
never mind. Come on, what were you going to 
say?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave sighed, &quot;I was going to say it's no 
wonder you're
a shallow clothes horse bitch, your family life has 
programmed
you that way. All solutions in life can be found if you 
buy the
right thing.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn's knuckles whitened as she 
clenched her fists. &quot;Oh
fine for the rich boy to say 
that.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave shrugged, &quot;There's plenty of things 
that money can't
buy, believe me on that one.&quot; A flicker of 
suppressed sadness
played across Dave's face. He shook his head, 
&quot;Look, forget
I said anything, let's get some dinner and finish 
your paper.&quot;
He started walking back down the 
hall.</P>

<P>&quot;But you still haven't answered my question, why 
are you
helping me?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave turned and faced Quinn, an 
impish smile on his face, &quot;Why
for the karma of course. The way 
I see if, walking you through
writing an A paper will get me enough 
good karma points to overcome
any bad karma that might come my way 
for quite some time. Besides,
I like impossible tasks, and getting 
you an A on this paper is
as impossible as they 
get.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You bastard!&quot; Quinn shrieked, and 
punched him on
the arm. Dave started running when he saw Quinn ready 
another
blow and the two teens chased each other around the 
mansion.</P>

<P>Trent swung the car into the Lane driveway and 
killed the engine.
&quot;Thanks for helping me out Janey, it means a 
lot to me. You
know, what with Tom and all.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane smiled 
weakly, &quot;Hey don't mention it, you are my
only 
brother.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Uh, no I'm not.&quot; Trent said, 
confused.</P>

<P>&quot;You're not? Oh damn, right, you're not. Well 
you're my
eldest brother...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Wrong again 
Janey.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh damn, well you're my favorite brother, 
how's that?&quot;</P>

<P>Trent smiled, &quot;Sounds cool to 
me.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Need a hand with any of this stuff?&quot; 
Jane nodded
at the backseat filled with audio gear they had talked 
Doug out
of in exchange for Trent's old amp.</P>

<P>&quot;Nah, I can 
handle it, you go call Tom. Besides, I have
to go if I want to be at 
the gig on time.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Who are you and what have you 
done with my brother?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Janey, I wish you'd stop 
saying that every time I say
I want to be on time for something, it's 
very distracting.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, sorry. Have a good 
show,&quot; she said, waving goodbye.</P>

<P>&quot;See you later 
tonight.&quot; Trent restarted his car
and drove away.</P>

<P>Jane 
walked up to the front door, she noticed that the note
she left was 
missing. &quot;Either Tom came by or somebody else
knows that I 
wasn't home and cleaned us out.&quot; She opened
the door and walked 
into the house. &quot;Well, everything is
still here, must have been 
Tom.&quot; She found the phone in the
clutter and dialed the Sloane's 
number.</P>

<P>&quot;Hello, Sloane residence,&quot; Tom's mother 
said in greeting.</P>

<P>&quot;Hi Mrs. Sloane, it's Jane, is Tom 
there?&quot;<BR>
</P>

<P>&quot;Why hello Jane, so nice to hear from 
you. Hold on a moment,
let me see if I can find 
Tom.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane heard a click and the strains of a Mozart 
piano concerto
came wafting out of the phone. &quot;It figures the 
Sloanes have
Muzak for their home phones,&quot; she 
thought.</P>

<P>The music suddenly stopped and the voice of Tom's 
mother came
back on the line, &quot;Jane, Tom told me to tell you 
that he'd
be right over.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But I just wanted to 
talk to him,&quot; Jane said desperately.</P>

<P>&quot;He seemed to 
think otherwise, you know how boys 
are.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jane replied 
dubiously.</P>

<P>&quot;The two of you aren't doing anything are you 
shouldn't
be?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What? No, no, we're not Mrs. 
Sloane,&quot; Jane said,
distracted by other 
thoughts.</P>

<P>&quot;That's good to hear.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;A 
pleasure talking to you Mrs. Sloane.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes it was 
Jane, don't be a stranger.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I 
won't.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, and Jane if anything happens that 
might hurt Tom's
future standing you won't like what happens to 
you.&quot; Ice
crept into Kay Sloane's cheery 
voice.</P>

<P>&quot;I'll definitely keep that firmly in mind,&quot; 
Jane
said darkly.</P>

<P>&quot;So good to hear from you. Bye 
Jane.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Bye Mrs. Sloane.&quot; Jane hung the phone 
up. &quot;Well,
it's not everyday the chairwoman of the local Amnesty 
International
chapter threatens your life.&quot; She shrugged, she 
knew the
Sloanes didn't necessarily like her, but she didn't 
necessarily
like them, so it was a wash. Jane sat down on the couch 
and waited
for Tom to show up. &quot;I wonder why Tom wanted to come 
here.
I just wanted to talk on the phone.&quot; She frowned, 
&quot;This
can't be a good thing.&quot; She paused again, &quot;And 
it's
really bad that a girlfriend isn't happy that her boyfriend 
is
coming over to see her.&quot; Jane hugged her knees to her 
chest
as she tried to fine the answers to the nagging questions 
flying
about inside her head. She was so lost in thought that she 
failed
to hear the sound of a car pulling up to the house, or the 
knock
on the door.</P>

<P>Tom knocked on the door again; he had come 
over to Jane's house
as quickly as he could. Which was pretty fast 
since he'd borrowed
one of his dad'scars. There was still no reply so 
he tried the
door and found it open. He cautiously stuck his head 
inside. &quot;Hello?
Jane, you here?&quot; He asked 
tentatively.</P>

<P>&quot;...Jane, you here?&quot; Tom's voice cut 
through Jane's
thoughts causing her to look up.</P>

<P>&quot;Hey 
Tom, I'm here, come on in.&quot; She stood up and
walked over to Tom. 
They did not kiss.</P>

<P>&quot;Hey Jane...&quot; Tom began to 
say.</P>

<P>&quot;Look Tom,&quot; Jane interrupted, &quot;I'm really 
sorry
about this afternoon, but it really was an emergency. 
Trent's
amp blew up and he needed my help getting it replaced. I'm 
sorry
we couldn&#146;t wait for you, but Trent has a show tonight 
so
time was an issue too. So, uh, I'm basically pretty 
sorry.&quot;</P>

<P>Tom smiled sadly, &quot;You can say that again. 
Jane, I don't
have a problem with you helping your brother out, what 
kind of
an ass would that make me if I did?&quot; Jane smirked, 
&quot;But
I do have a problem with the fact that sometimes I'm 
secondary
to whatever's grabbed your attention at that moment, gummy 
bear
sculptures, astronomical photography, and whatever else the 
current
flavor of the month is in art.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;So you 
expect me to drop all my other interests to just
be your 
girlfriend?&quot; Jane asked angrily.</P>

<P>&quot;No, I'm not 
saying that. I'm just wondering if you can
set aside your artistic 
persona for a little while every now and
then.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;My 
artist persona?&quot; Jane yelled. &quot;I am an artist,
get over 
it.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No, you're a teenage girl looking for some 
sort of identity
because her absentee parents have left her with 
nothing but a
slightly crumbling house and a brother who has less 
drive than
a two cylinder engine!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Tom...&quot; 
Jane started to say, then she paused. &quot;Get
out,&quot; she said 
quietly.</P>

<P>&quot;What?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Get 
out.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Get out?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes, go, scram, 
get lost, vamoose, you're not wanted
around here, go home, don't come 
back.&quot;</P>

<P>Tom frowned, &quot;Do you mean 
that?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;For now. So you'd better get your ass out 
that door before
I start swinging.&quot;</P>

<P>Tom backed towards 
the door, &quot;Jane, I...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You didn't mean it. 
Yeah I know. But I also know this.
I am an artist. I've always been 
an artist, and I always will
be an artist. If you have problem with 
that then you shouldn't
be going out with me.&quot;</P>

<P>Tom stood 
in the door, &quot;I know that Jane, but I also know
that unless 
you're willing to bend a little then you shouldn't
be going out with 
me, or anyone else for that matter.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Didn't I tell 
you to leave?&quot; Jane growled.</P>

<P>&quot;Are you really sure 
you mean that?&quot; Tom asked, concerned.</P>

<P>&quot;For right 
now yes. I'm not in the mood to have this conversation
with 
you.&quot;</P>

<P>Tom's face hardened, &quot;Fine, if you're going 
to be stubborn
I'll go.&quot; Tom turned and walked out the 
door.</P>

<P>&quot;Hey Tom,&quot; Jane called 
out.</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah?&quot; Tom asked, without turning 
around.</P>

<P>&quot;If you, uh, come by tomorrow I'd probably be in 
the mood
to talk.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That's nice, I'm not sure I'll 
be, but we'll see.&quot;
Tom exited the house before Jane could 
reply.</P>

<P>Jane dropped back onto the couch, &quot;Aw hell, that 
went
great.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria looked up from the book she was 
reading and glanced at
the clock. &quot;I wonder if Jane's home 
yet?&quot; Daria thought
to herself as she reached for the phone. She 
got a pickup after
the fifth ring.</P>

<P>&quot;Hello Lane 
residence,&quot; Jane said.</P>

<P>&quot;Hi 
Jane.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hey Daria, to what do I owe the 
pleasure?&quot; Jane
said with mock 
cheerfulness.</P>

<P>&quot;Nothing really, just wanted to call and 
see what you
were up to...&quot; Daria paused, &quot;Uh Jane, Tom 
came by this
afternoon.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Trent's amp blew out on 
him, we had to take it to a specialist.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, well 
that explains that.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Why did Tom go to your 
house?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;His car died on him, he had to call the 
garage.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That explains why I didn't hear him drive 
up...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;So you've talked to Tom?&quot;</P>

<P>Jane 
sighed, &quot;Yeah, we had a pretty good dustup 
too.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But everything is ok now, 
right?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Not exactly.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;So you 
two broke up?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Not 
exactly.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Then where exactly are you?&quot; Daria 
could almost
hear Jane's shrug.</P>

<P>&quot;I dunno, we were both 
pretty pissed off at each other.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I want no part 
in any of this. Let me just say that 
up
front.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Gee, what support, nice to know you're 
there for me buddy.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria sighed, &quot;Damn, you're 
right. Ok, against my better
judgement, why are you two pissed off at 
each other?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Let' see, Tom's mad at me for not 
being his girlfriend
and I&#146;m mad at Tom for trying to force me 
into being something
other than what I am.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You 
mean you're not his girlfriend?&quot; Daria 
asked
plainly.</P>

<P>&quot;Damn right I'm...ah hell, that came out 
wrong didn't
it?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I believe your Freudian slip is 
showing.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh sure, laugh it up. So I misspoke, 
doesn't change the
fact that he can't expect me to stop being me, 
even if that might
inconvenience him.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;While I 
hate to break up this rant I'm not sure if that's
what Tom 
wants.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;How do you know that? Did he tell you 
that?&quot; Jane
groused.</P>

<P>Daria sighed, &quot;Why did you two 
start going out?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Uh, because, I don't 
know.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Could it be in part because you were a 
free-spirited
artist type?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I guess so,&quot; Jane 
said in a mollified voice.</P>

<P>&quot;And isn't it true that 
you've blown off things the two
of you have planned because of 
so-called, art emergencies?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Damnit Daria, you 
don't have to draw me a diagram!&quot;
Jane 
snapped.</P>

<P>&quot;Sorry, but subtlety wasn't 
working.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;When did you try to be 
subtle?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Never, it's not really my strong 
suit.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane chuckled, &quot;Ok, you're right I was an 
ass. But Tom
had no right to...do something, help me out 
here.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Take his problems with you to 
me?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, there we go. That bastard, who does he 
think he
is?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Though it's not like you didn't talk 
to Trent about it
while you were on the road with 
him.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;We did no such...yeah, you're right. How'd 
you know?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Lucky guess, plus I know you have to 
keep talking in
order to keep Trent awake.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane 
chuckled, &quot;It figures, you do spend enough time staring
at 
Trent.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I can hang up this phone very easily 
Jane,&quot; Daria
warned.</P>

<P>&quot;So you can give me grief 
about Tom, but I can't tease
you with Trent, and I do mean tease with 
every connotation of
the word, that's fair.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Who 
said life was fair?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Not me, that's for 
sure.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Good, the sooner you accept that the sooner 
you can begin
plotting your revenge on the 
world.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Way ahead of you there chica. My hit list 
gets updated
daily.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Suppose we should be worried 
about wiretaps?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Nah. Give em something to sweat 
over.&quot; The two fell
silent, enjoying their momentary burst of 
levity.</P>

<P>&quot;So what are you going to do about Tom?&quot; 
Daria asked,
turning serious again.</P>

<P>&quot;What about him? 
We'll talk tomorrow I expect and if we
can talk things out, good. If 
not, then we won't.&quot; Jane replied
in a matter of fact 
fashion.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh,&quot; was Daria's only 
reply.</P>

<P>&quot;Why do you ask? Have designs on my 
boyfriend?&quot; Jane
asked mockingly.</P>

<P>&quot;Of course not, 
I'm passionately in love with Trent but
I'm afraid to act on those 
emotions, remember.&quot; Daria said
recited, as if by 
rote.</P>

<P>Jane smirked, &quot;You said it, not me, and don't 
think I
won't bring it up at some later date.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;In 
that case, just for the record, and any recording
devices, I, Daria 
Morgendorffer, do not have any 'designs' on
Jane Lane's boyfriend, 
her brother, or Jane Lane herself, for
good 
measure.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I'm crushed, you don't want to get in my 
pants?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Not even if you're not in them Jane, sorry 
to disappoint.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I'll have to find someway to carry 
on, I suppose.&quot;
Jane sighed dramatically.</P>

<P>&quot;I'm 
hanging up now before this conversation gets 
any
stranger.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Bye Daria.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Bye 
Jane, talk to you tomorrow,&quot; The line went dead
and Jane hung up 
the phone.</P>

<P>Dave handed Quinn a stack of paper, &quot;There 
you go, one
paper on the fashions of the Renaissance Italy and what 
it meant.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn gingerly took the paper, &quot;Will it 
get me an A?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave shrugged, &quot;It's the best we 
could do short of getting
a time machine and having a most excellent 
adventure through time.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That's not exactly 
encouraging,&quot; Quinn said, frowning.</P>

<P>Dave laughed, 
&quot;Don't worry, like you said, it's juat DeMartino.&quot;
They 
walked to the door, &quot;Huh, it's gotten pretty dark out,
want a 
ride home?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn nodded, &quot;That would be 
great.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Come on, the garage is this way.&quot; 
Dave led Quinn
back through the house until they entered the Wylie's 
spacious
garage.</P>

<P>&quot;Wow, you have a lot of cars,&quot; 
Quinn said, staring
at the collection. Dave shifted nervously on his 
feet.</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, Dad's a bit of a collector.&quot; He 
appraised
a key rack then selected a key ring, &quot;Let's take the 
Z-3.&quot;
He pushed a button on an intercom, &quot;Hey Dad, I'm 
taking the
Bondmobile to drive Quinn home.&quot; He turned to Quinn 
and smiled,
&quot;Come on, it's a warm night, we can drive with the 
top down.&quot;
He opened the door of the Beemer for 
Quinn.</P>

<P>&quot;Ok, but don't go too fast, I don't want to get 
wind hair.&quot;
Quinn said as she slid into the seat and buckled the 
seat belt.</P>

<P>Dave got into the car and pushed the button for 
the garage
door. He looked over at Quinn and smiled mischievously. 
&quot;Fast
is such a relative term.&quot; Dave started the car and 
raced
the engine.</P>

<P>Quinn looked at Dave, worried. &quot;Dave, 
what are you...Eeeeee!&quot;
Quinn shrieked as Dave gunned the 
accelerator and the car shot
out of the garage and down the 
drive.</P>

<P>&quot;What's the fun of a fast car if you don't put it 
through
its paces?&quot; Dave asked over the growl of the engine. 
Quinn
didn't bother replying.</P>

<P>Daria was lying on her bed 
reading a book when she heard a
car come screeching to a halt outside 
the house. &quot;Dad's already
home, I wonder who this is?&quot; 
Daria went downstairs to investigate.
She looked out the bay window 
and saw Quinn getting out of an
expensive convertible driven by Dave 
Wylie.</P>

<P>&quot;Uh Dave, thanks a lot for writing my paper and 
all.&quot;
Quinn said.</P>

<P>&quot;Hey now, don't sell yourself 
short, you put in a lot
of work on that paper 
too.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But you did all the typing and stuff,&quot; 
Quinn protested.</P>

<P>&quot;I just typed what you said. The 
important part, the ideas,
were all your doing,&quot; Dave said 
nonchalantly.</P>

<P>&quot;You're just trying to make me feel like I 
had a part
in it,&quot; Quinn said, blushing faintly.</P>

<P>Dave 
shook his head, &quot;No I'm not, it's your paper, 
enjoy
it.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;If you say so...still I wouldn't have 
done this if it
wasn't for you...&quot; She paused, reached over and 
kissed Dave
on the cheek, &quot;Thanks again Dave.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave 
was a little taken aback by Quinn's actions, &quot;Err,
well, you're 
welcome.&quot; He replied, flustered. &quot;See you
tomorrow 
Quinn,&quot; He stammeredas his face started to turn
beet 
red.</P>

<P>Quinn smiled, pleased that she had burst Dave's bubble 
of self-assuredness.
&quot;Yeah, see you tomorrow.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave 
floundered with the clutch for a moment before getting
the 
convertible in gear and driving off. Quinn walked into the
house 
where Daria met her.</P>

<P>Daria was leaning casually against the 
entry into the dining
room when Quinn walked through the door. 
&quot;So, you actually
got Dave to write that paper for you. I'm 
curious, what's his
price?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Dave helped me with my 
paper just because he's a nice
guy,&quot; Quinn 
sniffed.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh come on, you can tell me Quinn, what did 
you pay him
to write it?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Really Daria, are you so 
cynical that you can't accept
that some people might actually act out 
of charity and not for
money?&quot; Quinn said dramatically, 
&quot;And besides, Dave
didn't 'write my paper.' I came up with the 
ideas; he just did
the typing. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to 
call Stacy.&quot;
Quinn defiantly strode past her sister and up to 
her bedroom.</P>

<P>Daria watched Quinn go then shook her head in 
disbelief, &quot;I
don't know what they put in the water over at 
Dave's house, but
it's good. Quinn's having delusions of academic 
grandeur, although
she does live in her own little world most of the 
time anyway.&quot;
Daria looked around and noticed she was by 
herself, &quot;And
I guess I've been drinking the same stuff since 
I'm talking to
myself.&quot; Daria shrugged, walked back up to her 
room, and
went back to her reading. &quot;This has been one weird 
day.&quot;
She thought.</P>

<P>Tom leaned against his dad's car and 
stared out at the night
sky. He hadn't felt like going home, so he 
drove to an out of
the way place he liked to go from time to time. He 
took a pull
from the battle of water he was holding. His first 
impulse after
leaving Jane's had been to get drunk, but that would've 
cause
more problems then it was worth.</P>

<P>&quot;Besides,&quot; 
he thought, &quot;getting drunk over a
girl is so trite. I'm better 
off with the water.&quot; Tom sighed
again as his thoughts turned 
back to his central dilemma, Jane.
&quot;What the hell am I going to 
do?&quot; He asked himself,
&quot;Do I even want to try and fix 
things with Jane?&quot; He
started at the bottle. &quot;Oh to hell 
with it.&quot; He finished
off the bottle and drove home. He parked 
the car in the garage
and crept into the house. His mother had let 
him use his father's
car on the condition that he go straight to 
Jane's house and back,
trips through Lawndale were not part of that 
agreement. He was
pretty sure that his mother had a committee meeting 
of some sort
and his father was definitely away on a business trip, 
but it
never hurt to be careful.</P>

<P>No parents accosted him as 
he made his way into his room. He
had just flopped onto his bed when 
the door to his room opened
and he heard his sister say, &quot;Well, 
well, look who's finally
showed up, what happened to 'I'm just going 
to Jane's.' anyway?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;How do you know I wasn't just 
there?&quot;</P>

<P>Elsie shrugged, &quot;I don't, but then again 
neither do Mom
and Dad, especially Dad since you were driving his 
car.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Elsie...&quot; Tom said in a threatening 
voice. &quot;I'm
in no mood to play games with you right now so just 
go away.&quot;</P>

<P>Elsie stood her ground, &quot;Hey no way, I 
caught you big
brother, you know the rules pay 
up.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Elsie!&quot; Tom shouted. &quot;Get 
out!&quot;</P>

<P>The expression on Elsie's face quickly shifted 
from triumphant
to concerned, &quot;Hey Tom, what's 
wrong?&quot;</P>

<P>Tom shrugged, &quot;I think Jane and I are going 
to break up,
if we haven't already.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Whoa,&quot; 
Elsie said as she sat down next to Tom, 
&quot;What
happened?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, she went off somewhere 
with her brother this afternoon,
even though the two of us had 
already agreed to hang out this
afternoon.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Tom, 
the two of you do that everyday, BFD.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, but 
it's more than that.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Ok, what's the reason this 
time?&quot; Elsie asked, exasperated.</P>

<P>&quot;This time? What's 
that supposed to mean?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Just what it sounds like. 
Every time you go out with
someone it's the same story. You meet the 
person, go out with
her, mostly to tweak Mom and Dad. Then after a 
while you get bored
so you concoct some BS excuse to break up and 
then repeat the
process.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh wait, I think I see 
where this is going. Let me guess
I've got a fear of commitment, 
right? Tom said sarcastically.</P>

<P>Elsie looked at Tom 
disdainfully, &quot;No, sheesh Tom, you
watch too many movies. I mean 
you go out with a girl until you
get bored. Then you're too afraid to 
just break up, so you latch
onto some BS little irritant as your big 
reason.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Admit it Elsie, you were going to say 
fear of commitment.&quot;</P>

<P>Elsie shoved her brother playfully, 
&quot;I was not, asshole.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Tut, tut, language 
sis.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, yeah. Now, what's this underlying 
reason for breaking
up with Jane?&quot;</P>

<P>Tom sighed, 
&quot;This is going to sound stupid, but because
I think Jane cares 
more about her 'art' than she does for me.&quot;</P>

<P>Elsie 
pondered this for a moment, &quot;You're right that does
sound pretty 
stupid.&quot; She paused, &quot;And pretty 
reasonable
too.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oooo, a paradox, care to 
explain.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, on the one hand it's pretty dumb 
of you to think
that Jane would stop being Jane just because it 
inconveniences
you, but on the other hand, if Jane really does care 
about you
then she'll find more time to fit you into her schedule, as 
it
were.&quot;</P>

<P>Tom nodded, &quot;Yep, that pretty much sums 
it up.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hey Tom, I've got a question for 
you.&quot; Elsie asked
Tom suddenly.</P>

<P>&quot;Sure, what is 
it?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Do you and Jane still have fun 
together?&quot;</P>

<P>Tom shrugged, &quot;Sure, 
why?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And seriously, have you ever thought that 
Jane is the
great love of you life?&quot;</P>

<P>Tom thought for a 
moment, &quot;Well...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's ok to say 
no.&quot;</P>

<P>Tom continued to think then slowly shook his head, 
&quot;No,
I suppose not. Guess there's not much point to the two of 
us going
out anymore huh?&quot;</P>

<P>Elsie swatted Tom on the arm, 
&quot;You idiot, You missed my
point. You have fun when you're with 
Jane so why change things?
It's not a crime to date someone you 
aren't madly in love with,
and you should know 
that.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, ok sure.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Then why 
are you two breaking up? If she's not some big
love for you why do 
you have to be her primary passion? Keep going
out as long as the two 
of you are still enjoying each other's
company. When that stops being 
the case then breakup. Right now
you're just being 
silly.&quot;</P>

<P>Tom laughed, &quot;Since when did my little 
sister become such
a guru on the affairs of the 
heart?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Since my big brother started whining to me 
about how
much his girlfriends suck. It's pretty much been all on the 
job
experience since then.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, that would make 
you an expert wouldn't it?&quot;
He laughed again, &quot;Ok, thanks 
Elsie, I'll think about what
you had to say. And who knows, I'll see 
what Jane has to say and
go from there.&quot;</P>

<P>Elsie stood up, 
&quot;Sounds good to me. Goodnight Tom.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Night 
Elsie, see you tomorrow.&quot;</P>

<P>The next day Dave ran into 
Daria during lunch.</P>

<P>&quot;Hey sorry about that Daria,&quot; 
Dave said, offering
a hand to help her up. &quot;Wasn't looking where 
I was going
I guess. You know, lost in a remembered groove or 
something.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria rubbed her now sore rear, &quot;Uh, 
yeah sure. Why do
I feel like I was just an unwilling participant in 
some grand
cosmic joke?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave shrugged, &quot;I got no 
dukes about that.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You've 'got no dukes?' What the 
hell is that?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I'mexperimenting with new slang, it 
sucked?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Big time.&quot;</P>

<P>Damn, there goes 
my big catch phrase,&quot; Dave said, shrugging.</P>

<P>&quot;Dave, 
the day you start making sense to me I'm getting
my head 
examined.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave laughed, &quot;Hey, like I said, I'm 
sorry. Look, let
me buy you lunch, or 
something.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Forget it, apology accepted, I don't 
want to have you
add a school lunch to your already heavy 
conscience.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh come on, you don't think having a 
father worth several
billion on paper doesn't have its 
advantages.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You've got some sort of special chef 
or something?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No, nothing quite that dramatic I'm 
afraid,&quot; Dave
said chuckling.</P>

<P>&quot;Then what is this 
big advantage when it comes to school
lunch?&quot;</P>

<P>Dave 
paused for a moment, &quot;Damn, I forgot...&quot; Daria
sighed and 
turned away. &quot;No wait, I remember now, unlimited
munchies from 
the snack bar.&quot; He took out his wallet.</P>

<P>&quot;Ok, now 
you've got yourself a deal.&quot;</P>

<P>Soon Daria and Dave were 
sitting at a table with a large pile
of snack food between 
them.</P>

<P>&quot;You know this is bad for us,&quot; Daria 
said.</P>

<P>&quot;Consider the 
alternative.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;True.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Where's 
Jane?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Working on a project for art.&quot; Daria 
munched on
her Snickers bar for a moment, &quot;So...did Quinn really 
do
any work on that paper?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That's an impertinent 
question.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Let's just say it would be a first if 
she did.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave shrugged, &quot;Well, it's true. 
Everything I wrote down
she thought 
up...mostly.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;How's that?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;She 
came up with the underlying truth of the paper. I
just prettied up 
the words, tweaked the grammar, stuff like 
that.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh really.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, hey, 
your sister is more than capable if you pick
the right 
topic.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What did you charge for your 
assistance.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Man, you're nosy.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria 
shrugged, &quot;I'm just curious. I suggested that Quinn
ask you for 
help mostly because I figured she wouldn't, or you
would say no. I 
never thought that the two of you would actually
work together. So, 
what did you pay her?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You're just like your 
sister, did you know that? Neither
one of you believe in the concepts 
of charity and altruism.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I believe in those 
things...at least when they work to
my benefit.&quot;</P>

<P>Dave 
sighed, &quot;Yeah, whatever. But to answer your question,
Quinn 
didn't pay me anything, I was just being a nice 
guy.&quot;</P>

<P>While Daria was forming her reply the Fashion Club 
walked past.</P>

<P>&quot;Gee Quinn, that certainly was a large 
paper you turned
in today.&quot; Sandi said with as much disdain as 
she could manage.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh that,&quot; Quinn said 
dismissively. &quot;I just
had Dave Wylie write it for 
me.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh really, and what did you agree to do in 
return? I
hope you didn't agree to go out on a date with him. There's 
no
situation dire enough to require going out with a geek, even if
he 
is rich.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn laughed nervously, &quot;Oh no, nothing 
like that. He
just seemed to want me to hang around while he wrote 
it. You know
geeks, they'll do whatever someone as cute as me wants 
them to.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Quinn, that was like, so smart of you. I 
know I'd never
think of something that clever. I'd just try to write 
the paper
myself and fail miserably.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That's so 
nice of you to say Stacy,&quot; Quinn 
replied
happily.</P>

<P>&quot;So what you're saying Quinn is that 
you're like the cutest
girl in school because you got some geek to 
write your paper for
you?&quot; Sandi sniffed.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh no 
Sandi, what I meant was...&quot; The rest of conversation
faded as 
the quartet walked away.</P>

<P>&quot;As you were saying?&quot; 
Daria asked.</P>

<P>Dave looked at the soda can halfway raised to his mouth. He
set it down and started at a spot on the table for a mom 
ent. An
expression of anger, and betrayal, flashed across his face, 
but
when he looked up his face had settled back into a neutral 
expression.
&quot;Well what can I say, Quinn obviously sees things in 
a different
light.&quot; He shrugged and stood up. &quot;Enjoy the 
candy Daria.&quot;
He sauntered off.</P>

<P>Daria stared at her 
candy bar, then set it on the table. &quot;Damn,
I lost my 
appetite.&quot; She stood up to leave, then hurriedly
put the 
remaining junk food in her backpack. &quot;It is Dad's
night to cook 
after all,&quot; She reasoned to herself.</P>

<P>Later that day, 
after school, Jane was pacing in her living
room. She knew what, or 
more appropriately who, was coming and
she didn't quite know how she 
was going to deal with that. Sure
enough, it wasn't long before she 
heard a knock upon the door.</P>

<P>&quot;Here we go,&quot; Jane 
said to herself. &quot;Come on
in Tom.&quot;</P>

<P>The door opened 
and Tom's head appeared, &quot;Hey Jane, how'd
you know it was 
me?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I told Daria to steer clear this afternoon 
and Trent's
off with the band, it was a pretty safe 
guess.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Uh yeah, I suppose so...can I come 
in?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What? Oh, sure, sure, I won't bite your head 
off.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well that's a relief,&quot; Tom said as he 
shut the door
behind him. They stood, facing each other for several 
long moments.</P>

<P>&quot;So, what brings you here Master 
Thomas?&quot; Jane finally
asked.</P>

<P>&quot;I wanted to talk to 
you about last night.&quot; Tom said
simply.</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, last 
night,&quot; Jane replied hesitantly.</P>

<P>&quot;Look Jane, I 
understand you're some big artistic spirit
and I don't want you to 
stop being that just on my behalf. But
I also do reserve the right to 
feel a little put out when I think
you're putting the art ahead of 
me.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Are you really that serious about us 
Tom?&quot; He did
not reply, &quot;I thought 
so.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;We have fun together, right?&quot; Tom 
asked.</P>

<P>&quot;What? Sure we have 
fun.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That's all I really want, someone fun to 
hang out with.
All that other stuff...&quot; he shrugged, 
&quot;That's just normal
human jealousy type stuff. I'm sorry I was a 
tool yesterday. I'll
try to do better in the 
future.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;So you don't want to break up with 
me?&quot;</P>

<P>Tom shook his head, 
&quot;Nah.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well then, I, uh, well I'm sorry I was 
an ass yesterday
as well. And in the future I'll try to be a little 
better at giving
you a heads up when the old muse comes a 
calling.&quot; They hugged,
then kissed. After a short time Tom began 
to pull away.</P>

<P>&quot;Where are you going? We've got make-up 
making out to
do.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, well, I er, I've got this 
paper due tomorrow and
I haven't really gotten started on it. Can we 
raincheck on the
make up? Say 
tomorrow?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh...yeah, sure, that's for the best 
anyway cause I've
got this...thing I have to finish. Really 
important, that thing.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Right, see you tomorrow 
then?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, sure, tomorrow,&quot; Jane watched as 
Tom walked
to his dad's car. She closed the door and went upstairs 
before
he drove off. She stood in front of her easel and sighed, 
then
started painting.</P>

<P>Tom looked on as Jane shut the door 
behind her. He sighed,
got in his father's car and drove 
home.</P>

<P>&quot;So are you two back to normal?&quot; Daria asked 
when
Jane called later that evening.</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, I 
guess,&quot; Jane said, sighing.</P>

<P>&quot;Well that sounds like 
a ringing endorsement,&quot; Daria
replied.</P>

<P>&quot;It's not 
like we're going to break up or something, and
I think we reached an 
understanding on the whole art issue, it's
just...&quot; Jane trailed 
off.</P>

<P>&quot;Just what?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Forget it, you 
don't want to hear me talk about this.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Jane, 
you're my friend, of course I do.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Ok then, Tom 
and I are great, wonderful, never been better.
Now I'll see you 
tomorrow at school ok?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Wouldn't miss it...well 
I'll be there at least.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Later 
Daria.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Bye Jane.&quot; The two friends hung up. 
Daria sat back
in the couch and tried to reflect on the past two 
days. &quot;I
wonder if this is how the people in soap operas 
feel?&quot; She
pondered.</P>

<P>Just then her mother came walking 
through the living room,
talking on her cell phone. &quot;Yes Eric, I 
quite agree, that
offer is ridiculously too low,&quot; she noticed 
Daria sitting
on the couch. &quot;Oh, there you are Daria, come on, 
dinner's
ready. No Eric, I wasn't talking to you, I was speaking with 
my
daughter, no the other one...yes that one.&quot; A sour 
expression
crossed Helen's face. &quot;Now Eric, I have to go, family 
dinner
you know...&quot; A pause, &quot;Oh really, you went there 
to
eat...Mmmhmmm, I'll call you back as soon as I'm finished 
here.
Right, bye Eric.&quot; She turned off the phone and walked 
into
the kitchen, Daria followed. &quot;Jake, what are we having 
for
dinner sweetie?&quot;</P>

<P>Jake looked up from the stockpot he 
was stirring. &quot;My
world famous Whatchagot Stew! Here, have a 
taste.&quot; He offered
a spoonful to Helen, who dutifully took a 
sip.</P>

<P>Her reaction was immediate, &quot;Gah! It burns!&quot; 
In her
haste to get a drink Helen lost her grip on her cell phone, 
which
gracefully spun in the air and landed in the stewpot with a 
soft
plop. The phone sputtered and sparked before sinking to the 
bottom
of the pot. The family watched in silent 
disbelief.</P>

<P>&quot;I'll, err, go order a pizza,&quot; Jane said 
meekly and
slunk off.</P>

<P>&quot;Dammit!&quot; Helen bellowed and 
stormed out of the kitchen.</P>

<P>Daria just leaned back against 
the counter and smirked, &quot;It's
good to know that no matter how 
strange life gets I can always
count on my home life to provide 
amusement.&quot;</P>

<P>The End.</P>

<P>Busted Stuff (Lyrics from 
7.3.2000 Three Rivers show, since
this is an unreleased song they are 
subject to change)</P>

<P>Not enough<BR>
Never too much<BR>
Woman 
look just like love<BR>
A rolling stone<BR>
Gathers no moss<BR>
But 
leave a trail of busted stuff<BR>
I know she's gonna leave my broken 
heart behind her<BR>
I take what she's given up<BR>
I know she's 
gonna leave my broken heart behind<BR>
I take what she's given 
up<BR>
Sweet sugar lips<BR>
Pushed from the hips<BR>
You know you 
look just like love<BR>
Without a care<BR>
She floats above<BR>
She 
got me down here looking up<BR>
I know she's gonna leave my broken 
heart behind her<BR>
I take what she's given up<BR>
I know she's 
gonna leave my broken heart behind<BR>
She the one, she the one, she 
the one for me<BR>
When she moves<BR>
She moves so cool<BR>
She got 
me feeling just like a fool<BR>
But inside<BR>
Is where the devil 
hides<BR>
The woman look just like love<BR>
I know she's gonna leave 
my broken heart behind her<BR>
I take what she's given up<BR>
I know 
she's gonna leave my broken heart behind her<BR>
I take what she's 
given up<BR>
I know she's gonna leave my broken heart behind 
her<BR>
She the one, she the one, she the one for me<BR>
I know she's 
gonna leave my broken heart behind<BR>
You're the one, you're the 
one, you're the one for me <I>(repeated)</I><BR>

<P>Author's 
Notes:</P>

<P>Source Info: There, finally it's done. This story has 
had one
of the most torturous developments of anything I've written. 
I
came up with the idea at some point in time shortly after July
5th, 
2000, which was the first time I'd heard the song Busted
Stuff. I was 
struck by the lyric about a trail of busted stuff.
I thought it'd 
make for a great running theme in a story, Now
obviously I came up 
with this plot before the end of Season 4
so the plot was a little 
different. The main difference was that
Tom, Jane, and Daria were 
going to go buy Tom a new clunker at
Happy Herb's. However Season 
Four ended, the movie was shown,
and I still hadn't started Busted 
Stuff. I felt moved by the events
that closed the season out so I 
changed some things around and
settled on the plot line as it 
occurred in the story. That's the
main story behind &quot;Busted 
Stuff.&quot; It's the shorted thing
I've written so far in the Daria 
genre, but each story is as long
as it needs to be. I also feel that 
this is the most episodic
of my works, as well as a touch 
experimental. I played around
with perspective a little and I hope 
the cuts are too jarring.</P>

<P>Dave and Quinn's Excellent 
Adventure: I know what you're saying,
&quot;But Sam, we know Quinn's 
got a brain, besides, didn't we
see this in IIFY?&quot; My only 
answer is, yes on both counts.
However, this is one element of Busted 
Stuff I settled on long
before I even heard of IIFY. I took pains to 
not work too far
outside the pre-IIFY Quinn's parameters and I hope 
that shows.
I chose history for the class because that was my major 
in college,
and the paper topic because I'd just finished reading a 
book on
the subject, &quot;Worldly Goods&quot; by Lisa Jardine. By 
the
way, free No-Prize to the person who spots the pop culture 
reference
that permeates the entire storyline.</P>

<P>Truckin': Doug 
Boade is my own little homage to a real person,
Doug &quot;Taper 
God&quot; Oade. Doug Oade runs Oade Brothers
Hi-Fi and has provided 
many wonderful tools for tapers, including
the Oade cable, quite 
possibly one of the most indispensable accessories
for any taper who 
owns a Sony DAT deck. He also runs a messageboard
on his website that 
is a terrific resource for anyone interested
in taping.</P>

<P>The 
End My Friend: Yeah, that concluding scene doesn't quite
fit with 
what came before it, but it was part of my initial plotting
and I 
wanted to include it, if for no other reason that to show
something 
else &quot;busting.&quot; Plus, I know that if you drop
a cell phone 
in stew the results won't be as impressive; chalk
it up to dramatic 
license.</P>

<P>What's Next?: This is my last story set in Season 4, 
all two
of them. The rest are going to be set in Season 5 and 
beyond,
though not necessarily tracking exactly with the events that 
will
come in that season. I've still got a whole bunch of things 
in
development. Probably the next thing I'll have done is 
either
Chalkdust Torture, Prince Caspian, The Song that Jane Likes, 
or
what I've tentatively titled, The Stone, though who knows 
what
exactly will fall out when I next get out my pen, but if I 
had
to make a bet I'd say expect Chalkdust Torture to be my 
next.</P>

<P>Well, that's all for Busted Stuff. I hope everyone 
enjoys it.
I'm happy with the piece and I had fun writing it, and 
that's
what's important in the long run, I guess.</P>
