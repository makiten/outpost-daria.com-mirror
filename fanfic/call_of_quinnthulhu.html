<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>CALL OF QUINNTHULHU </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"In deathless
sleep, the Old Ones dream and lie in wait for the time when they shall rise
again, for when the stars come right, they shall awaken from their aeon-old
slumber. Then shall they return to hold dominion over our world once more,
bringing woe and destruction onto mankind." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>--<b>Nox Arcana</b>, <i>Necronomicon</i>
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>1. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Just relax,
Quinn," said Dr. Shar, "you won't feel a thing." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Shouldn't I like
be sudafed or something?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Of course not.
This is a very delicate procedure, and won't hurt a bit." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"OW!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Oh, sorry.
Hmmm.... you seem to have worms." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Sandi suddenly appeared
above Quinn, looking down. "You have worms? That is, <span class=GramE>like,</span>
so gross." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"But... no one is
suppose to know! I mean, <span class=GramE>no I don't have worms</span>!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Sandi glared down at
her. "How could you lie to me, your best friend, and President of
Lawndale's Fashion Club?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I don't have
worms!" She gasped as Dr. Shar's gloved hand pulled out several writhing
worms from an incision in her abdomen. "Those aren't mine! Those aren't
mine!" She quickly closed a hospital gown over the incision, holding it
shut. "Those aren't mine!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Gross,
Quinn!" shouted a shocked Sandi. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then Quinn saw an old,
scraggly hippie friend of her mom's, dressed in a creepy black trench coat. At
least he HAD been a friend until he tried to kill her, shortly before they
moved to Lawndale. He looked at her, his eyes wild and disgusted as the day he
tried to kill her, and pulled out the shotgun he had used then. "I've got
to go!" she shouted. She got herself up and took off running as Sandi and
Dr. Shar looked at her in fear and disgust. <i>Not again! Not again!</i> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She ran through the
hospital, the same one she had spent so much time at in Highland, trying to
keep the incision closed, but felt a few worms falling out from time to time
anyway. She ran, hoping to stay ahead of the armed maniac. She stopped at a
crossroad of open doctors' offices, trying to decide which way to run. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then she noticed that
every single person was reading <i>Val</i> magazine. On the cover was a picture
of her. <span class=GramE>With her deformities.</span> She saw the caption <i>Teen
Mutant Exposed! A dark look into the secret life of Quinn Morgendorffer, sister
to the Anti-Teen</i>. "No," she said. She shook her head as she
noticed many were casting surreptitious glances, whispering among <span
class=GramE>themselves</span>. "No." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"There you are<span
class=GramE>,</span> you freak!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn took off blindly,
without bothering to look at the man trying to kill her. She looked desperately
for some escape, but she saw no exits. She was in an abyss of never-ending
hallways with an armed maniac after her. He'd tried to kill her before and had
almost succeeded. She'd only survived because she had surprised him. He wouldn't
let her do that again. <i>Aren't there any police or something!?</i> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She stopped by a fire
alarm and pulled the lever. The lights all went red, a siren blared, and
emergency water sprinklers went off making her gown wet and the worms in her
belly writhe excitedly, trying to get out. She took off running again as she
saw the shadow of her pursuer at the end of the hall. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She opened an emergency
stairway to see stairs going both up and down, barely visible in the dim red
light. <i>Up or down?</i> <span class=GramE>she</span> thought. She decided
down was easier and rapidly descended the stairs, worms still falling from her.
Only a couple of stories down and she heard the door she'd entered burst open
and she knew the guy was still chasing her, tracking her by the worms that fell
out of her. She began leaping down the stairs, but his footsteps got louder and
louder, rapidly gaining. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then the stairwell ended
by a door with a pulsing dim red light. She struggled with the door, and just
as she was about to scream in frustration, it opened into a dark basement. Even
though it was dark, Quinn could see perfectly well. She shut the door and ran
to the other side, past several containers. The smell of earth and water
excited her somehow, but she kept running until she came to a cavern with a
pool in it. She heard the door burst open behind her and she waded in, finally
swimming underwater. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn waited,
underwater, breathing easily, staring up unblinking. A flashlight beam
eventually lightened the dirty brown water covered with algae. It would likely
hide her from him, though he might still shoot into the water. He was obsessed
enough to do it, too. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then the beam of the
flashlight, which Quinn now saw was attached to the shotgun, aimed down into
the water. He moved it around slowly. After awhile, the shotgun was no longer
pointed at her at all, but further out. And Quinn struck. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Bursting out of the pool
of water with shocking speed, <span class=GramE>She</span> knocked his arm
aside before he got off more than one shot. It went wide. Several worms, now
gigantic tentacles, shot out of <span class=GramE>Her</span> incision, wrapping
around the human that dared to treat Her as prey. He would've screamed his
terror and despair, but <span class=GramE>Her</span> tentacles were wrapped as
tightly around his throat as they were his arms and legs. She felt great
pleasure in the squeezing that was crushing the life out of him. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn suddenly realized
she was awake in her bed, covered in sweat, making a haunting, inhuman noise in
her throat. She stopped her alien keening, and began gasping in sudden terror.
She looked down in her dark room and confirmed what she already knew: her
deformities were back. She could see everything as if bathed in a bright light.
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She had a prehensile
tail growing out of the base of her spine that was nearly 3' long. There was a
row of "feelers" that looked like fine hairs about an inch long that
grew along her spine from her skull on down to the tip of her tail. They were
able to pick up the <span class=GramE>most minute</span> details for her:
electrical currents, scents, air motion. They felt rubbery, not hair-like, to
her hand. Her toes and fingers had grown by at least two inches and her
formerly well-manicured nails were sharpened bone. Each foot had an extra big
toe and each hand had an extra thumb. She felt the bony ridges around her knees
and elbows, and a thickness through her entire body. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Her canines were longer
now, too, visible even when she kept her mouth shut, and her tongue had grown
in several inches and could pick up impressions from the air. Her ears had
elongated into pointed ridges and she heard footsteps coming to her room. Her
nose, turned up and sunken into her face, could smell that it was her mom. Her
eyes could barely make out her mom's outline through the doorway, and when her
door opened she could clearly see her mother's heat pattern, along with a slight
electric glow that only certain instruments could pick up, and another glow
that no human instrument had yet been able to detect. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Helen turned the light
on and gasped as she saw Quinn breathing hard in bed, in her full change.
Quinn's eyes remained opened, yet she couldn't see them, for her third eyelids
were back, opaque and impenetrable, though she knew Quinn could see through
them more clearly than any human. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Oh, Quinn,"
said Helen, tears about to fall. "Not again."<o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody1><span style='font-size:10.5pt;
font-family:Verdana;letter-spacing:0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody1><span style='font-size:10.5pt;
font-family:Verdana;letter-spacing:0pt'>2. </span></span><span
style='font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Verdana'><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>That morning, Quinn was
almost back to normal. <span class=GramE>The key word being "almost."</span>
It took several minutes to hours, but she was able to "pull" the
mutations "in" so that they weren't visible, though it was tiring to
do so. The pills prescribed by Dr. Malak in Highland helped. But she still had
stubs where her new thumbs and big toes had been, about 2" of a tail, and
her pupils were shaped like hourglasses in the light. When dilated in dim
light, they looked like diamonds. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She ate some fried eggs
listlessly at the breakfast table, her mom talking to Eric on the phone. She
glanced at Daria who was already dressed for school. Her brow furrowed and then
she shuddered as she saw Quinn's third eyelids blink over her eyes momentarily.
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I'm sorry,
Quinn," said Daria, looking away. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Like you were the
one to put uranium in the water," said Quinn with quiet bitterness.
"At least all that happened to you was some health and eye problems, and
maybe a hyperbrain. Me, I'm a FREAK!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria shook her head.
"I thought... I thought you were cured." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"All the pills do
is slow my metabolism down and help me keep control. It doesn't fix my
DNA." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Your body is
building up a tolerance?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I guess." She
shook her head. "You know, I thought I could finally be NORMAL. Pretend
all that mess with the uranium and stuff didn't happen. Now it looks like Sandi
and the whole <span class=GramE>school are</span> going to know." Her
voice lowered. "I just hope this doesn't make the news, and that Mom's
psycho friend doesn't find out." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria gulped. He had
attacked her, too. When she opened the door for him, back in Highland, she had
seen something was very wrong. She tried shutting the door, but he was faster
and stronger. She tried to run but he had knocked her down, slapping her
glasses off. On the floor, unable to see clearly, she'd heard him muttering
incoherently, about trying to see if the "abomination" was inside
her, and that "it" had to die. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>And then Quinn and Helen
had walked in, returning from the hospital where Quinn was finally getting some
hopeful treatments, and he attacked Quinn, screaming. He had his hands locked
around Quinn's throat, choking the life out of her, chanting for her to die,
when her mom knocked him out with a skillet to the back of his head. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He was tested for drugs
and only trace amounts of pot were found. He was committed for observation and
a battery of tests were run on him. Helen knew schizophrenia was common in his
family. Then he had somehow managed to walk out dressed as a janitor and gotten
away before the alarm sounded. The Morgendorffers were frightened, especially
with all the phone calls that ended with a click, but after 3 months it was
decided he was probably with some cult in Mexico again. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>And then Quinn, the new
medicines working so well that she radiated joy, walked (something that had taken
her years to learn to do in a way that didn't disturb others watching her) into
the kitchen and the window was shot out. Amazingly, Quinn had fallen to the
floor just before the maniac had fired. Ducking low she ran back out as Mom's
psycho friend fired again. He'd hurt himself as he knocked the glass out of the
window and crawled through it, but he kept on coming. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn did what she
always did when she wanted to escape attention: she ran to the bathroom.
Unfortunately, this didn't seem to stop him. He wasn't insane enough to waste
ammo, and he picked the ridiculously easy bathroom lock while she cried for
help through a window that was too small to crawl through. She felt the change
come back over her slowly. But as the door open, Quinn ran at it, and pushed
his gun away as it went off again. He tried to push her off and kicked at her,
but she didn't relent. She even clawed his face with sharpened nails enough to
leave permanent scars. One eye of his was soon useless from the blood running
into it. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then he managed to pull
the shotgun from her grasp and jump back. Then he shot her and Quinn screamed
as she felt penetration in her abs. She turned to run and another blast took
her in the back, knocking her down. Then he jumped on her prone form and put the
shotgun to the back of her head. But her tail, now fully extended, instantly
wrapped around his wrist and yanked hard. The next shot went low into a nearby
wall instead. Then to his shock, Quinn turned, her spine as supple as a cat's,
and rammed a hardened, jagged elbow into his throat before taking his shotgun
from him and throwing it. Just as the shotgun left her hands, <span
class=GramE>his own</span> grabbed her wrists. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He learned then that
Quinn was double jointed and easily twisted out of his grasp while her tail
grabbed his shirt and yanked him backward. Quinn bit his neck then and he
screamed. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>And then Quinn heard
someone running in and knew it was her mom. She quickly took her fangs out of
his mangled, bleeding neck. He allowed himself to be tossed off her by her tail.
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>That time he was
incarcerated for attempted murder. Thanks to Helen's connections, she was able
to get him sent to prison much faster than would normally happen. He ranted
that Quinn was an abomination that had to be destroyed and was now kept on heavy
medication, barely able to do more than drool, let alone appeal. This suited
Helen just fine. Helen knew he was still locked away, but Quinn didn't want to
hear about her old life and Helen didn't tell her anything except that he would
never bother her again. She prayed it was true. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Dr. Malak, of the
Hoffman Institute, who'd contracted an office in Highland to work with Quinn
and also waived all medical fees, oversaw the medical treatments and therapy
Quinn undertook, starting from shortly after she had been born. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He was very excited,
even more than he was over the genetic samples which intrigued him beyond
mania, by how she recovered from the shotgun blasts. For Quinn, already his
life's work, showed true regeneration from the shotgun blasts. Not only did the
wounds close themselves much the way a skinned knee would do, but even the
telltale signs that she had been shot vanished. What was interesting was that
the last traces of her wounding vanished on the same day in which any and all
genetic samples taken from her became worthless: </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The day of the new moon:
New Moon Phenomenon, or NMP. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Even Dr. Malak was
spooked by that. For not only would the samples become normal human and useless
for his more experimental tests, but even the KNOWLEDGE would be vanished. All
recorded data shifted with it. The memory of his studies grew vague, dreamlike,
and even he couldn't recall what happened. He called in friends with better
memories, and they were just as affected. But they all refused to believe that
the New Moon had anything to do with it. That wasn't the realm of science. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Science be damned, this
was magic. Dr. Malak told no one this, but he was convinced he was tapping into
something that could potentially revolutionize humanity, opening the pathway to
cures to nearly every disease. Possibly, he hoped, even leading to a
singularity which would change humanity, just as writing and oral tradition had
once revolutionized mankind. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>There had been news
reports of uranium contamination in Highland by a government reactor, but the
story had been suppressed. It was almost impossible to find now, except in one
of the earliest issues of Project Censored. The reactor and other government
agencies spent so much money stonewalling that Helen wondered if the taxpayers would've
forked over less just to pay out-of-court settlements. <span class=GramE>While
several had been damaged, only Quinn had been turned into.... well, a freak of
nature.</span> "The contamination" (the facility was never named) was
officially blamed for Quinn's deformities. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Dr. Malak himself, who'd
studied many of the others exposed to the mutagens, including Daria
Morgendorffer, didn't believe the uranium was the reason. But he couldn't say
what was. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Still, the plant had
been quietly shut down, and the Hoffman Institute was footing the bill for all
expenses, even paying out $1,000 a month just for the rights to conduct free
medical tests and therapy for Quinn. Helen wasn't entirely satisfied, but she
knew this was probably better than she had any right to hope for. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The reason that the
Hoffman Institute indulged Dr. Malak's obsession with the Morgendorffer subject
is that her DNA did not have just two molecules joined by hydrogen bonds
composed of 23 chromosomes each like most people, but had another genome of
unknown origin. Labeled TPA for Teroic Pseudonucleic Acid, it gave her another
23 chromosomes never seen or reproduced elsewhere. These were the chromosomes
that somehow didn't survive NMP if separated from Quinn's body. No, they didn't
survive REALITY itself. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>And when Quinn hit
puberty and her pituitary became dominant, she somehow gained a limited ability
to manipulate her physical state, sometimes to the point of suppressing her TPA
blueprints until she could pass for human. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Experiments in between
moons, while closely and constantly observing her, showed that mandrake root
was able to increase her control and even suppress what most others who studied
Quinn dismissed as "junk DNA." The few who heard the Hoffman
Institute's term "TPA" often acted with anger, contempt, and perhaps
anxiety. It seemed most of those few to closely examine Quinn found her genetic
structure so abnormal, and the NMP to be so spooky, that most scientists wanted
to pretend that Quinn didn't even exist. But they'd never admit they were scared.
They just pretended any data gathered were a mildly interesting anomaly and
learned to tune her existence out entirely. Scientists are rarely scientific. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Luckily for them, the
Hoffman Institute seemed willing to not share its own studies with the rest of
the scientific community. At least not until it could be commercially
exploited. The drug they developed also seemed to decrease Quinn's mutations
and even allowed her to slowly adapt her body into a more normal form, as if
she had never been born with the TPA. Continual usage locked her in her form
and Quinn knew a miracle as amazing as someone paralyzed from the waist down
suddenly able to walk, determined to run. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Too bad that they
couldn't figure out WHY it worked, but all the data collected kept getting
corrupted in the NMP. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>But after the attack on
their home, and the interest of reporters who were curious about the event,
Helen sold the home and moved. While Helen regularly emailed Dr. Malak to
apprise him of Quinn's continued progress, and to thank him for turning her
into a normal teenager (though an exasperating one), she didn't bring her in
for exams anymore, except once a year. He quietly managed to get the drugs to
her and Quinn took them. None of them said why, it was just done in silence. Quinn,
long tormented as a freak in Highland, was only too happy to move where she
could start anew. She seemed so happy out here, but now.... </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"You staying home
today?" asked Daria </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Duh," said
Quinn, giving Daria a dirty look. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria sighed. "You
know, I had almost completely forgotten about... that." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn's lips trembled.
"Yeah, me too." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Quinn," said
Helen off the phone, "Dr. Malak is driving out here. He says he should be
here around lunchtime. You'll stay here until then, and I'll stay home with
you. Okay, sweetie?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Okay," said a
dispirited Quinn. "Do you mind if I go to my room now?" When Helen
nodded, she got up and went upstairs. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>In her room she sat at
her computer. <i>Maybe I'll have to interact with everyone on-line</i>, she
thought morosely, <i>just so people don't see what a freak I am.</i> She
wondered why this had happened. It had been so long and everything went so
well. Remembering the NMP, she called up a site that told what phase the moon
was in. She was not surprised to find it was New Moon. She wondered, <i>But why
THIS New Moon?</i> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Blinking, she thought of
astrology. She didn't know enough, most of what she picked up being <i>Val</i>
and <i>Waif</i> offering clothes and makeup to go with your sign. But since
astrology involved the heavens, and the moon was a part of it, maybe the stars
were, too. She wondered why Dr. Malak had never thought of that before. <span
class=GramE>Or if he had and just never told her.</span> She'd have to ask. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She googled up some
astrological sites and found some gave free information. But they only gave a
little and then you had to pay for them to tell you more about how to achieve
romantic and/or financial success. And the free stuff probably included free
spyware, too. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>But she came across one
site, The Astral <span class=GramE>Church, that</span> claimed to give free,
lengthy, accurate readings. Unlike the others, it wasn't obsessed with money
and love, but rather with "biorhythms." Interested, she began filling
out the information on her birth. She had to get the photo album that had a
copy of her birth certificate to find all the information it wanted. She was
uncomfortable answering some of the questions, but she didn't see how it could
hurt anything. <i>Probably just market research</i>, she told herself as she
finally hit SEND. It promised to send her a complete report later. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Feeling tired all of a
sudden, she went to lie down until Dr. Malak showed up. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Meanwhile, hundreds of
miles away in New Mexico, the program run by the Astral Church did what it was
supposed to do. Taking the information, it judged that this information was
important enough to forward to its creators. A few minutes later, a man in
military garb blinked at the email he got from their Astral Church program.
Clicking, he read the results. He swallowed. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then he began a search
for all information about a Quinn Morgendorffer, who was a likely Tainted. It
was believed several Tainted had likely escaped their scrutiny at birth due to
problems with funding, technology, and general incompetence and reflexive
denial when the subjects appeared. After an entire freak show was found to be
among the Tainted, it was taken for granted that several more existed out
there, both alone and in groups. They had been showing up since that mistake in
1947. Using Nazi scientists gathered from Operation Paperclip, American
scientists succeeded at a top-secret project at which the Nazis had previously
failed. <span class=GramE>Which turned out to be most unfortunate.</span> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Over the next few hours,
despite some calls and some cutting-edge programs available to them, he didn't
find as much as he would've liked on her. But he found enough. More so, he
found that the Hoffman Institute had their own files, but he couldn't tell what
they were. That meant most of their data was on another computer separated from
the net. And despite their pretending to be a flaky new age outfit that did
weird seminars, it was known by those in the know that they were a business and
think tank that hired the best and brightest--and most unusual--scientists with
open minds in hopes of exploiting the next cutting edge revolutions in science
in about every field. And they felt Quinn Morgendorffer was pay dirt, and may
have been foolishly hiding her from government scrutiny. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>A little over an hour
later, he gathered all his notes and printouts and went to report the Astral
Church program had located another one. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>By lunch, Blue Section
sent out operatives to Lawndale and to the Hoffman Institute. He didn't know
what they found, but before he went to have his supper, he saw a dossier of the
Morgendorffer girl with CANCEL stamped on it. That meant Red Section would
likely hit Lawndale in the next few hours with some cover story about a
chemical spill that would then have to be suppressed in the media. That's what
happened the last 2 times the Astral Church program had found a Tainted, it was
confirmed by Blue Section, and Red Section was sent in. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>And when he showed up
tomorrow morning, Quinn Morgendorffer would be on the dissection tables in the
labs of Green Section a few floors down from him, and her entire family
disappeared, and likely dead. Green Section would have little less than a month
to find what they needed before her corpse dissolved into neurotoxic sludge
(which he heard often smelled like cherries). </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Trembling, he put the
unpleasantness out of his mind so it wouldn't mess with his digestion. There
was nothing to be done for it. Whenever he asked himself, <i>How can we do
these things<span class=GramE>?<span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></span></i>
he always answered himself back with, <i>How can we NOT do them?</i> It was
regrettable, but it was in the interest of all humanity that this dirty work be
done.<o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p>

<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Between Quinn's eyes, a

mind. With it, <span class=GramE>She</span> could "see" what was
meant. The Light <span class=GramE>She</span> had seen around people and places
that no human instrument had ever recorded was...Essence. Essence made up the
Reality around Her human form. It protected the New Gods, the spirits of Form,
from the Elder Gods, the Chaos <span class=GramE>Before</span> Form. Form was a

the other worlds mentioned. Venus was the most beautiful blue and green world

world was one of endless caverns that <span class=GramE>was</span> naturally

<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn nodded, feeling both

kind of 'flow' that can be measured by the stars. As far as I know, this 'Flow'
may actually CAUSE the movement of the stars, as our cosmos just flows with
it." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"You mean
essence?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Excuse me?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"The light I can
always see that no instrument could record. I think it's the light that makes
up people and places. It's hard to say. All life forms have it. All rocks have
it, but it's different. There's an overall light that is radiated by an entire
environment, by a pack, by a culture. Cities have them, and I can tell a lot
about a place by how the light looks. I can tell if there's been violence in a
home recently, if it's been burglarized, or if someone has been violent or been
a victim of it recently. All through that light they give off." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"And you think this
is, um, 'essence'?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I don't know. I'm
asking you." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Dr. Malak stared for a
minute, lost in thought. Then he cleared his throat nervously, and said,
"Quinn, I'd like to run something past you. I'm not saying it's true, it's
just a thought. It's not even to be seen as probable. Just a random
thought." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Okay," said
Quinn. By Dr. Malak's light, he really was nervous and hesitant. But if he
continued, he was going to be honest, though he was also unsure of what he was
talking about. "Please, go on." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Have you heard of
the Chupacabras down in Mexico?" When Quinn blinked, unsure, he added,
"The goatsucker." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn nodded her head.
"You think it's made up of the same genes as I have?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Maybe," he
said, "if it's real. It may even be completely made up of TPA. Thing is,
there have been things killing animals for a long time. Something is always
blamed, based on society's explanation of such things. In America, it's even
thought UFO's are going around doing it. But there's always something doing it,
and the truth is, we don't know what. The favored animals by far seem to be
horses, sheep, and cattle. These are the animals most often given in sacrifice
to the gods." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Ewww!"
shouted Quinn. "I thought only, like, devil worshippers did that or
something." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"This is about all
religions. And a director at a zoo in Mexico City has made a public comment
that the attacks on animals there by what was believed to be the Chupacabras
were done as if by a single instrument. It appeared the animals had been
sacrificed as per instructions of an old rite described in a Biblical text
called Leviticus." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn shuddered.
"That disturbs me, and I'm not sure why." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"In all these
cases, the entity in question seemed attracted to the blood, and all would've
been recognized by our distant ancestors. It's possible that these things, even
what we call UFOs today, were the old gods and spirits that still required the
blood to feed. Since they weren't being fed anymore, these spirits or gods or
daimons.... well, they took to just taking it where they could. They often gathered
at certain sites which would be visited by disaster. I don't know if they cause
these disasters, or if they're just drawn to them. They seem to exist outside
of time, at least as we understand it." Dr. Malak looked embarrassed to be
talking about this, but his light also revealed relief at finally being able to
discuss it with someone who might understand. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I thought those
were like demons or something." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"And vampires, and
grey aliens, and other things. Many are men in black. These days they can be
seen in black cars. Centuries ago, they were seen on black steeds. And there
are places on this world in which the <span class=GramE>boundary between the
worlds are</span> thin for some reason. Maybe wormholes or leylines or who
knows what. They were often haunted by a powerful spirit, often called a god.
The word 'panic' comes from the god <span class=GramE>Pan, that</span> is still
believed to chase people off a certain mountain in the Mediterranean. Though
many today believe it's the Devil." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Maybe it is."
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Maybe it is, and
maybe it's not. It seems that if these spirits get enough worshippers, then
they get more powerful. They make themselves out to be gods. And they are
traditionally very possessive of their worshippers. Even when they grudgingly
share, they demand their own due. Plenty of texts warn about gods that are
vampiric, that try to enslave humanity. Some modern persons, like astral
traveler James Monroe or even Aleister Crowley, have warned that all the gods
are liars and care nothing for humanity beyond what they can somehow harvest through
worship." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"You mean what I
call essence?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Probably. If
there's any truth to this at all." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"And they compete
for this essence, not liking to work together?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"They don't seem
to," replied Dr. Malak. "It seems belief and rites were important, and
many of these spirits found that the more people they could get to worship
them, the more powerful they became. And the more hostile they became to other
spirits." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Why would they
care about other spirits?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Well, it's
curious, with the Chupacabras. It started out as a little, local thing. But
when the killings got picked up on the news circuit, the Chupacabras spread to
everywhere people had heard about it, leaving dead animals in its wake." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"So the more
attention they get, the more they grow in power and scope?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Dr. Malak nodded.
"And there's a book by Charles Fort that says that there seems to be an
invisible power or principality or whatever that was trying to stop people from
talking about the strange things, or even knowing of them. It wasn't done to
protect us. It was so that it could keep exclusive exploitation rights to
us." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn shuddered as she
recalled her Dream. "Um, is there any way to fight back?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Cold iron seems to
help," said Dr. Malak. "It is often used as protection against all
kinds of evil spirits. What's interesting is a few people have said they
stopped their own abductions by UFOs by carrying <span class=GramE>it</span>."
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Why would metal
work against a non-physical being?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Dr. Malak smiled.
"That's what I asked, and I think I might've figured it out. It's what you
have to understand in order to understand my answer to your original
question." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Okay," said
Quinn. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Supposed
to be that iron was first discovered as having fallen out of the sky.</span></span></span><span
class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> It was more than one element,
having power over all others. Later, it was made into weapons and armor, often
using fire which was another important force, and so represented humanity's
mastery over the unknowable forces, darkness, and evil around them. In other
words, the metal is a SYMBOL of conquering the unknown, and so when wielded by
someone who truly believed in it, or even by those immersed in such a culture,
it had a real effect. That is, it's not the metal, it's the belief." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"It's the essence
that does it? The same essence that is hungered for by the gods?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I would think so.
What's odd is that phases of the moon, the stars, and the like also make a
difference, whether it's crafting a sword to overcome darkness or chanting a
spell. Even our major religions still use solar and lunar events in their
rituals." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"So it can use
natural essence along with the essence directed through ritual!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Magic." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Exploitation."
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Whatever,"
said Dr. Malak. "But think if humanity were to learn to harvest this<span
class=GramE>..essence</span>... for itself! We'd have free energy without
pollution, able to heal the sick and dying with a touch, possibly become a race
of immortals!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn blinked at that.
"You think I'm immortal, don't you?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Not exactly,"
said Dr. Malak. "But you did survive those two shotgun blasts. You're close.
I think you're somehow becoming aware of this energy, this <span class=GramE>essence,
that</span> is the power that is harvested by these other entities, for good
and bad. You are the next step in human evolution." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"And what if I'm
not?" asked Quinn. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Well I'm still not
sure what you are, but you are something beyond humanity's ability to yet
understand." He shook his head. "I wish I could get you interested in
science. I bet YOU wouldn't be cursed with New Moon Phenomenon like we
are!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Maybe," said
Quinn lightly. She wondered if there would be time. The Other Realm that just
communed with her didn't seem to think Earth had much time at all. It also
seemed that Quinn wasn't as much an evolved entity as a bioengineered weapon. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"But there's
something that's troubling me about all this," Dr. Malak replied.
"These entities that live off of what you call essence should be
suffering. So many people don't believe in the gods the way they used to. There
are more people, and plenty do follow odd rituals of appeasement and of seeking
favor. But still...." He pursed his lips. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"What?" asked <span
class=GramE>Quinn.</span> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"These entities are
quasi-real. They're paradoxical, both there and not-there. We can calculate
their speed OR their position, but not both. And now it's turning out our very
cosmos is becoming that way." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"You mean
tainted?" asked Quinn fearfully. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Tainted?" Dr.
Malak sounded surprised at the word. "No, I was wondering if there's a new
energy that's changing everything, material and physical, and you're one of the
first humans. <span class=GramE>Because subatomic particles are looking to be
exactly like these entities of essence..." <br>
<br>
"The creation of everything!"</span> Quinn couldn't help but
interrupt. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Um,
yes.</span></span></span><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:
0pt'> Yes, that would be your essence. But of course people assume that we're
just discovering this to be true. But I'm starting to think that it's JUST
BECOME TRUE, not that we're only now discovering it." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>There was silence before
Quinn asked, "Hey, what did you mean by 'one of the first'?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Dr. Malak swallowed.
"You're not the only one, Quinn." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"What!? How long
have you known of others!?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He shook his head.
"I came across a few others after you. Some of them disappear. I think
they go into hiding, but maybe some people hunt them down. I don't know. But
there's one more here in Lawndale. The Institute arranged for their family to
move here after we were able to help their son with the same medication that
we've used to help you. And strangely enough, HE had an episode last night,
too. I've already talked to his family, and they're willing to meet you. I
haven't told them who you are, respecting your privacy as I must respect
theirs, and of anyone else so affected with TPA." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Who is it?"
asked Helen, shocked. She had been sitting quietly in a corner, tuning most of
this conversation out as it didn't make sense. It reminded her too much of her
LSD trips in the past. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"You can meet them
at the clinic I have ready for the both of you. Or you can wait and come along
later yourselves, alone." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"We'll meet
them," said Helen. "Now who is it?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"The boy is just a
few months older than Quinn, but until the meds worked on him, he was
homeschooled by his very protective parents. His name is Ted
DeWitt-Clinton." Then he cleared his throat. "Now that I answered
your question, Quinn, what about mine?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Oh," she said
evasively, "it was just a weird dream I had." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Tell me about
it." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I'll tell you
later." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I'll hold you to
it," sighed Dr. Malak. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>They left 5 minutes
before the first operatives from Blue Section showed up at the Morgendorffer
residence.<o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p>

10.5pt;font-family:Verdana'><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Dr. Malak introduced
Grant and Ted to Helen and Quinn. Helen recognized Grant Clinton upon seeing
him. He and his wife had accosted her over Daria giving their son chewing gum,
among other things that she couldn't recall very well. Luckily, he didn't seem
to remember her. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Ok, if I can get
some blood samples...." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>While Dr. Malak took
samples, Grant asked Helen, "Um... we barely handled it well... how did
YOU handle it?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Helen blinked a moment.
"Honestly, I thought it was the uranium. Just Quinn got hit really strong.
I was amazed she remained alive at all." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Grant shook his head.
"We... had some weird experiences. We--that is, Leslie and I--met at a
commune run by a group calling themselves the Aquarians. It was... pretty weird
there. We were supposed to undo capitalism and war and things like that. Our
guide, Starcaster, could do some weird stuff. Maybe it's like the LSD warping
our memories, but it was like sorcery. And we had some bad trips, kept being in
a locked room that was almost completely black, while these aliens, supposedly
from the Pleiades, kept sticking us with things. Even doing... well, to avoid
graphic detail, messing with our genetic material." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Helen frowned and looked
down. "I had an experience like that, too. But I was told that it's a
common LSD trip. There was an experiment where people were hypnotized and asked
to describe being taken aboard a flying saucer. They often described what many
abductees did." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Maybe we're all
being abducted, and only a few ever find out." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Helen shuddered.
"The UFO abductee phenomenon has many parallels with those taken by
Satanists or even weirder things." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Maybe we're all
being abducted by something." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I don't think
so," said Helen testily. "It's just the paranoia of a bad trip."
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"You had a trip. So
did Leslie and I. Look at our children." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Only Quinn!" <i>I
hope</i>. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Others among the
Aquarians had children like Ted. Some gave their kids up for adoption. Others
killed them. Some parents were found killed, their kids missing, though nobody
suspects a toddler of having done it." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Helen looked at him
wide-eyed. "They're just children," she whispered harshly, "it's
not their fault!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"But why the tests?
And who's conducting them?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I'm sure that
there are no tests! It's a bad trip, that is all it is." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Some of these
abductees tested as pregnant and then the baby was just completely GONE in
later tests." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Miscarriages are
very common, I'm sure..." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"The tests showed
that they had never been pregnant in the first place. These are tests conducted
by the same doctors who confirmed pregnancy before." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Helen took a breath and
chose to drop the subject. Things were scary enough without pausing to consider
if she had touched something REAL in those paranoid moments... and been
violated by that nightmare in turn. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn and Ted seemed to
get along a lot better. Ted had allowed his entire range of mutations to stand
out. He looked a lot like Quinn, only he didn't have any feelers along his
spine, nor did he have a tail. He did have two <span class=GramE>antenna</span>
on his head that looked like a caricature of some Martian, and eyes that had
multiple facets to them. Quinn found it like looking into ridged lenses. He
also had fledgling wings, though they didn't look as if they could support his
weight in the air. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>When Quinn saw him, she
felt her own mutations come out, and she let them. For some reason, she wanted
him to see her. She thought his mutations looked wickedly cool on him, rather
than freakish, and she didn't want to appear boringly mundane next to him. She
also found him a lot more attractive than any of the boys she had dated before.
"So when did you start taking the pills?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Ted glanced at her. <span
class=GramE>"About a year ago.</span> Just before I came here to get away
from certain crackpots that thought I was evil incarnate." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Me, too," she
responded lightly. "Did the Institute help you?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Not until much
later." He shrugged. "My parents thought all that hippie stuff
dabbled in demonic forces or something and tried to keep me separate from that
and the world at large. They hoped this separation would help make me 'normal'
or something." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Um..." Quinn
wasn't sure how to ask this next question. "Have you had any weird...
dreams lately?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Ted looked at her more
intently now. "Yes," he said, after a pause. "Showing me images
even more intense than a Goya painting...." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Goya painting,
what's that?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"He painted scenes
of blood and destruction." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Oh, yeah,"
said Quinn softly. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"They said there
was another here. I admit<span class=GramE>,</span> I'm surprised it's you. I
was thinking it would be like Andrea." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Do you wish it
was?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Huh? Oh, I'm just
amazed that there are others. I guess that means the others in our dreams are
real, too." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn frowned, suddenly
afraid. "Yes, I guess it does." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"And they're coming
here." He spoke even more softly, adding, "I don't think they'll like
our families." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn looked over at
Helen and Grant, who apparently had just stopped speaking to each other. She
looked back to Ted and shook her head slightly in agreement. "Not sure
what to do about that, either." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Maybe we should
find out what they want before they meet our families." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"What's that?"
asked Dr. Malak, back. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"We're just
wondering what you'll find is all," said Ted. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Dr. Malak frowned, but
didn't press the issue. Then his cell phone rang. "Excuse me," he
said, going out the door. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Now where did he
go?" asked Helen, "this is too important to be working with other
jobs!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Grant shook his head.
Frankly, he didn't trust the Institute, though he was grateful for what help
they had provided so far. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Did your parents
have a hard time with you?" asked Ted softly to Quinn. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Yeah," said
Quinn. To Helen and Grant, they both seemed to be whispering nonsense
syllables, but they heard each other clearly. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"There were others
like us, abused. I guess they'd appreciate what's coming. What about you?"
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn looked at him.
"I don't know. You?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I don't know,
either. I feel like I'm trapped between two worlds, and I don't know which one
is mine. Maybe neither one is." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Yeah," agreed
Quinn. <span class=GramE>"Did you see the other worlds, the ones in our
solar system?" <br>
<br>
"Yes.</span> What does it mean?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I don't
know," said Quinn, "but I don't like that they'd all be destroyed,
sparing none." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Have you pulled
anything out of your dream yet?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"What?" asked
Quinn a little more sharply in surprise, "No! Have you?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Ted nodded once, but
didn't say anything, before being interrupted by his dad. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"What are you two
talking about?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Just about what
it's like to be a freak," replied Ted, a little sullenly. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The door came open, Dr.
Malak came back in, and Ted and Quinn both frowned. His light was discordant.
"What's wrong?" they both asked at the same time. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Nothing," he
said, and they both knew he was lying. "Um, Mrs. Morgendorffer, have you
contacted anyone else about Quinn's special needs?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Helen shook her head,
her eyes asking why he was asking. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Seems
some people with a lot of clout are asking my boss questions about your
daughter."</span></span></span><span class=postbody1><span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Grant's voice rose,
sounding a little angry. "Will they be able to find out about Ted?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Dr. Malak considered for
a moment. "My records are encrypted, including with my own special
shorthand. They can be broken, but it will take some time. If these people are
allowed access to all my work, and it sounded as though they will be, then they'll
likely know about him in the next few hours. Assuming they start immediately at
decryption using a human, since I don't think any computer has the ability to
decipher my shorthand." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Grant hissed.
"Thank you, Mrs. Morgendorffer!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I haven't talked to
anyone!" said Helen. "Have you, Quinn?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn shook her head.
"No, I've been hiding!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I don't get
it," said Dr. Malak darkly. "But Mr. Nakami has found these people
most disturbing. He told me to expect company soon." He looked at all of
them. "Do we proceed with the tests, or not?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Grant and Helen looked
to each other and then Helen looked back, "Proceed." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Wait," said
Grant. He made a call to Leslie, and then he said, "I'm sorry, Ted is
going to have to come with me now." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"No, Dad, I want to
know what's going on. We need to know this." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Your mother
doesn't like it. She doesn't want you involved in this." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I already am
involved." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"We're going home. <span
class=GramE>Now."</span> Against Ted's continued protestations, the father
and son left Dr. Malak with Helen and Quinn. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Helen then made some
calls from her cell phone to Jake and a few others, in the case any violations
of their civil rights should occur. Meanwhile, Quinn was taken for some x-rays.
She closed her normal eyelids against the harsh light of the X-ray machine at
work. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then Quinn felt
SOMETHING. She wasn't sure what, but she knew it was important. "Can we
take a break?" she asked. "I feel... like we should take a
break." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Dr. Malak blinked.
"Okay, if that's what you want. Would you like a soda?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Yes, please,"
replied Quinn. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Helen and Quinn were out
in the hallway of the rented medical office building while Dr. Malak went to
get a soda for her. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"What's going on,
Quinn? You know something, don't you?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Before Quinn could
reply, they both heard a crash. It sounded as if Dr. Malak fell onto something
heavy without crying out. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn and Helen barely
had time to process this when three men, all dressed in black and wearing
shades, came around the corner, marching side by side. Quinn saw that unlike
everyone else, none of these men displayed any light of Essence. She felt an
instinctual terror and knew she had to run. "Mom," she said weakly,
before Helen fell unconscious. All three men reached into a side pocket and
pulled what looked to be flashlights out. Quinn's terror overcame her then and
she ran, faster than she believed possible. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>It was much like her
nightmare in the hospital, only she found a stairwell very <span class=GramE>quickly,</span>
and there was only one way to go: up. She couldn't get to the door outside
unless she ran past them. She ran up the three stories and burst out the door
just as she heard them enter the stairwell. On the sunny roof, she felt
trapped. Her mutations were exposed for <span class=GramE>all the</span> world
to see, and she didn't even see a fire escape. Deep inside herself, she felt <span
class=GramE>Them</span> approaching and knew she had to escape. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Remembering how she had
pulled her mutations in, she tried something else: To grow wings similar to
what Ted had on his back, only bigger. To her surprise, she felt her back give
way, and as much as she hated doing it, she took her shirt off to accommodate
the wings. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Just as she heard the
doorknob turn, she leaped off the building, and released a high-pitched keening
as she fell, and then a keen of elation as she began gliding. She nearly bumped
into four shocked people that looked to be technicians of some kind but managed
to get enough elevation to go over their ducking heads. She felt her tail slap
the glasses off of one of the men who looked to still be in college. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Out of the way,
geek!" she shouted as she glided several more meters and landed by an
alley. She took off into the alley, calling her wings back in so she could put
her shirt on at least. She thought that those men she'd nearly crashed into
were the only ones to get a good close-up look at her topless and she wanted to
keep it that way. She hoped they would think she was like Mothman from that
horror movie based on a true story or something and not recognize her as Vice
President of the Fashion Club. Maybe she was pursued by monsters of some kind,
maybe she was a monster herself, and maybe she'd just flown with her own wings
for the first time in her life, but part of her still cared about such things. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She didn't see the
emotionless faces of the lightless three men staring down from the rooftop at
her sudden departure. Nor did she know that the men on the ground who had
ducked out from under her were from Blue Section and she didn't see them get
back up and run into the clinic. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Inside, they found only
an unconscious Helen Morgendorffer and Dr. Malak. They had not seen the three
men in black that had pursued Quinn, they did not find anyone else in the
building, and they didn't know what had happened to Dr. Malak and Helen
Morgendoffer. One called in a request for more support, and to report that
Quinn Morgendoffer was confirmed as Tainted.<o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody1><span style='font-size:10.5pt;
font-family:Verdana;letter-spacing:0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody1><span style='font-size:10.5pt;
font-family:Verdana;letter-spacing:0pt'>5. </span></span><span
style='font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Verdana'><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Red Section was strictly
black ops. Almost no one even admitted to their existence, even at their base.
To do so was to invite their attention. Plenty of Red Section had been recruited
from crime families and from the more ruthless agents of various governments.
One such unit was led by a man in the field simply known as "The
Captain." He didn't even know who his admin was, he was simply called Sir.
He was sometimes referred to as "the old <span class=GramE>man,"</span>
or even "big daddy," but never to his face. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>This was to be The
Captain's first time to lead a mission to extract a Tainted. His predecessor
had been killed in the last operation, along with nearly half his men. He and
the others used to replace the fallen were experienced warriors, agents, and
campaigners, but they had been assured they had never gone up against one of
the Tainted. He was being given one final briefing by Sir before he caught his
jet. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Sir was indeed an old
man, but one still possessed of vigor and grim purpose. This was a man who
would order mass murder and not think twice about it. The Captain both
respected and feared that, not being so different himself. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Sir stared at him a full
minute, searching for any weakness or uncertainty. Neither could be tolerated
for the mission to come. Not if their team was to succeed. Not if their team
was even expected to survive. Finally, he nodded and said, "Captain, it's
about time you were told what's really going on." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The Captain remained
alert, saying nothing. Sir approved of this and continued. "After the
defeat of Nazi Germany, we found that some of their scientists were working
with a cult known as the Thule Society that was using astrology and occultism
mixed with fringe science to dominate the masses. Part of the reason for the
death camps, in fact, was to raise energy for this, and other occult
projects." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The Captain blinked at
this, but continued to stand alert, saying nothing. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"They didn't
succeed, and we got many of them via Operation Paperclip. But we succeeded
where they failed. You see, we incorporated accurate occult rituals, while the
Nazis altered theirs to match a favored mythos featuring underground realms and
Aryan supermen." He took a breath and finally added, "Feel free to
ask questions. You need to understand what you're up against and why this war
against the Tainted is so important." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The Captain swallowed,
not ready to ask questions yet. But he knew to ask nothing would be to appear
to have a slow mind, and he'd rather retain Sir's confidence. "What did
you do with your success then, <span class=GramE>Sir.</span>" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Sir leaned back, and it
was apparent he was reaching back to days he hadn't thought about in detail for
quite awhile. "We first attempted to use it to allow for the peaceful
passage of the National Security Act of 1947, which abolished the Constitution
and birthed the American Empire. We were so successful that in addition to the
passage of the bill, the small-town conservatives ceased to be isolationists
and hungered for global adventure on a scale that made Mr. Roosevelt's liberals
spin. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Not
only that, but through our occult focus, the Pentagon, we became the world's
policeman, and hardly anyone would even dare question its actions or judgments
without being denounced as a traitor.</span></span></span><span
class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> By 1960, anyone who tried to
restore power to the Congress was vilified, not by liberals but by
conservatives. About that time we had American troops all over the world with
no real resistance to speak of. Project PsyOp was a stunning success beyond our
wildest hopes and aspirations." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The Captain blinked. He
knew this was something big, but he had no idea of the scope of it. "When
did something go wrong?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Sir smiled grimly.
"The very first time we used it, in July, 1947. I suppose you heard of the
UFO nonsense in Roswell, New Mexico? Well it wasn't a flying saucer from
another world. It was... for want of a better phrase...pure information
downloaded from another dimension. Don't ask me what I <span class=GramE>mean,</span>
all I can say is that it spoke to us in our dreams. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"With it we were
able to make the devices once used by Green Section before they were destroyed
or sealed off. But we had to use only the <span class=GramE>most fit</span> and
stable, for it was... again, for want of a better word, Negative Psychic
Energy. It seemed to draw forth the life force of anything around it and then
corrupt it, creating a canker for want of a better word. Back then, in the late
40s, someone dubbed this other reality as Alien-X, as it's alien to our senses,
understanding, and completely unknowable to us. Worse, once the Taint is strong
enough in an area, we can't undo it." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"But you had to
have someone use it." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Sir nodded, and frowned.
"Our psi-pilots, which shaped the dreams of the masses, developed the
ability to communicate with each other in dreams, too. They were just as
affected as the physical universe. Something they didn't tell us right away.
Not until they suggested we begin Operation Nephilium." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Operation
Nephilium?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"The DNA was broken
down and rebuilt, much like the physical universe seemed to be. And then where
the psi-pilots worked, there was an increasing... canker. Reality shifted, and
it seemed to feed off of interaction with people. We eventually had to seal it
off to keep it from growing anymore. But as it warped reality, it warped the
genetic structure of humanity, which allowed for some unusual mental and
physical attributes that were deemed worth exploiting in the event of
war." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Supersoldiers?"
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Sir nodded. "We
weren't sure about it, but then it came to light that the Russians and Chinese
were engaged <span class=GramE>in a similar projects</span>, and we had orders
from on high to move ahead ourselves. But we noticed some things over the
decades that weren't comforting. Sometimes, one of the Tainted, in any country,
would find <span class=GramE>themselves</span> in disfavor, and the other
Tainted helped them in the other countries. Then we noticed that plenty of
Tainted were showing up where none were supposed to." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I'm sorry, I'm not
following you." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"People not part of
Project Nephilium were giving birth to Tainted. Our own supersoldiers struggled
to hide them and then to have them accepted. But by then there were too many
reports of abductions and genetic experiments by unknown entities going on from
confused civilians. Many said it was aliens, other said it was fairies or
monsters or something else. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Thing is, no one
knew WHAT it was, it's just their mind would make a desperate attempt to fit
the unknowable into a frame of reference that worked for them. In the United
States, these tended to be little grey aliens. <span class=GramE>Sometimes even
blond men.</span> But whatever country, these abductions took place in what
paranormalists call 'window areas,' and could be predicted astrologically. What
really complicated matters is that not everyone who had this experience had
really been affected by it. The Canker or Taint had to be powerful enough, or
it was just a nightmare with no physical effects. Even so, we believe such
quasi-abductions served as reconnaissance." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Quasi-abductions?
Sir, I don't..." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"In dreams! The
Taint allows them to operate in a quasi-real world! And just as we were using
Project PsyOp to manipulate the dreams of the masses, Alien-X was also using
the very same technology we had to conduct its own campaigns! Even worse, those
BORN Tainted, like this Quinn Morgendoffer you're going to extract, go through
at least two puberties. By now, Quinn has likely entered her 2nd Change, and
she will possess abilities like you have never encountered before. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Then we found that
the more successful abductions coincided with time our own Nephilium soldiers
were off base. We surmise they somehow helped the Alien-X entities through,
into our reality, to <span class=GramE>Taint</span> humans outside our Project
and our control." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The Captain was stunned.
"Why?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"No one knew. But
it became increasingly clear that the Tainted felt no loyalty to the human
race. They saw themselves as superior. And maybe they are. To put it bluntly,
they saw taking orders from a mere human about the way we'd see taking orders
from a spider monkey. And then we realized that the information download wasn't
a gift, but a virus, a Trojan horse to allow <span class=GramE>themselves</span>
into this reality. By creating these supersoldiers, who had no real concept of
national identity or patriotism to country, we were stocking an army that saw
us ALL as the enemy. In a word, we were helping them prepare for an invasion
from Alien-X." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The Captain blinked at
this, feeling his stomach twist. "What about Russia and China?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"It was the Ruskies
that first realized that. They tried to destroy their own supersoldiers, but
the others knew and rebelled, mostly escaping into the Siberian wilderness.
More than a few humans were killed in the exodus, particularly in Novosibirsk
where the supersoldiers were being kept. And then the <span class=GramE>Chinese,</span>
and our own, versions began helping them. We eventually moved to wipe them out,
too. Between 1984-1991, we conducted a massive campaign to wipe out every
member of Operation Nephilium, and the Russians and Chinese helped with the
understanding that these soldiers were members of an army intent on invading
Earth from...elsewhere." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"We didn't get all
of them, did we?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"No. Plenty remain
uncounted for, though they are given a 90% likelihood of being dead. Then there
were those born Tainted that we had nothing to do with. In '93, we had to
actually call in tanks because a cult was purposefully breeding them and
creating a small army of the bastards. We managed to wipe them out, or we think
we did. In '96 we found two survivors of Operation Nephilium that we thought
dead as members of a freak show consisting of over a score of members. All <span
class=GramE>Tainted</span>, created without our knowledge of their existence.
And they were spreading the Taint wherever they went." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"God." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"This Quinn
Morgendorffer is another one that escaped scrutiny. The plant that was dumping
uranium in the water spent so much time trying to dodge blame and
responsibility, that all reports of mutations were lost to us thanks to the
paper shredders. But one of those mutations wasn't a uranium-one, but a
Tainted: Quinn Morgendoffer. The bastards at the Hoffman Institute have been
studying her for years. They've had the same problems we've had, but they've
actually managed to make a medication that can suppress the Taint. At least
until they enter their second puberty. They've also injected the Taint into
various animals, studying them." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I assume you've
had them destroyed. <span class=GramE>The animals."</span> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Sir frowned. <span
class=GramE>"Not exactly.</span> The animals have been taken for study.
The head honchos at the Institute are under close watch now, and they know it.
Since they've had some success where we've failed, we're hoping that debriefing
them and studying their findings will help us find the way to undo the Taint
and close all portals between our world and Alien-X. You see, once the Taint
affects Reality, we're not sure how to destroy it. The best we can do in most
cases is buy up the land and seal it off." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Sir," asked
The Captain, "what IS known about the<span class=GramE>..</span> <span
class=GramE>entities</span>... of Alien-X?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"We're not sure
WHAT these denizens from Alien-X are. They tend to break down sanity, inspire
schizophrenia, and ultimately break down reality. They are... like alien gods
of some kind." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"You mean like in
those Lovecraft stories?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Sir shocked The Captain
by nodding. "Many knew about it and wrote about it in code. Lovecraft went
too far and mentioned the Necronomicon by name. That's why he died so suddenly
when he was only 47, but that's another matter. His literary executor, August
Derleth, was persuaded to insert a note in every edition claiming that the
Necronomicon doesn't exist. We've had tremendous success in trivializing it
further ourselves." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Including in using
Project PsyOp." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Sir made an unpleasant
face. "We were doing the dirty bastard's work for them! Just as we were
manipulating the masses, they were manipulating us!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The Captain then asked,
"How is the war effort going now?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Sir surprised him with,
"Unknown. You see, the Tainted are out there, growing and <span
class=GramE>Tainting</span> areas, preparing for nothing less than invasion by
entities that care nothing for human notions of countries or patriotism. It is
likely to be a war of eradication against all of us. But only if we're
lucky." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The Captain had heard
enough. <span class=GramE>More than enough.</span> <span class=GramE>Time to
get to the important part.</span> "How do we kill them?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Their
vulnerabilities, especially after they've entered the Second Change, are few.
Fire works, which is why all your men will have plenty of incendiary grenades
and access to flamethrowers. The bullets used are all forged with fire from
cold iron. Nothing else seems to work. But even then, it takes a lot to kill
them. They tend to regenerate extraordinarily fast, and they often grow extra
vital organs that replace damaged ones." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Any other
options?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"If all else fails,
should Red Section report failure to extract, then we'll trigger a nuclear
explosion." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Do you think
they'd report failure knowing that?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"They don't know
that's what will happen. They think that we'll be sending in
reinforcements." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Oh." He
swallowed, as he'd be real close to Ground Zero. "That's a lot of tax
payers that will get killed, too." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"There's a lot more
to replace them," he said. "What, you think scared people will stop
paying taxes? If anything, they'll pay more once we tell them it was a
terrorist attack. <span class=GramE>Understand,</span> that even without Operation
PsyOp being active, people are pretty stupid. <span class=GramE>And entirely
expendable.</span> Any important people will have already been taken from the
area. Read up on your Machiavelli, if you have doubts about what I say." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The Captain nodded his
head slowly, making a mental note to get out if the operation went south.
"That sounds like a plan. Not a nice one, but as you say, this is
war." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"And war is
hell." Then Sir frowned and looked distinctly uncomfortable. "One
more thing." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Yes?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"We have, at times,
run into... these things... <span class=GramE>that appear</span> to be Men in
Black. But they're not human. They don't seem to care about us, or even those
of us that impersonate them, in the slightest. They seem to be as dedicated to
wiping out the Tainted as we are. If they feel it serves to help them in their
mission, they will kill our people, too. We have no idea who they are, who they
work for, or why they do what they do. But in this case, the enemy of my enemy
is NOT my friend. Should anyone encounter them, they are to be left strictly
alone, if possible, but attacked with extreme prejudice should they attempt to
steal away the Tainted from you." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Why not let them
do the kill for us?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Because when they
kill, the body turns to neurotoxic sludge immediately, which makes it useless
for our studies. These MIBs don't like us studying them, either. We've had
operatives and scientists.... meet unpleasant ends or vanish altogether, and at
least some did so at the hands of these MIBs." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Can they be
killed?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"About the same way
as the others." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He shook his head.
"We may be at war now, but if I may ask, why did this nightmare get
started in the first place?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"We were at war
with the Communists." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Not really." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Close
enough." He shrugged. "Who would pay our salaries if we didn't have
some emergency to fight?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"So we just
generate more emergencies to justify our existence?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"As much as I'd
like to discuss philosophy with you, there's Tainted to be extracted so that we
can find the key to close the cankers to Alien-X." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Yes, Sir, my men
are on it." He left <span class=GramE>thinking,</span> <i>I wonder who the
greater threat to humanity is: Alien-X, or you?</i> As an experienced field
commander, he hid his last, treasonous thought well. Besides, he knew he was
disturbed and just looking for someone's butt to kick. <span class=GramE>Someone
that wasn't an alien monster from beyond.</span> <i>Just focus on the war. And
don't be scared. My predecessor was killed because he panicked, but I won't do
the same. Just how bad can one little girl be?<o:p></o:p></i></span></span></span></p>

<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn went home. She had
a bad feeling about doing that, but she didn't know where else to go. She got
plenty of guarded stares, but few people came close, and those that did, walked
by quickly with their face averted. A police cruiser passed her once, seemed to
slow slightly, and kept going. <i>At least they don't think I'm a high school
student</i>, she thought wryly. She figured they didn't know WHAT she was, and
they were happier not knowing. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She walked casually
enough, as she always did, but her mutations hung out for all to see. As a
disguise, she clipped her hair up and put it under a cap and wore shades. She
wore cargo pants under Daria's Mark Twain nightshirt. The only visible clothes
that were hers were her shoes. This made her hurry as she knew her fellow
Fashion Club members would recognize them. They looked at everything guys did,
plus shoes. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>When she got to her
house, she saw that it had been broken into. There was nothing visible to the
naked eye, but the telltale signs of discordant lights that didn't belong were
there to her senses. But there was no one there now. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She let herself in and
went to the phone book. She tried to look up Ted DeWitt-Clinton's number, but
found it was unlisted. Information was just as helpful. Sighing, she went up to
her room. To her added discomfort, the signs of trespass were strongest here,
including on her computer. She could tell just by looking that it had been in
operation until only a few minutes ago. That made her very, very nervous. She
wondered when her mom would wake up and come home. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She felt very tired and
spread herself out on her bed, noting that Daria should be home in less than an
hour. She hoped that the intruders did not come back. She hoped the weird men
in black didn't show up, either. She knew it wasn't them as they wouldn't have
left any traces for her to find. Contemplating this, she did not feel herself
fall asleep. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She found herself under
a bright light, surrounded by deep shadows. She felt others like herself <span
class=GramE>nearby,</span> and THEM again, watching her. An old man, but one
who radiated vitality and strength, lurched forward on tentacles. "You
have seen The Enemy?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn blinked. Then she
knew they were talking about the 3 men in black. "Yeah, they were pretty
scary." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He nodded. "But you
escaped. That is good." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"My mom was there,
but she passed out. So did Dr. Malak." When the guy showed no response,
she added, "I'm worried about her." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Who?" he
asked. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"My
mom!"</span></span></span><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:
0pt'> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He shook his head.
"Your human bearer has served her purpose. You must forget about
her." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"She's dead!?"
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Not yet. But as
far as you're concerned, she might as well be. You must. The humans will never
accept you. Not even your own mother. Especially when she finds what it is we
will do to her species. We are your family now. But you must wake up, for the
Enemy can sneak up on you while you rest." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Who ARE
they!?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Not who, but what.
<span class=GramE>Constructs of the Enemy, of the Usurpers.</span> They appear
wherever your timeline could cease to be. They used to be relentless, but now
we have <span class=GramE>Tainted</span> too much and they are overburdened.
That they come after you means you are a particular threat to this continuum.
This is good, but they must not be allowed to destroy you." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Threaten this
continuum? <span class=GramE>How?"</span> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The thing shrugged.
"We will find out. And we will make sure you live up to that potential.
You must wake up now and be on your guard until we <span class=GramE>arrive</span>
later tonight." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"But I'm so
TIRED!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Have you fed off
Essence? No, I see you have not. Whenever you use your Gifts, or even hide
yourself from the vulgar masses, you need to replenish yourself. Listen
closely, you'll hear a soft whine or buzz just below what you can normally
hear. You will feel it like a soft electrical charge." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn did, and felt her
feelers along her back wiggle excitedly. "I feel it," she said,
desire blooming within her. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Now just pull it
in. It will naturally flow through and around you, becoming more solid around
you. Then breathe out the impurities." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn did so, and lost
herself in the ecstasy of it. The man smiled at her pleasure in <span
class=GramE>Tainting</span> the world, and knew that given time she would
embrace them fully. As they all did. It was just a matter of time, though that
was a luxury Quinn did not have if the Enemy was already after her. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn woke up suddenly
and wondered why she was lying on the floor. Then she wondered where the carpet
went. Then she realized she was lying on the ceiling. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>As the shock of this
realization coursed through her, she dropped, turning and landing gracefully on
her feet. She felt alive as she never had before. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The
her</span></span></span><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>
eyes widened in fear as she heard a pounding at the door. But she smiled an
instant later as she realized it was Ted! She hurried down and opened the door.
"Hey, Ted!" She smiled at him seductively. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>To her disappointment,
he looked normal, though she could see his True Form superimposed translucently
over his visible frame. She'd hoped to see his head antennae waving excitedly
instead. He said, "Hide <span class=GramE>yourself</span> and come on! I
don't think it's safe here." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Shrugging, Quinn
concentrated, and found that reverting to her Quinn Morgendorffer appearance
was ridiculously easy. "Let me go change," she said. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"No, come on. I
think we should go. <span class=GramE>Now."</span> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn almost refused,
but saw he was sincere. Remembering her fear of the weird men in black, she
decided to go with him. She saw an old, yellow car outside. It was a ratty
thing she would hate to be caught in. But she decided to let it slide. But as
she got in, she saw a sword in the back seat. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"So what's with the
sword?" she asked. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I found it in my
dream," he said, as he started the car. Driving away, he added, "I
grabbed it and when I woke up, I was still holding it." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn blinked, wondering
what the implications were of that. She suddenly wondered if she could be hurt
through her dreams and shivered. <i>Had that guy shot me in my nightmare last
night, would I have really been shot?</i> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>They drove to Pizza King
and went in and ordered a pizza. Ted snuck the sheathed sword in under a trench
coat, laying the trench coat with the sword in it beside him. While they ate,
he told her that he had also learned how to "take in Essence to
recharge" himself, just before he came here. He had fallen asleep in his
dad's car and was told he was needed to protect her from The Enemy, whatever
that was. Their dream allies would meet them in body that night at Pizza King. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"They said that
those people who attacked you almost never show up in a public place. But if
everyone suddenly falls asleep around us, we need to get out as fast as
possible." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Did they give you
that sword?" she asked, wondering why they didn't give him an Uzi. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"No, I found it.
Some human used it against an Old One and wounded it badly. It's made of cold
iron and charged with spells of some kind. I took it because I know sword
fighting and worked with it. They told me to keep it, but know it could hurt me
if it were used against me. Later, they also told me it could be used against
The Enemy." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then Daria and Jane came
in, and came right up to them. They both appeared distinctly uncomfortable. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria blandly asked her,
"Quinn, do you know why the house is so cold?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><i><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Because I ate the
Essence</span></i></span><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:
0pt'>, she thought. Instead, she said, "No." Then she frowned as she
saw something in Daria and Jane both. She stopped as she saw them both frown at
her scrutiny. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I'd say she was
offended at what we're wearing," said Jane, "but have you noticed the
nightshirt Princess Grace is wearing?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Curious at what she saw,
she looked again. There it was, a little INVERSED Essence. Not <span
class=GramE>Taint</span>, exactly, but it was like "corrupted
Essence." She'd never seen that before. Was it caused by their being in
her home after <span class=GramE>she</span>... Tainted it? Ate it? Or was this
Inversion something else? She reached out mentally to it and both girls gasped.
Quinn quickly pulled back as she felt them react to her intrusion. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"So cold...."
muttered Daria<span class=GramE>. "</span>Quinn, what did you do?"
She looked at her with fear. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane frowned, also
shivering. "You're saying it was her?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Let's go,"
said Daria, already walking away. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Where?" asked
Jane, following. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Your
house."</span></span></span><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:
0pt'> They left. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn shook her head.
"I was hoping to ask them about Mom. I hope she's okay." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Ted frowned, reminded of
the 3 men that had menaced Quinn. "What did you do to Daria and her
friend?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I saw... <span
class=GramE>Something in them.</span> Something <span class=GramE>like</span>
us. It was very small. I don't know if it's because they were in the house so
soon after I took <span class=GramE>it's</span> Essence into me, or...." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"What?" Ted
remembered that he had always thought there was something similar about Quinn
and Daria, but he never could put his finger on it. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Something
else."</span></span></span><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:
0pt'> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then the 3 Jays
appeared, each saying hi, and staring coldly at Ted. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn smiled thinly at
them. "Look, um, we'll talk later, okay?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>All 3 frowned. One
asked, "Is this guy bothering you? You're not acting like yourself. And
that shirt...." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn's features
changed, her full form coming out. Her voice vibrated as she said, "Leave
Now." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She knew they were fast
on the field, but she'd never seen them move so fast to run out to the door.
She quickly put herself back to normal. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Ted laughed. "That
was great. <span class=GramE>But probably not a good idea."</span> He
laughed again, and Quinn laughed with him. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then Quinn noticed she
hadn't seen that Inversion within them. She looked around her. She knew the
Fashion Club would likely be at Stacey's now, so she wasn't worried about them
showing up. But she studied everyone else. There was Kevin Thompson. No
Inversion. <span class=GramE>Mack and Jodie just came in, no Inversion.</span>
Others she didn't know so well, no Inversion. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Wait. <span class=GramE>One.</span>
The weird one everyone called Burn <span class=GramE>Out</span> Girl. <span
class=GramE>Jennifer something.</span> She had it, too. And she was by herself,
eating a pizza, reading a book. "Excuse me," said Quinn distractedly,
as she got up and went over to her. She walked slowly over to her, while Ted
looked quizzically after Quinn. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jennifer looked up
annoyed at Quinn, but also a little surprised that Quinn would come up to her,
and dressed that way, too. "What?" she asked, somewhat belligerently,
somewhat curiously. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Have you been at
my house recently?" asked Quinn, as she reached mentally to explore her Inversion.
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Why would I...
would I....<span class=GramE>"</span> Jennifer suddenly didn't feel well.
She looked up and somehow KNEW Quinn was doing... whatever. She grabbed her
Ultra Cola and threw it at Quinn, drenching her. Quinn didn't react in the
slightest, which really scared her. She got up and ran, Quinn slowly following
behind her, her shirt dripping wet, trying to understand why Jennifer had an
Inversion. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>As Jennifer ran out,
Andrea came in, yelling at Jennifer to watch where she's going. Then turning to
see Quinn, she blinked at her appearance, and asked, "What do you
want?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"To know if you've
been in my house," said Quinn simply. Like Burnout Girl, she also had that
Inverness within her. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Why would
I...." Andrea suddenly didn't feel well. Looking up, she KNEW it was
Quinn. Snarling in surprised, angry fear, she threw a punch at her face.
Without even blinking, Quinn quickly brought her hand up and caught it, holding
Andrea's fist in a vice-like grip. This startled her, but she wasn't frightened
until she saw the look in Quinn's eyes. Not of snobbish superiority, or
anything anyone would expect. <span class=GramE>Just simple curiosity, like a
child looking at a bug under a magnifying glass.</span> And were her pupils
really shaped like an hourglass? </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then Andrea swallowed as
she thought she saw a pair of third eyelids blink. She tore her fist away from
Quinn's grip and ran back outside, and swore to lay off the mushrooms as she
continued to run, feeling ill. <i>Flashback</i>, she told herself, <i>I'm
having a paranoid flashback! No more shrooms!</i> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Back in Pizza King, Ted
lightly grabbed Quinn's arm. "Quinn," he asked her softly, "what
are you doing?" He was now standing beside her at the door. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Speaking softly, she
told him, "A few people have this... this THING inside them. I want to
know why. It means something, but I don't know what. But it's important."
Then she looked around. Everyone was staring at her. She smiled and went back
to her table, followed closely by Ted. She could hear some of them speculating
that she was on drugs or something, but there was a common feeling in the room:
uncertain fear. She didn't even hear any speculations on what she was doing
here with Ted. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn decided to <span
class=GramE>lay</span> off before she pushed the managers to kick her out. Her
being Quinn, and the two girls being unpopular, was probably the only reason
she hadn't been kicked out yet. But she knew they were thinking about it. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>After awhile, things got
back to normal, but no one bothered Quinn. Quinn and Ted talked about what life
was like growing up as the sun set outside, and kept on talking until the old
man in Quinn's dream, now in a wheelchair with his legs completely covered by a
blanket, was escorted into Pizza King with 2 men and 2 women. Quinn saw that
the last of twilight was fading, and that they all were like her and Ted. They
radiated <span class=GramE>an Inverseness</span> instead of Essence, one so
strong it was unmistakable. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I hope this isn't
a mistake," said Quinn softly. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"This is a public
place, Quinn, what could happen?" responded Ted just as softly, making
sure he could get to his sword quickly. <i>Is THAT what Quinn and I will
become?</i> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Meanwhile, at Casa Lane,
Mystik Spiral cut band practice to help with Daria and Jane who were sweating,
convulsing, and... <span class=GramE>something</span>. Daria grabbed Trent and
suddenly felt weaker, and then he, too, felt ill. Jesse experienced the same
thing at the hands of Jane. Soon Max and Nick joined them on the front room
floor, convulsing, sweating, and changing. Casa Lane grew very, very cold and
several house plants around the house withered to ash as a communal keening
went up. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jennifer was breathing
hard in her own bed. Even though she had turned her light out, and the sun was
almost completely set, she could see perfectly well. But she didn't know why
she felt so cold when she was sweating so profusely. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Andrea was in her own
room, feeling a thickening of her skeleton. She Felt a... a life force of sorts
around her, and felt such force flow into her as she changed. Had she looked
outside, she would see that all the grass and trees in sight were withering away.
But she would've just assumed it was part of this intense flashback she thought
she was experiencing. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>To stop the mushroom
flashback, she was listening to Bella Morte, telling herself silently, <span
class=GramE><i>It's</i></span><i> just a trip. <span class=GramE>Ride with it.</span>
The Vitamin B-3 Niacin formula will kick in any minute now. Just go with it and
let the fear flow away</i>. She concentrated on not screaming when she felt an
exoskeleton form around her nails and her teeth elongate and grow thicker,
larger... especially her canines. She just concentrated on the music. </span></span><br>

<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She decided the light
was too harsh and she turned it off. She could see perfectly well. Then she
felt the third eyelids cover her own eyes and she could STILL see. She fell in a
heap, sweating profusely, struggling not to cry out in fear lest one of her kin
see that she was freaking out and decide to put her back in rehab. She barely
heard the music anymore as she struggled not to scream. </span></span><br>

<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The jukebox just
randomly put on Forsaken by Disturbed as the Tainted came in. Was it
coincidence, or an omen? They were trying to convince Quinn and Ted to come
away with them, but both young people were a little spooked by them. It was
hard to say what it was, but every once in awhile, the blanket over the old
man's legs would shift oddly that made Quinn nervous. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then a middle-aged guy
that made pizzas in the kitchen of Pizza King, called out loudly,
"Everybody, can I have your attention, please!" Everyone looked at
him curiously, as he had never done this before. "There seems to have been
an accident of some kind. There were no details, except that it's a chemical
spill. It might be wise if you go home. I'm going to shut down, though you can
stay here if you rather. If you leave, please don't try crossing any
roadblocks!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The Tainted old man in
the wheelchair softly told the others, so that only the Tainted could hear,
"It's not a chemical spill. It's us. We need to get out of here now. Put
the babes in my van." This was all said so softly and casually, which only
made it more ominous to Quinn and Ted. A man and woman got behind both of them
and the two got a distinct sense that their cooperation was optional. The man
who had spoken up about the accident looked at them suspiciously, but said nothing.
Quinn and Ted left with their escorts. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Outside, everything
seemed normal, except for the sirens. They saw no emergency vehicles, but they
heard them. Quinn looked up at the stars coming out for a moment, wondering how
long those stars would shine down on this planet, until she was gently pushed
further towards a van. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn gasped as the old
man opened the door to the driver's side, for he threw his blanket in the seat
and stood up on a mass of tentacles. He then jumped into the van. <span
class=GramE>The man that had been behind Quinn had walked up to the wheelchair
and folded it, putting it into a prepared space by the side door.</span> She
had never seen anything like that. She stole a quick glance at Ted to see that
he, too, was mesmerized by the grotesqueness of what they had just seen. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then the man who had
arranged the wheelchair opened the side door and motioned Ted and Quinn in.
After they got in, he shut the door on them. Out the windows, she saw the
others get on 4 sleek, yellow Yamaha motorcycles with black stripes that made
Quinn think of yellow jackets. They started up and left just before the old
man, the old <span class=GramE>thing,</span> pulled out and followed behind
them. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>It was barely 2 minutes
when they saw a roadblock swarming with what appeared to be black-armored
soldiers around it and stopping cars. There were 3 cars stopped, but they had
just allowed one to pass. What struck Quinn as particularly ominous is that she
couldn't see anything of them. From head to toe, even their faces, even their
eyes, were all covered in something black. They all strapped a variety of
weapons, from long guns to side arms, and they all looked wrong somehow. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The van slowed, still
several meters away from needing to stop, and 4 of the motorcycles continued
forward. Quinn frowned tensely as she saw a half-dozen soldiers walk up behind
the 3rd car and motion for the motorcycles to stop. They did. And one handed
him something. "What was that?" she asked. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The old, tentacled man
rasped, "Nightmare grenade. It's a black crystal that finds all that human
fear and blasts it in their mind, the moment it's activated by the touch of
Essence. Watch <span class=GramE>this,</span> it's very, very effective." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The soldier took it.
Nothing happened. "Well?" asked Ted. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"The glove, see.
Their uniforms are made of a fabric that prevents Essence from flowing freely
from their bodies. Which is inconvenient, but... ah!" There was a loud
retort. Quinn and Ted both gasped as they saw another of the motorcycle riders
had blown a hole into the soldier holding the rock from a very large hand <span
class=GramE>gun,</span> one so large she didn't know how he had hidden it. The
man chuckled, "Armor-piercing rounds." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>While the old man
reversed the van, the soldiers quickly gathered against the motorcycles, which
rode in separate directions off-road. The van was ignored as the soldiers began
shooting. They only got off a few shots, and only one rider fell, when they all
began screaming. Some of them fell, others ran, and others just stood there
shrieking. The car at the front suddenly accelerated and ran a soldier down. No
one shot at it as it drove forward frantically. The middle-aged couple in the
next car both got out, running and shrieking. There appeared to be only a
driver in the third car, and he seemed to just fall into a fetal position, out
of the sight of everyone else. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then Quinn and Ted
transformed. Quinn's feelers waved excitedly, and Ted's antennae did the same.
They both gasped at the pleasure of it. "What's... this?" asked Ted. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The old man, who now
seemed more vital, like in their dreams, calmly said, "Fear releases the
Essence from the mortal mind. There'd be even more if they weren't wearing that
fabric. Go ahead and enjoy it, kids. You'll need it, and every time we devour
Essence of this world, it is replaced by Taint. Do enough of it, and a portal can...."
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Unexpectedly, the side
door jerked open, and Ted and Quinn saw 2 of the 3 men-in-black staring coldly
in. She jumped back into Ted's lap as both reached in towards her. Suddenly,
the old man was between them, and then he leaped on one, locking it within his
tentacles. They both fell to the road. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The other didn't pause,
but continued reaching for Quinn. <span class=GramE>Only to get Ted's sword in
its throat.</span> It pulled back and rubbed its throat with both hands. The
other man in black dropped from the top of the van onto the old man and yanked
his head back and stuck something to his head. An unearthly shriek rose up and
then he was melting into <span class=GramE>a purplish</span> goo that smelled
oddly like cherries to Quinn. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Ted slashed him with his
sword. He turned, an obvious cut in him but no blood, and Ted slashed him
again. Jumping out of the van, he thrust and pulled his blade out. The man
evaporated into black mist. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then Ted was grabbed
from behind by the one he had stabbed in the throat, who now seemed fully
healed. The other got up with the device. He slashed, but missed. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Just as the one with the
device began to shoot forward, Quinn leaped out at him and grabbed both arms.
She found he was incredibly strong and would've swung her over if she hadn't
also wrapped her legs and tail around him. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Ted sidestepped slightly
and swung the sword so that it faced behind him and pulled it back. The man
holding him also evaporated into black mist. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn took a bite with
her canines of the man trying to swing her off, but nearly puked from the
taste. The man fell then, trying to roll her off. After a moment, he succeeded,
and she was slung several meters with her breath knocked out of her. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The Essence was still
flowing into her, and she quickly felt all her bruises heal over. In those few
moments, she saw Ted leap over and slash him. It wasn't deep, but the man
evaporated into black mist anyway. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"You okay?"
asked Ted, running up to her. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I'm fine,"
she replied. "What happened to the old man?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>They went up and just
saw the purple goo. Then, through their horror, they saw both tires were
completely flat. The van was no longer useable. Quinn frowned as she saw that
the weapon the one man in black dropped was not to be seen. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>They jumped at the
sounds of explosions. Turning, they saw 6 black helicopters with bright lights
focus on the motorcycle riders, of which there were now 3. <span class=GramE>A
large vehicle that looked as if it could hold several soldiers, and all black,
was also pulling up to the roadblock from the other direction.</span> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Let's go,"
said Ted, getting his trench coat, sheathing his sword and putting it on. Then
grabbing Quinn's wrist he started to pull her back into Lawndale. She went
willingly with him. They both resumed their human appearance and raced to the
nearest alley. They ducked in and skidded to a halt when they saw 4 soldiers
there, two of them wounded and being supported by the others. The soldiers
stopped in shock as they saw the two teens. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>One of the wounded
looked directly at Quinn and frowned. Sounding slightly delirious, he asked,
"But if that's Quinn, then who was the Tainted that tore us a part?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The two who were less
battered dropped their wounded and leveled their sidearms on Ted and Quinn. The
two had barely moved before both guns went off, and Ted was thrown off Quinn.
She ducked as another gunshot went off, and she sensed a high-velocity round
pass just an inch above her. She heard one of the wounded saying there was
"more than one Tainted, I repeat, more than one Tainted." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She got to one foot and
knee and saw one soldier pull a grenade, and put his finger around the pin and
stop. The other one was pulling a gun from the side holster of the wounded man
next to him. She snarled and leaped forward, her True Form coming out, and with
a surprising burst of speed tackled the man as he began pulling the gun to bear
on her. He fell and she ripped his throat out. Unlike the man in black, he
tasted DELICIOUS. She Felt the Essence flow into her, as well, and it was
sweeter still. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Forgive me for my
sins," she heard the other soldier whisper, and knew he had pulled the
pin. She leaped at him, and he instinctively threw the grenade at her. She
twisted aside and slapped the grenade with her tail, and it flew like a
baseball hit by a bat. But she couldn't restrain a surprised momentary shriek
all the same when it blew, and a blast of heat assaulted her. The bright light
cast sharp shadows through the alley. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Just die, you <span
class=GramE>freaks</span>!" The man yelled at her. She could see him
perfectly in the dim alley again and knew she had the advantage. She could see
his pupils still trying to readjust themselves back to the darkness from the
sudden explosion of heat and light that had briefly illuminated the alley. He
pulled a knife. She leaped at him, her tail wrapping around the wrist with the
knife and jerking it back as she tore out his throat. The blood and Essence
were very nice. But she only took a moment before she got up and dispatched the
wounded. She thought nothing about what she did, only that she was now
concerned with Survival. She found that thoughts of good, evil, and mercy took
a back seat to that one concept. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Only after the immediate
threat was over did she go to see Ted. He was gasping, but he would live. <span
class=GramE>If he didn't get shot again.</span> It still looked bad, though.
Then inspiration hit and she breathed over him, willing the Essence to flow out
of her into him. His eyes cleared, and he looked much better. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Thanks," he
said. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She smiled at him. She
found his survival was also paramount to her. He got up, still hurt, but much
better. Resuming their human form, they went to the other end of the alley. She
saw a vehicle approaching from meters away and she said, "The other
way!" They ran to the other end and ran out, heading into Lawndale. They
only got two blocks when several vehicles manned by those soldiers in black,
pulled around a corner, and turned their direction. They both fled into the
next nearest alley. They were halfway across when the vehicle stopped at the
mouth and shone a spotlight on them. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>A loudspeaker spoke up
loudly, "Quinn Morgendorffer, put down your hostage and surrender. We only
want to help you. But you have to trust us. Put the hostage down now." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>They didn't stop, and
they heard a door open. Quinn felt burning pain in her leg as a gun was shot at
them both, but she didn't stop. She saw vehicles on both sides of her on the
other end, soldiers already getting out. Two helicopters were also flying over
head, and their spotlights shone down on them. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Seeing there was nowhere
to run, Quinn looked about desperately. <span class=GramE>Time to find a place
for her last stand.</span> "Through that window," she said to Ted,
who was also taking in their suddenly grim odds. He nodded and resumed his True
Form. So did <span class=GramE>she</span>. Then they leaped through the glass
window, which exploded into shards, just as several guns began firing. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Landing inside, Quinn
saw she was in a Chinese Restaurant of some kind. <i>Isn't this the Good Times
place?</i> <span class=GramE>she</span> wondered. She never came here as she
heard it was a hangout for geeks and weirdos, but now decided it was perhaps
the most appropriate place for them to make their last stand. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>And then out of the
shadows, a man in black <span class=GramE>formed,</span> the one that had only
barely been wounded by the van before vanishing. It grabbed Quinn and slammed
her against the wall with a strength that outdid her own many times over. One
arm pulled away, but then she saw the arm fall and evaporate as Ted's sword cut
it off. There was no blood. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The man released her,
and turned toward Ted. His arm slowly began to reform. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Go," said
Ted, "I'll catch up!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn jumped the man
from behind. Even with one hand, he managed to grab a hold of her before she
got a good grip and sling her towards Ted. Ted ducked, rolling under Quinn, and
brought the sword up and thrust into its chest cavity. The entire man
evaporated into black mist again. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Hearing running combat
boots getting very close, they both were running towards the back of the
restaurant. Fire exploded behind them and they knew the restaurant was on fire,
and would likely consume the building soon. Backing away, Quinn suddenly
vanished into a wormhole. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>And then <span
class=GramE>Everything</span> changed. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The energies of the
wormhole filled Quinn's being like Essence, and transformed it. She thought she
vaguely heard someone shouting he had always known "that twit would drive
us crazy!" And then it was gone. She was in an abyssal gulf that was, for
want of a better term, a mix of gelatin, ocean, and the cold space between the
stars. It shone as a dim violet to her eyes. Somehow, there was an odd music,
if it could be called that as it was heard with nonhuman <span class=GramE>senses,
that</span> filled this watery void. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She felt the caress of
tentacles surround her. A "voice" spoke to her, "This is <span
class=GramE>My</span> beloved daughter, with whom I am well-pleased. You have
given the Earth to <span class=GramE>Me</span>!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Others approached. She
heard then something like speech but unexplainable. </span></span><br>

<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinn blinked at this.
It was all alien, and yet somehow familiar. She wondered if <span class=GramE>They</span>
were somehow related to these "Usurpers" that they kept going on
about having "stolen" the cosmos from Them. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She wondered where Ted
was. She saw no portal back, but she was able to see into the restaurant where
she had been. She saw Ted badly burned, barely alive. Frowning, she...
REACHED... back in, and <span class=GramE>Felt</span> both Taint and Essence
reach forth by her will, forming a protective, healing cocoon around Ted. She
began healing both his human side and his Tainted side. </span></span><br>

<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The Good Times Chinese
Restaurant began to warp in shape. A light came from within it, bright and hot,
but one which was healing Ted, and causing the soldiers to run away in panic,
as their sanity collapsed. She harvested what Essence she could from them and
the surrounding area and used it <span class=GramE>fuel</span> her design. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>[SHOW YOU] [HOW IT'S
DONE] </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>From the night around
the restaurant, several aerial sacks, invisible to the human eye but pulsing
with Hunger for Essence to her own eyes, spread forth a sinister collection of
vibrating ganglia, singing a song only she and the Old Ones could hear. They
fell upon soldiers, and drained their Essence directly into Cthulhu. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Hastur touched her and
suddenly several wriggling shapes pulsed forward around a collection of
soldiers near the edge of town, narrowing into ominous tentacles. The touch
drove soldiers mad, ripped through their uniforms, and the tentacles drank
greedily. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>[MINE!] <span
class=GramE>shouted</span> mighty Cthulhu. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>[MINE!] <span
class=GramE>retorted</span> Hastur. The others began to crowd toward Quinn. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>As the Old Ones began
bickering, Quinn explored how this wormhole had changed her. She felt both her
human and <span class=GramE>Tainted</span> sides bridging the gap. And deep
within her, she felt another Change. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>As she Changed, she saw
a few soldiers still barely sane, babbling into a radio phone that "Quinn
Morgendorffer can open cankers to Alien-X at will." Then she saw an
approaching jet. A missile was launched, and she knew this would somehow change
everything, too. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>[YES!] </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>[SEIZE THE POWER OF THE <span

HUMANS GAVE IT TO US!] </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>They were still cheering
when the missile released its deadly load. And Quinn's own grasping form
grabbed at it, even as the other Old Ones grasped at it to Taint it and blast
open the portal for a more direct invasion. But Quinn felt it pass through HER,
as she was the literal portal now, and she had her own ideas. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>[WHAT?] </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The Old Ones screamed,
as Quinn directed the nuclear blast through <span class=GramE>Herself</span> at
mighty Cthulhu, terrible Azathoth, leering Hastur, and the others. They tried
to fight back, but she got <span class=GramE>Them</span> where They were
vulnerable. As <span class=GramE>They</span> withered, she fed upon their Taint
the same way she fed upon Essence. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>And became a God:
Quinnthulhu. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The other Old Ones,
approaching, paused, considering this new development. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then <span class=GramE>She</span>
was surrounded by angelic and demonic entities, and knew these were minions of
the Usurpers. They fought as badly as the Old Ones. Converting her Essence,
still being fed into her by the probing digits formed on Earth before Quinn
destroyed their creators, she converted it to Taint and blasted the annoying
spirits away. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The Usurpers came, and <span
class=GramE>She</span> blasted Them, too. She felt <span class=GramE>Their</span>
power flow into Her, just as the Old Ones had done. Quinnthulhu was not only a
New <span class=GramE>God,</span> She was a Hybrid Usurper-Old One. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The few Usurpers and Old
Ones left fled into the Void away from Her Terrible Might. And Quinnthulhu
forgot <span class=GramE>Them</span> as They no longer mattered to Her. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She reached into Earth,
Her's now by right of combat, and caused Ted to ascend with <span class=GramE>Her</span>.
Then <span class=GramE>She</span> reached into the predatory sacks given birth
by Cthulhu and transformed them into beautiful, glowing butterflies. She saw
this was good and smiled. She called forth a rainbow, but one with blacklight
edges. She was amazed at how simple it all was. All <span class=GramE>She</span>
had to do was Imagine it to Create it. Both Essence and Taint were Her Paint to
make anything <span class=GramE>She</span> wanted. The new rainbow would now be
<span class=GramE>Her</span> sign to the Earth that they would all be blessed
by both sides, neither side at combat with the other anymore. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She saw Daria and Jane
and so many others with a touch of Inversion. She now saw that they had all
been touched as <span class=GramE>She</span> herself had been, but the
connection hadn't been strong enough for it to take in the Material Realm. This
caused it to be suppressed. But when the mortal Quinn touched it with both
Taint and Essence combined, it began to retroactively take into this realm,
transforming them into creatures similar to what Quinn had been born as. She
saw there were so many others out there, and as Quinnthulhu integrated with the
current continuum, they all began to mutate. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then <span class=GramE>She</span>
looked at Earth from a wider perspective. She saw many things that <span
class=GramE>She</span> had never imagined as a human. Animals and plants had a
surprising sentience, and communicated with each other through a variety of
means: some with noises and expressions, others with scents and a few even used
<span class=GramE>a telepathy</span> of sorts. She was amazed at how cocky most
flowers were, making Sandi Griffin look downright humble in comparison. The
trees were slow and ponderous. And deep within the Earth, miles underground,
were crystalline entities that communicated with flashes of light to each other.
It would all seem random to a human, and the crystalline entities had no
concept of organic life themselves. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then <span class=GramE>She</span>
saw that time itself was much more fluid, and She could reshape it all if She
desired. She made a mental note to bring back the other planets, once <span
class=GramE>She</span> was a little more used to Her new position as God of
this realm. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then <span class=GramE>She</span>
saw into other realities, her consciousness expanding to include more and more
worlds... She was surprised that in another reality, Her brainy sister came
back after World War 3 in the future of that Earth as a messiah, after falling
off a cliff ... and in another, Jane was God, and related to a magical crone
named Baba [Grandmother] Yaga. <span class=GramE><i>Coincidence?</i></span><i>
What does it mean?</i> She knew <span class=GramE>She'd</span> figure it out as
Her consciousness continued to grow beyond mortal measures. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She came to see that All
Now Existed because She imagined it into being. Like the gods of old, <span
class=GramE>She</span> projected Her image onto countless worlds, cultivating
receptive minds to know and love Her divinity as She began to assimilate these
higher realities, each one a matryoshka doll that encompassed the one before
it. And now Quinnthulhu encompassed them all in <span class=GramE>Her</span>
own....Q Continuum was the word She invented to describe it, being beyond
mortal measure. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>And then <span
class=GramE>She</span> reached into worlds in which all that She knew was just
fiction, somehow spawning their reality, just as others spawned their reality.
She began to assimilate it, driving away both Usurpers and Old Ones wherever <span
class=GramE>She</span> could, assimilating entire worlds. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then <span class=GramE>She</span>
found some who thought of her, even if they didn't know she was real... such
personages as Professor, Scissors, and Hey....and through Hey, Dervish. Yes,
the one known as Dervish was working on some silly kender fic, though <span
class=GramE>She</span> liked the Arborea plane she described, a continuum of
joy, love, and beauty. She would make such a place for <span class=GramE>Her</span>
followers, She might even make the new planets that way! </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>But that was for a
little later. For now, <span class=GramE>She</span> reached into Dervish's mind
and changed it. After all, mortal concerns are insignificant compared to the
concerns of a Goddess. And then Dervish saw that all that had happened to <span
class=GramE>Her</span> since Her nightmare as the mortal Quinn. Dervish had a
different ending in mind, but Quinnthulhu easily changed it with a hint of <span
class=GramE>Her</span> almighty will. Dervish wasn't even aware of it, having
thought she had chosen this ending from the very beginning. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Quinnthulhu smiled. Then
thoughtfully, with a tentacle scratching at <span class=GramE>Her</span> face,
She decided that She would use this Dervish before moving on to assimilate even
Higher Worlds. She would offer those blessed with <span class=GramE>Her</span>
sacred verses, a choice that would affect those who saw them for all eternity.
She frowned as Dervish resisted, but the psychic battle was over before it had
even really begun. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><i><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Don't cross Me,
Dervish, or I'll imagine you right out of existence! Don't think I can do it?
Lots of folk disappear without a trace, and more than a few are those who have
declared themselves <span class=GramE>My</span> enemies. Makes a body think,
don't it? </span></i></span><i><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Oh, Right. I see that
you're being a good girl now. Ahem. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Greetings, everyone,
from the Q-Continuum! Never mind that last comment to Dervish. Just because I'm
a God now, and have devoured your gods and demons and Old Ones and made their
power mine, doesn't mean I'm no longer a nice person. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Listen to <span
class=GramE>Me</span> in your heart, and answer My call. <span class=GramE>For
I am Quinnthulhu, of the Q-continuum, and I love you.</span> And not as in
"love you in <span class=GramE>My</span> soup" kind of love, or
"let's have sex and then forget about you" kind of love, but in
"I want you to be beautiful and spread beauty" kind of love. Join <span
class=GramE>My</span> popular priesthood that wears my Holy Butterfly symbol
over their heart while looking good as they chant, "Ia, Ia! Quinnthulhu! <span
class=GramE>The Butterfly with a Thousand Fashions!"</span> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>What is the Q-Continuum?
It is <span class=GramE>Me</span>, the realm of all beauty and love and
popularity. I am found in butterflies and rainbows, in the coral reefs and
majestic mountains, and anywhere there is beauty. When you become beautiful,
you also will become part of <span class=GramE>Me</span>, the Q-continuum. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Life is worth living
because of the beauty found in the world and the love that draws twin hearts
together. Create a bulwark against evil by nurturing what is beautiful,
encourage beauty wherever you find it, and let your beautiful glow brighten and
enliven the lives of those around you. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Keep your own body as
comely as possible and as attractively displayed as the situations warrant. Let
hairstyle and clothing best suit your personal appearance, striving to stir and
delight others who look upon you. Moreover, hide not away, but always seek to
present yourself to those around you in a pleasing variety of garbs and
activities so as to move them with love and desire. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Love none more than
yourself save Quinnthulhu, and lose yourself in the beauty of the Q-Continuum,
allowing a pittance of Her radiance to shine from you, Her loyal worshipper.
Imagine yourself radiant. You could be, especially as you join with <span
class=GramE>Me</span> in my Q-continuum in beauty and fulfilled desire forever.
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>What will YOU do with
the Call of Quinnthulhu? An Eternity of beauty and pleasure await those who
embrace <span class=GramE>Me</span>, while the Void is filled with Hungry
Usurpers and Old Ones, slobbering greedily for the morsels of lost souls to
come within reach of their questing maws. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>I know you will make the
right choice. I hope so, for I truly love all of you. Please come and be with <span
class=GramE>Me</span> in joyous love and beauty Forever!</span></span></i><span
class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>And the mighty,
beautiful, popular Quinnthulhu moved on to worlds in which all of us are merely
figments of someone else's imagination. And in my mind, I can still hear the
worshippers of Quinnthulhu singing in their beautiful grottoes: </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><i><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Close your eyes, give

<br>
<span class=postbody1><b><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Author's Final,
Gibbering Thoughts:</span></b></span><span class=postbody1><span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>If you retain any sanity
after reading that, you might wonder about some of the inspirations. In
addition to the Cthulhu mythos (which Wikipedia can clue you in on if you're
unfamiliar with it), there were some other works I found inspirational. In
particular <span class=GramE>is</span> Nightworld and All the Rage by F. Paul
Wilson. The Illuminatus! <span class=GramE>Trilogy by Robert Anton Wilson and
Robert Shea.</span> <span class=GramE>The Alternity roleplaying system,
particularly for the conspiracy-oriented Darkmatter campaign.</span> (The
Hoffman Institute does really exist and did at one time advertise for
scientists who were particularly "open-minded.") </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Should I have gotten any
of the science wrong, <span class=GramE>then</span> I remind you that scifi and
the like are made for scientists the way romances and porn are made for those
in fulfilling relationships. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The personages
Professor, Scissors, and Hey are fellow Daria fans that originally thought of
this idea and then had Hey convince me to create the story for them. The
"other realities" where Daria or Jane became divine are references to
other fanfics, both by The Angst Guy, IIRC. The Good Times Chinese Restaurant
was featured in the Daria ep, Depth Takes a Holiday, in which it's revealed
that a wormhole connects it to a land of archetypes. "St. Patrick's
Day" said he feared talking to Quinn would drive him crazy, too. </span></span><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>For those not clear on
exactly what the Old Ones were trying to do, then it was to corrupt our star
system, rob it of its Usurper Essence and replace it with their own Essence
(known as Taint from our PoV, though technically, they'd see Essence as Taint).
Essentially, if the Elder Gods can steal the Essence, Taint it to <span
class=GramE>themselves</span>, they can steal away the entire solar system and
reshape it into another verse. Humanity will never have existed in the first
place, because Earth's past will be erased and rewritten, along with <span
class=GramE>it's</span> present and future. It will all be lost (again) to the
Elder Gods, who take it back from the Usurpers (the current gods and spirits
and such, and those they fashioned to create extra essence for them to milk and
use). </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>IOW, humanity won't be
humanity anymore, but another species that puts out essence for the Elder Gods
instead. And much like the samples taken from Quinn that vanished from Reality
because of the New Moon Phenomenon, Earth as we know it will simply cease to
exist at all, replaced by <span class=GramE>Something</span> Else...something
pleasing to the Elder Gods. Humanity will then become Essence cows to the Elder
Gods instead of the Usurpers, or it will all be beautiful discordant chaos (at
least to our senses). In any case, our reality breaks away and no longer
exists...having never existed in the first place. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>I know<span class=GramE>,</span>
it's hard for linear-thinking mortals to grasp. But that's why you're a cow
instead of a god. <span class=GramE>Moving on now.</span> </span></span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>For those of you angry
at the thought of Cthulhu, and other GOOs (Great Old Ones), getting destroyed
within mere minutes of first meeting Quinn...go refresh yourselves and your
faith by visiting your nearest Campus Crusade for Cthulhu. (I dare you to
google it! Go on!) </span></span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The last song by Quinn's
faithful is from the Bangles, called Eternal Flame. And as for Nox Arcana, it
is a symphonic piece of electronic music. I listened to their CD Necronomicon a
lot while making this fic </span></span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>As</span></span></span><span
class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> to the loved ones of those
driven insane by reading my fic, I offer my sincere condolences. And for those
who retained their sanity after reading this fic, I've just got a question for
you to consider: If you WERE insane, would you know it? </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Thanks to all who helped
me with this <span class=GramE>fic.</span> As usual, to Liz, who has wandered
the grey, in between spaces so long this all sounds normal to her, and in
particular to The Angst Guy, who made it possible for this fic to drive you all
mad. All hail the Angst Lord. Or answer to Quinnthulhu.</span></span></span></p>
