by Jenna 

Ms. Bennett - All right class, it's time for our mid-year field trip. Where would you like to go?

Upchuck - How bout' the Playboy Mansion? 
Ms. Bennett - Charles, that is the sickest idea I've ever heard. 
Kevin - How about.....uh.... 
Ms. Bennett - Anyone else? 
Jodie - What if we all go to that new carnival/theme park in Charlestown? 
Ms. Bennett - Jodie, that's a very good idea, all in favor? 
Daria and Jane exchange glances and raise their hands 
Ms. Bennett - All right, it's decided, but we need chaperones since our buses are broken.
Any volunteers? 
Upchuck - My dad can drive. 
Jane - My brother and his friend can too. 
Kevin - I'll drive! 
Ms. Bennett - Ok, I'll find a few more people later, class dismissed. 
Daria - You sure Trent and Jesse can drive? 
Jane - Maybe, what else is Trent doing next week. Remember, Trent doesn't leave the
house very often willingly. 
Daria - Good point.

Meanwhile--- 
Daria - Hey Jane, what time is it? 
Jane - I dunno, there's no clock in here. 
Quinn - It's 7:00 pm. 
Jane - How did you know that? 
Quinn - Watch. 
Trent - Hey Quinn, why don't you go find your fashion friends and tell Jesse to come here. 
Quinn - Yeah bye. 

In Jesse's room ---

Meanwhile --- 
Jesse - I can't get over this, they love me. 
Jane - Who? 
Jesse - The Fashion Club. You know a way to get them to hate me? 
Jane - Tell them you're gay. 
All stare at Jane. 
Jane - Just an idea. 
Trent - You could......I dunno. 
Daria - Get one of those sleeping pills and drug em'. That would shut them up. Believe me,
I've tried it. 
Jane - I remember when you gave Quinn those sleeping pills. 
Trent - Isn't that sorta bad? 
Daria - Why? 

Meanwhile--- 
Sandy - He is sooooooo cute!!!! 
Upchuck enters. 
Upchuck - Hello ladies. Were you talking about me? 
Stacy - You, ugh. 
Upchuck - Than who were you talking about? 
Tiffany - Jesse. You don't know him. 
Upchuck - Fine, I'll leave. 
Walks outside into the hall. 
Upchuck - Hmmm, I'll go see someone else.

Jane - No. 
Jesse - Who's he? 
Trent - I dunno Jesse, who are you? 
Upchuck - I'm Chuck Ruttheimer.....you're Jesse? 
Jesse - Yeah. 
Upchuck - Those girls in room 777 are nuts about you. 
Jesse - I know, now go away. 
Upchuck frowns and leaves. 
Trent - You shouldn't have told him to leave, you should've beat him up. 
Jesse - You're right. 

Ms. Bennett enters. 
Ms. Bennett - Jesse, go back to your room. It's time for bed. (leaves)

Trent - Why? 
Jesse - I have to spend the rest of the night with the Fashion Club. 
Jane - Right, good luck. 
Daria and Trent - Good luck. (Jesse leaves) 
Quinn - (entering) I don't believe Sandy, Stacy, and Tiffany are so into Jesse. Well I'm not
gonna like him. Personally, you (referring to Trent) have way cuter eyes, and hair, and
you're in a band too. 
Trent - Damn. 
Quinn - You know what, I like you. 
Trent - I think it's time for bed. 
Jane - But, we haven't eaten. Let's call room-service!

cheese sandwich, what do you want to drink? 
Trent - Coke. 
Daria - Coke. 
Quinn - Water. 
Jane - Three cokes and one water, pronto! 
Hotel Guy - Ok, charge to... 
Jane - Chuck Ruttheimer. Bye. Now we have food. 
Some time later a knock on the door-- 
Hotel Guy - An apple for Ms. Taylor and ice-cream and condoms for Mr. Thompson. 
Jane - I think you got us mixed up with another room. 
Hotel Guy - My mistake. 
Daria - What did he want? 
Jane - He got our rooms mixed up. Kevin and Brittany ordered ice-cream, an apple, and
condoms? 
Quinn - Speaking of which, where's my apple? 
Knock on the door-- 
Trent - Yeah? 
Hotel Guy -Morgendorffers, Lanes? 
Daria - Finally. 
Trent - Who are Kevin and Brittany? 
Daria - The blonde cheerleader and the football player. 
Trent - Why does she always wear that outfit? She probably smells bad. 
Jane - I have no idea.

Quinn - He doesn't care about your nails. Daria, where's my nail polish? 
Daria -Do I go through your stuff? 
Quinn - Here it is, can I go help you choose lipstick? 
Sandy - Sure. (leaves) 
Jane - So it's just us now. Daria, if I would leave, your morning would be perfect. You and

Jane - A little bland, but with all the adventures we have....like when we went to
Alternapalooza and Daria.. 
Daria - Shut Up. 
Jane - I wasn't gonna talk about how embarrassed you were around... 
Crystal - Trent? 
Jane - How'd you know?

Crystal - That's Jason, I gotta go tomorrow, write me, or I'll call you. 

The day goes boringly otherwise 

Back at the hotel--- 
Ms. Barch - Go to sleep. 
Jane - Night Jesse. 
Jesse - Good night Jane. 

In the room--- 
Trent - So basically, this trip is pretty good. 
Daria - Compared to Alternapalooza. 
Jane - I'm pretty tired, we should go to sleep because...Trent? 
Daria - Your brother is already asleep. 
Jane - (shrugs) Well I should sleep too. 

The next morning-- 
Ms. Barch - Get up. 
Daria - Ok (half asleep) Jane, Trent, Quinn get up. 
Trent - Lisa.......(mumbling in his sleep) 
Jane - Huh? 
Quinn - Go away. (put's pillow over her head.) 
Jane - What's going on? 
Daria - Trent was mumbling something about Lisa.

Jesse - Yeah. 

At Crystal's house--- 
Jesse - Hey Cryst. Let's go. 
Crystal - Ok. 
Jane - Daria why did we even go with them?

Trent - Bye Daria. 
Daria - Bye Trent. 
Trent - When's your next field trip, I'd like to drive for you again.

The scene ends with Daria smiling.
