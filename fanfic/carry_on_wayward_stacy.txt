Like always, Daria is a trademark of MTV and

Chorus:
Carry on, wayward Stacy
You're a wimp that ain't racy
Lay your pigtailed head to rest
Don't you cry no more.

Stacy:
Once I was a girl in shallow confusion
till The Fashion Club saved me from 
delusion
Sandi said that I'd be perfect,
to just break down an' cry.
Though I had backbone,
I still was a chicken
Though I spoke my mind,
I still took a lickin'
I hear the voice of Quinn 
when I sob;
I can hear her  say:

Chorus (repeat)

Stacy:
Masquerading as a babe with a reason
Dating Bret Strand's the event of the season
And if I claim to be a diva,
it surely means that I don't know.
In the hot tub, I said my hand was pruney
Sandi cringed at that and called me a looney
And then Sandi's brothers locked us outside
and what's worse, I heard them say:

Chorus (repeat)

Stacy:
NO!!

Solo

Sandi, Quinn & Tiffany:
Carry on

Stacy:
You're such a big crybaby

Sandi, Quinn & Tiffany:
Carry on

Stacy:
Why don't you grow up? Maybe.
Now The Fashion Club is no more
Surely collage waits for you.

Chorus (repeat)
New last line:
Don't you cry, don't you cry NO MORE!!

OWARI (THE END)
