Author:  ACLI

Round 1 DING!:  Lane Basement:  September 1

(Daria stands at the top of the basement stairs looking down at Trent,
Jane, and an unfamiliar looking blond waif.  She peers suspiciously at the
three.  Jane glances up and sees Daria.)
-Jane:  Daria!  (She runs up the stairs and gives Daria a big
snuggly-huggly.  Daria's hands stay limply at her sides.)
-Daria:  Where the hell'd she pick up this habit?*
(Over Jane's shoulder, Daria sees the waif playing with Trent's hair.  She
scowls.)
-Jane:  Ohmigosh!  (Grabs her arm and pulls her down the stairs.)  Daria,
this is D'Arcy.  D'Arcy, Daria, Daria, D'Arcy. (giggles)
-Daria:  Hi
-D'Arcy:  (Grabs Daria's limp hand.)  Hi!  I'm D'Arcy.  How are you?  I
just moved here over the summer.  I hope I don't have too much trouble
fitting in!
-Daria:  (Watching her hand that is still being shook.)  Oh believe me.
You'll do fine.
-D'Arcy:  (Stops shaking Daria's hand.)  I don't know what I would have
done without Jane and Trent this summer!  They tell me you went on a family
trip with your parents and sister for the summer, how was it, I've always
wished I had a sister, I bet its like having a best friend live with you.
But anyway I would have died with boredom without them.
-Daria:  So you and Trent spent a lot of-
-(New York accent from above):  I thought I kept you pretty entertained.
-D'Arcy:  Robbie, you're back!
(A figure descends the stairs**)
-Robbie:  D'Ahcy, I left ten minutes ago.
-D'Arcy:  So you didn't miss me? (pouts)
(Daria zones out in disgust for a couple of minutes)
(During her zone)Robbie:  Well, you're mother was there so I-
-D'Arcy:  Why do you have to keep mentioning that?
-Jane:  What?
-D'Arcy:  He used to have a crush on my mother!
-Robbie:  (Jokingly)  Used to nothing.
(D'Arcy glares at him)
-Jane:  That's disgusting!
-Trent:  Actually, I've seen her mother, and-
(Jane glares at him, disgusted)
-D'Arcy:  Show them your arm!
-Robbie:  (Notably sheepish/embarrassed) No.
-D'Arcy:  Show them!!  (Robbie shakes his head no and D'Arcy kicks him to
the ground.)
-Robbie:  I like this.  I remember last time after you did that we-
(He shuts up after receiving an evil look from D'Arcy.  Daria tunes in to
see D'Arcy sitting on Robbie's chest.)
-D'Arcy:  Take it off and show them!!
(Daria gasps, unsure of what D'Arcy wants him to show, and Robbie looks
over. As he turns his head his hat falls off revealing a bald tattooed
head.  Daria stares.)
-Robbie:  (Sticks out his pierced tongue)  Hey, I'd shake your hand, but
I'm a little detained.
-Daria:  Can't speak, must speak.  Hey.
-D'Arcy:  Show them your arm!
-Robbie:  I can't, D'Ahcy.  You're sittin on it.
-D'Arcy:  I don't care, show 'em anyway!
-Robbie:  D'Ahcy, start thinkin and get offa me!!!
-D'Arcy:  (Sarcastically)  I never thought I'd here you say that. 
-Robbie:  (Shocked)  Me neither (Regains original attitude of
aggressiveness)  Now get offa me!  (D'Arcy obliges and rips Robbie's shirt
off at the same time.)
-Robbie:  (Triumphantly)  Serves you right!  That was your shirt.
-D'Arcy:  No it wasn't.
-Robbie:  (Dejectedly)  I know, but wouldn't it have been ironic if it was?
-Jane:  You have a tattoo?
(A closer look reveals a medium tattoo of the name Julianna.)
-Daria:  (A little overwhelmed by the people the Lanes met while she was
away.)  I better leave, I have to…bye.  (Trent and Jane are too busy
talking and laughing to notice her leave.)

Round 2 DING!:  In Front of the school:  September 2  

(A large group of students are standing around buzzing with chatter.  Daria
is standing alone when Jane runs up to her.)
-Jane:  Ohmigosh!  Daria!  You will not be-(SMACK!)
(Jane looks stunned for a second.  Daria drops her hand shocked that she
has just smacked her best and only friend.)
-Jane:  (Thinks for a minute.)  Have I been acting like that since you've
been back?
-Daria:  (Cautiously) Yes.
-Jane:  Sorry.  I guess D'Arcy's been rubbing off on me.  Anyway what I'm
trying to say is, Mr. O'Neil had a nervous breakdown over the summer.  We
have a new English teacher!
-Daria:  Great.  I'm sure he will enlighten us all.
-Jane:  Oh, Daria (Daria's hand raises to smack her again)  Sorry! Sorry!
-Voice:  Jane!  Daria!  Ohmigosh!  I'm sooo glad I found you guys.  (Daria
looks up to see D'Arcy in a knee length black skirt with a slit way up to
there, a strappy black tank-top, a silver necklace, and also chunky
platform Mary Janes.  Daria looks down at her own usual outfit.)
-Jane:  Hi D'Arcy.
-Daria:  Where's Robbie?
-D'Arcy:  (Gives her a brief evil look as if to say 'Why do you wanna know?
 He's mine!'  She quickly regains her usual sunny disposition.)  He was
right behind me (giggles).  I swear, he couldn't find his way out of a
paper bag.
-(OS)Robbie:  Keep talkin', I'm followin' the sound a' your voice.  (D'Arcy
glances around to see Robbie with his back to her.)
-D'Arcy:  Turn around.  (He does so, putting his arm around D'Arcy, raising
one eyebrow and snapping*** his fingers at Jane and Daria.)
-Robbie:  Hola, chicas!  (He winks at them)
-D'Arcy:  (elbows him)  Do you have to flirt with everyone.
-Robbie:  You know it.  (D'Arcy rolls her eyes and the bell rings.)

Round 3 DING!:  Homeroom

(Daria and Jane sit next to each other in the back.)
-Jane:  The new English teacher covers this homeroom.  It's something King.
 Mr. or Mrs.-I'm not sure.
(A Good looking guy walks in.  He's a spiky haired young looking student.)
-Jane:  Damn.  (Both their mouths are open.)
-Football Jock:  (Haughtily)  This is a sophomore homeroom kid, scram.
(The kid's shoulders slump as he mutters some four-letter words under his
breath.  He approaches the big guy.  The door bursts open.  D'Arcy is
there, wearing a black suit jacket over her ensemble.  (She probably got
called down to the principles and was told to cover up a little.)  All the
guys including the kid stare.)
-D'Arcy:  (Fiercely)  Stop picking on him and sit down!
-Jock:  Yes ma'am.  (Sits and all talking stops.)  Are you the teacher?
-Bimbo Girl:  Yeah, are you Miss King?
-D'Arcy:  (Confused)  No.  Why?  Are you?
-Bimbo:  (Even more confused) No, I do think so.
-Kid:  (Slams his fist onto the teacher's desk.)  I'm Miss King!  I, mean
MR. King!  Actually, it's Jon.
-Bimbo:  That's great kid, now sit down and shut up!  We're trying to
figure out who the teacher is.
-D'Arcy:  (Mockingly)  He is the teacher.
-Jon:  Thank you.  Are you sure you're supposed to be here?  This is a
sophomore homeroom.
-D'Arcy:  I'm actually a senior, but I registered too late, so they shoved
me in here.
(Jon says a silent thank you to the god of schedule making.)
-D'Arcy:  (Looks at Jon with big Doe eyes.)  I'm sorry I was late to class,
Mr. King.
-Daria:  (Mutters) Slut.
-Jane:  She is not a slut.
-Daria:  You saw what she was wearing.  Now she's flirting with the
teacher.  What do you call her?
-Jane:  A friendly person.
-Daria:  (Sarcastically)  Like Quinn?  Just face it she's a slut and a bitch.
-Jane:  If anyone's being a bitch, it's you.
(Jane's fist is flying towards Daria's horrified face. )
-Jon:  What the hell do you think you're doing?! (Jane stops a split second
before her fist makes contact with Daria's face.)
-Jane:  (Puts her hand down.)  Sorry.  (To Jon, not Daria.)
-Jon:  (Sighs) Fine.  (Mutters)  jeez sophomores.
(D'Arcy hears him and gives him a sympathetic look he smiles at her and
Daria can be seen in the back glaring at D'Arcy.)

this story are our original characters and should be explained.  That is
what this cast list is for.

Kate Moss but blonder, filthy, stinking rich, but not at all stuck up,
Daria's rival for Jon's affection and Jane's friendship

teaching genius/hottie, spikey bleached blond hair (normal at school),
tongue ring (not at school), teaches 10th and 12th grade does end up dating
a student, Daria? Or D'Arcy?  "Dirt poor white trash"

with this guy, it works, hot he is hot, very very hot, think of the best
looking guy you know…way hotter, no hair, tatooed head, base-ball cap
wearing, blue-blue-blue eyed…hottie with a tongue ring (sorry a slight
obbsession of ours), words do not do him justice, everyone loves him, with

strongly resembels Jon in an "I'm 20 years older than him" kind of way

well that's none of your damn business.  Brothers:  Twins:  Brendan and
Jeff 20 year old louses,  Johnnycake a 16 year old friend of Robbie's, and
Trent a 9 year old cutie.  All the brothers blend into the woodwork.
