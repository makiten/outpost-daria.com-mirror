<P ALIGN="CENTER">I met her down in Dega Street, the street where Lawndale plays,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And parties all night long and sleeps it off for thirty days.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&quot;Hey, Daria!&quot; I called, and then she turned her head to see.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">She caught my eye, and smiled her gentle smile back at me.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">I hadn’t seen her much since she and Jane had called it quits,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And seeing her like this had made me realize it’s the pits.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">She acted glad to see me, ‘bout as glad as she could show.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">I grinned my grin back at her...and I hoped she didn’t know...</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">We ducked into a coffee shop and took a booth in back.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">We talked and talked for hours, till our ears were out of whack.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The glasses, dress, and jacket were the same she always wore.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">She told me things were fine, she wasn’t rich but wasn’t poor.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">She told me she was studying at college far from town;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">She wouldn’t be in town for long, enough to bring her down.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Her grades were fine, but it was lonely all out on her own.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">She worried about life and all the people that she’d known.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">She’d come back for a visit with her family and friends;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Like always, it was torture, like a class that never ends.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">She’d grown up more than simple time could show or words could tell.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">She’d mellowed---when I knew her, it was always &quot;Go to Hell!&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">I wondered who her &quot;friends&quot; were, having known her from before,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">When the only friend she had was Jane, and others got the door...</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">I told her of my life, while glossing over all the bumps;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">I didn’t want to tell her all the pitfalls and the lumps.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">I told her about Jane’s new life, the little that I knew,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">That Jane, the last I’d heard from her, was feeling down and blue.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">She was in and out of art school, getting started in the city,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And she sold a couple paintings, out of sympathy and pity.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Well, Daria felt sorry, looking sad and very grim.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">I told her not to worry, that Jane was &quot;not&quot; out on a limb.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">We sat and talked in Dega Street, as hours passed us by;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">We caught up with each other over coffee and a pie.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">But some things went unsaid, the things that could’ve made us blush.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">We didn’t talk about our feelings, or about our crush.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">She always kept it to herself and didn’t want to tell.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">I never told her that I knew, or what I felt as well.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Eventually our steam ran out, and we both powered down.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The evening was upon us and our mainsprings had unwound.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">I asked her to come over for a visit if she could</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">She said she had to leave, but if she could’ve come, she would.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">She was leaving in the morning, back to college and the rough---</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">She had to get some sleep because the flight was long and tough.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">We left the coffee shop and said good-bye outside the door.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">She said good-bye and walked away---I knew I wanted more.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Across the street, she turned around, and waved her arm and hand.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">I grinned and waved right back and shouted, &quot;Call me if you can!&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And then she disappeared into the crowd and I was all alone.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">It was back to normal living and the life I’d lived and blown.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">She seemed to understand, she didn’t treat me like I’m dirt.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">I knew how much I’d missed her, but I didn’t know it hurt.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">I had lost my chance to have her---even though it wasn’t fine.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">But my time had come and gone: she had her life---I had mine.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">So I resigned myself to misery---she didn’t have to know.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">That I loved her from afar, and knowing that, I let her go...</P>
