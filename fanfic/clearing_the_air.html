<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Trent Lane sat on the edge of
the couch in the Morgendorffer living room. He couldn't lift his eyes from his
worn shoes to look at the auburn-haired woman sitting across from him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Well... it all worked out for

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Trent had wondered why Jane had
declined the invitation to ride over to <i>Schloss</i> Morgendorffer when Daria
had called... and why his wife Lindy had also refused, saying that she needed
to finish her laundry day chores, especially since Jane had brought a bundle of
clothes with her when she arrived for Thanksgiving vacation from BFAC. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>He wondered for a moment if
they had all planned this out...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Look, it doesn't really even
matter now, right? You're with Michael, and that's a really nice ring, and I'm
with Lindy. We've both moved on."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria brushed her hair back,
and took a short breath. Silently, she counted to twenty-five before she
trusted herself to speak.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Trent. You're my friend. I
care about you, and you're right &ndash; we both have moved on." She fixed him
solidly in that soul-searing, trademarked glare that a host of young men
throughout Lawndale had learned to avoid, and Trent felt himself instinctively
drawing back, away from the young woman several inches and a good thirty to
forty pounds lighter than him... drawing away as if she could cause physical harm
with a glance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1 style='margin-right:162.3pt'>In a way, she always could. That's partly why
I never...</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Does the word 'coward' ring a

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Shut up."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Trent blinked hard at the
precise, clipped and yet bland tone of the woman's voice. "I'm glad that you
and Lindy are together and happy. I'll never begrudge you that."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria leaned forward. "What
pisses me off &ndash; and what we're going to talk about now, just this once, so that
we can finish it off and never speak of it again &ndash; is the way you treated me. "</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"What did I do to you?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Rather than recall Jules from <i>Pulp
Fiction</i> and his question to that geeky kid from <i>Career Opportunities</i>,
I'll just say this: Don't do that, Trent."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The way Trent's gaze dove for
the shag carpeting confirmed that he understood her meaning. "Yeah."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Silence flowed through the room
for a moment. "You did the exact same thing that Tom did, do you know that? The
same thing that Michael almost did, too."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Excuse me...?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"You made choices for me.
Whether they would have been good or bad choices, at least they would have been
<u>my</u> choices to make. My memories. My experiences. You took that away from
me."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Daria, I think you're making a
little too much over my not finishing up a thirty-second piece of music-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"That you could have done in an
afternoon, max. You did that just so I would be angry at you, and then we could
have that little talk at Pizza King, remember?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Trent nodded. "I've thought
about that on occasion," Daria continued. "I had a little talk with Quinn one
day &ndash; the day after you first met Lindy, I believe. I remember mentioning to
Quinn that you have a habit of forgetting things."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I've gotten better."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I hope so. That's not my
concern anymore, though. That's what you did when you didn't come through with
that music. You did that to get me mad so I wouldn't want to think about you
'in that way', and make a clean break." She gave him another glare, this one
freezing him like a jet of liquid oxygen. "You forgot that the music was for a
grade &ndash; your sister's as well as mine. She needed that grade. You were thinking
about how this would affect you and you alone."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I was thinking about you-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"When you kissed me on the
cheek, I didn't show it &ndash; but I would have given anything for a two-by-four at
that moment to smash your head in. If I were a female dragon, I would have
roasted you alive."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Wha-?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"You were blowing me off. Don't
put any noble aspirations behind it. You were a coward who was too afraid to
show me anything even remotely what you've shown any of the girls you've dated
&ndash; and it would be really easy for me to call them all 'skanks' or 'sluts',
because that would free you up, wouldn't it? You didn't want to even give me a
decent goodbye kiss because 'you wouldn't want to treat me like all of those
other girls. I'm special, and you couldn't see treating me like that. I meant
too much to you for that."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria took a breath. "Who the
hell told you that I wanted you to put me up on a pedestal? No one. You put me
there because that way and made it so that I was oh, so much more than a girl
who you could date &ndash; and that way, you didn't have to try. You didn't have to
try to treat me like an actual <i>girl</i> and not 'Daria', or try and be more
than you were back then; you didn't have to have someone who looked at you in a
way that would have made you feel guilty, because you knew you'd want to better
yourself for her. The problem is, you didn't want to better yourself &ndash; or,
rather, that <i>you didn't want to better yourself for <u>me</u></i>."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Trent couldn't lift his gaze
from the floor. "Even worse &ndash; in a way, you nearly cost me and Jane our
friendship. "If we'd have had something, anything even if it had been just one
little date &ndash; a movie, stale popcorn, going Dutch on pizza and you getting
chased off by my Dad because he THOUGHT that you might have tried to kiss me
goodnight... it would have been something that Jane and I could have shared. That
way, the whole Tom thing... I won't say that it wouldn't have happened, but then...
who knows? Maybe... maybe not. It also annoys that you knew so much about how
Tom, Jane and I felt back then, but you couldn't tell how you turning away from
me would make me feel."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria stood up. "I remember
when Prom came around. There was this green dress I saw online, and..." Her face
tightened, and Trent realized that this was the most emotion he'd ever seen in
Daria in all of the time he'd known her. <i>I thought that Jane said that she
and that Tom guy didn't want to go to their Senior Prom... Oh. <u>He</u> didn't
want to go - and she was too proud to ask...<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The moment passed. "I don't
appreciate it when others make choices for me that can affect my life. I'm not
going to allow anyone to do that to me ever again. Do a favor for me, will you,
Trent? Think of Lindy, and Jane, and any little girls you may have someday... and
don't make all of their choices for them. They'll still love you... but a part of
them will always resent you."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>They were both quiet for a few
moments; Trent took that as his cue to leave. "I don't hold a grudge, Trent...
that was just something I had to... I needed to say. After you leave... the next
time we see each other... this conversation never happened."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Trent nodded. He started for
the door, but turned back. "Daria, I-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"If you let the words 'I'm
sorry' come from your mouth, I'll take one of my father's golf clubs and beat
you until my hands go numb." She shrugged, as Trent's eyes grew wide.
"Lingering feelings of anger, resentment, jealousy... and even puppy love. Guess
what, Trent Lane?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria fixed him with her
trademark 'Mona Lisa' smile. "I am a regular girl, after all."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Trent looked at Daria for a
long moment, and then walked towards her with a deliberation that Daria had
never seen before from him. "Yeah. You want to be a regular woman. Okay. Let's
do that."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>He stopped directly in front of
her. "Whatever else I've done, you don't have the right to talk down to me like
that. Respect goes both ways &ndash; and even if I've done you wrong, you don't get
to say things like that."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>He locked eyes with her; to
Daria's credit, she didn't flinch from the look of slight anger and
disappointment he seared her to the floor with. "Something else. You're right &ndash;
those were your choices and decisions... but you know that a lot of us don't make
the right decisions, and it scars us and everyone else. You KNOW what would
have happened if we'd have started something. Go on. Say it. What would have
happened?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I don't know."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Yes, you do. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria had no idea how Trent had
moved so suddenly, or how everything inside her suddenly felt as though it
would melt away, but her lips were pressed gently against Trent's; softly at
first, then harder, more insistent, more demanding, hungrier...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>She would not &ndash; could not &ndash; let
go.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Trent managed to pull away,
flushed and anxious, his arousal more than evident as he tried to compose
himself, while Daria eased herself down upon the couch, and began to button
back her opened blouse. "That's why."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>This is dedicated to Voice of
My, a 'Daria' writer who passed away. I read one of her shipper works where, in
the forward, she says that she doesn't like D/T shipper fics, so she decided to
write one. Consider this 'the last D/T shipper.'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>As you can also tell, this
takes place in the <i>Falling Into College </i>universe. I just thought that it
would be a good place for Daria, even though both she and Trent have moved on
and are happy, to finally clear the air on that one little issue. I always felt
that Trent got away with murder (so to speak) through the episodes <i>Lane
Miserables</i> and <i>Jane's Addition </i>(and that he had a lot on nerve for
stepping up to talk to Daria in <i>Fire!</i>). If Darren Appleton or Darius
Morgendorffer were around, they'd kick his ass for the way Trent played with
her head and then blew her off... he knew that she had a thing for him. </p>
