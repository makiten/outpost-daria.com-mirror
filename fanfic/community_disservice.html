<P>NOTES:
<P> This is a fifth-season story, taking place before "Fizz Ed" (October, to be precise).  For those who have read it, it also takes place just after my story "Is Summer Over Already?" but for the most part the goings-on in that fic won’t be referred to in this one, so there’s no need to worry about reading that one first (I do ask you to read it just for the sake of doing so, however).  I prefer each of my stories to stand alone.
<P>However, readers may understand some of the references better if they’ve seen the following episodes:
<P>"The Old and the Beautiful"
<P>"Speedtrapped"
<P>"Is It Fall Yet?"

<P>INT:  O’Neill’s classroom
<I><P>Mr. O’Neill is "teaching" while the students show their usual bored indifference.  Daria and Jane sit near the front.



</I><P>O’Neill: Before we get started on "A Tale of Two Cities" I wanted to ask the class about some of our feelings upon completing "Wuthering Heights".  I know it was a very… <I>emotional</I> tale, and some of our more sensitive students might have come away from it feeling a bit… shall we say, disturbed.
<P>Daria: <I>(to Jane)</I> "Disturbed."  Yes, I think that describes some of us very well.
<P>O’Neill: Jane!
<P>Jane: What the hell did I do?
<P>O’Neill: You’re an artist, Jane, and so you must be very in touch with your deepest emotions.  How did this book make you feel?
<P>Jane: I’d have to go with… sleepy.
<P>O’Neill: Huh?
<P>Jane: (sighs)   I don’t know, Mr. O’Neill… I just couldn’t identify with the lead character.  I found it really hard to put myself in that kind of position, and really relate to the story.  It’s… kind of troubling, really.
<P>O’Neill: Oh, that’s a shame.  I’ll leave you to sort out your inner turmoil.  Anyone else?
<P>Daria: <I>(whispers)</I>  Nice save.
<P>Jane: You don’t go through self-esteem class seven times with this guy without learning what the right things to say are.
<P>O’Neill: Moving along – Heathcliffe is often described as a Byronic Hero.  Kevin, what do you think this means?
<P>Kevin: Whoa, you mean he had a mechanical arm or something?  Man, now I wish I’d read the book!
<P>Jane: You know, he can actually be kind of entertaining to watch, in a monkey-at-the-zoo kind of way.



<P>Daria: Unfortunately, there’s a drawback.



<P>Jane: What?
<P>O’Neill: Daria, what are your thoughts on Wuthering Heights?
<P>Daria: <I>(to Jane)</I> That.
<I><P>Before Daria can speak, Ms. Li barges into the classroom.
</I><P>Jane: Saved!
<P>Daria: Guess again.
<P>Ms. Li: Students, I have wonderful news!
<P>Jane: <I>(aside)</I>  Ooch, this can’t be good.
<P>Ms. Li: In cooperation with many different worthwhile organizations here in Laaawndale, your school has embarked upon an innovative and forward-thinking new program that, I am sure, will inspire our students to maximize their potential as citizens and as human beings.
<P>Daria: <I>(aside)</I>  She’s been reading that list of power words again.
<P>Jane: <I>(aside)</I>  How intriguing and progressive of her.
<P>Ms. Li: This program will be called "Laaawndale Outreach!"  It will be a chance for you young people to bond with your community, by performing various acts of community service throughout this, er, community.
<P>Daria: <I>(aside)  </I>I’m feeling more communal all the time.
<P>Jane: <I>(aside)</I>  <I>Da</I>, comrade.
<P>Ms. Li: Furthermore, the state is offering a grant to the school which shows the most dedication to the service of its community.
<P>Daria: <I>(aside)</I>  Ah.  Funds.  This all makes sense now.
<P>Ms. Li: So, today after class, students will be asked to come down to the main office and sign up for a community service assignment. 
<P>Daria: <I>(aloud)</I>  "Asked" as in "Compelled"?
<P>Ms. Li: Let’s have none of your backtalk, Miss Morgendorffer!  Of course, participation is strictly voluntary, except in select cases where students do not choose to volunteer.  However I fail to see why any student would choose not to participate in this wonderful program, which is sure to teach valuable skills to the students of Laaawndale High, foster bonding with the city of Laaawndale, and give pride to the citizens of Laaawndale.
<P>Daria: <I>(aside)</I>  If she says "Laaawndale" one more time, I’ll gnaw my own leg off.
<P>Jane: <I>(aside)</I>  Save me a drumstick?
<P>Ms. Li: In addition, students involved in the program will receive Participation Credit, without which you cannot graduate.
<P>Daria: Excuse me?  What the hell is "Participation Credit?"
<P>Ms. Li: It was all explained in the School Review Meeting held last Sunday.  Handouts were given to attendees.
<P>Jane: Both of them?
<P>Ms. Li: Here at Laaawndale High, we recognize the need for students to experience the, quote, "Real World."
<P>Jane: I don’t get cable at my house.
<P>Ms. Li: I should think you would all be thrilled to be presented with such an opportunity to help others in your town.
<P>Daria: As a former participant in "Awareness of Others Week", I suggest that I’ve done my part and it’s time to pass the torch to the underclassmen.
<P>Ms. Li: <I>(ignoring her)</I> Remember!  Sign up today at three o’clock!  Carry on, Mr. O’Neill.  <I>(exits)
</I><P>O’Neill: Well!  What an exciting opportunity!  I hope that you all take advantage of it and learn one of life’s most valuable lessons:  that great feeling you get when you give of yourself.
<P>Daria: We learned all about that in Health class last year.



<P>Mr. O’Neill goes red with embarrassment.  Fortunately for him the bell rings.  Everyone grabs up their books and makes for the door.



<P>Daria: Come on, let’s get to that sign-up sheet.
<P>Jane: Quite the little joiner, aren’t we?



<P>Daria: Remember what happened last time?



<P>Jane: <I>(getting up quickly)</I> I rather enjoyed it myself, but for your sake, let’s move.

<I><P>Sandi and Stacy are leaving class together.
</I><P>Sandi: I can’t <U>believe</U> this.  The Fashion Club is a community service in and of itself.  We should be exempt from this kind of thing.
<P>Stacy: You are so right Sandi!
<P>Sandi: Of course I am.  Someday, they’ll see that.
<P>Stacy: Uh-oh.  There’s a bunch of people going for the sign-up sheet.  Shouldn’t we hurry?
<P>Sandi: I’ll tell you what, Stacy.  Why don’t you run in there and sign us both up for something?  There’s no reason we both have to scramble through that crowd.
<P>Stacy: Oh… but, Sandi, I don’t think I should pick for you, I mean, what if I pick the wrong thing?
<P>Sandi: I have complete confidence in you, Stacy.  Besides, as <B>P</B>resident of the <B>F</B>ashion <B>C</B>lub, it is my duty to delegate responsibility.  Go now, quickly!
<P>Stacy: Ohhh!  I bet I get all sweaty!  <I>(Stacy takes a deep breath, holds it, and plunges into the crowd that’s rapidly forming around the sign-up lists)
</I><P>Sandi: And don’t sign up for clothes donation!  <I>(shudders)</I>  Never again…

<P>Tiffany: You’re sooo smart, Quinn…
<P>Quinn: But I’m not like, you know, a brain or anything!
<P>Tiffany: Of course not…
<P>Quinn: All right, so I’m trying harder and getting better grades and stuff, but I’m still the same Quinn!
<P>Tiffany: There’s a different girl named Quinn?  Where?
<P>Quinn: Look, I’ll prove it to you!  <I>(she spots the three J’s)</I>  Joey?  Jeffy?  Simon?
<P>Joey: Hi Quinn!
<P>Jeffy: Hey, Quinn!
<P>Jamie: <I>(whiny)</I> Quinn!  That wasn’t even close!
<P>Quinn: Sure, Johnny.  Listen, could you guys do me a favor?  I can’t get to the sign-up sheet because there are too many people in the way.
<P>Joey: I’ll get ‘em out of the way!
<P>Jeffy: I’d move mountains for you, Quinn!
<P>Jamie: Life sucks.  <I>(Quinn bats her eyelashes at him)</I>  Whatever you want, Quinn!



<I><P>The three J’s plow forcefully into the crowd, leaving a hole in their wake and getting a lot of people very angry. 



</I><P>Quinn: You guys are the best! <I> (she strides into the gap left behind by the J’s and makes her way straight to the sign-up sheet)</I>  Let’s see here… parks and recreation maintenance, not!  Serving food to the homeless… yeah, right.  Clothes donation drive – oh God, never again!  Reading to day-care students… ick.  Here we go!  Animal Shelter Volunteer!  All those cute little puppies and kitties need me… hey Tiffany, I found a good one!



<I><P>Quinn signs her name and Tiffany’s to the list, then moves back out of the crowd, which crushes behind her as the three J’s lose their footing and are practically trampled.

<P>CUT TO:  Jane and Daria, arriving on the scene.
<P>Jane: Did you ever want to see what would really happen if you went into a crowded room and yelled "Fire!"
<P>Daria: Tempting… but I suggest we use more subtle methods.  Just follow my lead.
<P>Jane: I leave it in your capable hands.
<I><P>Daria leads Jane into the crowd
</I><P>Daria: <I>(loudly)</I> Say, Jane, isn’t this where they’re having the signups for the ballet team?
<P>Assorted Football Players: WHAT??  <I>(they run for it)
</I><P>Jane: No, I’m pretty sure that this is the Chess Team tryouts!
<P>Several Other Students: NO WAY!!  <I>(more students run for it)
</I><P>Daria: Wait, I’ve got it!  This is the line for summer school!
<I><P>Many more students stampede out of the way.
</I><P>Daria: That thinned the herd a bit.  Let’s go.
<P>Jane: I’m lost in admiration.
<I><P>They move forward to sign up.
</I><P>Daria: (looking over the sheet)  Hm.
<P>Jane: Not much to choose from.  Ballet team might have been preferable.  Wait, here’s a good one!  (she signs her name)
<P>Daria: What is it?
<P>Jane: Graffiti removal!  Closest thing to painting they’ve got.  Unfortunately, there’s only one opening left.
<P>Daria: I’m heartbroken.  <I>(sigh) </I>Let’s face it, there’s nothing actually appealing here.  <I>(she signs her name)
</I><P>Jane: <I>(looking over)</I>  What did you pick?
<P>Daria: I’ll tell you later.  The crowd’s coming back, I suggest we make a hasty exit.

</I><P>Trent: Hey, Jane.  Hey, Daria.  What’s going on?
<P>Daria: The usual zaniness.
<P>Trent: Where’s Tom today?
<P>Daria: He’s out of town for a while.  His parents are making him check out a few Ivy-league colleges.  Judging by his experiences, I can thank my lucky stars that my parents can’t afford to fly me around the country doing the same thing.
<P>Jane: Yeah, lucky you.  You get to go to Middleton.
<P>Daria: And on that day, Satan will be going to work in a snow plow.



<I><P>Jane picks up a paper in front of her and glances over it.



</I><P>Trent: What’s that?  You doing homework or something?
<P>Jane: Trent, how long have we known each other?
<P>Daria: It’s Ms. Li’s latest scheme.  We’re all doing community service projects.  Ms. Li provides a free source of slave labor, in return for which she gets kickbacks.
<P>Trent: Whoa.  Ever see the Shawshank Redemption?
<P>Daria: There’s a difference here.  In prison, there’s a chance to escape.
<P>Jane: I signed up for graffiti removal.  This is a list of some of the more defaced areas of town.  I picked it up on the way over here.
<P>Trent: Cool.  What did you get, Daria?
<P>Daria: I’m assisting at an elementary school for gifted and talented kids.
<P>Jane: What do they need tutoring for, if they’re so damn smart?
<P>Daria: The way I see it, if that’s the case, I get off easy.  And if not, I get to mold the minds of our future leaders.  It’s a win-win situation.
<P>Jane: Daria, when will you learn?  Since when did you have a win-win situation that worked to your advantage in the end?
<I><P>Silence.
</I><P>Jane: While you’re thinking about that, could we get some pizza?  I need some Canadian bacon.

<P>INT:  Cranberry Commons, Food Court
<I><P>Quinn and Tiffany are sitting together over salads and tiny sodas.
</I><P>Quinn: So then I said, Look lady, if you’re all out of salmon pink lip gloss, don’t think for a moment that you can get me to buy <U>melon</U> pink lip gloss and think it’s the same thing, because not only do I have a flawless color sense but I was <U>not</U> born yesterday and I’m not going to be taken in by your fast sales talk, and she just had <U>nothing</U> to say to that so I turned on my heel and walked straight out of there.
<P>Tiffany: Wow, Quinn, you really –
<P>Quinn: So then I just went over to Blushes and Brushes and they had just gotten a <U>whole new box</U> of salmon pink lip gloss and that glittery eyeshadow right off the truck that morning so I was the <U>first</U> one to dip into the box, but I only got a half-dozen of each because who knows what I’d do with it next month when everything points to darker reds coming back in.
<P>Tiffany: Really, that’s –
<P>Quinn: Anyway, I’m so glad that we’re going in together on this project because it’s going to be <U>so</U> great helping all those cute little animals find homes and besides, I really like talking to you, Tiffany.
<P>Tiffany: Sure, Quinn.  <I>(sees Sandi and Stacy approaching, and looks happy and relieved)</I>  Hey, guys!  It’s really great to see you…
<P>Stacy: <I>(ignoring Tiffany)</I>  I’m really sorry, Sandi!  I’m really, really, really, <B>really</B> sorry!
<P>Sandi: For the last time, Stacy, just let it go!
<P>Quinn: What happened?
<P>Stacy: It’s like this –
<P>Sandi: <I>(interrupting)</I> Stacy signed us both up to assist in the annual quilting bee at the Better Days Nursing Home.
<P>Stacy: <I>(crying)</I>  It said there would be fabric samples!  Fabric samples, Sandi!
<P>Quinn: Oh, Sandi, that’s a shame.  But look on the bright side!  You’ll learn so much about sewing, maybe you can make your own outfits instead of having to go to Cashman’s all the time!  <I>(smirks)
</I><P>Sandi: <I>(scowling)</I>  And what, if I may ask, is your contribution to the community this year?
<P>Quinn: Oh, Tiffany and I are volunteering at the animal shelter!  We’re going to help all those adorable little animals find a home.
<P>Stacy: <I>(stops crying)</I> Really?  That’s so nice, Quinn!
<P>Sandi: Too bad we’ll be sewing quilts all day.  Think of all the animals that won’t ever find homes because we won’t be there to help them.



<I><P>With a loud bawl, Stacy resumes crying.  Quinn and Tiffany glare at Sandi, who glares back for a moment.  Then she notices that a number of other people, some of them Lawndale students, who have taken note of Stacy’s distress, also glaring at her.  Realizing that she may have gone too far, she gets a slightly ashamed look on her face.



</I><P>Quinn: <I>(getting up) </I>Come on, Stacy.  Let’s go to the bathroom and fix your makeup.  We can’t have people seeing a member of the club go all to pieces.
<P>Stacy: <I>(blubbering)</I>  It s-said there would be f-fabric, Quinn.
<P>Quinn: There, there now… it’ll be all right.
<I><P>Tiffany and Sandi sit in awkward silence for a bit.
</I><P>Tiffany: Um… I need another soda.  <I>(she leaves)



<P>Sandi watches her go, and then slumps onto the table, her chin resting on her hand.  Glancing around, she sees the crowd mostly going back to their business.  She also notices Jodie, who focuses back down at a newspaper just after Sandi notices her disapproving look.



</I><P>Sandi: What are you looking at?
<P>Jodie: <I>(not looking up)</I> Do you really want to know?
<P>Sandi: <I>(getting riled up)</I> Hey, how I handle Stacy is none of your business!
<P>Jodie: I didn’t say anything.
<P>Sandi: Go on, tell me what you really think.  That I’m a cast-iron bitch who treats her friends like dirt.
<P>Jodie: <I>(finally looking up, and getting ready to leave)</I> Sounds like I don’t need to tell you.  <I>(she exits)
<P>Sandi looks like she’s about to say something, then collapses with an air of defeat.

<P>Quinn: So, what happened to Sandi?
<P>Tiffany: She just left…
<P>Quinn: That’s weird.  Anyway, it’s probably just as well, I think Stacy would have started crying again as soon as she saw her.  So, what do you think we should wear to the animal shelter?
<P>Tiffany: Hmm… that’s hard, you know?  I mean, we don’t know what colors the animals will be…

<P>Quinn: Sure, Sandi.  These things happen.
<P>Sandi: Um, Quinn?  You don’t think I was too hard on Stacy, do you?
<P>Quinn: Um… well… Stacy’s just so <U>tenderhearted</U>, you know?
<P>Sandi: I wouldn’t want her to feel too bad about the whole quilting thing.  I mean, it was just a misunderstanding.
<P>Quinn: Yeah, well, she feels really bad about it.
<P>Sandi: Uh, yeah.  Well, I should go now.
<P>Quinn: Sure, Sandi.
<P>Sandi: I’ll see you tomorrow. <I>(hangs up)

<P>Daria: If you’re finally off the phone, I want to call Tom.
<P>Quinn: Daria, wait.
<P>Daria: <I>(sigh)</I> Yes, Quinn?
<P>Quinn: Did you ever know someone that you’d been hanging around with for a while, and although you knew she had a bit of an attitude at first, you thought you could live with it, and after a while it just got worse until you begin to wonder why you stay around because she just gets on your nerves?
<P>Daria: Actually, I feel that way right now.
<P>Quinn: Fine, just go call your little boyfriend!  <I>(chucks smiley pillow at Daria and misses)
</I><P>Daria: Quinn, if Sandi’s getting on your case, just tell her off.  You’re smarter than she is, you should be able to take her on in any verbal volleyball match.
<P>Quinn: It’s not me, Daria.  It’s Stacy!  I feel so bad about how Sandi treats her!
<P>Daria: If Stacy’s decided to be a doormat, there’s nothing you can do for her.  She has to figure it out for herself.  Just make sure you’re there for her if you want her to have someone to turn to when she needs it.  <I>(she leaves)
</I><P>Quinn: <I>(sighs)</I>  Thanks Daria.



<I><P>Quinn turns to the wall, deep in thought, until she’s startled by the smiley pillow hitting her gently in the back.  She starts to get mad, then realizes Daria didn’t throw it very hard, and smirks a bit before going back to her brooding.

<P>INT:  Classroom
<I><P>Daria walks into the classroom, and stops in the doorway.
</I><P>Daria: Ah.  The ninth circle of Hell.



<I><P>The classroom is, in a word, untidy.  The usual student desks and molded plastic chairs are present, but strewn about in a way that suggests that they were dropped from a great height and let scatter where they may.  The walls are decorated with what is probably student art, and it makes Jane’s stuff look tame by comparison.  In addition, there are a number of animal cages with the tops off, and only about half of them still have the animals inside.  The kids are engaged in various activities, including creating more hideous works of "art", playing with the animals, reading, writing, pulled into discussion groups, etc.  There are about thirty of them and two adults, one of whom perks up and notices Daria.
</I><P>Teacher: Oh, you must be Daria!



<P>Daria: I suppose it would be pointless to deny it at this stage.
<P>Teacher: Please, come in.  I’m Marge, and I’m one of the coordinators of the Blue group.
<P>Daria: Good.  I’m feeling a little blue about this myself.  <I>(a minor explosion from a nearby chemistry kit makes her jump)</I>  What’s going on, is this recess or something?
<P>Marge: Oh no, we don’t artificially structure the day in this facility.  Our children are permitted to learn when they choose, teach when they choose, and recreate when they choose.
<P>Daria: Does that mean I can go home when I choose?
<P>Marge: <I>(not paying attention)</I>  In this way, each learns at her or his own pace and at those times best suited to themselves.  Come, let me introduce you to the people you’ll be sharing your time with.  This is Gordon, he is the other Blue coordinator.
<P>Gordon: Hello, Daria.  It’s wonderful that you could be here with us.  Perhaps you could join our discussion of the cultural mores during the Wan-Chu Dynasty once you get settled.
<P>Daria: <I>(looks at the kindergarten-aged kids involved in the discussion)</I> That’s a little unsettling right there, actually.
<P>Marge: Oh, and this is Lester, one of our promising young poets.
<I><P>Lester’s about six years old.
</I><P>Daria: Hey, Lester.
<P>Lester: I sense the weight of personal regret heavy on your bosom.
<P>Daria: Excuse me?



<P>Marge: Oh, and this is Elaine.
<I><P>Elaine (a twelve-year old girl) twirls over to Daria, makes a graceful curtsey, then spins on her toes in the other direction, letting her long hair drape over Daria’s shoulder as she does so.



</I><P>Marge: Elaine is experimenting with communicating through interpretive dance.  She just said how nice it was to meet you, and she hopes you’ll become good friends.
<P>Daria: How does she dance to people she doesn’t like?
<P>Marge: You’ll have a chance to meet everyone as time goes on, of course, but it’s best that they introduce themselves in their own time.
<P>Daria: As long as no one is communicating through the use of blunt objects, I think I can handle that.
<P>Marge: Wonderful!  I’m going to leave you to find your own potential as Coordinating Assistant.  Feel free to join any of the discussions you see, or facilitate learning and growth wherever you can lend a hand.
<P>Daria: Can’t wait.



<I><P>Marge goes back to her group of students.  Daria stands in the middle of the room for a bit, looking at the scene around her with deadpan eyes.  There’s a tug on her sleeve.  Daria looks down to see a little girl holding a large white rat.

<P>Floyd: No, and we didn’t take pictures of the landfill before the Director of Public Works built his house on it, either.  Just cover it up.
<P>Jane: Yeah, but this is really cool.  Look at this design.  And this was all done with spraypaint?
<P>Floyd: It’s graffiti.  Get rid of it.
<P>Jane: It’s art.  I can’t just destroy it!
<P>Floyd: Hey, if you want to be an art critic, do it on your own time.
<P>Jane: You don’t get it, do you?
<P>Floyd: Look, you can paint it white, or I’ll get someone else to do it.  It’s no skin off my back.
<P>Jane: Go find someone else, then.  <I>(she drops the roller and paint bucket and stalks off)

<P>Quinn: Where are the cute animals?
<P>Mr. Clay: Over here is the vet’s office.  We have trained people to take care of the sick animals, so you won’t have to deal with that much.  Over there is where we keep the cats.
<P>Tiffany: Kitties… cool…
<P>Mr. Clay: They generally get fed twice a day, but they won’t usually eat everything in front of them all at once.  Litterboxes should be changed once a day.
<P>Tiffany: Why would you keep a box of trash in there with them?
<P>Mr. Clay: <I>(ignoring Tiffany)</I>  Moving right along, here’s the smaller adult dogs, anything under twenty pounds.  The puppies are in a different room.

</I><P>Sandi: Hello, I’m Sandi Griffin, this is Stacy Rowe.  We’re here to volunteer.
<P>Nurse: Not for reading, I hope?  Not to be rude, but our residents are very picky about the tone of voice that our readers have…
<P>Sandi: <I>(frowns)</I> Exactly what is the matter with my voice?
<P>Stacy: <I>(small voice)</I> We’re here for quilting…
<P>Nurse: Oh, wonderful!  Come right this way.  You wouldn’t believe how hard it is to get young people interested in the art of quilting.
<P>Sandi: <I>(glances at Stacy)</I> I’m, um, sure it’s fascinating.
<P>Stacy: I didn’t mean to, Sandi!
<P>Sandi: It’s <U>all</U> <U>right</U>, Stacy!  You don’t need to apologize any more, we’re just going to make the best of it!
<P>Stacy: It said <I>(sniff)</I> there would be fabric samples…
<I><P>Sandi sighs with exasperation as they round a corner into the sewing room.
</I><P>Nurse: Do either of you have sewing experience?
<P>Stacy: I have some… I mean, I can sew a button and stuff…
<P>Sandi: <I>(hopefully)</I> Out of curiosity, what if we don’t?
<P>Nurse: Oh, our residents would be happy to teach you, of course!  Now, Sandi, this is Mrs. Peabody, you’ll be working mostly with her.
<P>Mrs. Peabody: Margaret?  Is that you, dear?
<P>Nurse: No, Mrs. Peabody, Margaret isn’t here.  <I>(aside to Sandi)</I> Mrs. Peabody always wanted a daughter, but she had eight boys instead.  This week, she’s been asking for her nonexistent daughter named Margaret.  Don’t be concerned if she wants you to call her "Mother".
<P>Sandi: Umm…
<P>Nurse: Stacy, over here is Ms. Chaney.
<P>Stacy: Hi.
<P>Ms. Chaney: Well, aren’t you a pretty little thing?
<P>Stacy: <I>(shy smile)</I> Um, thanks.
<P>Ms. Chaney: Oh, but I’m being such a silly old woman, I’ll bet you hear that all the time from the boys in school.  You don’t need to hear it from me too.
<P>Stacy: <I>(blushing)</I> That’s really nice of you to say, Ms. Chaney…
<P>Ms. Chaney: Please dear, call me Janice.  If we’re going to be working together, we should be friendly with each other, don’t you think so?
<P>Stacy: Well, if you say so Ms Chan– Janice.  <I>(she giggles)
</I><P>Ms. Chaney: Well dear, let’s get right to work.  I’m not getting any younger, and we need to finish this quilt before I head down the tunnel of light.  I imagine that you have an excellent color sense, I can tell by your clothes.
<I><P>Stacy blushes and smiles, unused to so many compliments.
<P>Sandi, in the meantime, is speaking with Mrs. Peabody.
</I><P>Sandi: So, do you have, like, fabric samples or something that we’re supposed to be looking at?
<P>Mrs. Peabody: Do you know that you have your father’s nose, Margaret?
<P>Sandi: I’m Sandi, Mrs. Peabody.
<P>Mrs. Peabody: <I>(a bit surprised)</I>  Oh!  Forgive me, dearie, these eyes aren’t what they used to be.
<P>Sandi: It’s quite all right.

<P>Leon: Yes?
<P>Kevin: What are all these cars doing on our highway?
<P>Leon: <I>(Looks at Kevin as if he’s a moron)</I> Well, I’ll tell you.  A few years back, someone realized that driving on the highway was a lot less bumpy than driving on plain dirt, and the idea caught on.  Any more stupid questions?
<P>Kevin: No, I mean, isn’t the highway, like, ours?  I mean, we adopted it, right?
<P>Leon: Huh?
<P>Upchuck: Don’t bother, he’s dumber than the pavement he’s standing on.
<P>Kevin: Hey!
<P>Leon: Whatever.  Just pick up the trash and watch out for traffic, we’ve got enough roadkill around here.  <I>(He gets in his pickup and drive off)</I>.
<P>Kevin: <I>(to Upchuck)</I> Dude!  That was like, really uncool!
<P>Upchuck: Don’t you know what "Adopt-A-Highway" even means?  It means we pick up trash and that’s it!  What kind of idiot signs up for this in the first place?
<P>Kevin: Hey, maybe I’m not a straight C student like some people, but I know my rights!  This highway is mine now!
<P>Upchuck: Whatever.
<P>Kevin: Hey, besides, if you’re so smart, what are you doing here?

<I><P>Daria and Jane sit at a table, picking at their food, not eating it.
</I><P>Jane: Shouldn’t we be talking about how our volunteering went, or something?
<P>Daria: Sucked.
<P>Jane: Ditto.
<I><P>Silence.
</I><P>Jane: So, why did yours suck so much?
<P>Daria: It’s like an entire room full of Guptys.
<P>Jane: Ooch.  Bummer.
<P>Daria: They throw these kids together into this classroom with absolutely no boundaries whatsoever.  I mean, I’m all for defying authority, but when there’s no authority to defy, it kind of messes everything up, you know?  Am I making sense?
<P>Jane: Not really.  Actually, it kind of sounds like growing up in my house.
<P>Daria: So, what sucks about your gig?
<P>Jane: They want me to paint over graffiti.
<I><P>Pause.
</I><P>Daria: <I>(motions for more with one hand)</I> And…
<P>Jane: I don’t want to.
<P>Daria: Jane, forgive me if I seem obtuse, but what did you think "Graffiti Removal" actually meant?  Did you think they would move the vandalized walls brick by brick to a museum and then rebuild them?
<P>Jane: Yeah, I know, but I figured it would be a bunch of meaningless squiggles and hearts with "Kevin Luvs Brittany" misspelled in them.  Some of this stuff is real, genuine art.  Just because it’s on a wall in spraypaint instead of on a canvas with oils, they call it vandalism. 
<P>Daria: The nerve of some people.
<P>Jane: You don’t understand, Daria.  Being raised by bohemians has taught me some important things:  don’t eat anything that moves; ask for I.D. when presented with so-called long lost relatives; never let anyone into the house who’s wearing a suit and tie; and, above all, respect art in all its forms.  The images on these walls may be made by hoodlums with spraypaint, but they’re talented hoodlums with spraypaint who, like it or not, added some much-needed character to our little burg.  I’ve spent my life creating art.  I can’t just destroy it.
<P>Daria: Jane, have you considered the consequences of failing to deliver on one of Ms. Li’s pet projects during your senior year?
<P>Jane: I can take it.
<P>Daria: Can you take being in the same class as Quinn and her friends?
<I><P>Jane shrugs.
</I><P>Daria: Another year of Mr. DiMartino?
<I><P>Jane looks doubtful.
</I><P>Daria: Kevin and Brittany are probably going to flunk too, you know.
<P>Jane: <I>(shudders)</I> That wall will be white by next Tuesday.
<P>Daria: Atta girl.
<I><P>Jodie approaches.
</I><P>Jodie: Hey guys, mind if I sit here?
<P>Daria: Before you say anything, be aware that we each already have one more extra-curricular than we’d ordinarily deem prudent.
<P>Jodie: <I>(a little miffed)</I>  Look, Mack’s sitting with his football buddies.  I just want a change of company for a bit.
<P>Jane: Forgive my blunt friend.  Have a seat.
<P>Jodie: Thanks.
<P>Daria: Sorry, Jodie.
<P>Jodie: <I>(shrugs)</I> Eh.  No big deal.  So, how are things going with you two?
<P>Daria and Jane: Sucks.
<P>Jodie: Really?  That’s too bad.  What are you doing for your volunteer project?
<P>Jane: Reverse vandalism.
<P>Daria: Remedial brainwashing.
<P>Jodie: Oh yeah, Daria, you signed up for that Talanted and Gifted School.  Funny, I’d think that would be interesting.
<P>Daria: Picture this:  Take Albert Einstein, Socrates, William Shakespeare, and Benjamin Franklin.  Put them all together in a room with no rules, no limits, just a lot of opportunities to learn, grow, and discover new things.
<P>Jodie: Sounds pretty cool.
<P>Daria: Now replace the geniuses with a bunch of kids whose parents just thought they were brilliant because they could count higher than the Cookie Monster.
<P>Jodie: Ew.  I see your point.  So, Jane, what did you really get?
<P>Jane: Graffiti removal.
<P>Jodie: Oh.  Well, I can see why that would suck.
<P>Daria: And what are you doing, if I may ask without seeming too interested?
<P>Jodie: Oh, I’m volunteering at the soup kitchen, the crisis center, and I signed up for an internship at Congressman Sach’s office.  Extra credit, you know.
<P>Jane: Good God, woman, don’t you ever sleep?
<P>Daria: Wait a minute.  Aren’t those all things you were doing anyway?
<I><P>Jodie smirks and folds her arms across her chest in satisfaction.
</I><P>Jane: I’ll be damned.
<P>Daria: I don’t know whether to be impressed with your little scheme, or pity you for being in the position to pull it off in the first place.
<P>Jodie: <I>(sighs)</I>  I’m teetering between those two possibilities myself.

<P>Sandi: Well, naturally, I wanted to… maintain a certain emotional distance.  <I>(growing confident as she continues her line of BS)</I>  I mean, after all, it would have been psychologically damaging to that poor woman if I had actually acted like her daughter, don’t you think?

<P>Marty: Why not?
<P>Daria: It’s annoying.
<P>Marty: We’re allowed to work wherever we want to.
<P>Daria: And while I suppose I should be honored that you’ve chosen my feet, I still feel compelled to recommend one of the many chairs which have been placed in this classroom for just such an eventuality.
<P>Marty: Your boots are really uncomfortable.  Could you take them off?
<P>Daria: I’m going to say this once, kid:  Don’t dis the boots.  And if they’re so uncomfortable, maybe that’s a sign that you should go sit somewhere else.  This place spent a lot of good money on chairs.
<P>Lou Ann: <I>(another student, overhearing)</I> I just had a discussion with Gordon about experimental societies that don’t use money.
<P>Daria: Could we try to keep this discussion focused on alterative places to sit beyond my feet?
<P>Lou Ann: Discussions should be allowed to evolve without constraint.
<P>Marty: I think society would be better off without money.
<P>Daria: Yes.  That’s an interesting thought.  And if we had no money, there would be no campaigns for political office, since those are wholly dependent on money.  Without politicians, we would need other sorts of leaders.  Perhaps a leadership structure more like a corporation, with a board of directors, and a chairperson.  The chairperson would likely sit in a chair of some kind, as opposed to someone else’s feet.  Why don’t you try that, Marty?
<P>Marty: You have a very closed mind.
<P>Daria: Let me try this from another angle.  The leg muscles are among the strongest voluntary muscles in the human body.  I estimate you weigh approximately seventy pounds.  How far do you think I could launch you across that carpet with a single kick?

<P>Link: So is my mother.  She figured regular school isn’t stimulating me enough.  <I>(mockingly)</I> That’s why I’m so down all the time.  It couldn’t possibly be because my stepfather’s such a jerk and my damn mother spends every afternoon watching talk shows or that stupid Sick-Sad-whatever.
<P>Daria: Um… sure.  Well, I wish I could say that this place will work wonders for you, but so far it seems to me like "OK to Cry Corral" on amphetamines.  I’ll tell you what, though, I’ll try to make it a little more tolerable for you while I’m here, if you could try to do the same for me.

<P>Stacy: What are we making these quilts for, anyway?

<P>Stacy: Why would something be wrong?
<P>Ms. Chaney: My point exactly.  At the risk of seeming like an old woman spouting platitudes, living a life can be a lot like making a quilt.  If you make one little mistake from time to time, it’s not the end of the world.  Just adjust the rest of the pattern to fit, or pull out a few stitches and start over.
<P>Stacy: Um, okay.
<P>Ms. Chaney: I could go on to say how life is a patchwork of experiences, held together by the thread of time, and in the end you have something warm and memorable, but then I really would sound like an old woman spouting platitudes, and as a teenager your instincts would lead you to smile, nod, and not listen to a word I say.

<P>Mr. Clay: Have a seat.  <I>(he gets up and goes to close the door)</I>.  You see Quinn, we’re a very small facility here in Lawndale, and we serve not only this community but everything else in a twenty-mile radius.  To put it concisely, we have very little space and a lot of stray animals to care for.
<P>Quinn: I know.  Isn’t it great that so many of them get adopted?  I think there’s almost a dozen that were here last week that aren’t here now.
<P>Mr. Clay: <I>(sighs)</I> Quinn, you don’t understand.  There aren’t nearly enough people interested in taking home new pets to keep us from getting dangerously overfilled with animals.  We just don’t have the resources to hold them all here until they are adopted.
<P>Quinn: Oh.  So, who’s taking them home?  I’d kind of like to see Snookums again, actually.
<P>Mr. Clay: Quinn, we can’t care for all these animals, and no one is taking them home.  We are in a position here where we have no choice but to use euthanasia.
<P>Quinn: Huh?  You’re sending them over to kids in China?
<P>Mr. Clay: No, Quinn.  We… put them to sleep.  Painlessly.  We try to be as humane as possible.
<I><P>Quinn is struck speechless.
</I><P>Mr. Clay: I know this must be hard for you to accept, but understand that we really have no choice.  There are simply too many of them for us to handle.  I hope we won’t lose you as a volunteer, you’re one of the best people I have, and that includes the paid staff.
<I><P>Quinn’s chin trembles.  Tears are running down her face.
</I><P>Mr. Clay:   I can see that you’re a very caring person.  I’m sorry that this has upset you so much–
<P>Quinn: <I>(interrupting, whispering)</I> You killed Snookums.
<P>Mr. Clay: Quinn, try not to look at it that way–



<I><P>Quinn gets up and runs out, crying in earnest now.  Mr. Clay sighs and turns his chair toward the window, watching her leave.

<I><P>Quinn bursts out of the front doors, barely able to see through her tears.  She doesn’t go far, soon collapsing in a sobbing heap on the walkway in front of the building.
<P>after a few minutes...



</I><P>Voice: Quinn?
<I><P>Quinn looks up.  It’s Mr. Clay.
</I><P>Quinn: Go away, you murderer!
<P>Mr. Clay: Quinn, it’s not a perfect world.  If I could save all these animals, I would.  But we only have so much space, and so much money.  If they don’t get adopted, what are we to do?  Let them starve, or turn them back out on the street?
<P>Quinn: <I>(not crying so hard anymore, but still sobbing a bit)</I>  But… there has to be something you can do besides killing them!
<P>Mr. Clay: We try, Quinn.  Every week I write letters to the mayor’s office and the governor asking for more funds.  We hold bake sales, we get some money from private donations, and sometimes we’re able to send animals to other, better-equipped shelters.  Most of all, we depend on our volunteers.  People like you, Quinn.
<I><P>Quinn looks up, her eyes no longer so angry.
</I><P>Mr. Clay: If it weren’t for our volunteer staff, we would only be able to hold half the animals we do.  And the number coming in doesn’t get any smaller.  If you still want to go, I’ll understand, and I’ll give you a passing grade on the project.  But we do need you, and I hope you consider coming back.  I’ll leave it up to you.
<I><P>Mr. Clay turns and heads back inside.  After a moment, Quinn gets up and follows.

<P>Daria: Quinn couldn’t find her left foot if you showed her the right one and told her to look for one just like it.
<P>Mr. Clay: You must be her older sister.
<P>Daria: How’d you guess?
<P>Mr. Clay: I have an older brother.
<P>Jake: Daria, this is the right place, isn’t it?
<P>Daria: Yes, Dad.  Quinn’s just saying bye-bye to all the animals.
<P>Mr. Clay: Ah, Mr. Morgendorffer, I presume?
<P>Daria: No flies on you.
<P>Mr. Clay: I’d like to tell you how proud we are of Quinn.  She’s the best volunteer we have.  A very caring and sensitive girl.

<P>Daria, still turned around, notices a kitten poking its head out of Quinn’s jacket.  She says nothing, however.

<P>Daria: Depressed, cynical, and cranky with the world.
<P>Jane: My kind of kid.
<P>Daria: That wasn’t the most interesting thing that happened all day though.
<P>Jane: Oh?  Do tell.
<P>Daria: Quinn brought home a few inmates from the pound.  A dog, a rabbit, and at least four cats.  Sneaked them in right under Dad’s nose.
<P>Jane: Well, Jake never was one of your more perceptive people.
<P>Daria: Sure, getting them home was no problem, but she’ll never keep them under wraps for long.  If she wanted a pet so badly, why didn’t she just ask for one?  Dad’s always wanted a cat.
<P>Jane: I’m guessing she had other motives.
<P>Daria: Well, apart from the rabbit, they don’t seem like they’d be very tasty.
<P>Jane: Obviously you’ve never been to Korea.  But seriously, she was probably just trying to save their little hides
<P>Daria: From what?  I mean, doing time can’t be pleasant, but it’s not like they –
<I><P>Pause.
</I><P>Daria: They do, don’t they?
<P>Jane: If you mean buying them a one-way ticket on the Heavenly Express, that’s a big yes.  There was a local controversy about it a few years ago, but then Tommy Sherman won the State Championship and suddenly there were more interesting things to talk about.

<P>INT:  Joey’s room



<I><P>Joey’s hanging out with Jeffy and Jamie, watching football.  In one corner of the room is a shrine to the worship of Quinn, with lots of pictures and a red telephone (the "Quinn Hotline") which has never, ever rung.



<P>The red telephone rings.  Needless to say, the three boys are thunderstruck.
</I><P>Joey: D-did that really just happen?



<P>Jeffy: It can’t be!



<P>Jamie: Hang on a second…
<I><P>The phone rings again.
</I><P>Jeffy: MINE!! <I>(lunges for the phone)
</I><P>Jamie: I GOT IT!! <I>(similar lunge)



</I><P>Joey: IT’S <U>MY</U> ROOM!!! <I>(jumps over both of them)
<P>There’s a mad struggle for the phone, which ends with Joey on top.



</I><P>Joey: Hello?  Quinn?  Is that you?
<P>SPLIT SCREEN
<P>Quinn: Well of <U>course</U> it’s me, Joey.  I mean, unless you’ve been giving this number out to other girls!
<P>Joey: I’d never do that, Quinn!  Never, never, never!
<P>Jeffy: What’s she saying?
<P>Jamie: Did she mention my name?



<P>Joey: Quiet, guys!  <I>(into phone)</I>  Sorry, Quinn, the other guys are being kind of rude.
<P>Quinn: Oh, that’s okay, just tell them hi and I’ll talk to them soon.  Listen, Joey, have you ever wanted a pet?  Like… <I>(Quinn consults her list)</I> … a terrier, or a cocker spaniel?
<P>Joey: I don’t know… I never really thought about it, and my mother said once she wasn’t too keen on having a pet…



<P>Quinn: Oh, that’s too bad.  There’s the cutest little dog down here at the shelter that’s about to get adopted by some Russian family who’s taking him back to Moscow, and I’d just miss him so much!  I was thinking, if only someone I knew would adopt him instead, and take him home, and take really good care of him, I could come by and see him.
<P>Joey: I just don’t know…
<P>Quinn: I’d come by and see him a <U>whole</U> <U>lot</U>, Joey.
<P>Joey: I’ve always wanted a dog!  What do I need to do?
<P>Quinn: Just come on down to the shelter, and I’ll set it all up for you!  Thanks so much, Joey, I’ve always liked you best.  Can you put Jeffy on, you know, so I can tell him?
<P>Joey: Sure! <I>(hands phone to Jeffy with a smirk)</I> Quinn has something to tell you!
<P>Jeffy: Hi Quinn!
<P>Quinn: Hi, Jeffy!  You <U>know</U> how I’ve always liked <U>you</U> best… have you ever considered adopting a pair of cats?

<I><P>Jane approaches a long wall with a roller in her hand and a camera around her neck.  An almost visible cloud of guilt hangs over her head.  She looks down the wall, seeing the swirls of color painted by some of Lawndale’s anonymous artists.  Trent approaches behind her.
</I><P>Jane: See what I mean, Trent?
<P>Trent: Yup.  It’s a wall, all right.
<P>Jane: I wonder if I got enough pictures.  Maybe I should get something from this angle too.
<I><P>She takes up the camera and fires off a couple of shots toward the far end of the wall.  Suddenly, she’s very angry at the whole thing.
</I><P>Jane: Dammit, what am I doing?  I’m not a sell-out!  I mean, next year I’ll be eighteen, I can just drop out of high school and they’ll have nothing to say about it!
<P>Trent: Come on, Janey.  You don’t want to do that.
<P>Jane: Yeah, I know.  But think of how you’d feel if someone told you to go to a record store and rub all the albums with sandpaper.
<P>Trent: Hmm...can I start with the Disco collection?
<P>Jane: <I>(smiles in spite of herself)</I>  Oh, well.  I guess the guys who painted this stuff up here didn’t expect it to last anyway.  I just hate being the one who has to white it out.
<P>Trent: You know, Janey, if I were painting that wall, I’d do it in black.  It would make more of a statement, I think.
<P>Jane: Yeah, well if <U>I</U> were painting it, I’d leave these walls alone, and do a huge mural on that other wall that shows how I feel about this town and this stupid project.
<P>Trent: Um, Janey… you <U>are</U> painting it.
<I><P>Jane’s eyes go wide, her jaw drops, and the roller slips out of her hand to splash wetly on the concrete.
</I><P>Jane: You know something, Trent?  You’re absolutely right.  <I>(she smiles in a crafty way)</I> Lawndale, when it comes to graffiti, you ain’t seen nothing yet!

<P>INT:  Lawndale Learning Facility for the Gifted and Talented
<I><P>Link is sitting by himself in a corner of the room, playing with a checkerboard.  He makes a move, then spins the board around so he can play the other side.  A girl about his age approaches.
</I><P>Megan: <I>(the girl)</I> Hey new kid, do you want to join our discussion on current events?
<P>Link: I have a headache.  That current enough for you?
<P>Daria: <I>(approaching from behind)</I>  Don’t steal my material, Link.
<P>Link: <I>(looking up)</I> Thank God, someone almost normal.  Where the hell have you been?
<P>Daria: Hey, it’s a long walk.  <I>(to Megan)</I> Link and I are going to have some one-on-one, Megan.  Why don’t you ask Elaine to join your little discussion?
<P>Link: Yeah, maybe she’ll waltz some interesting arguments about conflicts in the Middle East.
<I><P>Megan shrugs, and exits.
<P>Link continues playing solo checkers.
</I><P>Daria: Could you use an opponent?
<P>Link: Are you kidding?  You’d kick my butt.
<P>Daria: Why else would I ask to play?
<I><P>Link doesn’t smile.
</I><P>Daria: So, is this place getting you down?
<P>Link: It’s not home, so it does have one thing going for it.
<P>Daria: Things are rough at home, huh?
<P>Link: Don’t play shrink with me, Daria.  I have enough people doing that.
<P>Daria: I’m not trying to be a shrink.  I’m trying to be a friend.
<P>Link: Okay, <U>friend</U>.  Why don’t you tell me about all of your problems?
<P>Daria: Fair enough.  We can start with this idiotic assignment.  I signed up to be a tutor, I end up being a babysitter.  Present company excepted, I don’t think I’ve ever seen such a bunch of wackos.  And I’ve been to High School.
<P>Link: See?  That’s the thing.  You signed up for this.  You had a choice.  I don’t have any choices.
<P>Daria: My other choice was clearing out the storm drains on Main Street, but yes, in a technical sense I had a choice.
<P>Link: Whatever.
<P>Daria: It’s a fact of life, Link.  We all go through it.  When you’re a child, you don’t get much of a choice.  It won’t get much better anytime real soon, unfortunately.  But it will get better eventually.  Especially since Ms. Li will probably retire by the time you get to Lawndale High.
<P>Link: Whoopty-doopty-do.
<P>Daria: Link, this isn’t easy for me.  Could you try to meet me halfway here?
<P>Link: What’s not easy?  Being a friend, or being a psychiatrist?
<P>Daria: I haven’t got that much experience at either one.  And I’m not trying to psychoanalyze you.  I’m trying to get to know you.
<P>Link: <I>(looks her in the eye for the first time)</I> You want to get to know me?  Fine.  I’m the kid that everyone always says was such a quiet young man, never really talked much.   Not the kind of person you’d expect to climb a clock tower with a machine gun and wipe out half his graduating class.
<P>Daria: Link –
<P>Link: Don’t freak out on me, it’s not like I could get a machine gun anyway.
<P>Daria: Link, let me tell you something.  And if you never listen to anything else, listen to this.
<P>Link: I’m listening. <I>(he doesn’t seem to be listening very hard)
</I><P>Daria: You know that I’m not one for opening up to people.  We have that in common.  But I learned, after a while, that you need someone in your life, even if it’s just one person, whom you can trust.  I can live with it if you don’t think I’m that person.  Just make sure you find someone.  Because eventually, people stop trying to get to know you.  And loneliness is everything it’s cracked up to be. 
<P>Link: <I>(unmoved)</I> I could use a little more loneliness right now.
<I><P>Daria stands up and walks away, throwing one last look over her shoulder.  After a moment, Link looks up, as if he’s about to say something.  But he doesn’t, and instead turns sadly back to his checkerboard.

<I><P>Sandi is struggling to get two squares of fabric sewn together.  Her fingers are well-bandaged by now.
</I><P>Sandi: How the hell is this supposed to work?  The needle isn’t even straight!
<P>Mrs. Peabody: Now Margaret, I’ve told you about that language!
<P>Sandi: Look lady, I’ve been as patient with you as I possibly can under very trying circumstances, but my name is <U>Sandi</U> and I’m not your freakin’ daughter!!  Besides, if you had a daughter, she’s be, like, fifty years old by now!
<P>Mrs. Peabody: Well, I never!  You young people are so rude these days!  You come into my home and start acting all high-and-mighty, thinking you can be discourteous to someone just because they’re elderly!  You should be ashamed of yourself.
<P>Sandi: <I>(a bit guilty)</I> Um, I’m sor –
<P>Mrs. Peabody: Besides, you’ll be old yourself one day, and when you are you’ll be sorry you were so nasty to your poor mother!
<P>Sandi: Oooh!!
<I><P>In the meantime, Stacy is putting a few finishing touches on her quilt.
</I><P>Ms. Chaney: Very good, dear.  I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone catch on to the art of quilting so quickly.  We’ll be done ahead of schedule by a whole week!
<P>Stacy: Well, you’re a really good teacher, Janice.
<P>Ms. Chaney: Perhaps we should help your friend over there.  She seems to be getting awfully frustrated.
<P>Stacy: <I>(under her breath)</I> Good.
<P>Ms. Chaney: Pardon, dear?
<P>Stacy: Hm?  Oh, nothing.  Tell me, do you know how to sew clothes too?
<P>Ms. Chaney: Why certainly, dear.  I made clothes for all my children while they were growing up, and my mother did the same for me.  Of course, the Depression was on, so she didn’t have much choice.  It was either learn to stitch or let the kids go naked.
<I><P>Stacy giggles.
</I><P>Ms. Chaney: Oh, but you don’t want to hear an old woman go on about things you learn about in History class.
<P>Stacy: No!  I… kind of like hearing about it.  I mean, you make it sound interesting, like it really happened instead of it just being all dates and places and stuff.
<P>Ms. Chaney: That’s sweet, dear.  It’s really nice to know that kids today can sometimes remember that we were all young once, and we knew how to live.  Let me tell you about the summer of ’41, that was a wild one –
<I><P>Ms. Chaney is interrupted by a loud clatter over in Sandi’s direction.
</I><P>Sandi: <U>What</U> did you just say??
<P>Mrs. Peabody: Oh dearie, there’s no need to get all upset.  Your mother just needs a little help using the commode, that’s all.  Come now, it never bothered you before…
<P>Sandi: That’s IT!!  I’ve ruined a manicure, my dress has blood on it, I’ve got some kind of rash from Quinn’s stupid rabbits, and this quilt – <I>(she holds up three sewn together squares of material, one of which promptly falls off)</I> – this STUPID QUILT is never, never going to get done because all you do is sit in your delusional world when you’re supposed to be showing me how to sew without putting holes in my fingers, and now you want me to help you with the TOILET?!?
<P>Mrs. Peabody: Now Margaret, you’re making a scene.  Just get over here and help your mother to the bathroom.
<I><P>Sandi’s face goes bright red.  She looks like she might explode.  Finally, she does.
</I><P>Sandi: AAAAAUUUUGH!!!!
<I><P>She runs over to Stacy and pulls her out of her chair by the lapels.
</I><P>Sandi: Stacy!  I can’t take this anymore!! Get me out of here, I… I need to shop!!  <I>(her eyes get a crazy glint)</I> Take me to Cashmans!  I need to see the new winter fashions!!  I need to make Quinn feel inferior!  I need to tell Tiffany she doesn’t look fat!!  I need a credit card – FOR GOD’S SAKE, SOMEBODY GET ME A CREDIT CARD!!!
<I><P>Sandi starts hyperventilating.  Stacy, who was understandably startled, pulls herself together.
</I><P>Stacy: <I>(shaking Sandi by the shoulders)</I> Sandi!  Get a grip!!  <I>(she slaps Sandi on the face, not too hard, but enough to get her attention)
</I><P>Sandi: <I>(catching her breath)</I>  I… I… um…
<P>Stacy: It’s all right, Sandi.  It’s going to be okay.  Just sit down here, and I’ll get you some water or something.
<P>Sandi: Um…
<I><P>Stacy leaves to go get some water.  Sandi sits for a moment, calming down, glancing around at everyone staring at her.  Her cheeks are flushed with intense embarrassment.
</I><P>Sandi: <I>(more to herself than anyone else)</I> I’m okay… I’m okay… no problem… I’m the President of the Fashion Club… I’m in charge… I can handle it…
<P>Mrs. Peabody: Well, Margaret?  Aren’t you going to help me?  I can’t hold it in forever, you know.
<P>Sandi: <I>(to Ms. Chaney) </I>Save me!
<P>Ms. Chaney: Of course, dear.  I’ll get a nurse.  <I>(she starts to stand up)
</I><P>Sandi: No!  Don’t leave me with her!!  Please!!
<I><P>Ms. Chaney sighs, and sits back down to wait for Stacy.

<I><P>Quinn hangs up the phone and slumps back into her chair.  She’s fairly exhausted.
</I><P>Quinn: God, who would have imagined talking on the phone could get so tiring!  Let’s see now, I found homes for Daisy, Nicodemus, Vinny, Ming, Sunshine, Alex… and Bowser.  But that still leaves two dogs, three cats, and another rabbit!  What am I going to do?
<I><P>Mr. Clay walks by the desk.
</I><P>Mr. Clay: Oh, Quinn, there you are.  I just met some of your friends, coming in to pick up some animals.  I’m glad to see you’re spreading the word around.  Every pet that gets adopted makes room for another homeless one.
<P>Quinn: I’m trying so hard, Mr. Clay.  I just hope it’s enough.
<P>Mr.Clay: <I>(more serious)</I> Quinn, I know what you’re trying to do here, and while I applaud your efforts, please realize that we’ve been down this road before.  I think it’s commendable that you’re doing everything in your power to get more animals adopted, but in the end I’m afraid you’ll find that there are more strays and unwanted pets than there are people to take them in.
<P>Quinn: <I>(softly)</I> I just want to save as many as I can…
<P>Mr. Clay: And that’s understandable.  Just… try not to set yourself a hopeless task.
<P>Quinn: Yes, Mr. Clay.
<I><P>Quinn turns back to her list as Mr. Clay leaves.  She sees a number of names crossed off, but an equal number that have stars next to them and are not crossed off.

</I><P>Jake: Let’s see, got the wok, got the mushrooms, got the beef… wait a minute!  This package had two pounds of meat!  Who took the meat out of this package?!
<I><P>Jake checks the package on a small kitchen scale..
</I><P>Jake: Dammit!  Only a pound and a half!  Where am I going to get half a pound of beef?
<I><P>Jake turns to rummage through the refrigerator.  A rabbit hops leisurely across the counter behind him and starts nibbling on the shredded cabbage.
</I><P>Jake: Hmm… got some beets, got some corn, got some leftover kitchen sink stew – hey, I haven’t made that in two months!  Why the hell do we eat frozen lasagna every night when we have all these leftovers?
<I><P>A dog jumps onto the counter opposite the rabbit.  It growls softly.
</I><P>Jake: Why don’t we have any damned meat in here?  Hey, here’s some meatloaf!  I could make a stir fry with that!  Hm, and if I add this leftover burger from the Labor Day cookout, that should just about cover it!
<P>Dog: Woof WOOF!!
<P>Jake: GAAAHH!!  <I>(he jumps, startled out of his wits, and bumps his head on the refrigerator shelf.  An avalanche of food and drink cascades down on him)</I>  What the hell was that??
<I><P>Jake scrambles to his feet and slips in the eggs, but manages to grab the counter and hang on.  He looks around frantically, but the rabbit and dog have been scared off by his accident with the refrigerator.  Jake runs out of the kitchen into the living room, but there are no animals to be seen.
</I><P>Jake: You can’t hide from me, dammit!  I’ll find you!!  So help me, I’ll find you ALL!!!

<I><P>She hangs up, and dials another number
</I><P>Quinn: Hey, Marcus?  It’s Quinn.  Remember last week, how all the animals got adopted and you didn’t have to come in to, you know, euphemism them?… That’s what I said.  Anyway, all the animals on the list this week got adopted at the last minute… I know, isn’t it weird?  Two weeks in a row… Anyway, you don’t have to come in tomorrow… Sure, no problem, I’ll take care of the paperwork!  G’bye.

<I><P>Helen comes in, on her cell phone for a change.
</I><P>Helen: Look, I’ll tell you again, it’s a matter of practicality.  Greenpeace says you can’t build there because the Warbler’s Jumping Rat is endangered…  Well, of course we don’t dispute that, the numbers speak for themselves…  We just turn it to our <U>advantage</U>!  Our position will be that if there’s only one left, the species isn’t too bloody likely to bounce back whether we break ground in December or not!
<P>Daria: Besides, I think I saw that last one go into the Hamburger Pie.
<P>Jake: You know, speaking of animals, has anyone seen anything weird around here lately?
<P>Daria: I see weird things on a daily basis.
<P>Jake: I mean… well, have you by any chance seen any animals around the house?
<I><P>Daria notices a cat leaping onto the counter behind Jake.  No one else sees it.
</I><P>Daria: Animals?  What sort of animals?
<P>Helen: <I>(still on the phone)</I>It’s the perfect argument!  If they do manage to find any more than that first one, it just reinforces that they’re not all that endangered a species!
<P>Jake: The other day, there was a cat in the bathroom!  And then there was a dog here in the kitchen!  And I could swear one of my bunny slippers hopped away this morning!
<P>Daria: Dad… you didn’t actually eat those leftovers in the fridge, did you?.

Jake gives chase, but Daria happens to stick a foot out at just the wrong moment and trips him up.

<P>Daria: Teaching kids to make a better paper airplane.  This is really going too far.  <I>(she looks around for Link)</I>  Link?  Where are you?



<P>Marty: <I>(approaching Daria)</I> Can I sit on your feet again?



<P>Daria: No.  Have you seen Link?



<P>Marty: Who cares?  He never joins in any of the discussions.
<P>Daria: <I>(angry)</I> Some people like to have a little time by themselves.  That’s no reason to not care about them.
<P>Marty: He’s mean.  Just like you.
<P>Daria: You know, just because someone doesn’t like you, that doesn’t make them mean.



<I><P>Marty turns and stomps away.



</I><P>Daria: <I>(under her breath) </I>It might just mean they have taste.
<P>Marge: Oh Daria, there you are.  I was hoping you might be able to tell me where Larry is today.
<P>Daria: <I>(angrier by the minute)</I> His name is Link.
<P>Marge: Oh, yes.  Well, we were all worried about him, and –
<P>Daria: Really?  Which of you were worried about him?  The kids over there throwing paper airplanes, or the ones sitting in a circle talking about the moral decay in the modern city?
<P>Marge: Really, Daria, there’s no need to –
<P>Daria: Or maybe it’s the poser who can’t even get his name right.

<I><P>Mr. Clay is doing some paperwork when there’s a knock on his door.



</I><P>Mr. Clay: Come in!
<P>Quinn: <I>(peeking around the door)</I> You seem really busy Mr. Clay, should I come back later?
<P>Mr. Clay: No, I’ll be even busier later.  What’s on your mind, Quinn?
<P>Quinn: Well, I was just thinking about some more ways we could help some of the animals here.  I thought maybe we could go to the elementary schools in the area and bring some of the puppies and kitties along, and talk to the kids about how we take care of them and how important it is to adopt animals instead of buying them from a store and stuff.
<P>Mr. Clay: Quinn –
<P>Quinn: And then I thought about how we could do the same thing for the Girl Scouts and the Boy Scouts, and maybe all the publicity would be helpful too, to get us funding and stuff.  Oh, and I wanted to tell you I’ve been working really hard all week and I was able to get all the animals on the list a home, but some people can’t come and get them right away so could we keep some of the animals around a little longer that would have been… you know, tomorrow?
<P>Mr. Clay: Quinn, I’m afraid we’ve got a real crisis going on right now.  It’s probably best that I tell you now instead of having you find out later.
<P>Quinn: What’s wrong?
<P>Mr. Clay: Maybe you saw in the paper about how the local police found that house where an old woman was keeping about forty cats and dogs.   They were not, needless to say, getting the proper care.  The animals were confiscated and brought here a few days ago.  This is stretching our resources considerably, and when you add that to our usual weekly additions, I’m afraid we’re at almost double the safe capacity for this facility.
<P>Quinn: <I>(wary)</I> What does that mean?



<P>Mr. Clay: It means, Quinn, that we have to make some room.  And I’ve explained to you that there’s only one way we can do that.



<P>Quinn: But that’s not <U>fair</U>!  I worked so hard and I got all these pets new homes and now you’re going to have to kill some of them anyway?
<P>Mr. Clay: We might be able to keep those few that you’ve arranged for already, but that still leaves almost thirty animals that we have absolutely no room for.
<P>Quinn: Th-<I>thirty</I>?
<P>Mr. Clay: Perhaps it would be best if you went home now, Quinn.  I know this is very difficult for you.  There’s no need for you to stay around and become even more upset.
<P>Quinn: NO!  We have to do something!  This isn’t right!!
<P>Mr. Clay: Quinn, I’ve explained to you, we have no choice.  I really feel you should go home now.
<P>Quinn: But…
<P>Mr. Clay: It’s for your own good, Quinn.  I’ve already sent your friend Tiffany home.  I can call your parents to come get you, if you like.
<P>Quinn: <I>(with an air of defeat)</I> No. Thank you, Mr. Clay.  <I>(she gets up and leaves, the tears dropping off her face) 



<P>Mr. Clay watches her go, then sits down, shaking his head sadly.

<P>Daria: She’s not in here!
<P>Quinn: <I>(bursting into Daria’s room.  Her face is streaked with tears)</I>  Oh, Daria, this is awful!  I was at the shelter today and I tried to talk to the manager and tell him that he couldn’t kill those poor little puppies and kitties and he said something about <I>(sobbing breath)</I> how they didn’t have any choice and that I should just go home and there’s over <U>thirty</U> of them and they’re going to kill them tomorrow and what do I DO?? <I>(she drops onto the foot of the bed, narrowly missing a small rabbit)
</I><P>Daria: <I>(puts her book aside)</I>  Um, Quinn… I think you’ve really done all you can.  I mean, take a look around.  You did manage to save some of them, even if we don’t know what to do with them all.  And I’m sure Dad will someday forget all about his brush with madness.
<P>Quinn: But it’s not FAIR!  Those dogs and cats and things never hurt anyone, and they’re all so sweet and cute and everything!  I mean, I’d take them all home if I could, but I can’t because there’s just too many of them and I can’t sneak them out!
<P>Daria: <I>(genuine)</I> I’m sorry, Quinn.
<P>Quinn: <I>(suddenly angry)</I> That’s not good enough!
<P>Daria: Huh?
<P>Quinn: Daria, remember that one time when I did that huge favor for you and you said you owed me a favor in return with no questions asked?  Well, I’m calling you on it!  You’re really smart and I know you can find a way to do this.  <I>(desperately)</I> Please, Daria, I don’t think I could take it if we just sit back and let it happen!
<P>Daria: Quinn, I want to help, but –



<P>Quinn: <I>(stands up)</I> NO!  You have to at least try!  You have to try, Daria!

<P>Daria: Bring a big piece of paper, OK?

<P>Daria: Here.
<I><P>Jane puts the paper on the table, where it picks up a couple of stains.
</I><P>Daria: Okay.  You’re probably wondering why I asked you here today.
<P>Jane: <I>(indicating Quinn)</I> I’m more curious about what she’s doing here.
<P>Daria: A necessary evil.  Remember when we were talking about the animal shelter, and how they were about to send some of the inmates off to join the choir invisible?
<P>Jane: Vaguely, yes.  Is this going to take long?
<P>Quinn: Daria has a plan to save them!
<I><P>Silence.
</I><P>Trent: Cool.  <I>(sips coffee)
</I><P>Jane: She’s not kidding, is she?
<P>Daria: As much as I wish she were, no.  Tonight, we’re busting two dozen flea-bitten mutts and other assorted creatures out of the pound.
<P>Jane: I see.  Let’s ignore for a moment the fact that you’ve lost your mind.  Once we have them out, what do you intend to do?  Build an ark and hope for rain?



<P>Quinn: We can take them to the other shelter in Fremont, you know, where they don’t kill the animals.



<P>Jane: Quinn, that’s over a hundred miles.
<P>Trent: The Tank can make it.
<P>Jane: That’s questionable, but let’s move on.  How do you plan to get <U>inside</U> in order to get them out?  I mean, it’s not Fort Knox or Lawndale High, but I assume they lock the doors.
<P>Daria: Not all the doors.  <I>(She starts to draw a floorplan on the paper)</I>  Here’s the basic layout of the place.  Front room, vet’s office, cages, and the dog run outside.  That’s our way in.
<P>Jane: You mean…
<P>Daria: The dog flap.  Exactly.
<P>Jane: And who exactly is going to crawl through there?
<P>Quinn: You’re about a size two, aren’t you?
<P>Jane: <I>(eyes widening)</I>  Forget it.  No way.  This is beyond insane.
<P>Trent: Come on, Jane.  It’ll be fun.
<P>Daria: Besides, haven’t you always wanted to do a scene with a poodle?
<P>Jane: Look, aside from the fact that I think you’re all off your collective rocker, I happen to know for certain that I won’t fit through a dog flap.
<P>Daria: From experience?
<P>Jane: Don’t go there.   Besides, I have my own agenda.  As much as I’d like to get arrested for breaking and entering, tonight was going to be more of a vandalism night.
<P>Quinn: But you can’t not help us!



<P>Daria: Relax, Quinn.  There’s no way Jane would turn down the opportunity to witness an event like this.  Is there, Jane?

<P>Quinn: Oh, thank you Jane!
<P>Jane: No hugs!
<P>Quinn: Ewww!!
<P>Daria: All right, we have to wait until dark to make our move.  In the meantime, Quinn, I need you to drive back home and start packing up your little zoo.  Meet us at the animal shelter at ten o’clock.  Oh, and bring some money.
<P>Quinn: What for?
<P>Daria: We need to gas up three vehicles tonight for a two-hundred mile round trip, and one of them sucks more fuel than a battleship.  No one said this plan would be cheap, you know.
<I><P>Quinn exits
</I><P>Daria: We should head over to Max’s place and pick up the Tank.  It <U>is</U> in reasonable working order, isn’t it?

<P>Daria: Oh, terrific.



<P>Jane: Listen, I need to get a few things for my own little project tonight.  Why don’t the two of you take Trent’s car over and steal the Tank.  It’s about seven o’clock right now, you should make it back here by ten.
<P>Trent: It’s only eight blocks.
<P>Jane: This is the Tank we’re talking about.
<P>Trent: That’s a good point.  Come on, Daria, we don’t want to be late.

<P>Daria: Remember that episode of Sick, Sad World where the three guys broke into a lingerie shop and took video of themselves trying everything on?  Remember how that video was used against them at their trial?  Remember how we couldn’t believe how stupid they were?

<P>Daria: <I>(considers)</I>  All right.  But before we do anything, listen to this.  This is our last chance to back out.  We can walk away right now and pretend this never happened.  If we get caught, we will likely spend the night in jail.  Quinn, this means a serious drop in your popularity.  Link, you’ll likely get sent to a whole string of new therapists.  Jane, since your parents aren’t around, you’ll probably be put in a foster home for the next six months until you’re eighteen.  Trent, I don’t need to tell you that since you’re the only legal adult here, you could be risking prison.  Are we all ready to do this?



<P>Quinn: <I>(swallows hard)</I> Ready!
<P>Jane: Born ready.
<P>Trent: <I>(indifferent)</I> Sure.
<P>Link: <I>(pulls out a pair of shades and puts them on)</I>  Let’s rock.

<P>EXT:  Rear of building, Animal Shelter



<I><P>Music:  Mission Impossible.  Trent backs the tank up carefully to the fence, bumping it slightly.  He shuts the motor off and gets out.  Links accepts a boost from him and climbs on top of the Tank.



</I><P>Link: <I>(a little scared)</I> It’s kind of a long drop…
<P>Quinn: You can do it, Link.  I know you can.
<I><P>Link turns to smile at Quinn, loses his balance, and slips off the van into the pen.



</I><P>Link: Ooof!



<P>Daria: Link!  Are you all right?
<P>Quinn: Link?
<P>Jane: Talk to us, kid!
<I><P>Link pulls himself up on the fence.
</I><P>Link: Piece of cake.



<I><P>Suddenly, there’s a loud barking from inside the building.  A large Rotweiller bursts out through the flap and growls at Link.



</I><P>Link: Eep!
<P>Daria: Quinn, what the hell is that?
<P>Quinn: Oh, no.  That’s Crusher.  I didn’t know they let him roam free at night.
<P>Link: C-Crusher?
<P>Jane: Quinn, the appropriate time to mention lethal guard dogs was at least an hour ago.
<P>Link: Help me…
<P>Quinn: Daria, Trent, Jane, help me up!
<P>Daria: What are you doing?
<P>Quinn: I think I can calm him down, but I have to get in there!  Now help me up!



<I><P>Using Trent as a stepladder, Quinn scrambles to the top of the Tank and immediately falls into the dog run.



</I><P>Daria: Quinn!
<P>Jane: Quinn!
<P>Trent: Are you okay?
<P>Quinn: No!  I landed in a big pile of –
<P>Link: Crap!  He’s getting closer!
<P>Quinn: It’s okay.  Don’t let him know you’re afraid.  Come here, Crusher… come on, you remember me, right?
<I><P>Crusher growls a bit more, but it’s a little less threatening.
</I><P>Quinn: Come on, puppy dog… that’s a good boy…
<I><P>Crusher comes up close and sniffs at Quinn’s hand.  His growling stops.
</I><P>Quinn: Oh, good puppy… <I>(she scratches behind his ears)
</I><P>Link: Puppy?
<P>Daria: Link!  The door!
<P>Link: Uh, sure.  There aren’t any more Crushers in there, are there?
<P>Quinn: No, just him.  Isn’t that right, you precious little darling!
<I><P>Crusher rolls over and lets Quinn rub his tummy.
</I><P>Trent: That’s just wrong.
<P>Jane: Don’t knock it, it worked.



<I><P>Facing Crusher the whole time, Link slides around behind Quinn and crawls up to the dog flap.  He crawls in head first – it’s a tight fit, but he makes it.



</I><P>Daria: All right.  Let’s head around to the front door.  You okay in there for a moment, Quinn?
<P>Quinn: When I get home, I’m throwing away this outfit.
<P>Daria: Naturally.  You’ve worn it once, after all.

<P>Link creeps through the dark building.  The animals are rousing themselves and taking interest in this unexpected activity.  A few cats start mewing.  The dogs, for the most part, are pressing their noses against the cages.  Link’s nervous, but keeps going until he reaches the front door, where he lets Daria and Trent inside.



<P>Jane: Nice work, Link.  We’ll make a hoodlum out of you yet.
<P>Link: I could get to like this.
<P>Daria: Jane, you’re not helping.  Okay, we need to get Quinn back in here, and lock up Crusher somehow.  Then we figure out which of these guys are getting the axe tomorrow.  We’ll need some pet carriers and some leashes for the big dogs.  I hope Quinn knows where they’re kept.
<P>Link: I’ll ask her! <I>(runs off)



</I><P>Daria: What is up with that?



<P>Trent: Come on, Daria.  Haven’t you ever had a crush on someone?
<P>Daria: I don’t know what you’re talking about, Trent.
<P>&nbsp;



<P>TIME PASSES
<P>&nbsp;



<P>EXT:  Dog run



<I><P>Quinn comes out the door with a large ring filled with keys.  She flips through them, selects one, and applies it to a padlock on an outside gate.  The lock pops off.



</I><P>Quinn: <I>(whispering)</I> Come on!



<I><P>Daria emerges with a couple of carriers, followed by Link with smaller carriers.  Trent brings out two Great Danes on leashes.



</I><P>Daria: Put the small ones in the back seat of the Lexus.  The big dogs go in the Tank.



<P>Jane: What about this chinchilla?



<P>Daria: Do I have to solve everything?  I don’t know, stick it in the Tank or something.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>A BIT LATER…



<P>&nbsp;
<I><P>Quinn comes out with the St. Bernard.  The dog follows her halfway into the Tank, then sits down, yawns, and starts scratching.
</I><P>Quinn: Oh, great.



<P>Trent: Here, let me try.  (<I>Trent tries to push the dog up into the van, but it just won’t go.)
</I><P>Daria: Trent, you might as well be pushing the Rock of Gibraltar.
<P>Trent: <I>(perks up)</I> Hey, that would be a great name for a band.
<P>Link: No, you’re doing it all wrong.  Hey, Moose!
<I><P>The dog slowly turns to look at him.&nbsp; Link jumps up into the van and holds out a large biscuit.



</I><P>Link: Come on, Moose!  Come on up here!



<I><P>The dog rises and hops up into the van.
</I><P>Link: Got him!  <I>(He jumps out and Trent closes the door)
</I><P>Quinn: That was great, Link!
<P>Link: <I>(blushing)</I> It was nothing…
<P>Daria: All right, we’ve taken too long here already.  If someone saw us, they might have called the cops.  We need to go now.  Trent, you get started on the way to Fremont.  I need to get Link home.
<P>Link: I want to go with you!
<P>Daria: I can’t take you on a hundred-mile road trip, Link.  Do you know how much trouble I’d get in?
<P>Link: <I>(scowls)</I> Oh, but having me jump over a fence, face down a killer dog, break into the city pound and set loose thirty cats and dogs is all fine and good.
<P>Daria: Link…



<P>Link: I’m not going home.  You can’t make me do it, you know.  I’m faster than you.



<P>Daria: You’re not faster than Jane.
<P>Jane: Hey, leave me out of this.
<P>Quinn: Come on, Daria, we have to go!
<P>Daria: If we get caught with you –
<P>Link: I’ll say I was running away and you picked me up.  It’s the truth.
<P>Daria: How do we explain the animals?
<P>Link: That’s your problem.  You’d have to explain them whether I was there or not.
<P>Quinn: Daria!  Let’s GO, for God’s sake!
<I><P>A ruckus erupts from inside the Tank.
</I><P>Trent: Uh, Daria, the dogs are getting nervous.
<P>Link: I didn’t want to have to do this.  <I>(He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small silver object)</I>  This is a dog whistle.  I lifted it while I was inside.  You let me come with you, or I’ll blow this thing so hard those dogs will be breaking down the doors.
<P>Daria: That’s a pen.
<P>Link: Damn.
<P>Quinn: Uh, guys, I think the reason those dogs are so upset could be those sirens in the distance.
<P>Jane: ALL RIGHT, Jane’s in charge as of now.  Trent, drive the Tank.  Link, get in there with him and do what you can to keep the dogs quiet.  Quinn, Daria, get in the Lexus and make tracks.  I’ll take Trent’s car.  Move-move-move!



<I><P>Everyone moves.  In moments, they’re pulling out of the parking lot.  Seconds later, a police car goes by on a cross street, heading in the opposite direction.

<P>Quinn: Come on, Daria, it’s not like you had a date or something.
<P>Daria: Look, why don’t you try to get some sleep?  You must be tired.
<P>Quinn: Since when do you care?

</I><P>Link: Well?
<P>Trent: Well, what?
<P>Link: Aren’t you going to ask me why I was running away?

<I><P>pause

<P>Trent: Kind of.  I moved into the back yard for a few months.
<P>Link: That’s not running away.
<P>Trent: It’s all how you look at it.  I was trying to see if someone gave enough of a damn to invite me back in.  I might have run away for the same reason.
<P>Link: I don’t want to go back.
<P>Trent: Bummer.
<P>Link: Hey, you’re not making me go back, if that’s what you’re thinking.

</I><P>Link: So, what happened with the back yard thing?  You still living there?
<P>Trent: <I>(laughs and coughs)</I> Nah.  Janey asked if I could come back because she was scared of this lightning storm.  We were pretty young then, though.  I was about your age, I guess.

<P>Daria: What’s the problem?
<P>Jane: Flat tire.  But I can handle it.
<P>Trent: Aw, man, I knew I should have gotten another tire.
<P>Daria: Trent, are you saying the spare’s missing?
<P>Trent: Nah, it’s in there.  But it’s got about six holes in it.
<P>Jane: Oh, perfect.  What the hell do we do now?
<P>Daria: How did you get six holes in a tire before noticing it was flat?
<P>Trent: Well, Monique and I had just broken up, and –
<P>Jane: This is really a story for some other time!  Dammit, what are we going to do now?
<P>Quinn: Can’t we put all the animals into just two cars and leave this… <U>thing</U> here by the side of the road?
<P>Trent: Ouch.  That’s my car you’re talking about.
<P>Daria: It wouldn’t work anyway, we can’t fit everyone into two cars.  Maybe the spare from the Lexus will fit.  <I>(Daria starts to head back to the car, and notices Link wandering slowly and thoughtfully a few feet off the side of the road.)</I>  Uh, Jane, can you take care of it?
<P>Jane: <I>(noticing Link as well)</I> Sure.
<I><P>Daria walks over to Link, who’s found a large rock to sit on.
</I><P>Daria: Hey, you all right?
<P>Link: <I>(sourly)</I> Oh, I’m great.  I’m an eleven-year-old runaway in the desert in the middle of nowhere.  My life sucks.  But otherwise, I’m fine.
<P>Daria: <I>(sitting down as well)</I>  Link, I wish I had some answers for you.  I don’t.  Sometimes life isn’t fair.  Most of the time, actually.
<P>Link: At least your parents want you around.  Oh, I know mine will come and get me, but it’s just because they have to.  Just like you’re going to have to take me back.
<P>Daria: So, you are coming back with us then?
<P>Link: Don’t treat me like I’m stupid or something.  I’m coming back with you because I don’t have a choice.  I’m just a child, remember?
<P>Daria: <I>(standing up)</I>  I’ll let you know when the tire’s fixed.
<I><P>Daria heads back over to the cars, where Jane is getting the tire attached.
</I><P>Jane: It’s not an exact match, but it’ll do as long as we keep the speed down to forty-five or so.  Sorry, this trip just got longer.
<P>Daria: More good news.  Hey Trent, can I talk to you for a second?
<P>Trent: Sure thing, Daria.  You don’t need any more help, do you Jane?
<P>Jane: "More" help would indicate that you’d provided some help in the first place.  I’m fine, thanks.
<I><P>Daria and Trent walk some distance away.
</I><P>Daria: You’ve probably noticed that Links’s not doing terribly well.
<P>Trent: He’s just mad at the world.  Hates his family.  We’ve all felt like that one time or another.
<P>Daria: Yeah, but he’s in a really bad way.  I mean, what if we hadn’t found him tonight?  Who knows what might have happened to him?
<P>Trent: I know what you mean.  The world can be a pretty scary place sometimes.  I’ve seen some weird stuff out there.
<P>Daria: Trent, I’ve tried, and I can’t make a good connection with him.  Can you talk to him?  Maybe he can relate to another guy a little better.
<P>Trent: Whoa, I don’t know, Daria.  I mean, I’m not exactly a role model.
<P>Daria: Don’t sell yourself short, Trent.  You can be a pretty together guy when you want to.
<P>Trent: I don’t think he likes me much.
<P>Daria: He doesn’t like anyone right now.  That’s the problem.  I know I’ve already asked a lot from you tonight, but can you try to talk to him?  I’m worried about what he might do next if he doesn’t get some help from someone.

<P>Link: Your van.
<P>Trent: Actually, it’s my drummer’s van.  But I actually seem to drive it a lot more than he does.  Weird, that.

<P>Daria: I never saw any bruises on him.  He doesn’t seem scared of home, it’s more like he’s angry about it.  My guess is that he’s telling it like it is, that he just doesn’t feel like he’s wanted there, or important enough for anyone to give a damn.
<P>Quinn: That’s so sad.
<P>Daria: And the thing is, there’s not much that can be done about that.  It’s not like he’s being beaten, or locked in the closet, or something.  He’s just, well…

And then I have to hear about how I should be grateful that I have a roof over my head and food on my plate, because there’s so many kids who have it worse than I do.

</I><P>Trent: Hey Link.  I know you’re hurting.  I’ve been there.  And things worked out okay for me.  There’s no guarantees, but things might work out okay for you if you can hang in there.
<P>Link: How did you get through it all?
<P>Trent: I had my music.  That helps a lot, you know.  You need a way to let this stuff out.

<P>Trent: They had kind of a hands-off style.  We kids kind of took care of ourselves.  My sister Penny was more of a mom to me than Mom was.
<P>Link: Do you have a younger brother?
<P>Trent: Nope.  My brother’s older than me.  Of course, there’s Janey.
<P>Link: I’ll bet you’re a good older brother.
<P>Trent: <I>(a little embarrassed)</I> Yeah, well, I guess I don’t do too bad.



<I><P>Link looks back out the window, no longer looking angry, just sad.  Trent looks much the same way.  He scratches his head, and notices that the chinchilla is still there.  He decides to leave it.

<P>EXT:  Fremont Animal Shelter



<I><P>The various cages are lined up in from of the shelter.  Jane and Quinn are opening cans of food and giving one to each animal.  Trent is busy tying the dogs to whatever he can find.



</I><P>Link: Think they’ll be all right?
<P>Daria: Better than they would have been.  Seriously, it’s a warm night, and I’m pretty sure this place opens at six AM.  They’ll be okay for a few hours.  Most of them are already going to sleep.
<P>Link: Cool.  I’m, uh, going to go help Quinn.  <I>(he runs off)
<P>Daria heads over to Trent.
</I><P>Daria: Did you talk to him?
<P>Trent: He’s a really sad little dude, Daria.  But I think he’ll be all right.
<P>Daria: Thanks, Trent.
<P>Trent: Hey, no problem.  Glad I could help.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>A BIT LATER…
<P>&nbsp;
<I><P>The cars are parked outside a convenience store.  Everyone’s sitting in the van, taking a rest.
</I><P>Jane: I can’t believe we actually pulled it off.  We are just too cool.
<P>Link: <I>(yawns)</I> I guess we have to go home now.
<P>Daria: I wish there was some other way, Link.
<P>Link: There isn’t.  But, maybe things will work out.
<P>Quinn: <I>(sitting next to Link)</I>  We couldn’t have done this without you, Link.  <I>(she kisses him on the forehead) </I> Thank you.
<P>Link: <I>(blushing furiously)</I> Umm… uh… wow.
<P>Jane: On that note, I need to get going.  Like I said, I have my own agenda tonight.  <I>(she jumps out of the Tank and heads off to Trent’s car)
</I><P>Daria: You ready to go, Trent?
<I><P>Trent says nothing, for he is asleep
</I><P>Daria: At least he waited until the van was parked.
<P>Quinn: What’s that on his head?
<P>Link: <I>(yawning again)</I>  It’s a chinchilla.
<P>Daria: Let’s just leave them be.  It’s probably not safe to let Trent do any more driving tonight anyway.  And I doubt it’s the first time he’s spent the night in this thing in a strange town a hundred miles from home.
<I><P>Daria, Quinn, and Link leave the van and pull out in the Lexus.

<P>Daria: Who knows?  But we should probably be grateful Mom’s a lawyer, just in case they figure out who did it.
<P>Quinn: <I>(glancing back at Link)</I>  Do you think Link will be okay?
<P>Daria: I think he knows that there are people he can turn to now.  That helps.
<P>Quinn: Yeah.  <I>(smiles a bit)</I>  It’s nice knowing that when you have a real problem, there are people you can go to for help.

</I><P>Daria: I figured he wouldn’t have locked it.  Probably hoping there would be a break-in.
<P>Quinn: That only happens at coffee shops and animal shelters.
<P>Daria: <I>(tiny chuckle)</I> Spending time with me and my friends is rubbing off on you, Quinn.
<P>Quinn: <I>(eyes going wide)</I>  I just appealed to your sense of humor, didn’t I?
<P>Daria: Yup.
<P>Quinn: God, just get me home so I can put on some makeup and watch Fashion Vision.
<I><P>Quinn lays Link down on the couch.
</I><P>Quinn: Goodnight, Link.
<P>Link: <I>(mumbling in his sleep)</I> …kiss me again, Quinn…
<P>Quinn: What?
<P>Daria: Hey, don’t wake him up.  I’m betting he doesn’t want this dream interrupted.
<P>Quinn: That’s just weird, Daria.
<P>Daria: Whatever.  Let’s get home.  I’m bushed.
<P>Quinn: By the way, what was Jane being all mysterious about?
<P>Daria: She’ll tell me tomorrow, I’m sure.

<I><P>A newspaper page fills the screen:
</I><B><P ALIGN="CENTER">BREAK-IN AT LOCAL ANIMAL SHELTER
<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="CENTER">Animals and equipment found at Fremont Shelter 100 miles away



</B></FONT><P>Mr.Clay: So, Quinn, what do you have to say for yourself?



<I><P>The newspaper is lowered.  Quinn is sitting across from Mr. Clay’s desk.  She looks a little scared, but is keeping control of herself fairly well.



</I><P>Quinn: Well Mr. Clay, it seems you won’t have to, you know, unitize them anymore.  Isn’t it great that someone found a new home for them all?
<P>Mr. Clay: Look, Quinn.  There’s going to be an investigation, and I’m sure that some kind of evidence will be found.  For instance, the tire marks on the pavement as three vehicles pulled out of here at high speed.  Or the footprints left in the dog run, the fingerprints on the cages...  Do I need to go on?
<P>Quinn: <I>(looking a lot less confident)</I> Um…
<P>Mr. Clay: Unfortunately, it seems that someone hosed down the tire marks this morning, blurring them beyond recognition.  The footprints in the dog run seem to have been stomped over.  And the only clear fingerprints on the cages are yours, which makes sense, as you’ve been feeding the animals regularly for the past few weeks.  There doesn’t seem to be much in the way of physical evidence left.
<P>Quinn: <I>(confused)</I> Huh?
<P>Mr. Clay: It also appears that the publicity from this event has resulted in plans for a substantial increase in our budget, ostensibly for more security equipment.  A little creative bookkeeping should allow that to go toward more and larger animal enclosures, more food, and more help, all of which should allow us to finally become the no-kill shelter we’ve always strived to be.  In addition, we have about a dozen new volunteers ready to start next week.
<I><P>Quinn nods, her expression one of complete surprise.
</I><P>Mr. Clay: Which brings us back to you, Quinn.  In light of the fine work you’ve done here over the past few weeks, I’m pleased to award you with an A on this project.  I’ll be sorry to see you go, but in light of recent events – meaning, of course, our large number of new volunteers – it would probably be best if you found another area in which to volunteer your time from now on.  I trust you understand?
<P>Quinn: Yes, sir.
<P>Mr. Clay: Now, off the record, I have to say I admire whomever our mysterious visitor was, for his or her commitment and courage, and I would thank that person - if I could - for doing more for this shelter in one night than any other single person has in the entire eight years we’ve been open.  On the record, however, I’d have to warn that that sort of behavior could get someone into serious trouble someday.  Do I make myself clear?
<P>Quinn: Yes, Mr. Clay.  And… thank you.  For my grade, I mean.
<P>Mr. Clay: <I>(smiling)</I> Of course, Quinn.  You’re quite welcome.

</I><P>Daria: Okay, maybe in a small way I kinda sorta missed you.
<P>Tom: <I>(through the phone)</I> Aw, don’t make me blush.  So, what have you been up to while I’ve been gone?
<P>Daria: I could tell you.  But then, of course, I’d have to kill you.
<I><P>There’s a loud ruckus from downstairs that sounds a lot like a primal scream from Jake.
</I><P>Daria: Uh, Tom, I’ll have to call you back.  My father has gone off the deep end.
<P>Tom: I heard that from here.  Let me know what happens.
<I><P>Daria hangs up and goes out to the stairs, looking down on the living room.



<P>Jake is crouched behind the sofa, dressed in camouflage and black-streaked face paint, carrying a large net.

<P>Daria: That’s just leftover kitchen sink stew.
<P>Jake: AAAHH!!  Oh, Daria, it’s you!  Get down, there are vicious creatures all over the house!  Your mother wouldn’t believe me, but I know they’re here!
<P>Daria: Uh, Dad?  Where <U>is</U> Mom?
<P>Jake: Your mother’s fine, I left her at the hotel.  It’s better that way, this kind of work is best left to a professional!
<P>Daria: Yes, I think this situation definitely calls for a professional of some kind.
<P>Jake: Quiet, kiddo.  They can hear you…



<I><P>Jake takes a sudden flying leap over the sofa and rolls to a protected position beside the TV.  He then crawls on his stomach across the living room, looking for prey.

<I><P>Helen bursts in.
</I><P>Helen: Jake, just what the <B>HELL</B> do you think you’re doing!!
<P>Jake: Helen!  I can explain, really!
<P>Helen: You barricade me in the bathroom, take my car, and drive all the way back here on some wild search for rabid animals – I had to take a cab all the way from Middleton, do you have any idea how much that costs? – and just where the hell did you get that ridiculous outfit??
<P>Daria: It probably wasn’t Cashman’s.
<P>Jake: Helen!  You’ve got to believe me!  There are wild animals in the house!&nbsp; Dozens - no, <U>hundreds</U> of them!&nbsp; They're sneaky.. .they're hiding... they're <U>everywhere</U>!!
<P>Helen: Jake, there are no animals in the house.  Now put down the net and let's talk about this rationally.
<P>Jake: I’ll prove it to you!  Come with me!
<I><P>Jake grabs Helen and starts dragging her into the kitchen.
</I><P>Helen: Really, Jake… you’re making an ass of yourself…
<I><P>Quinn comes in.

<P>Daria: Dad’s searching the house for animals.  It’s not a pretty sight.

<P>Link: <I>(frowns)</I> No.  Unfortunately, they’ll be here in about two hours.
<P>Trent: Ah, well.  Hey, I wanted to give you something.
<P>Link: What?
<I><P>Trent hefts a box punched with holes.
</I><P>Trent: He wouldn’t last long around my house.  I thought maybe you could take care of him for me.



<I><P>Link looks in the box.  It’s the chinchilla.



</I><P>Link: Cool!  But… my mother probably wouldn’t let me keep him.  Forget it.
<P>Trent: Hey, from what I understand, she'll probably never notice.&nbsp;
<P>Link: Good point.
<P>Trent: And if you ever want guitar lessons, we could probably set that up.  As long as you don’t want to learn open D-tuning.  Never did figure that one out myself.
<P>Link: You’re on, Trent.
<P>Trent: You could come over to my place after school.&nbsp; I'm usually awake by then.&nbsp; Maybe Wednesday?
<P>Link: <I>(smiling like we’ve never seen before)</I>  Thanks a lot, Trent.  Oh, and will I see Daria at your place?&nbsp; She's not so bad.&nbsp;
<P>Trent: Yeah... but you probably won't see her sister much.
<P>Link:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; She's not really my type anyway.

</I><P>Jane: So we actually got away with it?  No repercussions, no charges filed, no night in Juvy?
<P>Daria: The shelter got enough publicity out of the event to make up for it.  Quinn got off the hook scot-free, the rest of us were never even suspected.
<P>Jane: Dammit!  How am I ever going to get a record going if people keep cutting deals every time I have a brush with the law?
<P>Daria: It would all be cleared anyway when you reach eighteen.
<P>Jane: That’s the point.  I’ve only got a few months left to do something criminal and get away with it.&nbsp; Besides, I could have taken those Polaroids and gotten away with that too, dammit!
<P>Daria: Speaking of criminal acts, how did your little vandalism project go?
<P>Jane: All will be revealed at the proper time.  In the meantime, I got my B, and they can’t take that away now.  How’d you do?
<P>Daria: Marge said she didn’t believe in grading.  She thought I should give myself the grade I thought I deserved.

It is my sad duty to report that those bastards – excuse me, those… people… over at Oakwood High have been awarded the grant for highest participation in the Outreach program.

<P>As always, I’ll keep ‘em brief.
<P>This story turned out to be very, very long, long enough so that I came very close to losing interest completely.  In the end I posted the first chapter alone, hoping that it would give me incentive to finish it.  It ticked a few people off doing it that way, but the job got done.
<P>After having planned and started this story, I discovered a disturbing similarity between its premise and that of "The Old and the Beautiful" – an episode I hadn’t actually seen, but once I discovered this plot had been done before, I decided to refer to it.  I think the stories ended up dissimilar enough to prevent accusations of plagiarism.
<P>Holding a School Review Meeting on Sunday is, of course, a take from the Fizz Ed episode (which happens <U>after</U> this story) in which Ms. Li pulled the same stunt.  I assumed she’d probably done it before.
<P>The Shawshank Redemption, based on a work by Stephen King.  It’s about a guy in prison, and that’s all I’ll say about it because those who haven’t seen it shouldn’t know the plot in advance.  I highly recommend the film.  I haven’t read the book.
<P>I realize I’m guilty of a little Sandi-bashing here, but I tried to at least make her a sympathetic character.
<P>Trent’s description of how he got back into the house after six months in a tent is borrowed from Ruthless Bunny’s short story "Intense".  I recommend that story as well as everything else R.B. has written.
<P>Daria owes Quinn a favor after my previous story, "Is Summer Over Already?".&nbsp; While I generally try to make each of my stories stand alone, this was a case where a plot point was most easily resolved by referring to an earlier incident.
<P>Of course, season five shows no indication that Trent and Link are hanging out together.  But, it doesn’t show that they’re not either.  I think Trent and Link would get along very well, mostly because Trent won’t pass judgement and Link needs someone who’s an adult but also totally non-threatening.  His crush on Quinn was purely for comic value, but hey, wouldn’t any eleven-year-old boy be smitten with her?
<P>Thanks to everyone for their encouragement toward the final stages of this story, thanks to Glenn Eichler and the rest of the Daria crew over at MTV, thanks to the webmasters who posted this story.
<P>And most of all, thanks to my wife Rachel who is nothing short of the finest beta-reader any writer could ask for.  She’s cute, too.
