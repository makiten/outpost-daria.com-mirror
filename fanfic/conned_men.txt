
I guess this is where I should write stuff like "This is my first fanfic
so bear with me" and all.  Anyway, after a week of reading Daria fan 
fiction and stuff, I've finally broken down and have decided to work on 
my own fanfic.  If you like it, read the end comments, okay?  Thanks
a million!

BTW, I used C.E. Forman's format style, since I guess most of you would 
feel comfortable with it.

--IN A NUTSHELL:

Trent and Mystik Spiral get an offer from a mysterious man to open for a
well-known rock band whose tour stops at Lawndale.  Trent is overjoyed,
but Daria and Jane are suspicious.  Meanwhile, Quinn wins four tickets,
supposedly for a *boy band* concert in Lawndale.  Coincidence?

--SPECIAL NOTES:

Boy band lovers, please don't be offended by what you're going to read
here!  Remember: it's just a fanfic... ;)

ACT 1.

INT.: MCGRUNDY'S PUB.

(Mystik Spiral is finishing their act on the stage.  Jesse mindlessly 
strums chords while headbanging, and Max goes wild on the drums.  Trent 
does a bluesy riff, ending with a heavy power chord and a bow.)

TRENT: (into mike.) Thank you, and good night.

(Scattered applause.)

TRENT: (to the band.) I'll be outside, guys.

CUT TO:

EXT.: MCGRUNDY'S PUB, EVENING.

(Trent exits the pub, guitar in hand.  He's rubbing his chin thoughfully
when a silhouette of a man appears behind him.)

DEEP VOICE: Excuse me.

TRENT: Eh?  Yeah?

DEEP VOICE: You're from that band, right?  Mystik Spiral?

TRENT: Yeah.

DEEP VOICE: Are you Trent Lane?

TRENT: Yeah.

DEEP VOICE: Why don't we go somewhere so we could talk?

(Trent narrows his eyes.)

TRENT: Who're you?

(A silhouette of a hand gives Trent a business card.  He looks at it
for a while, then looks up to the man.)

CUT TO:

EXT.: LANE RESIDENCE, EVENING.

CUT TO:

INT.: LANE RESIDENCE, LIVING ROOM.

(Trent enters with his guitar case, grinning like an idiot.  He drops his
guitar on the floor and plops down on the couch, his hands under his head.
He starts laughing to himself.)

JANE: (enters from kitchen.) What, Nick accepted your bet and played naked
      like Flea?

TRENT: Oh, hi, Janey.  (sits up.)  Nah, nothing like that.  Here.

(He hands Jane the man's business card.  Jane looks at it and raises her
eyebrows.)

JANE: "R.R. Shaw Entertainment Services?"  What is this?

TRENT: He manages bands and stuff.  He was at McGrundy's tonight and he
       liked out act.  Said we might make it big.

JANE: This isn't some rip-off con artist thing, is it?

TRENT: (feigns hurt.) Don't you think we're that good, Janey?

JANE: (pretends to consider what he said.) Umm, let you know tomorrow. 
      (she leaves.)

TRENT: Yeah, yeah.  (he looks at the business card again and laughs.)

CUT TO:

EXT.: LAWNDALE HIGH, NEXT MORNING.

CUT TO:

INT.: LAWNDALE HIGH, MR. DEMARTINO'S CLASSROOM.

(The class is livelier than usual, to Mr. DeMartino's chagrin.  Paper 
airplanes are flying everywhere, and Kevin is busy making out with 
Brittany.  Jane is drawing something on a sheet of paper, while Daria 
looks on, observing.)

DEMARTINO: (eye twitching.) As I was SAYing...AS I was saying...as I WAS 
           saying...DAMMIT will EVERYONE SHUT UP?

(No reaction.  The class continues to be rowdy.)

DEMARTINO: (to himself.) You don't want to go back to the loony bin,
           Anthony.  Keep your cool.  (to class.) CLASS?

(Still no reaction.  Cut to shot of Daria and Jane.)

JANE: It's coming.  It's gonna happen.

DARIA: Uh-huh.  So what else is new?

DEMARTINO: (offscreen.) AUUUUUGGGGGGHHHHHHH!

(Cut to shot of class, staring at the camera, frozen.  DeMartino's scream
echoes throughout.)

DISSOLVE TO:

INT.: LAWNDALE HIGH SCHOOL, MR. DEMARTINO'S CLASSROOM, MINUTES LATER.

(Ms. Li has replaced Mr. DeMartino in front of the class.  The class is 
silent, save for Brittany's constant sobbing.)

LI: I'm afraid Mr. DeMartino will not be able to make it on time to finish 
    your class.  This being the week's last period--

BRITTANY: (offscreen.) But--but he SCARED me, Kevvy!

KEVIN: (offscreen.) It's okay, babe...I'll protect you!

LI: THIS BEING THE WEEK'S LAST PERIOD, I've decided to dismiss you early.
    You may visit Mr. DeMartino in the hospital.  Monetary donations are     
    welcome.  Address checks to the Lawndale High School Board.  Dismissed!

CUT TO:

EXT.: SIDEWALK.

(Daria and Jane are walking home from school.)

JANE: That was the worst one yet!

DARIA: People like DeMartino make school worth going to everyday.

JANE: Not to mention a helluva lot more fun!  You do consider being
      surrounded by psychotic teachers and dumb jocks fun, don't you?

DARIA: Why not?  I've lived through seventeen years of it.

CUT TO:

EXT.: MORGENDORFFER RESIDENCE.

(Daria and Jane walk up to Daria's house.  Sandi's car is parked outside.)

DARIA: Fashion Club alert.  Let's go to your house.

(They continue walking.)

CUT TO:

INT.: MORGENDORFFER RESIDENCE, LIVING ROOM.

(Quinn and her Fashion Club cohorts are gathered around the TV set.)

STACY: Thanks again for inviting us over to watch the five-hour special 
       of "2001: A Fashion Odyssey," Quinn!

TIFFANY: Yeeeaaaah, thaaaat was niiiiice of youuuuuu.

QUINN: Aww, cut it out, you guys!  Anyway, what else can we do?  When I
       found out that Sandi's TV was on the blink, I had to do something.
       I'm glad you guys are here.

SANDI: So, Quinn, are you saying that you're glad that our TV set is
       broken?

QUINN: Of course not, Sandi!  What I meant was--

SANDI: Gee, if Quinn's TV is so much more reliable, maybe QUINN should be
       the pres--

QUINN: Sandi, we're not going to go through this again, are we?  I thought
       this discussion was, you know, over.

SANDI: Are you saying that I'm not keeping up with the times?

TIFFANY: Loooook, it's staaaartiiiiing.

(2001 music starts playing.  Cut to frontal shot of FC staring at the 
screen.)

CUT TO:

INT.: LANE RESIDENCE, KITCHEN.

(Trent is on the phone when Daria and Jane enter.  He looks excited.)

TRENT: He'll call me back in a few minutes?  Okay.  Okay.  Thanks.  Bye.  
       (he hangs up and sees the girls.)  Hi Janey, Daria.

DARIA: Mm.

JANE: Hey, was that--?

TRENT: Mr. Shaw's secretary.  She said he'll call me back.

DARIA: "Mr. Shaw?"

TRENT: He's Mystik Spiral's new manager.

DARIA: Sounds like a con artist. (Trent surprises Daria with a glare.)

JANE: Trent met him last night at McGrundy's.  From what I've been hearing,
      this guy is the real McCoy.

DARIA: Mm.

(The phone in the kitchen rings.  Trent dives for it with surprising
enthusiasm.)

TRENT: Yeah?

(Cut to shot of Daria and Jane.)

DARIA: I've never seen Trent get excited and all about anything before.

JANE: Well, there WAS the time when Jimi Hendrix rose up from the grave
      and gave Trent a call during Halloween.  Except that it was
      acutally their drummer, Max.  Trent waited beside the phone for
      a week before he found out.

DARIA: That Jimi Hendrix is dead?

(Jane smirks and looks at Trent.)

TRENT: Sure, Mr. Shaw!  Hey, thanks a lot!

(Cut to shot of Daria and Jane looking at each other and shrugging.)

DARIA: He IS acting weird, but at least he hasn't reached the stage of
       going goo-goo ga-ga over something that's really superficial.

CUT TO:

INT.: MORGENDORFFER RESIDENCE, LIVING ROOM.

(Same shot of FC watching TV as before.)

FEMALE INTERVIEWER: (offscreen.) So, Cindy, do you have anything else
                    to say before we go?

BUBBLY, AIRHEADED VOICE: (OS.) Like, no, not really!

INTERVIEWER: (OS.) How about you, Tyra?

AIRHEADED, SHALLOW VOICE: (OS.) Platform shoes!  Neat!

INTERVIEWER: (OS.) Right.  And you, Claudia?

SHALLOW, BUBBLY VOICE: (OS.) Do you like my nail polish?

TIFFANY: Thiiiis show is soooooo coooooool.

CUT TO:

INT.: LANE RESIDENCE, KITCHEN.

(Trent, Jane and Daria are seated around the kitchen table.)

JANE: So, anything new with Mr. Shaw?

TRENT: You're not going to belive this, Janey.  He got us an audition
       to open for Ciggie Butt when they start their tour next week!

JANE: No.

TRENT: Yep.

JANE: Mystik Spiral is going to tour with Ciggie Butt?

TRENT: Ciggie Butt!

DARIA: What the hell is Ciggie Butt?

TRENT: We would've seen them perform live if we ever got to Alternapalooza 
       last year.

DARIA: Just when I thought names couldn't get any sillier.  Maybe you
       guys should change your name to Junkie's Pot.

TRENT: Ciggie Butt...Junkie's Pot...hmm...

JANE: Well, we'll leave you to your thinking, Trent-o.  C'mon, Daria,
      let's watch TV.

CUT TO:

INT.: MORGENDORFFER RESIDENCE, LIVING ROOM.

(Still the same shot as before.)

FEMALE ANNOUNCER: (OS.) And now, for our special "Guess the name of the
                  band and the song" contest!  We will play a snippet
                  of a song, and--you guessed it!--you will have to
                  guess the name of the band and the song!  The first
                  to call and answer correctly will win a special prize
                  from the 2001 team!

(A song by [insert name of cheesiest boy band you know here] starts playing.
All four FC members suddenly dive for the phone.)

ALL: I know it!  Me!  Me!

(Finally Quinn gets up from the tangle with the cordless in her hand.)

QUINN: Hello, 2001 Fashion Odyssey?  I know the answer!  I know it!  It's
       [stupid title of a song that has "girl" and "baby" written all
       over it] sung by [aforementioned boy band name here]!

PHONE OPERATOR: (OS.) You're absolutely correct!  May I have your full
                name, age and phone number?

QUINN: (whispers to FC.) I got it!  I got it!

SANDI: Gee, if Quinn can win in a TV show contest, maybe she should be--

(Sandi's voice is drowned out by Stacy's squeal of joy.  Sandi glares.)

CUT TO:

INT.: LANE RESIDENCE, JANE'S BEDROOM.

SICK SAD WORLD ANNOUNCER: (OS.)They sold their souls to the devil, 
                          and all they got was this stupid interview!  
                          Underappreciated Satanist rock stars, next on
                          Sick Sad World!

DARIA: Don't you smell some kind of a scam here?  Does Trent really
       trust this Mr. Shaw guy?

JANE: All I can say is that Mystik Spiral has got NOTHING to lose.

DARIA: But you have your suspicions, right?

JANE: Heck, I've never even seen the guy, Daria.  Anyway, you don't have
      to get concerned or anything about Trent.  He doesn't even have
      the brains to be concerned about himself.

DARIA: Okay.  I'd just, you know, hate to see anyone I know get caught
       up in a scam by some two-bit con artist.  Change the channel,
       will you?

(Jane presses a button on the remote.)

FEMALE ANNOUNCER: (OS.) Let's welcome our winning caller for our
                  "Guess the name of the band and the song" contest,
                  Quinn Morgendorffer!  Hello, Quinn?

QUINN'S VOICE: (OS.) Hi!

DARIA: Okay, almost anyone.

INT.: LAWNDALE GENERAL HOSPITAL, MR. DEMARTINO'S ROOM.

(Mr. O'Neill is here, sitting in the chair beside Mr. DeMartino's bed.)

O'NEILL: You see, Anthony, what I'm saying is that maybe you need to
         develop a new approach to deal with these kids.  Maybe the hard-
         assed method is a bet, heh heh, out of date?

DEMARTINO: And I SUPPOSE I should try MELLOWING out like YOU do and start
           AVERAGING three or four walk-outs while crying every WEEK!

O'NEILL: (Lower lip trembles but he regains his composure.) Not at all,
         Anthony!  I'm just saying that perhaps, instead of relying on
         intimidation, it might help you to start to get to know your
         students better!

DEMARTINO: I know ALL that there is to know about my STUDENTS!  That boy,
           Thompson, for instance...

O'NEILL: Curtis might be a little slow, but--

DEMARTINO: KEVIN.

O'NEILL: Oh, my. (Titters.) Yes, Kevin.  He might be a little slow, but
         just try and give him one more chance!  He needs your support,
         not your anger.

DEMARTINO: At this point, I'm WILLING to try ANYTHING.

O'NEILL: Great!  I have a plan...

INT.: MORGENDORFFER RESIDENCE, KITCHEN.

(Daria, Quinn and Helen are in their usual places.  Jake walks in,
holding a stack of mail.)

JAKE: Mail's here! (He places the stack on the table and starts shuffling
      through them.) Bills, bills, bills.  What do they think I am?  I'm 
      only a man, damn it!  But nooooo, these pigs see me as some big
      fat wallet that they can dig into anytime they--Quinn, this is for
      you, honey.  Now where was I?

HELEN: Sit down, Jake. (Jake takes his seat.) Quinn, you have mail?

DARIA: Maybe they finally accepted your application to "Thumbsuckers
       Anonymous."

HELEN: Daria!

JAKE: Don't worry, Quinn!  I know how it feels like to be alone and
      unappreciated!  Oh, boy, DO I!  I don't care if you still suck
      your thumb when you're alone and afraid!  Why, I--

HELEN: Jake!  Quinn, why don't you open it, dearie?

QUINN: (Looks inside envelope.) Oh my GOD!  I almost forgot!  I won the
       contest on "2001: A Fashion Odyssey" last night!

DARIA: Oh, I remember now.  I heard you over the TV last night.  I thought
       I was having a nightmare.

QUINN: Look!  Tickets for four to the [THAT boy band] concert in Lawndale
       next week!

HELEN: That's great, dear.  Now we can all go!

QUINN and DARIA: NO!!!

JANE: (In bed, ruffled hair and all.) Hello?  Who's this?  I'm sorry, but
      he won't be awake for a couple of--

TRENT'S VOICE: (OS on the other line, and very much awake.) Hello?
               Mr. Shaw?

JANE: Oh, brother. (She hangs up and looks at the clock.  It's 7 in the
      morning.) It's the end of the world.

CUT TO:

INT.: LANE RESIDENCE, TRENT'S ROOM.

(Trent is sitting up with his guitar on his lap.  He's on the phone.)

MR. SHAW (DEEP VOICE): (OS.) I'm glad I could reach you this morning,
                       Trent.

TRENT: (Chuckles nervously.) No problem, Mr. Shaw.  Any news about the
       auditions?

MR. SHAW: (OS.) Do you think you can make it if we set it this afternoon?
          I'll have someone ready to pick you up.

TRENT: Hell, sure, Mr. Shaw!  Anything you say!

MR. SHAW: Great!  Ciggie Butt will be observing you.

TRENT: That's great.  Man, this is so exciting!

MR. SHAW: (Laughs.) I'm sure it is.  Don't worry, soon bands will be
          dying to open for you, Trent.  I'm sure of it.

TRENT: Thanks.  We'll be ready.

MR. SHAW: See you this afternoon. (Hangs up.)

TRENT: (Strums his guitar.) Ciggie Butt.  (Laughs.)

CUT TO:

INT.: MORGENDORFFER RESIDENCE, DARIA'S ROOM.

(Daria is in a split-screen phone conversation with Jane.)

DARIA: Ciggie Butt.

JANE: Okay, it sounds dumb, but come on.  If a group with a name like
      [THE boy band] can make it big...

DARIA: That reminds me.  Quinn won four tickets to their concert here
       in Lawndale next week.

JANE: For Ciggie Butt?

DARIA: Can you stop saying that?  It makes me want to jump out the
       window or something.  No, I'm talking about [boy band! :)].

JANE: That's a coincidence.  Ciggie Butt is performing next Saturday,
      too.

DARIA: Hopefully not in the same place.

JANE: There'll be hell to pay if that happens.

DARIA: Where WILL Ciggie Butt perform?  Lawndale doesn't have a big
       enough spot to set up a concert?

JANE: Can you say "Laaaaawndale High?"

(There is a pause.  Daria looks incredulous.)

DARIA: This is ridiculous.  Ms. Li is actually allowing an indie-rock
       band whose name promotes smoking to play on campus?

JANE: There's a woman who needs to set her morals straight.

DARIA: She needs to find them first.

JANE: Point taken.

DARIA: And I take it that Trent told you all about this?

JANE: Yep.  Mr. Shaw says it's all being kept hush-hush.

DARIA: That's stupid.  Why would a band go on a tour without advertising
       it first?  Why is Ciggie Butt going to Lawndale anyway, if they're
       so big?

JANE: Beats me.

DARIA: I think this is a fraud.

JANE: I think I'm starting to believe you, partner.

CUT TO:

INT.: LANE RESIDENCE, LIVING ROOM.

(Mystik Spiral is waiting in here with their gear.  Daria and Jane are
also here.)

JANE: So, can we come with you guys?

TRENT: I guess.  If there's space left in the van.

MAX: I still can't understand why we can't take the Tank!  It's, like,
     it's US!

(Doorbell rings.)

JESSE: They're here.  Cool.

(Trent opens the door to a youngish man dressed as a chauffeur.)

MAN: (In annoying nasal voice.) Hello, uh, Mr. Shaw sent me to pick up
     Mystik Spiral?

TRENT: Right.  Hold on. (to band.) Let's get everything loaded up, guys.

MAN: Right.  I'll wait for you in the van.

TRENT: By the way, do you mind if my sister and her friend tag along?
       They sorta want to see us audition.

MAN: Uh, I'm sorry, but Mr. Shaw doesn't want any guests.  It's the rules.
     You know, hush-hush? (He leaves.)

TRENT: (Walks up to Daria and Jane.) I guess you'll both have to sit this
       one out.  Sorry.

JANE: S'fine.

DARIA: Mm.

TRENT: (Picking up his guitar case.) Don't worry.  You can catch us
       when we play next week. (He smiles and leaves with the band.)

MAX: (OS.) We're going to ride in THIS?  What a hunk of JUNK!

(Daria and Jane listen to the van drive off, then they look at each
other and run outside.)

CUT TO:

EXT.: LANE RESIDENCE, AFTERNOON.

(Soon, a battered blue car drives up.)

JANE: Right on schedule.

TOM: Hi Jane, Daria.

(Jane gets in beside Tom, while Daria settles down in the back seat.)

JANE: Follow that van, driver!

TOM: You got it. (He accelerates.) Hey, Daria.  Having fun yet?

DARIA: Not until this hunk of junk stalls in traffic.

(Tom and Jane chuckle.)

CUT TO:

EXT.: SLUMMY-LOOKING BUILDING, AFTERNOON.

(Tom stops the car outside a slummy-looking building.  Mr. Shaw's van
is parked right outside.)

TOM: Here we are, girls.  Do you know what you're supposed to do?

DARIA: I'm starting to feel like we're in Charlie's Angels.

JANE: Yeah, and there are three of us!  (She looks at Tom.)  You can
      be Farrah Fawcett.

TOM: Hah-hah.  Come on. (He exits the car.)

JANE: What'd I say?

DARIA: I think he wanted to be Drew Barrymore.

CUT TO:

INT.: SLUMMY-LOOKING BUILDING, LOBBY.

(Tom leads Daria and Jane inside.  The nasal-voiced man stops them.)

MAN: Hey!  You're not supposed to be here!

DARIA: We're fans of Mystik Spiral, the band that's auditioning here?
       Can we see them?

MAN: What band?  This is a warehouse, miss.

(Daria, Jane and Tom look confused.)

JANE: You sure?  I could've sworn I saw you driving them here a while
      ago.

(A phone rings offscreen.)

MAN: There's no band here, okay?  Go away. (He leaves to answer the phone.)

(The three are about to leave when they hear a particularly loud
guitar chord seemingly coming from downstairs.)

TOM: I don't believe it.  The guy was lying to us.

JANE: Come on.  Let's check it out.

(Cut to shot of closed doorway.  Tom and Jane tiptoe past it, but Daria
stops.)

DARIA: Listen!

MAN'S VOICE: (OS.) Yes, Mr. Shaw, they're right here, auditioning.
             Yes, I've collected their entrance fee. (Pause.) Five
             hundred dollars. (Pause.) Yes. (Pause.) And they won't
             be able to enter the [boy band] concert next week?
             (Pause.) You're sure?  Okay.  Then we skip town.  Right.
             (Pause.) All right, Mr. Shaw.

DARIA: I was right!  This was a scam!

JANE: Does this mean that Lawndale High is actually host to the [boy
      band] concert and not Ciggie Butt?

DARIA: Right.

JANE: Well, that makes so much more sense.  It almost makes me wish
      Ms. Li DID lose her morals.

TOM: We should tell the band.

(The door suddenly opens and the nasal man walks out.)

MAN: What're YOU kids still doing here?  I told you to scram!

TOM: Fine, fine, whatever.

(They leave.)

CUT TO:

INT.: TOM'S CAR.

(Tom is driving.  Jane and Daria are in their usual positions.)

TOM: So what exactly is going on?

DARIA: I think this "Mr. Shaw" charged the band five hundred bucks to
       play in the concert.

JANE: Trent must've been excited to meet Ciggie Butt.  I thought that
      went the other way around.

DARIA: Right.

JANE: And I guess that Mr. Shaw plans to skip town after the [boy band]
      concert.

TOM: Which the band won't be able to enter because they're really not
     in the list!

DARIA: Right!

(The three are silent for a while.)

JANE: What a stupid plan.  I can't believe Trent fell for this scam.

INT.: LAWNDALE GENERAL HOSPITAL, MR. DEMARTINO'S ROOM.

(Mr O'Neill is once again seated beside Mr. DeMartino's bed.)

O'NEILL: You're getting out of here this afternoon, Anthony!  Is
         everything all set?

DEMARTINO: For YOUR sake, I hope this WORKS.  I've been stuck in here
           for a WEEK and I'm NOT happy about it.

O'NEILL: (Chuckles nervously.)

CUT TO:

INT.: MORGENDORFFER RESIDENCE, DARIA'S ROOM.

(Daria is on the phone talking split-screen to Jane.)

DARIA: Trent still doesn't believe you?  It's been a week!

JANE: He said I was whacked in the head!  Man, Trent must really be
      itching for publicity for Mystik Spiral.

DARIA: I can't blame him.

JANE: So what should we do now?

DARIA: Just make sure they show up at school tonight.  I'll take care
       of the rest.

CUT TO:

INT.: MORGENDORFFER RESIDENCE, QUINN'S ROOM.

(Quinn is at her usual spot in front of the mirror when Daria knocks.)

QUINN: Come in! (Her expression changes when Daria enters.) What do YOU
       want?

DARIA: Quinn?  There's a guy right outside walking a really cute puppy
       and I thought you might want to know.

QUINN: Really?  A cute puppy? (She rushes out.) Gee, I hope the guy's
       cute too!

(Daria waits until Quinn leaves, then dips her hand in Quinn's handbag.
She pulls out four tickets.)

CUT TO:

INT.: THE TANK, AFTERNOON.

(Max is driving the tank.  Beside him is Jesse, and Nick, Trent and
Jane crowd in the back.)

JANE: Didn't you think it was weird that neither Mr. Shaw nor Ciggie
      Butt showed up last week?

TRENT: Nah, Mr. Shaw explained that already.  Come on, Janey, quit
       getting on his case!  He's doing us a favor and my sister is
       making up stories about him.

JANE: What*ever*.  Max, stop at that house.

(Cut to shot outside the Morgendorffer house.  The Tank stops in front of
Daria, who gets in the back.  The Tank drives off again.)

JANE: Glad you can make it.

DARIA: Anytime.  Isn't Tom coming?

JANE: He's going bowling with his friends tonight.

TRENT: That's a shame.

DARIA: So...excited about the big night?

TRENT: Yeah, but it's weird.  I don't think anyone around here knows about
       it.  Mr. Shaw said it was hush-hush.

DARIA: Who's going to be there?

TRENT: I don't know.  But if Ciggie Butt is going to be there, so are we.

NICK: Right on!

MAX and JESSE: Yeah!

JANE: Oooookay.

CUT TO:

EXT.: LAWNDALE HIGH, SUNSET.

(The Tank finds a suitable parking spot.  Mystik Spiral is surprised to
see the crowded parking lot.)

TRENT: What did I tell you, Janey?  It looks like the whole town is here
       to see Ciggie Butt!

(Cut to shot of Daria and Jane.)

JANE: (Elbowing Daria.) I wouldn't be too sure about that. (Points.)

(Cut to shot of Fasion Club near the entrance.  The guy collecting the
tickets taps his fingers on his table impatiently.)

COLLECTOR: Time's a-wastin', girls.

QUINN: (Rummaging through her bag.) I'm sure the tickets were here...

STACY: What's wrong?

TIFFANY: I thiiiiink Quiiiin looooost the ticketssssssss.

STACY: Oh, no!

SANDI: That's too bad, Quinn.  And you had all our hopes up, too.

COLLECTOR: Well?

QUINN: I-ah-kinda lost my tickets.

COLLECTOR: Sorry, then.  Can't go in.

QUINN: But I won the contest!  You can ask the people inside!

COLLECTOR: No ticket, no entry.

QUINN: (Exasperated.) All RIGHT, then!  How much is a new ticket?

SANDI: Gee, if Quinn is going to make us pay for OUR entrance, maybe
       we should just leave.  (She walks away, and the FC follows,
       leaving Quinn.)

QUINN: But...but...

(Suddenly, the three J's run up from offscreen.)

JOEY: Quinn!  Would you like to watch the concert with us?

JEFFY: We got you a ticket!

JAMIE: It was my idea!

QUINN: Awwwww...you DIDN'T!  (She enters the concert grounds, the 3 J's
       in tow.)

(Daria and Jane approach with Mystik Spiral.)

TRENT: Uhh, we're opening for the show tonight.

COLLECTOR: Opening? (He produces a notebook from under his table.) You
           fellas have a name?

TRENT: Mystik Spiral.

COLLECTOR: Mystik Spiral? (Chuckles.) What do you think this is, a rock
           concert? (He flips through his notebook.) Hey!  You guys
           aren't even in here at all!

TRENT: What?  We're opening for Ciggie Butt.

COLLECTOR: Ciggie Butt?  What's a Ciggie Butt?

TRENT: (Lunges at collector, but pulled back by Jessie and Nick.) You
       think you're being funny, man?

JESSIE: Cool, man, cool it.

NICK: I think he's telling the truth.

(Silence.)

MAX: Oh, man!  I think we've been HAD!

(Daria and Jane look at each other and roll their eyes.)

(Cut to shot of the band standing beside the Tank with Daria and Jane.)

JANE: See?  I told you Mr. Shaw was making fools out of you guys.

TRENT: I can't believe it.

DARIA: He was planning to leave town with your five hundred bucks after
       tonight.

TRENT: I'm going to kill that guy.

DARIA: You have your chance.  We think he's in there tonight.

TRENT: But we can't even get in!

DARIA: (Holds up Quinn's four tickets.) Happy New Year.

TRENT: What's this?

DARIA: They're called tickets.  You give them to the guy over there...

TRENT: (Taking the tickets.) Never mind.  Come on, guys.  I've got some
       things to say to Mr. Shaw. (Mystik Spiral saunters off.)

JANE: All right, sister.  Where did those tickets come from?

DARIA: Remind me that I owe Quinn an apology.

JANE: Not anymore.  Look.

(Cut to Quinn standing just inside the concert grounds, the three J's
fawning over her.  Outside, Sandi is fuming.  Cut back to Daria and Jane.)

DARIA: Good.  Now come on, put this on. (She produces two IDs.)

JANE: (Taking one.) Concert Committee?  And where, pray tell, did THIS
      come from?

DARIA: Easy.  I had Jodie write us both up in the committee.

(They approach the ticket guy.)

COLLECTOR: (Sees their IDs.) Go right in, missies.

DARIA: Uh, there are some instruments out back that need to be carried
       inside.  Would you send some people to help us?

COLLECTOR: (Looks over to the Tank.) Okay, no problem. (Into walkie-talkie.)
           Breaker, breaker, code 4, code 4.

(Daria and Jane look at each other and shrug.)

CUT TO:

EXT.: CONCERT GROUNDS, EARLY EVENING.

(Frontal shot of Mystik Spiral walking, all of them wearing dark frowns.
A guy gets in the way and Max shoves him aside.  The guy turns around and
collars Max.)

GUY: You lookin' for trouble, punk?

MAX: (Grins, wide-eyed.) Ah, no!  Thought you were someone else!

TRENT: There he is!

(Cut to shot of the back of Mr. Shaw's head.  He only appears as a
silhouette and appears to be wearing a hat.)

MR. SHAW: Eh?

TRENT: I think you owe us an explanation.

MAX: Yeah!  You know what happens when--

NICK: Shut up, Max.

MAX: (Whimpers.)

MR. SHAW: How amusing.  You've finally seen through my little plot.

JESSIE: Yeah!  We also figured out that you were conning us!

(Silence.)

TRENT: Uh, okay.  Now, you owe us money, Mr. Shaw.

MR. SHAW: I don't have your money.  I never collected your money.  I
          was never there.

TRENT: You dirty scumbag.  Give it up.  You'll never get away with it
       now.

MAX: (Growls.) We dipped into his sister's college fund for that, you--

(Before anyone could react, Max lunges forward and punches Mr. Shaw,
knocking him down.  Fists can be seen going up and down the bottom of
the shot while the rest of the band looks on.)

TRENT: Whoa.

JESSIE: Cool.

NICK: Come on!

(The rest of Mystik Spiral join in beating up Mr. Shaw.  Suddenly, a
voice stops all activity.  Cut to shot of stage.)

BLONDE BABY FACE PRETTY BOY (BBFPB): Hi Lawndale!  We love you!

(Resounding cheers from the 13-year-old female crowd.)

GOATEED HUNK OF A MAN (GHOAM): We're [boy band].  Can you feel the love
                               in the air?

(More cheers.)

CUTE SKINHEAD SLEEVELESS SHIRT DUDE (CSSSD): Yeah, baby!

(More cheers.)

THREE-EARRINGED LEATHER JACKET GUY (TELJG): Are you ready...to rock and
                                            bop?

(Even more cheers.  [Boy band] music starts.  Cut to shot of Mystik
Spiral.  Lying on the ground is a little guy with glasses--Mr. Shaw.
Mr. Shaw gets up and starts jumping up and down.)

MR. SHAW: (Jumps up and down.) Yeah!  [Boy band]!

JESSIE: I can't believe this.  He stayed in town just for THIS?

TRENT: Look! (Points.)

(Cut to shot of Daria and Jane waving at them from beside the stage.
Their instruments are piled up beside them.)

MAX: I beat him up! (Laughs maniacally.) I beat him up!

NICK: Hey!  I know what we can do!

(Cut to shot of stage, where BBFPB, GHOAM, CSSSD and TELJG are dancing
around.  Jessie comes and drags BBFPB away.  Trent pushes GHOAM off the
stage.  CSSSD runs off when Nick approaches.  Max punches TELJG and
starts beating him up.  The rest of the band pull him off.  TELJG slinks
away.)

GIRL BOPPER: (OS.) Hey!

GUY BOPPER: (OS.) What's going on?

(Suddenly, Mystik Spiral's instruments are on the stage with them.)

TRENT: Hi.  We're Mystik Spiral...but we might change our name.

(Cut to shot of Daria and Jane beside the stage.)

JANE: Amen.

(Rock music starts playing, and the initially surprised people start
jumping around to the beat.)

GIRL ROCKER: (OS.) Right on!

GUY ROCKER: (OS.) All right!

(Cut to shot of people moshing, with Mr. O'Neill and Mr. DeMartino stuck
in the middle.)

DEMARTINO: THIS is your IDEA of RELAXING?  You NITWIT!

O'NEILL: (Cowers.)

(Cut to shot of Mystik Spiral.  Trent pauses in singing to flash Daria 
and Jane a wink and a smile.)

(Cut to shot of Daria and Jane.)

DARIA: I wonder what happened to "Mr. Shaw?"

(Cut to shot of Mr. Shaw, crying on the ground.)

MR. SHAW: (In between sobs.) I didn't get to see them! (Sees Mystik
          Spiral's $500 in his pocket.) Lousy money! (He throws the
          crumpled bill aside.

NASAL-VOICED SIDEKICK: There, there.

(Cut to shot of Mr. O'Neill and Mr. DeMartino walking away.)

O'NEILL: I'm sorry this didn't work out the way I hoped, Anthony--

DEMARTINO: Hey! (He runs over and scoops up the $500.) Easy money!  This
           wasn't such a bad idea after all.  Come on, Timothy, I'm
           treating! (He runs off.)

O'NEILL: Really? (Perks up.) Hey, wait for me! (Runs off.)

(Focus back on Mr. Shaw crying, then cut to Mystik Spiral on the stage.
The end credits roll.)


*** THE END ***


--FEEDBACK:

What was your reaction to my fanfic?  Comments?  Suggestions?  Send them
over to <jrevc@pacific.net.ph>!  Boy band lovers, flame me at the same
address.

--COMMENTS AND STUFF: (Warning!  I can get pretty long-winded at times!)

My first fanfic!  I never knew how hard it was to write something like
this until...well, until I tried.  It took me a week to put all this
together.  As I write this, I haven't even given my fanfic a title yet.
I'm sure I'll think one up before I'm done with this...

Initially, I planned this story to be the first for a series of stories
about Mystik Spiral's tour with Ciggie Butt.  About halfway through the
first act, though, I decided that it wouldn't be very realistic, and
opted for Mr. Shaw to turn in a "con-man" instead.  I knew my description
of Mr. Shaw wasn't really clear, but I'll leave the actual imagery up to
you. ;)

I went with the Mystik Spiral plotline because I felt that the show wasn't
giving the band enough attention.  I wanted Mystik Spiral to have some
more dimension, even if all I managed to show here was that the band was
really desperate to believe anything they encounter that involves getting
them publicity.

There were some weak parts in here, too.  I suppose Trent could have
grown more apart from Jane after her accusation of Mr. Shaw, and I could
have given Tom a more prominent role, but I just couldn't seem to create
good enough dialogue that stuff like that.  The DeMartino subplot was
just something I added to resolve his breakdown at the start of the story.
I thought it worked pretty okay, but it's a little out of place.

I really had fun writing this, especially the names of [boy band].
BBFPB, GHOAM, CSSSD and TELJG, take a bow!  I planned to have N'SYNC
appear instead of a generic boy band, but I realized that I didn't know
their names.  Whoops.  Oh yeah, my apologies to people who listen to boy
bands...just having a little fun here!  No offense! :)

Woosh...I think this has gone long enough.  I really had fun writing this.
I hope you had fun reading it, too!  Watch out for episode 2, which I've
decided is going to be about Brittany and Kevin, but haven't really
made a plot about yet.  It'll be done in about a couple of weeks.  'Til 
then!
