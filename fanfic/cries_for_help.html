<br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Lori looked up from her
poem, but barely registered the park at night around her, or the dry, crackling
leaves she sat on. She wasn't ready to stop yet. She needed to pour more of her
pain, confusion, and despair out. To write was a pressure valve for her soul. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Her tears had stopped,
she could no longer cry. But she could write. It didn't stop the pain, but it
made it bearable. Poetry had become her only relief. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>But just now something
smothered her muse, like the plug was pulled. She wasn't sure what it was, so
she kept looking to see if she could pick up where she left off, trying to
figure out why her inspiration had suddenly dried up. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She sighed. Maybe she
should just go home. But she really wanted to finish this. She NEEDED to finish
this. If she didn't finish this, she might finish herself with the lancet. Slit
her wrists. She wasn't quite ready for that. Not yet. She wanted....no, first
she needed to unburden this pain from her soul. Otherwise, it might follow her
into the next world. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Out of the blue, despair
hit her like burning fire and she stifled a sob. She put pen to paper to
continue, sure that all her pain would pour out of her soul tonight so that she
could finally shuck off her mortal coil, freeing her soul into blessed
oblivion.... maybe even peace. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><i><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Link to <span
class=SpellE>Darlarcarscar</span></span></i></span><span class=postbody1><span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She looked down at what
she just wrote and nearly snarled. Rage joined despair. <i>Oh, fuck this. Fuck
this, fuck this, <span class=GramE>fuck</span> this!</i> She wanted the tears
she felt behind her eyes to come, but as usual, her eyes remained dry as she
silently writhed in more misery than she had ever known was possible. Even
after all she'd felt, she was amazed at the intensity of this horrific pain
that wracked her soul, bound her in ineffable agony. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody1><i><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Ineffable
Agony</span></i></span><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Good.</span></span></span><span
class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> That was something. She
tapped pen to paper, willing more words to come. Instead, she drew a picture of
Lawndale High. She'd hated moving here and getting put into Mr. O'Neill's
self-esteem class. She couldn't put her finger on it, but the pathetic Mr.
O'Neill struck her as dangerous. She tried to write in his class to take her
mind off his psychobabble, but nothing came. And she had nightmares of him
cutting her with her own lancet, licking the blood, eyes lit with vulpine
pleasure that would cause her to jerk awake, unable to sleep. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Her mom didn't care
about her nightmares. She just told her that Ms. Manson and Mr. O'Neill were
there to help her, so go share her nightmares with them. Yeah, right. Her mom
insisted that Mr. O'Neill called more than once because he was truly concerned
about her. <span class=GramE>That made her want</span> to gag. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Lori pulled her
headphones out of her pack and put them on. A moment later Danzig was
alternating between tragic ballad and gritty cacophony in a piece called "Dead
Inside." Maybe it would inspire her, or at least take her mind off everything. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"How does it feel when
you're dead inside, <span class=GramE>Lost</span> someone to the other side, </span></span><br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Felt so bad 'cause you
didn't cry, Couldn't shed a tear cause you're dead inside." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She drew crude sketches
of Mr. O'Neill and Ms. Manson. She followed with a crude sketch of Ms. Li. She
didn't know why, but this seemed to be helping her. They sucked, yes, but they
had nothing to do with her parent's fucked up divorce, her mom's exploiting her
and her <span class=SpellE>sucky</span> brother and sister for child support,
her dad's frequent tantrums over having to pay it and the police ignoring the
court order against him, and finally moving to Lawndale, leaving everything she
knew behind. Perhaps she should feel relief, but instead she felt a cold,
painful emptiness. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Danzig continued to sing
to her. "How does it feel when you're cold inside, Emptiness constant at your
side, <span class=GramE>Freezing</span> ever secret thought you hide,
Motionless, frozen hell design." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Lawndale High wasn't
really the problem, even if Mr. O'Neill gave her nightmares. It gave her
someplace else to be besides home. She didn't really have money to hang out
elsewhere. And she met Andrea there. Even if they weren't exactly friends,
Andrea showed her places where she might fit in. So if anything, Lawndale High
was a respite from her home. But that should be taken as a statement at how
much her home life sucked, more than praise for Lawndale High. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Danzig was screaming in
her ears about how cold he felt. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Andrea had taken her to
cool place called Arcanum 17, a place for the "artistes" of the gothic
persuasion. It wasn't only <span class=GramE>goth</span>. There were plenty of
college students, <span class=SpellE>artsies</span> of all ages, and others.
But it was half <span class=GramE>goth</span>. And many of them, not just
Andrea, read poetry like this. Maybe she could work up the nerve to read her
own. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Danzig asked
(rhetorically, it seemed), "How does it feel when you're lost and blind,
Loneliness is your only guide, <span class=GramE>And</span> how does it feel
when you're black inside, Numbness calls from your inner eye." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Lori suddenly realized
she was drawing a picture of the lancet that was in her backpack. One day, she
would use it. Black despair wafted a miasma of hopelessness around her. Why
couldn't she write more lines? Why couldn't she cry? </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She jerked her backpack
to her <span class=GramE>lap,</span> put her headphones back in, and fished for
her scalpel-like lancet. Finding it, she glanced around to see if anyone was
here. For a Saturday, it was very quiet, and she didn't see anybody. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Pulling the lancet out
of its plastic cover, she pulled her sleeve up to find a good spot to cut
herself. She had many red scars hidden under her sleeves. No one ever seemed to
wonder why she always wore long sleeved shirts. No one cared. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She hissed as she cut,
blood instantly showing. Her breathing quickened. Her mind focused on the cut.
Focusing on the pain of the cut took her mind off the pain in her soul. This
was the only other valve she had, for when her poetry didn't work. One day, her
lancet would not give her some small, pitiful relief, but would relieve her of
the pain forever. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She cut herself again.
This time she did not hiss. But she heard a gasp. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Whirling her head, she
stared at a nearby tree. Lori wondered if someone was hiding behind it.
Straining her eyes, she thought she did see a man trying to hide behind a
nearby tree. There, he moved. There was someone there, and she would guess it
was an adult male. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Lori felt fear twist her
gut and tighten her body. But then she choked it down. So what? If he killed
her, she would thank him. <span class=GramE>Anything to stop her pain.</span>
But she was also pissed. This was HER private time. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>And she suddenly knew
with utter certainty that this man had chased her muse away. To return to her
poetry, she needed to get rid of him. That didn't make sense, but she just knew
it to be true to the very core of her being. She could never write poetry while
he was there. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Lori gripped her lancet
hard and snarled, "Go away!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The intruder stayed
behind the tree, remaining very still. Lori got angrier. "I see you, asshole!
Go away before I hurt you, you fucker!" Rage and despair mixed to create an odd
sense of liberation from fear of what he might do to her. She honestly didn't
care. And she didn't care if she went to prison for killing him. Maybe she
could write undisturbed in her cell. That's all she cared about. She frowned
when she thought they might make it difficult to cut herself, let alone kill
herself. Despair and rage both <span class=SpellE>crescendoed</span> to a new
high as she realized this horrifying possibility. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Motherfucker!"</span></span></span><span
class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> Lori got up, ignored the
sleeve as it fell roughly over her bleeding arm, and the man finally moved. He
came around the tree, slowly coming toward her, his hands out to show he was
harmless. Still, some part of Lori was suddenly afraid again. Something ancient
in her spine and brain urged her to run very fast. But the despair and rage at
this intruder kept that instinct in check. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Her rage rose even
higher as she finally recognized him: Mr. O'Neill. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Brittany?" asked a shy
Mr. O'Neill. "I'm sorry if I disturbed you." He actually sounded sincere. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Lori suddenly remembered
just how pathetic this man really was. "It's Lori!" she snapped. "Why are you
stalking me!?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Oh, no," said Mr.
O'Neill, sounding shocked she would even think that. "I saw someone in the
park, and I just had...had to see who it was. I was...." Here Mr. O'Neill
actually seemed confused. He took in another breath. "I was drawn here. <span
class=GramE>To you."</span> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Lori rolled her eyes. <span
class=GramE>"Right, fucker."</span> She wondered if he'd tell her mom she was
cutting herself. <span class=GramE>Probably.</span> Luckily, her mom wasn't
likely to care, as long as she didn't fear losing her booze and cigarette
support money. She glared at him as Mr. O'Neill came within a few feet of her.
A light behind Lori cast her shadow out in front of her, and it nearly touched
Mr. O'Neill. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Lori's eyes widened when
she saw the... desire? Yes, desire in his eyes. She couldn't believe it, but
she shouldn't have been surprised. It was why he became a teacher, no doubt.
And right now, he wanted her! Within her contempt, some unsuspected vanity
reared itself. He didn't regret her the way her dad did. He wanted her. And she
momentarily wondered if he could somehow fill the emptiness that afflicted her.
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><i><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>No</span></i></span><span
class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>, she thought to herself. The
brief hope and excitement withered so fast, she wondered if she'd only imagined
it. She wasn't flattered, angered, or anything else. She just didn't care. She
wondered if she could use it against him, make him silent. But there was no way
she'd let him touch her. She shivered as she thought of Mr. O'Neill embracing
her, and remembered the nightmares. She felt fear dance over her skin. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Lori?" asked a
concerned Mr. O'Neill. "Are you okay?" He touched her arm and Lori jerked her
arm back. She glared at him with all her rage and despair, but found herself
suddenly very tired. She felt something..... <span class=GramE>she</span>
didn't know what it was. She closed her eyes, as if she were falling asleep.
She wondered if she had accidentally cut herself too deeply this time. She felt
a line of blood go down her arm and onto her hand, but it didn't feel like
much. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Lori felt Mr. O'Neill
gently grab her wrist and lift her shirt sleeve up. She opened her eyes, and
suddenly felt a soothing peace fill her soul. Mr. O'Neill gazed at her bleeding
arm as if in a semi-trance himself. Yes, Lori mused, they were both falling
into some kind of trance. She smiled slightly, but there was no happiness
behind it. He seemed to be sucking her pain out, which was a blessed relief,
but also any will she had to resist, or even to live. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Suddenly, Lori gasped as
Mr. O'Neill bent his head down and licked her arm. A moment later, she realized
Mr. O'Neill had been licking her blood! Did he have some vampire fetish? That
actually sounded kinda cool, until she recalled her nightmares. Fear rose up in
her again, but she did not move. Mr. O'Neill jerked his face to her and she
felt something in her mind when their eyes touched. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill was behind
her eyes! She could feel him as clearly as she could feel herself. He was as
surprised as she was. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She felt him behind her
eyes, searching for her pain. He had known that holding a person strengthened
"the connection," whatever that meant, but he never knew just how
much tasting the blood actually created some kind of psychic link, and he had
no idea how long it would last. He ravaged her mind, looking for every drop of
despair within her. And he found it. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Lori screamed, but was
cut off by Mr. O'Neill's other hand. She felt compelled to look into his eyes
again and she felt herself lost in those depths. Everything came to her. <span
class=GramE>The family without love, the life without hope, the disappointment
that haunted her, the sadness that was her constant companion.</span> She felt
something give, and Mr. O'Neill suddenly gasped in guilty ecstasy. She felt her
soul being sucked out. She couldn't even remember her name now. She was
nothing. There was no poetry, no name, no hope, <span class=GramE>no</span>
soul. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Lori felt his tongue on
her arm again, licking another line of blood. He let go. She still felt him in
her mind, raping her of every hell she ever experienced, and he silently told
her he would always be there to feed off every other moment of hell. She would
never be alone again. She had him and he had her, forever. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She raised the lancet.
She would kill him. She had to. But he felt her in her mind. Not me, he
mentally commanded. End it now. She took the lancet to her wrist and cut deep.
She made a mewling noise as she breathed in. This was a mortal wound. She knew
it, and he knew it, too. She didn't care. He loved her despair and drank deep.
As she fell clumsily and weakly to the ground, she knew that this was her last
night on earth. She hated O'Neill, but she didn't want to die alone. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She reached for him. <i>Hold
me</i>, she willed. <i>Hold me as no one as ever held me</i>. He took a step to
her and then stopped. Then he smiled cruelly and stepped back several steps. <i>Why
should I?</i> <span class=GramE>he</span> thought back at her, flashing several
of her suppressed and humiliating memories back at her. Her gut clenched from
blood loss and heartache, and Mr. O'Neill cruel smile grew joyous, lost in the
moment completely. As her consciousness ebbed, Mr. O'Neill reminded her she
never finished her poem. Her pain would follow her eternally, never to be
released. One last whimper and Lori was no more. </span></span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill stared in
rapture for several minutes. Slowly the realization that one of his students
from self-esteem class was lying dead, blood all around, her shirt soaked with
it, only a couple of meters in front of him. He knew with utter certainty that
she would never rise again, take another breath, <span class=GramE>see</span>
another morning. And he knew he had caused it. He had... no he hadn't liked it.
Like was too weak a word for what he felt. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>For the first time in
his life, he felt himself radiating strength and power like he never known
before. And, for the first time, he remembered what names went with what faces!
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He licked a few stray
drops of her blood from his hand, but he felt the vitality of the blood quickly
fading. Lori was just meat now. He mused darkly that there had been no release.
There was just agony, terror, despair, and indescribable loneliness... and then
nothing. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>His senses were sharp,
his entire being reborn. And.... he felt like writing a poem about it. He had a
muse now, and he wanted to celebrate the horror he knew, the horror of what he
had done. But he also was afraid of what he now knew he was, and the intense
pleasure that came with that self-realization. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He looked again to the
corpse in front of him and muttered with only a little concern, "Oh dear, what
have I done?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Whatever he had done, he
knew one thing with certainty: </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He would do it again. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>2. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>You know, you two are
pretty cool," said Link, in a tone of voice that said he could hardly believe
his own pronouncement. Jane and Daria smiled somewhat self-depreciatively at
the tone, while Link took another bite of his pizza. Anyone there at Pizza King
this Saturday night might have thought Link was a little brother to either
Daria or Jane. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Link had run into them
here, and he had joined them. This was his first time to meet Jane. As if in
omen what such a meeting could result in, an ambulance raced by Pizza King, its
sirens blaring. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Not many share your
opinion," Daria casually remarked, ignoring the ambulance, just before taking
another bite of pizza herself. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"That's because many
people suck!" Link had an intensity of passion, and a surprising ability to cut
through crap, that was oddly appealing to the other two. "And they don't matter
anyway." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"So is it you against
the world?" asked Jane. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Sorta," said Link mildly.
"I have friends, but most wanna pretend the world is either wonderful all the
time, or <span class=GramE>that</span> they themselves aren't touched by it. Or
they try to be one of the reasons life sucks all the time." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"You use to think I
sucked," remarked Daria. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Yeah, my mistake," said
Link. "Besides, when Mr. O'Neill came in and practically said he got you to
make me open up, I was sure you were just another jerk." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane smirked. "Yeah, Mr.
O'Neill is not someone you should face before a certain age." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Or any age," Daria
added. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane continued, "But
Daria and I first spoke to each other in his self-esteem class." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Link's eyes widened. <span
class=GramE>"Self-esteem class!?"</span> His voice sounded as if he'd heard
they were into necrophilia. He shook his head. "So how did you wind up in his
class anyway?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"We were both tested to
have low self-esteem," said Daria. "And he's just as bad in class as he was at
the OK to Cry Corral. After Jane and I graduated the class, he tried publicly
humiliating us in front of the entire school. Luckily, my real problem is that
I have low esteem for everyone else. And I used the situation to humiliate
Quinn." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"She also tortured her
parents by dragging them to Pizza Forest and a UFO convention," Jane added. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Pizza Forest?" asked
Link in horror. <span class=GramE>"The place with the singers?"</span> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria smiled ominously
at him. Link shuddered. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane smiled and added,
"In a few short years, Link, you'll probably be taking Mr. O'Neill's classes,
too." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>This time, Link nearly
convulsed. He decided to change the subject. "So what's your family like?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane shrugged. "Who
knows? They're almost never around. <span class=GramE>Except Trent.</span> He
plays in a band called Mystik Spiral." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Cool," said Link. "I
wish my parents were never around. My problem is they're never around when I
could use them, and they're always around when I can't." Jane looked at him,
inviting him to continue. "They don't do anything, really. They're always out,
trying to get ahead in their so-called careers." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"What careers?" asked
Jane. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Professional butt
kissers, one for some investment schemes, another to do with computers,"
shrugged Link. "They both work up around the Halcyon Hills Corporate Park, like
12-15 hours a day. Then they come home and wonder why nothing is done. It's
like I tell them I can't cut the grass <span class=GramE>cause</span> the mower
is broke, and they put taking care of it in their planner while paying someone
else to cut the yard. <span class=GramE>and</span> never get back to it until
they demand to know why I haven't cut the grass again. The mower still hasn't
been fixed, and they haven't found out that what's wrong with it is that I cut
the cable between the control lever to the engine." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"<span class=SpellE>Wo</span>,"
said Jane. "They might be pretty mad over that." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Maybe I'm mad over
their always preaching responsibility, but expecting the entire world to take
care of all the stuff they don't care for," Link replied. "They just think I'm
their intern at home or personal assistant or something. And when they can't
use me, they try to ship me off somewhere, like that prison camp that Daria
used to be a guard in. Or something else to straighten out their messed up son,
never thinking that maybe they're the ones messing me up, especially by sending
me off to be brainwashed on what a wonderful planet we live on, where the only
people not happy all the time are delusional." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane gave a slight smirk
at his youthful exaggeration, even though she understood what he was going
through in her own way. She wondered if he ever got the speech about the
butterfly. <span class=GramE>Probably not.</span> His parents sounded a lot
like Daria's mom. But the way "delusional" slipped off his tongue, it sounded
like he used it a lot. <span class=GramE>Probably heard it a lot, too.</span>
She frowned in thought, wondered how much he was exaggerating, and how much he
was understating. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"But at least Dad got me
a Play Station 2," said Link grudgingly. "They're both using it to foist me off
as they always do, but at least <span class=GramE>it's</span> fun." As usual,
Link said "Dad" in a tone of voice that showed how little he thought of him. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Latchkey Stress
Syndrome," remarked Daria deadpan, "The all-purpose psychobabble to guilt your
parents into getting you what you want." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Maybe a Play Station 2
is the going price for your children's love these days," added Jane dryly. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Or maybe," said Link a
little devilishly, "Dad didn't want me to turn his girlie magazines and
internet porn over to Mom." "Mom" was said with only a little less hostility.
"I mean that stuff was so weird, that even I </span></span><br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>never knew that people
could like it." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria and Jane frowned,
but decided against asking how weird while they were eating. But at least he
was learning to take care of himself, which his parents wanted. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I got some ideas for
some games," said Link with a mouthful of pizza. "I think I'd like to design
some when I'm older. No higher ideals, just release for all the sex and violence
we hold within us. Keep us from killing our parents. Give us something to do
when we don't have parents around us." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"So that's why Tom liked
having us play those games, right Daria?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"What?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"So he can release all
those violent, sexual impulses he felt when he was with us." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria blushed slightly,
and then switched to annoyed. "It's just something to do," she said. "And maybe
it kept us from expending our violent tendencies on him." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Link, who didn't like it
whenever Jane and Daria talked about stuff that he didn't know about, turned to
Jane. "So what do you do with no games, with your parents gone all the time?
Hold lots of parties?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane smirked. <span
class=GramE>"Hardly.</span> Sometimes Mystik Spiral has people come over, which
can be sorta like a party. But I'm usually working on my art." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Do you paint?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Yeah, a lot," said
Jane. "Sculpt, too, and a few other things." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Cool. I'd like to see
some of your paintings," said Link, who also liked painting. "Who else is with
you? <span class=GramE>A brother, right?</span> He's in Mystik Spiral?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Yeah," said Jane. "And
Mom's home half the time. Everyone else just sorta wonders in every once in
awhile, but they never stay long. Can't say I blame them." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Anyone else there right
now?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane's face wrinkled in
distaste. "Just Mom and Trent right now. But Wind, a much older brother, is
supposed to be bringing his newest would-be wife to meet the rest of us. And I
think they both need a place to stay." Jane was obviously displeased. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Really?" asked Daria. <span
class=GramE>"When?" <br>
<br>
"Any day now," said Jane in a subdued voice.</span> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Link interrupted with,
"Is Wind's last name 'Lane,' too?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Yeah," said Jane. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"That's gotta suck." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Yeah," repeated Jane,
taking a distracted bite off her pizza. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"A lot of lives seem to
suck," said Link, sounding subdued himself now. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>As if on cue, one of the
girls Daria and Jane barely knew at Lawndale High came running in, her eyes
red. She jerked her head around until she found some people she knew. She raced
to them and blurted, "Ohmigod, you're not going to believe this! You
remember Lori, the new girl?" The others at the table nodded. "Mr. O'Neill
found her corpse in the park! They say she slashed her wrists right there for
everyone to see! She's dead!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria, Jane, and Link
were shocked but said nothing. An excited murmur with a range of emotions, took
hold of everyone else at Pizza King. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Yep," said Daria
softly, "so many lives suck." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>3. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria decided that she
and Jane should walk Link home, but made it sound casual. As they passed near
the park, they saw emergency vehicles and several people milling about. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>All three recognized Mr.
O'Neill, who was talking to a couple of policeman. He seemed to be holding
together very strongly, but even from a distance he looked visibly upset. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Suddenly, he turned his
head and seemed to focus on Jane, Daria, and Link. Daria placed herself between
Mr. O'Neill and Link, and put a protective arm around him, until Link casually
shook it off a little later. Daria didn't know why she did that, but all three
unmistakably felt something dark there. Nothing they could put into words, so
they didn't talk about it. But maybe "evil" or "hunger" would've been the
closest word. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>By the time they got to
Jane's house, they mostly had forgotten that haunting moment, and Daria and
Link continued on to Link's house while Jane went inside Casa Lane. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Nothing could've
prepared her for what, or rather who, she saw. Jane stood there in shock, eyes
wide and blinking, stuttering several times as words fought to escape her. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Hi," said Alison
somewhat shyly. <span class=GramE>THE Alison.</span> <span class=GramE>The one
from the art colony.</span> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Finally, Jane sputtered,
"Alison? <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Wh</span></span><span
class=GramE>-</span>what are you DOING here?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison bit her lip, a
self-conscious gesture she had never seen her do before. "I didn't know you
lived here until today, Jane." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"But, Alison," Jane
almost whined, almost yelled, "What are you DOING here?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison sighed. She
turned and raised her voice. <span class=GramE>"Wind!?</span> Wind, can you
come here?" She turned back to Jane and smiled shyly again. "He's upstairs,
talking with your mom." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane reminded herself to
breath. "Alison?" asked Jane, "Can we talk somewhere private? Please?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I thought you might
want to do that," said Alison. "Never mind, Wind," Alison called out. There was
no answer. Alison shrugged and asked, "Where?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane decided against her
room. "Is anyone in the basement?" When Alison shook her head no, then Jane
gestured for her to follow and quickly walked to the basement and down the
stairs. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>When down in the
basement, Jane turned and asked sharply, "Are you leading Wind on just so you
could get back with me?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison displayed a
little annoyance, but reined herself. <span class=GramE>"Of course not.</span>
We met at a gallery. He liked my work. We talked, we got along, and we....
well, that's a long story. But I didn't even know he was your brother until today,
when I saw <span class=SpellE>pics</span> of you in this house." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"But I didn't think you
were after romance," said Jane with some bitterness. "I thought a quick lay was
all you were into. And whatever that could get you." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Annoyance washed over
Alison again, and was gone. "Jane," sighed Alison, "The only reason I went with
Mr. Dotson was to test you, and maybe make you a little jealous." Alison
laughed a bitter laugh. "You got so insanely jealous that you scared me a
little. And that comment you hit me with was too low. It's not like YOU had
anything to offer, except for who you are. And I was willing to be friends, but
you couldn't handle that." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane clenched her fists.
"I was NOT jealous!" Jane was the one fighting annoyance now. But she fought as
resolutely as Alison. "Look, Alison, I was going through a real rough time
then...." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"So was I," blurted
Alison with a little heat, crossing her arms. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"And maybe I did
overreact a little. But you have to know that Wind can't stay married to
anyone! And I'm thinking you're the last person he'll be able to hold on to." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Are you still jealous?"
Alison purred. She smiled, but dropped it when she saw Jane fighting fury.
"I'll tell you the details later," <span class=GramE>said</span> Alison, "But
right now, I really like Wind. I haven't decided if I'm willing to marry him or
not. I asked to meet his family, and if I decide to let him down, I'll make it
sound like it was his family I didn't want, and not him. I think that would be
easier on him." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane stared at her
speechless. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>After a minute, Alison asked,
"Are we done here?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Without a word, Jane
turned and walked back upstairs, Alison following behind. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>4. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The next day, Amanda,
Wind, Alison, and Jane sat at the table, with an ordered pizza and breadsticks
being shared between them. Trent had a gig to go to. Jane might have gone with
him, but she was determined to keep an eye on Alison until she could figure out
if Alison was playing games or not. So far, Wind was talking about Alison
nonstop. It was all good, but Alison seemed to be holding back from asking him
to stop. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Wind went into long
descriptions of several paintings Alison had at a gallery in the next town
over. He said her pain of loneliness in her paintings just called out to him
from many of her paintings, and he had </span></span><br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>to know the artist. They
met, and Alison was fun. It sounded as though Alison might have tried to drop
him, but they seemed to have become at least comfortable with each other. <span
class=GramE>With Wind holding on with claws, but knowing when to give
sometimes.</span> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Wind and some others
seemed to have influenced the gallery owner, Mr. Evans, to get more of Alison's
works. Which was good as Alison was finally able to pay off some bills. But it
was only for a short while, and it wasn't big enough for two to live on
comfortably. And Wind had just been evicted from his place. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Luckily, there was Mom's
house. Whether this was good or bad luck was dependent on the person's frame of
reference, Jane thought morosely. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"And she's an Aries
deluxe!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Aries deluxe?" asked
Amanda. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Sun, Moon, Venus, Mars
are all in Aries! So's her ascendant! But her Mercury is in Pisces, along with
my Venus. Her Aries Venus and Pisces Mercury <span class=GramE>makes</span> her
an awesome artist, too!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Huh," said Amanda
neutrally. She had Alison pegged for a free spirited Sagittarius, or maybe even
a secretive Scorpio. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane tried to suppress
her sigh, but didn't quite make it. But she did have to admit that Alison WAS
good. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"And I have a Libra
ascendant! We're both RIGHT for each other, because our ascendants are
diametrically opposite!" Wind then held up some fingers as he counted other
planets off. "My Sun, Mercury, and Mars are in Cancer, so I guess that means <span
class=GramE>she's</span> gonna be the head of the roost." Wind smiled at
Alison, and Alison stopped herself from rolling her eyes just in time to smile
back. "And Alison said I knew how to pay attention to someone without
smothering her!" He missed Alison silently moving her lips over that.
"Plus, her planetary and house arrangements make her more easily hurt, but
my Cancer placements make me more sensitive to her." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison fidgeted. Jane
couldn't tell if she was being embarrassed by Wind, or for Wind. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I've always believed
butterflies had to be free," said Amanda indulgently. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison turned to Amanda.
"What's your sign?" Jane thought Alison just wanted to change the subject, than
from any real interest in Amanda. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I'm an Aquarius," said
Amanda, with some pride. She cocked her head considering. "For some reason, all
my kids are Aries, except Trent and Wind. Trent is a Pisces. But Jane is an
Aries, too. I think she has a </span></span><br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Sagittarius ascendant,
don't you?" Amanda looked toward Jane. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane breathed out. "I
don't know." <i>I don't care, either!</i>, she thought. She thought she would
change the subject before they bored her to death. "How long do you think
you'll be here?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I don't know," said
Wind. <span class=GramE>"Until we can get on our feet better.</span> Then we'll
plan the wedding!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane rolled her eyes. So
this was Alison's game. Get a roof over her head. Well, Wind himself would be
plenty of vengeance enough, Jane thought sourly. As they continued, Jane
finished her pizza and then went upstairs. She decided she would get her mind
off Wind and Alison by painting something. </span></span><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Later that night, as
Jane neared Wind's room while she mentally repeated her story of wanting to ask
Mom something in case they saw her, she smelled the unmistakable smell of
cannabis. Wind and Alison were laughing and saying stupid things that probably
struck each other as somehow witty or even profound. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then Alison started
singing. <span class=GramE>Off key, but not too bad in a relaxed sort of way.</span>
"Yeah, yeah, God rolls great, yeah, yeah, God smells good, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah!" Alison started giggling again. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then
Wind and Alison both sang, "What if God smokes cannabis?</span></span></span><span
class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> Do you suppose he had a buzz
when he made the platypus? When He created Earth our home?" They both started
laughing. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>They shouldn't try going
professional, Jane thought. Alison kept humming. Jane knew she heard that song
somewhere before, but she couldn't remember where. Maybe she was stoned when
she heard it. She leaned closer when she heard Alison go, "Oh, oh, good spot!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Driven by some unknown
drive, Jane casually passed their room. Alison was mostly on Wind's bed, her
legs hanging off. Wind was massaging one of Alison's feet, while Alison rested
her other foot on Wind's shoulder. Since Wind was focused on Alison, and Alison
was lying back on the bed gazing up laughing lightly, Jane was not seen. The
sight disturbed her for no reason at all, and when Alison made a sound that
revealed she was enjoying whatever spot Wind had found, Jane felt furious, at
them, and even more at herself. But she left to go down the stairs as
originally intended before she could betray herself or the depth of her
feelings to them. After all, what was there left to say? </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>5. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Come Monday, Jane was
still in a foul mood. Daria had been a little taken aback by the repressed fury
that her best friend just barely let out of its cage. Jane felt confused, too,
and she didn't know why, and that only served to worsen her mood. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>So when Jane walked into
Mr. O'Neill's class, she wasn't pleased to see Mr. O'Neill smile at her.
Somehow, it looked obscene, but Jane shook that ridiculous notion off. Mr.
O'Neill was just annoying, that's all. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Right after the bell
rang, Mr. O'Neill got up from his desk. Jane noticed right away that there was
something different about him. She couldn't place it right away. But it seemed
he wasn't cringing anymore. Beyond that, she couldn't really say. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Class," said Mr.
O'Neill in a voice that sounded faintly amused, and stronger than ever, "I'm
sure you have all heard of the <i>terrible</i> suicide of Lori Goodman." He
paused, and the entire class got quiet. Nearly everyone had heard he had been
the one to find the body, too. Someone coughed nervously. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"This was a horrible
tragedy," continued Mr. O'Neill, "And the <span class=GramE>faculty at Lawndale
High are</span> very concerned. We don't want anything like this to happen
again. But we know statistically it is only a matter of time. So we will be
pausing in our Shakespeare to take time to write an essay." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Some slightly annoyed
noises were made. Mr. O'Neill ignored them. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I want everyone to
write about something that has every made them think of suicide. If you never
have, then what do you think would? And I want you to include something that
you think could help you overcome these obstacles to your actualization." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria raised her hand. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill frowned.
"What is it, Daria?" <span class=GramE>A hint of steel in his voice.</span> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>A slight murmur quickly
picked up in the classroom. Even Daria's eyes widened. "Um," said Daria off
balance, "How did you remember my name?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill sighed.
"Daria, other people aren't as stupid as you like to say in your pretentious
stories and essays. In fact, you're probably less intelligent than many in this
school, or you'd know how to get along better." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria was so <span
class=GramE>shocked,</span> she forgot to ask him what actualization meant.
Daria knew, of course. She was planning on telling him at the end, she just
wanted to remind him that using a word and knowing what it meant were two
different things, and as payback for when he annoyed her by using it and
refusing to tell her what it was in his self-esteem class. But now she had
forgotten what she intended to do. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Andrea spoke up lowly,
but audible to everyone. "Like getting along with the locals is a sign of
higher intelligence." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill turned to
her. "Andrea," he said, "I can see right through you. It's not like you're that
deep. You're just as pretentious as the Fashion Club, only in a darker way. The
only reason you chose your gothic pretension is because you know you're way too
fat to be beautiful. But in the end, you are no different, except you are
isolated and deluded. <span class=GramE>Just as Daria is no different by
deluding herself about being smarter than everyone else."</span> He tried not
to show how he drank her pain as she bled in unseen ways from the little nicks
he just dealt her. She refused to show him how he hurt her, but she couldn't
hide it from HIM. Mr. O'Neill couldn't help but grin a little which actually
caused Andrea to flinch a little. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Brittany raised her hand
and spoke without being called on. "What if you <span class=GramE>don't have
any reasons to feel bad, and you never</span> thought of suicide?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill blinked by
the unexpected question and then shook his head sadly. "I think you're
repressing, Brittany. Don't you remember how you were snubbed by that modeling
agency? Don't you remember how Kevin left you for another girl before you
seduced him back to you?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"<span class=SpellE>Eep</span>!"
Brittany's eyes widened. Kevin kept smiling like an idiot without a clue. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Brittany," Mr. O'
O'Neill continued, "you put so much stock into your looks and popularity. But
just because you are above average at these things at Lawndale High, doesn't
mean you will be out in the real world. When you go to college, you will find
there are people so much better looking and so much more popular than you could
ever hope to be. You will become a non-person, fighting to retain what you once
thought you had, and you will ultimately fail at everything: school, cheerleading,
modeling, life." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>There was real fear on
Brittany's face. Like Daria, she was stunned into silence. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"What will you do,
Brittany," Mr. O'Neill continued relentlessly, in a lower, slower voice that
suggested confidentiality, "<span class=GramE>when</span> your family and
friends have disowned you? What will you do when you're a burnt out junkie
selling your butt to complete strangers in hopes of your pimp giving you
another hit of the drugs you used in a futile attempt to hold onto what you
never had?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>It was obvious Brittany
was seeing it. Her mouth was opened in a silent O of fear, and it looked as if
her eyes were misting. She had even forgotten to be humiliated or outraged that
someone would say such things to her, particularly in front of other people. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria and Jane looked at
each other in shock, and a little anger. Then Jodie spoke up. "I have a
question." Jodie's tone suggested anger. "How is this supposed to be helping us
to feel better about ourselves?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill shook his
head and laughed a little mockingly, causing about everyone to blink. "Jodie,"
he said with a smirk, "The point isn't about feeling good. We can all pretend
that we do, but then we're completely unprepared for when life strikes us a
blow." He clenched his hands into fists, bringing them up, as he made his face
looked concerned and wise. "We must learn to be stronger than the pain, to face
our demons without fear or weakness." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"With all due respect,"
said Jodie bluntly. "I don't think that's what you're doing." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"With all due respect,"
said Mr. O' O'Neill just as bluntly, "I think you need to fess up more than
anyone. You don't think life is wonderful. You're so busy in your nonstop quest
to prove to your parents that you're worthy of their love, and yet you haven't
proved it in all your life. You try so hard here at Lawndale High to show your
best, but all your manipulations of people do is show your neurotic need to
suck the approval of everyone around you. What happens, Jodie, when you can no
longer do that?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jodie started to speak a
couple of times, choked, got up and left. Mack was right behind her, glaring at
Mr. O'Neill. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Walking out of class, <span
class=GramE>Mack,</span> is a real good way to lose your position as captain of
the Lawndale Lions. What will you have to offer Jodie, then?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mack actually blinked at
that, but quickly followed Jodie out of the classroom. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria got up and left. <span
class=GramE>And then Jane.</span> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Anyone else <span
class=GramE>want</span> an F for the day?" asked Mr. O'Neill in a kind voice. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Andrea got up and left,
pointedly flipping him off as she went. No one else moved. No one else
remembered that he was getting their names right. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>It was one of the worst
days many of them ever knew at Lawndale High, and they could only hope things
would soon go back to normal. As the bell ring, Mr. O'Neill demanded they have
the essays done by tomorrow. He looked forward to giving the ones who walked
out of his classroom another F if they didn't turn such an essay in. And then
making them "redo" it. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>But he had to admit,
while this was all good, it wasn't anywhere as good a high as when he had
tasted the blood. And he could feel the strength in him slowly leaking away. He
needed more if he was to continue feeling this good, this strong. <span
class=GramE>And to feel even stronger.</span> Because deep down, he knew his
potential had barely been tapped. He was in the process of Awakening. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>But he did not yet know
what he was <span class=GramE>Awakening</span> into. </span></span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>6. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane had come back from
another jog. She had to get the adrenaline out of her system, and she needed to
clear her head before she bumped into Wind or Alison again. While a part of
Jane was secretly glad to see Alison, another part felt angry that Alison had
intruded on her here. <span class=GramE>With her older brother.</span> She
quickly went into the shower and cleaned herself off. Daria should be over
soon. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Going down to the kitchen
to see what was in the fridge (if anything), she found Alison eating a salad
that she'd apparently made herself. There was more in a bowl, but Jane turned
to leave. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Jane, wait." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane turned, raising a
brow. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I wanted to talk to you
about Wind. Do you mind?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Do you mind if I eat
some of your salad?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Help yourself." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane went to the fridge.
She pulled out a can of Ultra Cola she saw and filled a bowl with salad at the
table. "Rabbit food isn't really my thing," she said sitting down. "But it will
work for the moment. So what's up?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison seemed
uncomfortable. "Has Wind always been secretive?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane chewed as she
thought. "He's usually willing to talk," said Jane cautiously. "But now that I
think about it, he doesn't say much." Jane shrugged. "Maybe he's just shallow."
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison shook her head.
"Sometimes, there's a depth about Wind that's intriguing. <span class=GramE>But
only sometimes.</span> Other times I want to strangle him for being such a
jerk." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane laughed. "That what
all of <span class=GramE>Wind's</span> ex-wives say." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison nodded
cautiously. "He won't talk about them much." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Maybe he doesn't want
to make you jealous." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"No, that's definitely
not it. I've caught him flirting with other women, and he enjoys it when I come
to chase her away and drag him off where he's less likely to misbehave." Alison
covered her face with a hand for a moment as she exclaimed, "Gods! Sometimes I
even talk to him, and about him, like he <span class=GramE>were</span> a
child!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Maybe he just wants a
little fun." Jane's voice took on a slightly darker tone. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Jane," said Alison.
"I'm sorry I tried to make you jealous. I was hurt over your just brushing me
off like that. I was sure we could've been something special. That you were
willing to throw that aside really hurt. What I did was petty, but I think it
was understandable." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Maybe," said Jane
cautiously. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"If you're still mad at
me, maybe you should let it out of your system." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane put down her fork
and listened. She heard nothing, and didn't think anybody else was home. "Is
Wind home?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison shook her head
no. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane took a drink and
then said, "First, I felt used cause you got me drunk. Next, I didn't like how
you came onto me. I wasn't ready for that. Then, when I thought about it, and
realized that just maybe there was a little truth to it, you wouldn't let me
say it. You just had to show off how fast you could find someone else. I really
needed to talk to you about that then, and about so many other things. I was
scared of being hurt again, and then you seemed to show me how little I meant.
Maybe that's why my ex-boyfriend dumped me for my social outcast of a best
friend." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I'm sorry, Jane. <span
class=GramE>Except for the getting you drunk.</span> I didn't set out to get
you drunk. I've been drinking and getting high since I was 13. I had a high
tolerance by the time I was your age, and I just assumed you would to. After
all, you were out there on your own, just as I was on my own at your age." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Okay, granted. But a
lot of that other stuff still sucked." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"You're right. But some
of it was just thoughtlessness on my part, not nastiness. And I ask you to
remember something. What I did not do. I did not plant one kiss on you. In
fact, I didn't even touch you beyond that of a friend." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Not from any lack of
trying," Jane mumbled. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"When I like someone,"
said Alison, "I do go off like a rocket. But as uncomfortable as I made you
feel by my sudden advances, I did not actually violate your boundaries. When
you told me to back off, I backed off. Maybe I tried convincing you not to shut
me out, but I did respect your boundaries. Believe me, <span class=GramE>Jane,
that</span> means something. At least it does if you've dealt with the <span
class=GramE>kind who don't</span> respect your boundaries. The ones that think
they can force you to do what they want, or that saying no just means you're
playing hard to get." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane took a few more
bites, contemplating. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison looked at her
with sad eyes that made Jane soften her expression, if only a little. "Can we
still be friends, Jane?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane shrugged. "I think
so. But give it time, Alison. And I try to avoid Wind, so don't take it personally
if I seem to be avoiding you while you're with him." Jane took another bite.
"And I'm glad you found a gallery to display your work. You do some really
amazing work. You wouldn't have to sleep with anyone to get your work
displayed, and I'm sorry I said as much." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison nodded her
thanks. "Wind and Amanda are coming to see my work at the gallery tomorrow. I'd
like it if you came out, too." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I'll think about it,"
said Jane. After a moment she asked, "Can I bring a friend?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison smiled. <span
class=GramE>"Of course."</span> Then Alison stared at Jane intently as her tone
took on a stronger tone as she asked her next question, changing the subject.
"Did your mother NEVER scorch a shirt, burn a biscuit, sing off key, waste
money, or lose her temper?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane laughed. "Wind is
always telling stories about how wonderful the women in his life are, whoever
they happened to be at that time." Alison blinked at that. Jane continued with,
"He definitely lives in Camelot, and he thinks he's Lancelot, and Mom as the
Lady of the Lake." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Pretty delusional,
huh?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"You better believe it. <span
class=GramE>Especially about the wasting money bit.</span> <span class=GramE>Unless
you count not buying us food when she had to choose between feeding us and
getting more clay."</span> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison winced. "Doesn't
sound like it was fun growing up around here." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"It had its good and bad
points." Jane smirked and added, "Wind might be right about Mom not burning a
biscuit, given that I only remember her making biscuits once in my life." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison laughed a little
at that. "But did she always know what to say when he was sad and blue?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Maybe for Wind," said
Jane, "But she usually told me things that made me want to rip the wings off of
butterflies." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison's laugh was a
little lighter over that. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I meant to ask you,
Alison, did you do some of your paintings on acid?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison smiled slightly. <span
class=GramE>"Yeah.</span> <span class=GramE>A few.</span> But don't be fooled
by my paintings. They don't have all the colors of an acid trip. The ones that
make people ask if I were on acid were really done by my focusing on one
object, and silhouetting everything else around it. It gives a new perspective
on the object of my painting. I do a little surrealism from time to time, too,
but when I'm sober." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>They heard the front
door open. Jane went to see who it was. <span class=GramE>"Hey, Trent!</span>
Hey, Daria! Hey, Link!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Hey, Janey." Trent went
for the kitchen. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Hi," said Daria. Link
waved once. He was carrying a sketchbook, which made Jane curious. Jane went to
meet them. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"You were riding with
Trent and Link? Does Tom know?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria gave Jane a slight
glare. "Don't start that again. Trent passed us while we were walking over
here, and he offered us a ride." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"So bring any real food
from your house to mine?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches. Already made." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"That'll work." Jane
took a sandwich and started eating. With the salad, this wouldn't be too bad.
Jane heard Trent in the kitchen laugh and cough at something Alison must've
said. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"My mom is going to call
Ms. Li tomorrow," said Daria. <span class=GramE>"Seems Mr. O'Neill really
freaked out the fashion drones.</span> He told them they were into fashion
because they knew how badly they needed to cover their blemishes." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"They must have loved
that." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria frowned. "Quinn
also said he cornered her while she was alone and told her that everyone else
was far more aware of her own imperfections than she was. She said he claimed
she was popular only because people felt sorry for her." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"<span class=SpellE>Wo</span>,"
said Jane. "He's turned into a real prick. Or do you think Quinn is
exaggerating again?" When Daria gave Jane a look that somehow implied an
unspoken sympathy for Quinn, Jane sighed. "Yeah, there's something up with Mr.
O'Neill. I haven't figure out what, though." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"He's a jerk," Link
added helpfully. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria added, "Quinn was
really freaked by it. She couldn't even eat her lasagna." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Maybe she's on a diet,
and knows that being upset is the only excuse your mom will take." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"No," said Daria. "Mr.
O'Neill has definitely crossed a line. But Mom says he's just upset over the
suicide. But she does wonder why he isn't taking time off over it so he can
come to terms with <span class=GramE>it</span>." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I wonder what that
girl's parents are doing?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Oh, did you hear? Mr.
O'Neill is supposed to be spending a lot of time with the dead girl's mother.
And the mother is wondering whom she can sue over her daughter's suicide." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane shook her head.
"What does Ms. Barch have to say about that?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I don't know," said
Daria, "But we're sure to find out." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Link spoke up. "I think
Mr. O'Neill just likes going wherever people are suffering." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane's eyes widened. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria looked up to Jane.
"What?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I think Link's right,
Daria. Mr. O'Neill.... he seems to like hanging around people who are
suffering." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria made a noise that
said she agreed, but wasn't sure that meant anything. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Remember?" pressed
Jane. "He wanted you to read some of your writing at the coffeehouse that would
have insulted the people listening there. Then there were all those problems,
most of which he set up. When you read that unexpected story instead, he was
shocked and shut the place down." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Maybe because he
thought I had incited a riot?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Link piped in, "You did?
Cool!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"No," said Jane. "He
seemed visibly upset to me before anyone left the Coffeehouse. And another
time," continued Jane, "He chased me when he thought I was crying. He seemed
extremely disappointed that I was okay. <span class=GramE>Even annoyed.</span>
I think he felt cheated somehow." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Oh, yeah," said Daria,
"back when he tried humiliating us both in front of the entire school." Daria
thought a minute and added, "You remember when he got my mom to send me to
volunteer as a counselor at his OK to Cry Corral?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane nodded. Link made a
face that said he clearly thought that any parent that would force their kid to
go with Mr. O'Neill was unfit to be a parent. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I thought he at least
tried, because whenever a kid was upset, he would try talking to them in his
office. They always came out worse. I just thought he was being stupid, but
maybe he's a passive-aggressive sadist." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"And," added Jane, "he's
always talking about saving the jellyfish and all, but you remember when he
crushed that spider? <span class=GramE>Even said, 'damn spiders' right in front
of us."</span> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria was still thinking
of the OK to Cry Corral. "When I was trying to get Mr. O'Neill to drop me as a
counselor, he told me he had tried to get Ms. Barch before. Can you imagine Ms.
Barch and Mr. DeMartino working together?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane smirked. <span
class=GramE>"Poor kids." <br>
<br>
"Yeah.</span> So why didn't Mr. O'Neill see that? Then he tries getting me. It
was as if he was trying everything he could to make those kids miserable. And
you should've been there, Jane. He sounded all caring, but he was one of the
most sadistic counselors I ever saw in my life. <span class=GramE>Even if he
was acting way too nice to be torturing anyone.</span> And it's easy to torture
kids by forcing them to sit still and do pointless busywork like twisting wires
together, while a beautiful lake and landscape lie right outside, where you're
not allowed to go. But how do you accuse him of intentionally hurting others
when he's passively aggressive that way?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"You know," said Jane,
"he's always been a jerk! I just never noticed it until now." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Link added in, "He
called me into his office once. I told him he didn't really care about helping
kids. He said he did and I told him that if that were true, then he sucked at
it." Link added a moment later, "Daria and Mr. DeMartino were okay. I'm glad I
met Daria." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria smiled for a
moment before she turned her thoughts back to Mr. O'Neill and she shook her
head. "But today was different somehow..." Daria trailed off. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane asked, "You don't
know how it was different?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Link looked up at that,
curious himself. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria scrunched up her
face some. "It's like before he was stupidly cruel, but today he was cruelly
stupid. <span class=GramE>Maybe even malevolent."</span> Daria shook her head.
"I suppose he'd say he's just internalizing feelings of guilt and rage over a
death of a student in his class, and he's taking it out on the rest of us." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"You don't sound like
you believe that." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I'm not sure I do. But
what else am I to believe?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria, Jane, and Link
were lost in thought for a moment. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then Daria said, "By the
way, I left a little early because Link stopped by. He wanted me to show him
where you lived again. And I took what excuse I could to get away from the
'rents who won't stop telling us we need to understand Mr. O'Neill's position."
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane looked to Link.
"You wanted to come here? Why?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Yeah," said Link. "I
wanted to see your paintings." Then he looked down at his sketchbook, "And show
you a little of my own work." Link handed her his sketchbook. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane's brows rose, but
she took the sketchbook and said, "Sure." After her own experiences at the art
colony, she wasn't about to practice ageism. She knew how hard it was for a
12-year-old, especially a boy, to find an audience, too. Art is communication,
and you don't feel satisfied until someone else understands what you're saying.
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison came in, with a
can of V-8 in her hand. "I'd like to see some of your paintings, too." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane glanced up in
surprise, "Have you been listening in?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Not really," said
Alison. "But I couldn't help but hear you once Trent fell asleep. He's in the
kitchen with his head on the table. So I got bored." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane flipped through
Link's pad a bit. She stopped on one that was very detailed. <span class=GramE>A
dark, menacing forest.</span> An owl looking at the viewer was downright
creepy. <span class=GramE>A silhouette of a boy wandering, surrounded by
thorns.</span> It was bleak. <span class=GramE>And impressive.</span> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison leaned closer to
examine it. "You did that yourself?" When Link nodded, Alison said, "You've
really captured the essence of being alone in a world that is both cruel, and
yet somehow indifferent." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Link blinked in pleased
surprise at that. "Thanks." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane turned to a crude
sketch of a classroom. It took a few moments before she realized that the
teacher and all the students were those Borg drones from the Star Trek series.
She laughed a little at that. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"What?" asked Link <span
class=GramE>blushing.</span> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"It looked so ordinary
at first. You did really <span class=GramE>good</span> at making the Borg
implants subtle. I didn't even catch it at first." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Yeah," said Link, "I
couldn't get caught drawing that. I was supposed to draw what I saw--which I
did in a way. This would've gotten me in trouble. Mr. <span class=SpellE>Drieson</span>
only looked at it for a second before dismissing it." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane lifted a brow.
"Resistance isn't futile?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Link shrugged. Jane
turned another page of a sketch of girl. <span class=GramE>Pretty good, but not
too interesting.</span> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The next page stunned
her. It was done with the pad long ways. A boy was struggling to walk, maybe
even escape something. A lifeless skeleton hung by its talons to the boy's
ankle, its finger bones digging in and drawing blood. The detail was superb.
And the boy's haunting expression, along with the drawing as a whole, conveyed
a feeling that wasn't easily put into words. Alison whistled. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria asked, "Is this to
alarm parents and teachers, or to enlighten other students?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Link smiled in a way
that reminded Jane of Daria's evil smile. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane smirked, too.
"Okay, everyone to my room, and I'll show you mine if you show me yours."<o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody1><span style='font-size:10.5pt;
font-family:Verdana;letter-spacing:0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody1><span style='font-size:10.5pt;
font-family:Verdana;letter-spacing:0pt'>7. </span></span><span
style='font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Verdana'><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill realized he
was going to have to be more careful. Apparently, several parents had
complained to Ms. Li yesterday night and this morning. She had put her foot
down, and said if she kept getting complaints, she was going to have to insist
he take a vacation to get his head together. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>What Ms. Li didn't know
was that he had his head together for the first time in his miserable life. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He had long stayed
around the hurting to help them, to answer the cries for help, but always
seemed to make them more miserable. Before he discovered what he really was, he
had really wanted to help them, but somehow he couldn't. And he always felt a
little stronger after the fact, as if in the suffering of others he somehow
caught a "second wind." He'd long called it his
"connection" to those in need of him, and felt that he was something
of an <span class=SpellE>empath</span>. He also noticed that when he was
particularly down, a visit to a funeral, a hospice, a prison, an asylum could
always boost his spirits. He hadn't known why until Saturday night. He just
guessed it came from TRYING to do <span class=GramE>good</span>, even if he
only made everyone feel even worse. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>But now he realized he
had encouraged the suffering. He'd been careful, but he was almost caught more
than once. And sometimes, he learned, anger could be used to thwart him. <span
class=GramE>Any anger that didn't rot the soul in endless frustration, fear,
and despair.</span> While people were often angry with him, they usually could
not justify it at all, and so suffered silently, and Mr. O'Neill silently,
unknowingly (even to himself) fed. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He wasn't sure why his
hosts had to be down. He guessed that maybe he was feeding off the aura or <span
class=SpellE>etheric</span> energy of the body. That the same things that led
to sickness--sadness, anger, despair, guilt--not only weakened the immune
system, but also their psychic defenses. When their defenses were down, his
starving cells or aura could pick off that energy. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Another thing that
bothered him was that the more positive emotions tended to elude him. He
usually noticed them from a lack of feeling any weaknesses. He wondered briefly
if Lori had found peace when he had killed her, or if she really simply stopped
when she died. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Another problem had been
that he tended to identify things by their feel. He had a hard time with names,
but a part of his brain that didn't deal in words always recognized them
instantly. Once, he hadn't even noticed a broken window at the OK to Cry Corral
until after Daria and Link--two people he realized he needed to separate if
either were to continue to be of use to him--had run off from him. The energy
signatures--or <span class=SpellE>Sigs</span> as he thought of them now--were
what called out to him, the way smells were primary to a dog. It was only now,
that he was filled with the energy he needed, that he was as grounded as
everyone else. Maybe even more so, as he felt his empathy <span class=GramE>strengthen</span>
almost to the point of being able to see inside their head. Not as intimate as
with Lori, but definitely psychic. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Yesterday, the classes
had been rich sources of feeding. He now realized why he had become a teacher.
He had never experienced so much misery in his life as his own time in school.
And now, it was only going to get better. <span class=GramE>For him.</span> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>But it wasn't enough.
Whatever was in his biology or soul had been cannibalizing his own energy all
his life. The other energy hadn't been enough, just enough so he could
function. He had found it hard to think or get centered or do anything. But
now, since he had <span class=GramE>Awakened</span>, he knew who and what he
was. And he quickly made peace with that. And as a schoolteacher, he felt like
a child in a candy store. He just had to be more careful how he fed. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>And he was going to need
to feed again more substantially, and soon. He felt himself slowly beginning to
slip back into the starvation state that had haunted him nearly his entire
life. It hurt. He felt something of a hollow space in his gut and behind his
eyes that demanded to be filled. And there were so many people around him here
at school just begging to be tapped. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane in particular
seemed haunted by something. She was more stable today than she had been
yesterday, but he figured he could cause a relapse, if he knew where to strike.
He wanted to tap Jane all that he could soon, and she could be another
believable suicide. Maybe Daria would follow. It was well known that those
close to a suicide often took their own lives. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He was <span
class=GramE>Awakened</span>. The others were prey. He knew what it was to be
strong now, and he would never surrender this feeling, ever again. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>There. <span
class=GramE>In the library.</span> <span class=SpellE>Sigs</span> he
recognized. <span class=GramE>Jane and Daria.</span> <span class=GramE>Jodie
and Mack.</span> <span class=GramE>All with a mixture of pain and hope.</span> <span
class=GramE>Interesting.</span> He slipped in to see what they were doing
together. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"You aren't using each
other," Daria was saying. "Look, you're both dedicated to your duties. You can
relate that way. You are among the few who can understand why the other puts
out all that time and focus on other activities. Most other people would feel
neglected. Another woman would say Mack thought football was more important
than she. Another guy with Jodie would wonder when Jodie would make a little
time for him. But you don't have that conflict, because you both understand
it." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>There was silence. Some
murmuring that he couldn't quite make out. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"If you really were just
using each other selfishly, then you wouldn't be torturing yourselves over it."
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jodie and Mack both
lightened up. Daria was definitely dangerous, Mr. O'Neill told himself. For all
her antisocial acting, she was a do-gooder at heart. And she knew what she was
doing. Mr. O'Neill thought it might be better if Daria <span class=SpellE>offed</span>
herself first, and soon. Maybe he needed to push for that now. He walked
further in, letting them know he was here. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Excuse me," he said
disarmingly, "Might I have a word with you?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Only if it's to
apologize for being a jerk," said Mack. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill felt a
stirring of rage he hadn't known he possessed, but he suppressed it and gave an
apologetic laugh instead. Ms. Li and the coaches had nearly gone ballistic when
he urged them to kick Mack off the team. He was told to leave Mack alone in the
future, so he had to tread carefully. <span class=GramE>For now.</span> "I'm
only trying to help," he said. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Four hostile faces
glared at him. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I was only pointing out
possible deficiencies and sources of insecurity so they can be dealt with now,
rather than festering and ultimately triggering another suicide," he told them
with as much false sincerity as he could. "I feel it's my responsibility to see
that doesn't <span class=GramE>happen</span> again." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Right,"
replied Mack in a sarcastic tone. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>They were drawing
strength from each other. He had to stop that, he had to divide them. "Jodie,
you remember when you wrote that essay on Mack thinking he was BMOC and it was
making his head a little big? Mack wrote something similar about your student
council duties." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I don't remember
writing anything like that," said Mack. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"It was a long time
ago," replied O'Neill. <span class=GramE>"But not as long ago as Daria and
Jane.</span> They seemed to think the other pretentious in her talent as an
artist or a writer respectively." He noticed they were all a bit nervous. That
was good, and he brightened just a little. "And I find it hard to imagine Jane
and Daria giving advice of the heart after that unfortunate incident with that
rich boy." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Too
far.</span></span></span><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:
0pt'> They instantly solidified against him. Damn. He needed to catch them
alone and take them out one by one. He laughed disarmingly and then said,
"Anyway, I'm glad you're working the problems out so that they don't fester."
He turned and left. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>As Mr. O'Neill left the
library, he saw Charles growl at another student. <span class=GramE>Can't have
that.</span> This time, he'd pick him off while he was alone. The way he'd do
to Mack, Jodie, Daria, and Jane soon. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Charles," said Mr. O'
Neill, "Come with me." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Charles shuddered, but
followed Mr. O'Neill to his classroom. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Have a seat, Charles." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Upchuck nervously sat at
a desk near Mr. O'Neill. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Now Charles," grinned Mr.
O'Neill, "I've noticed you've harassed a lot of girls here at Lawndale High,
but you don't seem to care that they are constantly rejecting you. Are you
afraid of them?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Upchuck shook his head,
very uncomfortable. He had a bad feeling about this, and it was all over the
school how weird Mr. O'Neill had been yesterday. And all the teachers seemed a
little down or angrier than usual, too. <span class=GramE>Especially Ms. Barch.</span>
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I think you are afraid,
Charles. You're not afraid of being called Upchuck, though, or even of being
rejected. You're afraid of being called faggot." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Upchuck</span></span></span><span
class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> eyes widened in shock. What
the hell was Mr. O'Neill doing? </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill put his
hands on the desk Charles was sitting at. "You are gay, aren't you? You can't
face it in yourself, and you can't stand others knowing it. But I've found out.
I'm here to help you. Help you leave the closet and realize your actuality!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Um, no thanks," said
Upchuck. He got up to leave. Mr. O'Neill grabbed his arm. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"We're not done talking,
Charles. Sit down." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"No." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Charles, do you want me
to call your Dad to talk about your latent homosexuality?" Mr. O'Neill thrilled
in how he masked his exuberance and triumph with the false sounds of a
concerned teacher. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Charles gasped, and then
stared in shock. He <span class=GramE>was tasting</span> good, Mr. O'Neill
thought. All of a sudden, he tensed, and Mr. O' Neill felt something gathering
momentum within Charles. But before he fully realized what it was it, a fist
smashed into his nose. A surprised and hurt Mr. O'Neill ducked away, letting go
of Charles, and covered his nose. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Charles ran. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>After a few moments, Mr.
O'Neill centered himself again. He then found the energy within him could heal.
He felt the cartilage in his nose re-knit, the bleeding stopped. He wiped it
off. But now he felt much hungrier. Charles would pay for that, he swore.
Charles might have run, but he couldn't hide. And then the things he was going
to do to Charles. <span class=GramE>Even if he wouldn't report this to Ms. Li
for the moment.</span> He'd take care of this himself at a later date. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>But first, he needed to
feed again. <span class=GramE>But from whom?</span> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Yes, things could get
most unfortunate for the students of Lawndale High. It was good there were
self-esteem teachers like him to answer such cries for help. Maybe he could
even open a new camp, the Cry for Help Corral, for worried parents to send
their troubled teens. <span class=GramE>Maybe even troubled teens like Charles.</span>
Yes, that would bear thinking about. Mr. O'Neill grinned at the thought. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Grinning,
but also tense.</span></span></span><span class=postbody1><span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'> It was time to feed. </span></span><br>

<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Danzig's "Stalker Song"

hapless passengers being Amanda, Wind, Jane, Alison, Daria, and Link.</span>
Trent grinned, lost in the music, slightly nodding his head to it. Yet it
somehow, for some reason, seemed ominous. </span></span><br>

style='letter-spacing:0pt'> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The Tank pulled up at
the gallery, and the occupants filed out with some relief. A full hour plus of
Danzig, along with bands like Prong, <span class=SpellE>Godsmack</span>, Coal
Chamber, Slipknot, and Drowning Pool was enough to try anyone's nerves, if they
weren't into that kind of music. Trent might have been, but Amanda and Wind
seemed grateful to their higher powers as they got out, almost jumping. The
others seemed okay, but relieved to be out, too. Only Link, who'd come at the
invitation of Jane and Alison, seemed unfazed by the rough and noisy ride. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Still, it was better
than the other stations right now, and the increasingly depressing news of
people killing themselves or killing others. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>They entered the gallery
to find a surprising number of people there. Jane and Alison stared at one in
particular, and both bore expressions of distaste. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I take it you know
him," said Daria, looking at Jane. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Mr. Dotson," said a
shocked Jane. Was there some weird karma thing going on here? Or were they just
unlucky? Alison seemed even less pleased than Jane. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The Lanes and friends
went over to the display of Alison's paintings. They were done in brilliant
hues, and psychedelic renditions of the ordinary turned into the fantastic. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>They looked at some of
the other artists' works. They were mystified how Dotson's works ended up
getting space next to all the others. It must be NEA, known to provide support
for artists that couldn't make it on talent. There was no other explanation. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. Dotson came out to
join them. "Alison! I'm glad you could make it. I bet you didn't think you'd
get to see a master artist unveil his latest work tonight!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison dryly remarked,
"You're right. And I still don't." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Jealousy doesn't become
you, Alison," clucked Mr. Dotson. "But you should know I have the ear of Mr.
Evans himself! And you know he has impeccable taste. And he thinks your works
are taking up valuable gallery space. I told him to leave your works alone, but
I think I'll tell him to do what he thinks best." Alison glared while Mr.
Dotson smirked at her. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Mr. Evans?" Daria asked
Jane. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"He owns several
galleries and is a revered art critic," said Amanda, from behind Daria and
Jane. "Eccentric in the extreme, but the few artists he favors often do well
enough. You'll see enough of artists hoping for his favors." Amanda shook her
head. "I tried talking to him a couple of times, but he wouldn't give me the
time of day." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Maybe his son could
paint something better than you could, Amanda." Mr. Dotson replied dryly. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"And any one of my kids
could come up with a better clich&eacute; than that," Amanda retorted. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. Dotson turned back
to the rest of them. "I'm glad you could all make it to my exhibit. <span
class=GramE>All the way from Lawndale, <span class=SpellE>hm</span>?</span> I
assume Amanda is still living there. So how was traffic on the way out?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Glad you asked,"
remarked Daria dryly, "I was afraid this talking was never going to stop being
so boring." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. Dotson's laugh was
light, if somewhat strained. "Let me show you some of my work." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"We're here to see
Alison's," said Wind, "So if you don't mind...." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. Dotson interrupted
Wind with, "And you are?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Wind smiled. "I'm Wind
Lane, Alison's future husband!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. Dotson smiled
mockingly at Amanda and Alison both. "I find that very interesting," he said,
sounding highly amused. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"That's more I can say
for you," blurted out Link. "Leave us alone." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Charming kid," Mr.
Dotson murmured, obviously thinking otherwise. He looked at Amanda. "One of
your brood?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Link is a very talented
artist. Jane is helping to foster his talent." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I see," said Mr.
Dotson, in a tone that said otherwise. "Well, it was nice meeting you," he said
with obviously false sincerity. "However, I must excuse myself to meet with my
fans. Adieu." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane shook her head.
"Well, he hasn't changed much." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"You said it,"
replied Alison tightly. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The Lanes and friends
continued touring the gallery. Wind seemed infatuated with so many paintings.
He might not have much in the way of artistic expression or talent, but he
certainly appreciated it. He was hypersensitive to whatever an artist might
possibly mean. Sometimes he even seemed to be right. But Trent appeared
oblivious to the entire gallery. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Wind would say things
like, "Such color! Such form and movement! I could look at that picture for
hours..." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Me, too," Trent would
reply hoarsely, "and I still wouldn't figure out what it's about." Wind looked
bemused as Jane and Alison stifled a laugh. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>They couldn't help but
notice Mr. Dotson displaying several of his works to a varied crowd and some
people with cams. One work on display was the "Paper Plate Genocide" he had
showed at the art colony. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>But what drew Daria and
Jane's attention was the cam marked Sick, Sad World. They drew closer, and
everyone else followed them unconsciously. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Right now, Dotson was
showing a new masterpiece of his that he called, "Judgment of the Walrus." It
was several open and empty clam shells on a tray with a judge's hammer glued to
it. He was explaining how he was inspired after reading Lewis Carroll. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I don't get it,"
murmured Amanda. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"You have to know what
the artist was thinking," said an art major, who seemed shocked by Amanda's
lack of artistic understanding. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane interrupted with,
"Why should she know something that Mr. Dotson doesn't?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Amanda excused herself
suddenly, and went into the ladies room to run some water and hide her
laughter. Because of that, she missed the best part. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Excuse me, Mr. Dotson!"
shouted a blonde, Sick, Sad World reporter with a strong accent that none of
the visitors could identify. "What do you have to say about the footage of
yourself and Mr. Evans in a passionate embrace at the New Year's Ball?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Lies! All lies!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"But Mr. Dotson, you
couldn't get space at a garage sale until Mr. Evans gave high praise to your
work, and he didn't do that until after the New Year's bash! <span class=GramE>Is
that a coincidence?" <br>
<br>
"Ridiculous!</span> I had good reviews from him long before that time!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"But weren't you his
editor? And didn't you replace Hanson Dmitri's name with your own?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"It's true!" shouted a
man with dark hair and a beard. "My best works! From Toy Train Disaster to
Paper Plate Genocide, he took them all from me! Mr. Evans said he would deal
with it, but then it was the New Year's bash!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I'll not take anymore
of this slanderous abuse! You'll be hearing from my lawyer, all of you!" Mr.
Dotson stormed off the stage. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I never knew," murmured
Alison. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I'm not convinced,"
said Daria. "Who would steal Paper Plate Genocide?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Since they had seen all
there was to see, and the excitement seemed to be over, they went outside back
to the Tank as soon as Amanda had rejoined them. As they left, they passed Mr.
Dotson smoking a cigarette. He glared at them, assuming that they had come out
to taunt him. The fact that they were leaving never occurred to him. "So," he
said bitterly, "after that ridiculous personal attack on me by my enemies,
you've come out to mock me." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"On the contrary," said
Daria, who was only a few feet away from him now as she passed, "it's scarcely
necessary." Daria smiled as Mr. Dotson glared at her with some fury. With Trent
behind her, she wasn't worried about a physical attack, and with a lawyer mom,
she wasn't worried about being sued. She left him to his muse. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria wondered if they
could all gang up on Trent and have him play something else--anything else, or
even nothing--on the drive home. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>9. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill was in the
homeless area of Baltimore, the proverbial "wrong side of the tracks," away
from Lawndale. <span class=GramE>The area with all the drunks and crack
addicts, the soup kitchens and pimps.</span> He was dressed down, but not
shabbily. He wanted to be as bland and unmemorable as possible. He wasn't the
slightest bit afraid as he had parked his car and got out. He was the predator.
The demonic hunger within him told him with full certainty that all the people
around him, even the violent ones, were his lawful prey and he would not be
denied. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Like any predator, he
favored the weak and the wounded. His heightened senses were attuned to any cry
for help that would tell him where to feed. And he needed to feed, but he knew
it would be a bad idea to be in the area of too many suicides. And out here, no
one was likely to be missed by anyone important. Walking along, he slowly
absorbed the energy that was made digestible to him by the despair. There
wasn't as much as he thought there'd be, but it would hold him until he found
true game. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Instinct focused on a
woman looking in a window. She had a cigarette in her hand, but it was
unlighted. Instinct told him to light it. So he went up to her and said, "Need
a light?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She smiled at him and
nodded. With one hand, she brought the cigarette to her mouth. With the other,
she put 4 fingers under her shoulder for a moment. His instincts told him she
said, "Starting price is $40." <span class=GramE>A prostitute.</span> That was
fine. <span class=GramE>Maybe even perfect.</span> This street etiquette was
new to him, though, and he had only instinct to go on. He would have to remain
wary. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I'm new in town," said
Mr. O'Neill, by way of greeting as he lit her cigarette. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Yeah, I thought you
were," she said. He could feel her sizing him up. She wasn't too impressed with
his appearance, judging him as not having much money. "And it's not vice night,
so you're probably not a cop." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"No, I'm not a cop,"
said Mr. O'Neill, "I do have $200, but nothing to do. I was wondering if maybe
you could show me <span class=GramE>around?</span>" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She smiled more
sincerely, <span class=GramE>then</span> said, "We could go to your place. I'm
sure we can find something to do there." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill laughed
shyly. "Well," he said, "I have someone there and it would be.... awkward." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She shrugged. "I know a
place real close. Come on!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She led him to a nearby
apartment that he hoped he never had to live in himself. The fridge in an
adjoining kitchenette was small and in view the moment she opened the <span
class=GramE>door,</span> and everything was in shambles. He sensed someone
sleeping in another room, but he couldn't get any firm details. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then a sleeping gray cat
suddenly bolted up right and stiff, hissing at Mr. O'Neill. Then it came at
him, hair standing up, baleful glare and unholy yowl. Mr. O'Neill backed up a
step, truly afraid. The anger in this cat was too much to cut <span
class=GramE>through,</span> and somehow IT KNEW WHAT HE WAS! Worse, the tenuous
psychic link he had already formed with this lamb was suddenly even more tenuous.
He was too shocked, and almost ran. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Oh, Mary Jane," chided
the woman. She picked the cat up and put her out. The cat remained outside the
door hissing and yowling. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She turned back to her
date. "Let's see some money," she <span class=GramE>said,</span> very business
like. The link was <span class=SpellE>reforged</span>, and he could feel her
excitement. She not only was getting money, which was survival, but she was
also being accepted. Mr. O'Neill allowed her the moment, grateful to her for
saving him from the evil cat, and out of pity at what was about to happen. He
pulled out $60 and said, "This is a start." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Cool." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She took it into the
kitchenette, and asked him, "Do you want a drink? Some grass?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"No, thank you. You're
enough." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He heard her moving
around, and then she came back. "You mind if I play my Last Dance CD?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>O'Neill gestured that he
didn't mind, thinking it might be useful for drowning out sounds that he didn't
want to disturb others with. Haunting <span class=SpellE>darkwave</span> soon
filled the front room. </span></span><br>
<br>

them. </span></span><br>

<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Do you want me to suck
your dick?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill actually
blushed. He didn't know why he hadn't expected something like that. "Um, I'm
not sure. Let's just neck, and let nature take its course." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Neck? <span

betrayal by friends, nasty johns, a pimp that scared her who was trying to
force her into his stable, a possibly suicidal guy going nowhere in the next
room that had her pull tricks while he tried hooking up "with some old friends"
to do a little B&amp;E with the hope that they could trade stolen goods for
drugs. Her name was Vicki, but she liked going by the name of <span
class=SpellE>Joyleaf</span>. So far, she hadn't actually given him any name,
mundanely speaking. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><i><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>last night I thought

class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>A suppressed memory came
to him of her meeting a guy, going off with him, being gang raped by him and
four friends. She was in her early teens when it happened, and the experience
left permanent scars and various STD's, including a "non-specific" one that
came and went, but couldn't be identified, let alone treated. This was his key.
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Tell me about the time
you were gang raped, Vicki." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She instantly stopped.
"Get away from me, fucker!" She was instantly pissed, but he could feel that
her fear was stronger than her anger. He caught her realization that she'd
never given him her name. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill REACHED into
her with his Hunger. She gasped, but she stayed in control of herself. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Take your money and go,
fucker!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill punched her
in the mouth. She cried out and she also bled. He quickly took some blood and
put it in his mouth, letting the connection strengthened. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>His eyes widened in
shock at the rage in her. Even more, she had just stuck a switchblade knife in
him. He lunged, pinning her arms, as the knife hung from his abs. She screamed
in disbelief, rage, and the beginning of true terror. "PAUL!" she
shouted in a panic, and then her voice caught in her throat, frozen by the will
of the monster that had her in his grasp. He licked at some more of the blood,
and he owned her, invading her soul to plunder it of all its pain to feed on. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He saw there was more to
the gang rape. Her parents were never that close to her, but her dad (who was
living elsewhere) wouldn't talk to her anymore, and her mom seemed to think she
brought it on herself. She had become pregnant, and her mom made her abort it
to keep shame from coming to the family. But she had already been raped and by
multiple men, and that alone was enough of a blow to the family name. Her mom
even callously asked her if a certain boy would want "damaged goods" like
her once. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She had tried getting
help from others, but to no avail. Others she knew back then had never
experienced any such thing, and didn't like to think that they might, so they
shunned her. Counselors were incompetent, and in one case, exploitive and in
another, sexually abusive. She fell into drugs and then met people with similar
experiences, people she felt she could relate to and belong with. She began
exchanging sex for the affection she didn't get anywhere else, and each time
her mother found out she was told this was why she had been gang raped to begin
with. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She'd gotten into harder
drugs and left home, eventually turning to prostitution to pay the bills and
avoid the drug tests of a mundane job that didn't pay enough anyway. She
thought about suicide, but was scared of death. And she hated how her boyfriend
in the next room talked casually about suicide, threatening to abandon her. She'd
already have kicked his butt some, but he kept wishing he was dead, and she was
scared to push him. She just wished she could go to sleep and forget all these
horrible memories and her fucked up life and never wake up. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The monster Mr. O'Neill
had her <span class=GramE>now,</span> broken past the last of her resistance,
and her pain was so ineffably delicious. He reached down to his abs and pulled
the knife out. He could feel the pierced muscles and organs already beginning
to <span class=SpellE>reknit</span>. Meanwhile, he made her relive the defining
hell of her life over and over and over, years of pain and frustration summed
up in seconds. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>And then, all too
quickly, she collapsed and he got nothing more. Mr. O'Neill knew she wasn't
dead, but she wasn't fully alive either. She was in some kind of coma. He felt
horrible disappointment. Had she not stabbed him, he would've been sated, but
with the healing, he needed more recharging. He was so disappointed, he almost
cried. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody1><i><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>be</span></i></span></span><span

class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He turned toward the
form he felt sleeping in the bedroom. He already caught that his name was Paul,
but his heightened senses now told him that he was also called Mouse, though he
kept trying in vain to get people to call him Iceman. Another addict, he was
currently sleeping off tweaking for five days straight. And he manipulated
people like Vicki by holding himself hostage via suicide threats. In trying to
save him, they would try to save themselves, and do anything to keep him from
"offing" himself. He smiled and went to his room, carrying the switchblade. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Paul had many fears. He
just barely feared dying more than he feared living. But O'Neill was able to
amplify those fears. And the male was so weak and vulnerable to him that Mr.
O'Neill made this meal last much longer. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Paul took a satisfying
long time to die, filling his every pore. Paul slowly slashed himself to death,
while O'Neill gagged his involuntary screams with a sock in the mouth and a
belt pulled over his mouth. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Feeling very satisfied,
he left the flat, which was now deathly silent except for the slight
refrigerator noise and a buzzing fly which sounded eerie and unnatural in the
flat turned sepulchral. He took the switchblade with him, along with the $60 he
had given her, not touching the money that was already there. He also took a
windbreaker to wear over his shirt, as his own had blood on it. No big deal. He
smiled, not caring if anyone saw him leave. It might even be days, or longer,
before anyone found them, and they'd blame the entire tragic event on the drugs
the two abused. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>But right after he
locked the door and shut it behind him, he found himself surrounded outside the
door by Mary Jane and four other cats, two of them looking feral. He'd had
trouble with cats in Lawndale, but not like this. He felt their rage as
murderous, and he ran. They chased him for about a block, and then he seemed to
be free of them. Cats had never liked him, and dogs stayed away from him. It
seemed the stronger he got, so to did the antipathy the cats and dogs felt for
him. Not feeling as fearless as he had moments ago, he realized this could
become a serious problem. He had no idea why this was happening, but he decided
then that he should check the folklore and myths tomorrow, to see if he could
find some clue to this pattern, and maybe even a reason for it, and if there
was a way to counter it. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He began walking to his
car, which was about a mile away. He whistled something as he went. He had
never done that before, but now somehow it felt natural to him. He knew it was
something Paul had done when he was younger, walking to and from a Catholic
school. He remembered how he felt compelled to write poems for a couple of days
after he swallowed Lori's soul, too. He frowned as another cat hissed at him,
but it retreated. Perhaps they only became aggressive if he entered what they
considered their lair. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>His senses were sharper
than they had ever been. His potential was being tapped even further, and
despite this new complication, he felt like an excited child. When he felt a
raw source of pain calling to him from nearby, he let himself get lost in the
urge to hunt. It reminded him of how excited Paul had been when he found Easter
eggs as a child. He tracked it down to a lone junkie in an alley. He walked up
to him, but jumped as a feral cat jumped out from a trash can, <span
class=GramE>hissed</span>, and took off running. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The junkie came to, saw
him approaching, and snarled, "Go away!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill smiled and
asked "Why would I want to do that?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then he brought his foot
up and stomped him in the mouth. The junkie cursed and tried to roll away, but
Mr. O'Neill was on him in a heartbeat. He was stronger, too, and he was already
taking over the man's mind as he licked some of the blood that had come out of
his mouth. With a taste of blood and alcohol and tobacco, he fully entered him
and almost laughed at the junkie's shock at the attack. Oh, it was sweet! With
each new victim, he was able to squeeze more than the last one! </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The man was Mr.
DeMartino's age. He had gotten busted smoking weed at 18 and thrown in the Army
to "teach him responsibility." Busted for grass again, he got sent to 'Nam.
There he not only smoked grass, but enjoyed harder drugs, like heroin. There
was constant pain and despair and disgrace. It was hell. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>And then his platoon
surrounded a village that was supposed to be hiding some <span class=SpellE>Charlies</span>.
All he could see were the elderly and the young, with some young mothers out.
He didn't see too much of anyone who could be a Charlie. He wondered if they
would storm the village. Then the order was given to fire. He didn't know why,
but he didn't question it. Someone had seen something. The shooting began. He
shot, too, too terrified to even aim properly. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Afterward, they were led
into the village. There were no <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Charlies</span></span><span
class=GramE>,</span> they had slaughtered a village of innocents. Their
commander didn't care, claiming with a tone of assurance that these villagers
gave comfort to the enemy. They shot the few survivors. His platoon was sent to
dig a pit. Several hours later, most of the villagers were in the pit, along
with some animals, and lye was spread over them. The village was then set on
fire, and they left. Let's hear it for governments spreading their endless
death and destruction in contesting exploitation rights under the headings of
"national security," "law and order," and "the public good." Or was there
really a reason that would make sense of what he did? </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>And it had always
haunted him. He had thrown in several corpses himself. <span class=GramE>Animals.</span>
<span class=GramE>Old men.</span> <span class=GramE>Women.</span> <span
class=GramE>Small children.</span> <span class=GramE>Infants.</span> He had
followed orders, and no one could've faulted him for that. While the Manson
family was prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, those that committed
the even worse atrocities at My Lai were barely slapped on the wrist despite
global outrage. The only one given a life sentence was pardoned almost
immediately by President Nixon who believed the officer thought he was truly
following orders. This was a complete reversal of the Nuremberg trials and
similar trials in Tokyo that executed soldiers who claimed they were just
following orders, but the President couldn't be morally wrong, could he?
Besides, he'd heard that it was a base of sorts, and now the <span
class=SpellE>Charlies</span> couldn't use it anymore. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>But it was a village in
South Vietnam! </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>There was at least one
more casualty in that village: himself. <span class=GramE>More specifically,
his soul.</span> He'd felt any self-worth die in that village, too. As he left
the carnage they put in a pit of lye, he'd felt a heavy weight burden his soul,
a stain that he could never be rid of, and the smell of blood and lye somehow
seemed to permanently linger around him. He began losing sleep because he was
back gunning down villagers nearly every time he closed his eyes, even for a moment.
He'd have blown his own brains out except he feared Hell too much and he
wondered if maybe there was some explanation and some redemption that he did
not yet see. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He did more drugs and
lost himself to narcotic addiction. But he wasn't left behind the way other
lost souls like him had been. He made it home, now seen as a "real
man" by his family, rather than the mass murderer that he saw himself as.
But he was different. He had nightmares. Sometimes when he saw his face in the
mirror, he whispered, "Murderer." He once even smashed a mirror. And
the only thing that could stop his nightmares and his self-torture was heroin.
It was his medicine, his chicken soup for the soul. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>But he did marry, and
even had a few kids, but he could never look at his own kids without
remembering the Vietnamese children he helped to bury in a shallow mass grave
of lye. Somehow, other soldiers, including those that had also taken part in
the massacre he participated in, put it behind them, but he wasn't able to do
it. They didn't want to talk about it, and one said he'd kill him if he ever
showed up again. It wasn't long after that death threat that he was busted for
heroin, grass, and cocaine. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Not only did his family
disown him, but his wife got a divorce and quickly remarried another man that
he believed she had been having an affair with for years. He spent years in and
out of prison, rehab centers, and on the streets. He would get on some kind of
government program, only to be kicked off when the hunger finally overwhelmed
him. But H no longer gave him any temporary <span class=GramE>relief,</span> it
simply kept him from <span class=SpellE>suiciding</span>. He may have been
alone, in tremors and nightmares, and the vision of all those villagers he had
buried, but he knew it was better than he deserved. A vision he never shared
with others, his shame was so great. He knew there was evil in the world, and
he was it, his soul sobbed. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill slowly
started becoming aware of the alley again. He looked down and saw that the
junkie was dead. He had simply died, somehow depleted of all his bio-energy,
and Mr. O'Neill felt great. It was as if his cells, somehow gorged, were <span
class=SpellE>metamorphically</span> changing into something else. And the
change brought ecstasy. That time, it had been so real, he had even forgotten
where he was. Each feeding Awakened him more and more into his destiny, leading
him to some great transubstantiation. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He left, feeling as if
he were glowing with vitality, and continued for his car, his senses impossibly
sharper than before. At this point, he was practically a telepath, too, getting
stray thoughts from people's heads as he passed them. Everyone was a beacon,
radiating life force. <span class=GramE>Except him.</span> He was a void that
all that force was pulled into. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then he telepathically
saw a stray memory of some black girl shot in the head. Focusing on it, he
realized that she'd told her boyfriend to treat her with more respect, and he'd
shot her in the head as a response. Finally, he realized that this memory was
from the grief of her best friend who'd seen the murder, and she was near.
Somehow he realized then that it was the young, teen girl of ebony skin he
could see across the street sitting at a bus stop, he started to approach to
feed without even thinking, when he suddenly reeled, startled. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>There was a dark <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>hispanic</span></span> male in a doorway a few
feet away from the young girl that somehow demanded all his attention. But
unlike all the other cattle around him, he radiated nothing, and so O'Neill
gained no thoughts or emotions. He was a sinkhole that drew all energy within <span
class=GramE>himself</span>, and he was staring balefully at Mr. O'Neill. And
then he realized what he was: </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>A predator like himself!
And he was stronger. And now he was coming for him, just waiting for the
traffic to clear. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill panicked and
ran as fast as he could, which he found was faster than he'd have imagined
possible. He didn't know what the fellow creature like himself wanted, but he
was sure the guy was territorial. He hadn't thought about that problem, of
there being others like himself to compete with. He would have to get his own
stable. The thought of starting a Cry <span class=GramE>For</span> Help Corral
again flitted across his mind. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>After several blocks, he
stopped running and caught his breath within mere moments. As he continued
toward his car at a brisk pace, he wondered how many mental hospitals, prisons,
teen rehabilitation centers, and schools were run by people--creatures--like
himself. How many politicians were creatures like <span class=GramE>himself</span>?
Was one of the teachers at his old high school a creature like him? And how
many were <span class=SpellE>latents</span>, as he himself had been until this
last Saturday, and how many had <span class=GramE>Awakened</span>? </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>As another cat hissed at
him, he suddenly recalled that cats in particular were either considered
guardians against malign entities and goblins, or were executed in droves for
being evil spirits themselves. He wondered then, how many popes and preachers
and inquisitors, particularly the ones that killed the animals as familiars of
their victims, had been like him? </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>And that led to a
startling question: just how many were there in the world like him now? How
many were Awakened, and how many still Slept? And were there OTHER entities
different from <span class=GramE>himself</span>? </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Too
many questions.</span></span></span><span class=postbody1><span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'> And the two things he'd learned today both taught
him that what he didn't know could seriously hurt him, possibly even destroy
him. But he was much stronger than he had ever imagined, even if he knew he
wasn't ready to challenge another Awakened yet. He would have to avoid this
place in the future, at least until he was even stronger. Shaking his head in
disappointment at the loss of this fertile hunting ground, he reached his car
and got in. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Driving</span></span></span><span
class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> back to Lawndale, he
contemplated how he was stronger, and contemplated how he could now kill
directly by draining without ordering his victims to off themselves as he had
with his last victim. That would be most useful. He spent the rest of the drive
home wondering whom to tap and kill first. Maybe Lori's family, O'Neill mused.
After all, they had enough problems. And a suicide in the family often led to others.
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>His thoughts ran swiftly
as he returned to his lair, for he had classes to teach tomorrow.<o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody1><span style='font-size:10.5pt;
font-family:Verdana;letter-spacing:0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody1><span style='font-size:10.5pt;
font-family:Verdana;letter-spacing:0pt'>10. </span></span><span
style='font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Verdana'><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane and Daria entered
the coffee bar known as Arcanum 17, known locally as the Ark 17, behind Wind
and Alison. Even though it was Friday night, the place wasn't crowded, and it
was dark. There had been some people outside smoking and talking, and that was
probably the smoking area from which they would be returning from. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Sure enough, there were
plenty of <span class=SpellE>goths</span>. For the most part, they seemed
divided into different cliques or styles of <span class=SpellE>goths</span>,
with only some intermixing. Many of the <span class=SpellE>artsies</span> and
college students were also evident, and seemingly keeping to themselves among
their own crowds, too. But there was a little mixing. And a few people were
obviously just here with dates, or to get hooked up, or maybe to see what
unholy rites went on. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The place did not serve
alcohol, but did serve a lot of coffee. And espresso and cappuccino and latte
and a host of other drinks, many of which would keep you up through the night. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>There were also many
paintings hung around the building. Several were of the avant-garde kind, full
of chaotic images, twisting landscapes, and dreamlike images. Some were
enigmatic and creepy, like the one of modern girls dressed as Britney Spears
running innocently about a Victorian home, while one Victorian-age girl seemed
erotically charged, while being attacked by a curtain. Another was that of
hanged men holding briefcases, each hung from the gallows by their own ties.
Another had a television with many eyes watching the people on the couch
watching it. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Others were less
surrealistic, but still odd. One was an ape looking in a mirror to see a human
staring back. Another had flags with their stripes as prison bars, holding
people captive. An especially intriguing one had people facing you. But instead
of faces, there was a dark, reflective glass that distorted your own image back
at you. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Someone mumbled out
poetry up front from a <span class=SpellE>mic</span>. Since they only heard
part of it, the friends ignored it as background noise and kept looking at the
visual art. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>There were a few
photographic pieces, too. One had only half a boy that seemed to have branches
for arms coming out of his shirtsleeves. Another had a woman looking out into
an endless ocean on some foggy day that looked otherworldly. A third had a
screaming mermaid being held by a giant hand out to a cat trying to catch her.
Another one was just haunting: several sad children around a dead rabbit. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then there were many
drawings, with a few paintings and one photograph, with the theme of vampires
or of cat-human hybrids. Most were more erotic than creepy, macabre, or
horrific. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I always thought it was
interesting," said Alison casually, "that what would normally be banned as
sexist and pornographic is made okay if you add an element of vampires to it."
She shook her head. "I can't help but wonder about a society that find animated
corpses robbing the living of their blood and their life more acceptable and
empowering than the images of open sexuality." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria and Jane did spend
a few moments imagining the vampire leaning over his helpless victim with
ripped clothing and bite marks as a human male instead of a vampire male. <span
class=GramE>Or the one of a scantily clad female vampire leering out of the drawn
portrait as a human exotic dancer.</span> Two naked female vampires licking
each other's necks, fangs protruding, in a graveyard, above a man slashed to
pieces as being ordinary women. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Yeah, it was easy to see
the PC thought police taking offense at the porn and exploitation and hatred of
women, if the vampire elements were missing. But with the vampire elements,
they were not only praised instead of condemned, but the artists had prices on
them that were typically a couple of hundred dollars and higher. <span
class=GramE>Weird.</span> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Hey," said Jane
sounding a bit disturbed, "Check this one out." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria got up closer to
the drawing. Her eyes widened at the sight of the vampire biting the neck of a
helpless teen. The vampire and victim were dead ringers for Mr. O'Neill and
Lori. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria took a breath and
asked Jane, "Did you hear what happened to Lori's family?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Who hasn't," said Jane
frowning. Apparently, Lori's brother and sister had also killed themselves,
possibly as part of a suicide pact. And then their mother came home, found her
last two kids dead, and killed herself, too. It was all over the news, with
reporters speculating about possible foul play or the involvement of cults. But
so far it looked like nothing more than a horrible tragedy. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Wind put an arm around
Alison who was being uncharacteristically withdrawn. Alison flashed him a
smile, but it was a distant one. They moved to a nearby portrait of Bast
dressed as a <span class=GramE>goth</span>. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>But Daria and Jane both
grimaced as they continued to morbidly stare at the O'Neill and Lori drawing
before them. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Ahem. Attend." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>All four turned to see a
<span class=GramE>goth</span> appearing to be in her young 20s wearing what
looked to be the black robe of a Catholic priest. The only visible accessories
were a Russian Orthodox cross hung from her neck and Doc Martins on her feet.
Her shoulder-length hair fell black and thick around her pale, full face and
green-gray eyes. Her hands, with black fingernails, were interlaced with one
another, almost as if she were in prayer. She pulled the otherworldly and
creepy aura off perfectly. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I have a message," she
said, "from the other side." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison sighed.
"Cassandra...." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"It's important," she
hissed. "You are being hunted. He will devour you, if given half a chance." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria was the first to
recover. She asked, "Who?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"You know him," said
Cassandra melodramatically. <span class=GramE>"Him."</span> She pointed to the
pictured vampire that looked like Mr. O'Neill. They noticed then that Cassandra
had drawn the portrait, and she had titled it simply "Evil Night Angel." She
would have guessed that Cassandra had gotten the inspiration from the news--Mr.
O'Neill had been interviewed over the girl's death after all--but it was dated
from over a month ago. Mr. O'Neill had seen Lori kill herself about a week ago.
Maybe she faked the date? </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Cassandra abruptly
turned and left. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Sorry about that," said
Alison. "She gets crazy like that sometimes. She does a lot of <span
class=SpellE>shrooms</span>. Sometimes she just giggles, other <span
class=GramE>times,</span> she gets all weird and mystical on you." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane and Daria both
couldn't help but shudder, and they all decided not to look at any more of the
visual art tonight. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I can't believe I
haven't heard of this place," said Jane. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"It opened only a few
months ago," said Alison. "For the most part, it's still for people around
Middleton College. But word is spreading, especially among artistes of all
kinds, and recently the <span class=SpellE>goths</span>." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>As soon as Alison said
that, Wind was rudely bumped by a gothic guy out of some nightmare. Ripped
shirt, ripped jeans, thick boots with several straps, and a trench coat. Black,
tangled hair cascaded down his back with the sides of his head shaved, white
make up covered his face, black lipstick was applied sloppily to his mouth and
mascara around his misanthropic eyes, and he sported the standard black
fingernails. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The gothic death rocker
snarled, "Watch it, pretty boy!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Sorry," said Wind both
annoyed and apologetic. He blinked. "Are you wearing makeup?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Just because I'm
wearing makeup doesn't mean I can't kick your ass, mamma's boy." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Wind seemed on the verge
of panicking, and the other three frowned. Daria and Jane wondered if they made
a mistake coming here. Even The Zen usually didn't have people this
belligerent. Then a female <span class=GramE>goth</span>, looking
concerned--and less disturbing--grabbed the nightmare, saying, "There you are.
Come on, already, stop fucking around!" She had neon red hair, combat boots,
desert combat fatigue pants that looked baggy on her, despite her medium build,
held up by a leather belt. Her shirt proclaimed, "Don't piss me off, I'm
running out of places to hide the bodies." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Thanks," said
Wind, watching the death rocker lurch away. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Never mind him," said
their casual savior. "He overdosed on his friend's vitamins yesterday and
didn't wake up until 2 hours ago. And we can't decide if we should let him have
any more coffee until the vitamins wear off or not." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane asked, "Vitamins?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Vitamin R," said the
woman. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Vitamin R?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Ritalin" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Why was he taking his
friend's Ritalin?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She shrugged. <span
class=GramE>"Buzz.</span> Besides, he's been stressed over all the suicides and
murders lately. He lost a couple of friends himself a couple of days ago. A
friend of his slipped into a coma of some kind, and his other friend living
with her slashed himself to death. They think the guy who died may have been
gone a couple of days before the body was found." She gave a look of pity and
distaste. "Officially, it's drugs, since drugs have replaced Satan for causing
all evil in the world. But not too many believe it. I don't. I mean he talked
about it, but he was sliced to ribbons. He's too much of a pain wimp. I think
the cops are just trying to lighten their caseload." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"<span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>Wo</span></span>," said Jane, "that really sucks." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Yeah," she said, "It
does. Anyway, he had to take her cat, who is acting all traumatized. <span
class=GramE>Poor kitty.</span> And stuff like that isn't only happening in the
city itself, but here, and even over in Lawndale." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane and Daria
unconsciously looked toward the drawing of a vampire that looked like their
teacher, and a victim that looked like a recent suicide in Lawndale. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Oh, shit! <span
class=GramE>Gotta go!"</span> She ran off. Apparently, the guy who <span
class=SpellE>ODed</span> on Ritalin was snarling at someone else. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison was laughing with
Wind. "You okay? What would your mom say to make it all better?" Wind seemed to
be enjoying the teasing. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I wonder," said Daria,
"if he had time to put on makeup, why didn't he have time to brush his hair?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane looked up and
thought. <span class=GramE>"An artistic statement regarding the time we waste
on trivialities, but ignore the important stuff that we have to think about
with our heads?" <br>
<br>
"<span class=SpellE>Ohhhh</span>.</span> Ok."<o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody1><span style='font-size:10.5pt;
font-family:Verdana;letter-spacing:0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody1><span style='font-size:10.5pt;
font-family:Verdana;letter-spacing:0pt'>"I see a good table," said Wind.
"You wanna hear the poetry, right, Alison?" </span></span><span
style='font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Verdana'><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Wind," said Alison
seeming amused, "I plan to read poetry. Yes, get us somewhere near our usual
place." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>After getting some
drinks and snacks, the four sat at a table near the far wall but close to the
stage. Above a small stage hung a sign that read <b>ELEPHANTS ARE CONTAGIOUS!</b>
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria turned to Jane.
"Elephants are contagious?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Surrealism," said Jane.
"Two of the poets that founded surrealism were said to use this phrase, and it
has come to represent the poetry of the movement." She knew this stuff. She'd
been around artists and art camps enough to have picked up on the basics. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Surrealism was actually
more to do with the liberation of language," said Alison. "The poetic
experience was the true fount of wisdom, liberating us from the confines of
'ordinary reason and discourse.' Some thought it was a type of psychic
channeling of the subconscious wisdom that could lead society to a
non-repressive civilization." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Surrealism," added
Wind, "like the Dadaism it sprang from, had many forms of expression. Most
people just remember the paintings, but there were live art performances,
bizarre exhibits, and most of all, poetry." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison smiled at Wind as
she continued, "The <span class=SpellE>Veristics</span> tried decoding the
language of the subconsciousness to the conscious. The Automatists were more
interested in being liberated from all meaning, as they believed imposed
meaning was delusional and oppressive. Both were looking for a way to escape the
authoritarianism inherent in society by freeing the imagination. There's even a
social and political surrealism. South Park can be considered social
surrealism, though plenty of art professors would bristle at the thought. Even
some anarchists have used surrealistic methods in their causes of social
liberation, such as the call to 'become Luther <span class=SpellE>Blissett</span>'."
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Hey," said Jane, who'd
been looking around as Alison talked, "isn't that Andrea?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria leaned forward.
"Yeah," she said, "what's she doing here?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Andrea got on stage. A
lot of clapping and cheering followed. Apparently, she was popular here. She
spoke into the <span class=SpellE>mic</span>: </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Ashes of the dead fill
my mouth, horror coalesces in my gut. The grave I can honor, but not the way we
live. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"People nod sagely at
the most insane decrees, and offer themselves as sacrificial toys to little
sadists in grown up bodies, where murder is a sin, and sin is your sacred duty.
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Force conformity on
all, as long as those who dictate the conformity are the worst models that
tremble before the infinite expressions of the infinite. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"In sordid reflections
we see ourselves, but without recognition. We are already beyond the looking
glass, and we are all mad." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She stomped off stage,
to more clapping, and one guy yelling, "YEAH!" at the top of his lungs. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"She's gotten
better," remarked Jane. "Hey, maybe you should read one of your
Melody Powers stories here." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I don't think
so," said Daria. "The Lawndale Lions might get away with a riot, but
a <span class=GramE>goth</span> riot would probably not be anywhere as
pretty." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I doubt they'd
care enough," replied Jane. "I don't think they get excited over
things like that. Maybe if you had Melody Powers more like Anita Blake." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Forget it,"
said Daria, fighting a smile. Then they both caught Cassandra staring intently
at them. Both blinking uncomfortably, they looked around to see what the other <span
class=SpellE>goths</span> were doing. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>One <span class=GramE>goth</span>
had her blonde hair up in a bun covered under a black see-through veil. She
wore a black leather dress with red frills on the bottom. It looked as if her
dress had a garter belt. She wore black gloves that didn't cover the fingers,
unless you counted the excessive red lace frills that replaced the fingers of
the gloves. She wore a red band around her neck. Black stockings and black high
heels completed the ensemble. She moved cautiously for some reason. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Three <span
class=SpellE>goths</span> passed their table then, two women and a guy. The
women both had red hair and cat eyes, and the guy was completely bald and
draped in a plain black robe. One of the women simply wore jeans, thick black
shoes with heels, and a black shirt that said EVIL in electric blue lettering.
She had her arms folded in front of her, and walked quickly from place to
place. The other woman trailing slightly behind her and "Fester" was thicker
than either of the other two and had what looked to be real red hair, and she
was wearing almost all white that transformed what some would call plain and
overweight into a vision of beauty. Only her thick belt, gloves, and Doc
Martins were black. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>One guy, tall and
gangly, was dressed like a Victorian gentleman, complete with top hat and
parasol in one hand. The only thing that distinguished him from that era was
the sunglasses he wore, even in this dim light. And maybe his black hair
falling straight down his back, that shown bluish in the light. He actually had
the grace of a dancer when he moved, and often used his fingers and hands, even
the one holding the parasol, to emphasize whatever he was saying. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The one he was talking
to wore a black trench coat, black leather boots, with a black hat that looked
like something the "50s secret agent" might wear. His thick black hair fell in
a rough ponytail behind him, down below his shoulders. He was constantly
looking around him as if he were worried about someone sneaking up on him. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>While many seemed to be
dark, sullen, and angst-filled, a few seemed unnaturally happy. Some looked
casual, too, without any affected pretensions at all. Some had many piercings,
and some seemed to have none. Some looked almost plain in a simple black dress
or casual dress (mostly black), while others looked as if they had robbed a Hot
Topic store and were wearing their plunder. A few even seemed to have yarn for
hair, sometimes with their own hair mostly shaved off, and a couple of these
were wearing <span class=SpellE>glo</span>-bracelets. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>And Cassandra seemed
invisible to the <span class=SpellE>goths</span> and other folk flowing around
her as she stared back at Daria and Jane intently. It was as if only Daria and
Jane could see her. They couldn't even tell if she blinked. Enough people moved
in between Cassandra and them that she could have easily blinked unnoticed
then. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then they noticed
another <span class=GramE>goth</span>, this one coming towards them, bouncy and
hyper, with normal, shoulder-length red hair in pigtails and an oval face with
a hint of freckles. <span class=SpellE>Glo</span> bracelets and friendship
bracelets adorned both wrists. <span class=GramE>Black skirt with blue belt
with glitter and stickers of planets, stars, moons all over her belt.</span>
She was the first <span class=GramE>goth</span> they saw in <span class=SpellE>tennies</span>,
too. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane looked to Daria. "<span
class=SpellE>Gothica</span> <span class=SpellE>Pippilotta</span>?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria shrugged and said
nothing. This night was just getting too weird for her. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Hi!" the <span
class=GramE>goth</span> said brightly and quickly, "I'm <span class=SpellE>Zanna</span>!
Mind if I welcome you?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Actually," said Daria,
"We're much too weird for anyone to sit down with us. Even our doctor won't sit
down with us unless we're strapped down first." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Cool," she said,
seeming to mean it, "I like weird. And I like new. And you're new." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"We're not new," said
Alison, who seemed to be debating whether or not they should welcome <span
class=SpellE>Zanna</span>. "Wind and I have been coming here since the place
first opened." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"You're new to me," <span
class=SpellE>Zanna</span> corrected, as she grabbed a chair from a nearby table
and sat down by them. "Tell me what your dreams and passions and aspirations
are." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison looked at the
others, eyes raised in question of whether they minded or not. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Alison is my passion,"
said Wind, ending that question. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Cool, what else?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>As Wind suddenly looked
uncomfortable, Alison interjected with, "Besides becoming an artist that doesn't
have to do anything other than part-time work at most, I'd like to get a lot of
garbage out of my head." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Zanna</span></span></span><span
class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> leaned forward to Alison.
"What would you put in your head, instead?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison blinked at that.
She turned her head a bit as she considered. "I guess that I have more power
over my own reality than the masses around me." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Zanna</span></span></span><span
class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> looked to Jane and Daria who
were watching this bemused. "And you two?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Artist for me, writer
for Daria," said Jane offhandedly. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"But what would you want
to discover or find in yourself?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Hope," said Daria. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"That's so sad," said <span
class=SpellE>Zanna</span>, as if she hurt for Daria. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Realistic," corrected
Jane. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Hope for what exactly?"
<span class=SpellE>Zanna</span> asked Daria. "In relation to you, not the world
out there." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Hope," said Daria,
"that I wouldn't be rejected for myself, or that I won't fear and hate the
rejection sure to come if I show my true self." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"So what you want is to
be loved for being yourself, and not some fake image that society tries to
force on you." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Or at least not hated
for being myself instead of what others say I should be." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>As <span class=SpellE>Zanna</span>
looked to Jane, Jane shrugged and said, "I'd like the ability to trust? At
least, if there is a good reason for it." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Oh, there is,"
said <span class=SpellE>Zanna</span> touching Jane's hand. Jane pulled her hand
away, frowning slightly. "At the very least," said <span class=SpellE>Zanna</span>,
"you should find the ability to trust yourself." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Zanna</span></span></span><span
class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> looked to Wind again who was
pursing his lips. "What would you want?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I'm not sure," said
Wind. "I think the ability to take care of others as well as they take care of
me." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Only Daria heard Jane
mutter, "How about the ability to take care of <span class=GramE>yourself</span>?"
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then more clapping took
place. All five looked up, with <span class=SpellE>Zanna</span> clapping, and
she actually whistled over the din. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Many of you heard
Johnny warn you to stay away from the hag if you wanted to live," said an older
woman that couldn't be easily identified or classified on sight as a <span
class=GramE>goth</span> or anything else. "But the hag within me has a
response." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Good intro for a bunch
of surrealists," Jane quietly said to the others. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"She's the owner,"
Alison replied. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"FOOL!" Some actually
jumped when that came through the <span class=SpellE>mic</span>. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The shout quieted
everyone, and then in a more normal, if creaky voice, she continued: </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"You think you can flee
from me? Shun darkness, avoid solitude, and you'll be safe? Silly child, you
have no idea what you're struggling with. <span class=GramE>An ugly, old woman.</span>
Oh, yes, you say, that's the crone, run away! But what will you do when I don a
different mask? Will you recognize me in my black suit and smooth stained-glass
voice? What about when I'm blonde and busty, and urge you to buy? When I wear
four stars on my uniform collar, will you see the hag then? When my voice rings
with authority from the Oval Office, will you know it's me?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She took a breath, a
dramatic pause, and then said in a harsh tone, "Die for God, country, or big
business, I don't give a damn. The hag, most heartily, welcomes you to Hell." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She walked off the stage
to applause and cheers. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Not bad," said Jane
clapping, "but I wish I heard the poem she was responding to." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Oh, that was done by
some high school <span class=GramE>goth</span> last week," said Alison.
"Something about of avoiding solitude and staying out of the dark or the hag,
or crone, would seize you and take you to Hell." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Heaven and Hell are
inside, you know," said <span class=SpellE>Zanna</span> enthusiastically. "Acid
can show you, if you need to see it for yourself." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison smiled
indulgently at <span class=SpellE>Zanna</span>. "What are your dreams and
passions?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Zanna</span></span></span><span
class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> dramatically proclaimed, "To
be stronger than the darkness that surrounds me and the light that burns me!"
Then she said in a more normal tone of voice, "Remember all the multiverse
resides in you, and you reside in all the multiverse. You can choose the peace,
love, unity, and respect. It's yours to claim. Don't let <span class=SpellE>Choronzon</span>
and his prophet Gray Face fool you into thinking otherwise. And never forget:
when others laugh at you, the multiverse laughs at THEM. So choose <span
class=SpellE>plurrrr-ality</span> existence, and let plurality manifest through
you." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>As they tried translating
the tongues <span class=SpellE>Zanna</span> was speaking in, another <span
class=GramE>goth</span> came up, seeming to be as bouncy as <span class=SpellE>Zanna</span>.
She had black hair with purple and electric blue hair extensions and red
novelty contacts. Beyond that, she just wore a simple black miniskirt, stripped
socks that almost reached her knees, and Do Martens. Jane wondered if she could
get some of those contacts being worn here and wear them to Lawndale High. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Zanna</span></span></span><span
class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> obviously knew her. <span
class=GramE>"Hey, <span class=SpellE>Doob</span>!" <br>
<br>
"Hey, Zen.</span> You still have those <span class=SpellE>shrooms</span>?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I don't need <span
class=SpellE>shrooms</span>! I'm like this all the time! You can keep your
dooms! I'll just play in rhyme!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Doob</span></span></span><span
class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> frowned at that. "You ate
them all by yourself didn't you? You selfish bitch." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I need some latte. You
want some?" <span class=SpellE>Zanna</span> got up. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Andrea approached Daria
and Jane, and seemed to be pointedly ignoring <span class=SpellE>Zanna</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Doob</span>. "Hey. What are you two doing here?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Come to witness the
fall of western civilization," said Daria, "where entropy is art." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Zanna</span></span></span><span
class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> spoke up again. <span
class=GramE>"<span class=SpellE>Extropy</span>!</span> <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>extropy</span></span>!" She actually did a little dance. It was
weird how someone could be cute, charming, and frightening to behold at the
same time. "Not entropy! Entropy is the illusion of decay as a new and better
future is being born right before our eyes!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Never mind her," said
Andrea, "she's a perky graver. The stress of conflicting lifestyles is tearing
her mind a part. Not that the <span class=SpellE>shrooms</span> and other drugs
she likes to partake in help." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Never mind her," said <span
class=SpellE>Zanna</span>, pointing melodramatically to Andrea. "She's just a <span
class=SpellE>mopey</span> <span class=SpellE>rager</span>. Not that the beer she
guzzles helps." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Bitch!" cried Andrea
looking down at her shirt, "You got that glitter shit all over me again! You <span
class=SpellE>goddam</span> candy!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Hey," said <span
class=SpellE>Zanna</span> to Andrea in a voice of concern, "Turn that frown
upside down!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Suddenly, Andrea and <span
class=SpellE>Zanna</span> just weren't there anymore. <span class=SpellE>Doob</span>
made some small sound of disgust and stomped off <span class=SpellE>indigantly</span>
the way she came. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Wow," said Daria
watching Andrea chase <span class=SpellE>Zanna</span>. "She even runs faster
than you can." Despite <span class=SpellE>Zanna</span> being much more
lightweight and long-legged, Andrea wasn't losing ground. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Faster than I do,"
corrected Jane lightly. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"And
through such an obstacle course, too."</span></span></span><span
class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then <span class=SpellE>Zanna</span>
crashed into the gothic nightmare that had threatened Wind, causing the <span
class=GramE>goth</span> to spill whatever he was drinking all over himself. "Bitch!"
he seemed to yell, getting up. <span class=SpellE>Zanna</span> took off, and
then Andrea crashed into the dripping <span class=GramE>goth</span>, causing
him to fall and hit his head and knocking him out. Meanwhile, <span
class=SpellE>Zanna</span> raced outside with Andrea not far behind. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria and Jane were
startled when they saw Cassandra standing beside their table, staring ominously
at all four of them. "In case you missed the significance, <span class=SpellE>Mopey</span>
and Perky are equal manifestations of the Divine. They were surrounded by less
obvious, but just as significant, divine manifestations." She left them again,
almost seeming to glide like a wraith. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria was getting that
creeped-out feeling again. "Did everybody get the <span class=SpellE>shrooms</span>
but us?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Oh, let me read my
poem," said Alison a bit tiredly, "so that we can leave soon." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison marched straight
up to the <span class=SpellE>mic</span>. Scattered applause came up. Alison
began reading from a paper without any introduction: </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Hear my warning: </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Sometimes love is
stronger than cruelty and indifference, but only <span class=GramE>so</span>
long as the cruel and indifferent don't know. Cold, alone, dying inside, <span
class=GramE>Who'd</span> ever guess that love would save me from my hell, only
to cast me into a deeper pit of hell further below? </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Love, like solitude,
beckons us all enigmatically and terrifyingly to our ultimate downfall. </span></span><br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Hate, like love, washes
away the laughter and tears of the world, even as it lethally sustains us all. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"The ghost of my love
reminds me that forbidden love can only be so pure, comforting and perfect, as
long as the masses remain ignorant of your passions, and you keep your
empowering comfort secret. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"It's too late for us
now, and she lies abandoned and unloved by all in her vault. Both of us brought
shame to our families, her death accusing me it's my fault. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I live on, but my siren
lover still sings, her love haunting me, as does her hate. And I try to
remember that our fall was not my fault, it was only our fate. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Was living or dying the
greater mistake, I wonder, since I live and she doesn't, yet we both writhe in
hellfire. Death, like the Life it is, robs me of my hopes and dreams, while
beckoning with promises of all that I desire. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"So hearken! Should you
ever find love in a world of cruelty and indifference, never let anyone know,
and always keep your distance. Or the one you loved will become the cruelest of
all, and nothing will silence the ghastly shrieks of your lover's undead
countenance." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The clapping was much
more intense as she came off the stage, with some whistling thrown in. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Wow," said Jane, "That
was more intense than I'd expect from you." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"There's a lot you don't
know about me, Jane," said Alison somewhat annoyed. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane, Daria, and Wind
looked uncomfortable. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I'm sorry," said
Alison, rubbing her forehead with her hands. "I think I got too much caffeine
in my system. I'm shaking enough. It just seems to me that tonight is being
really weird." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Yeah," said Jane, "I
think there is a major disturbance in the force. Wanna go home, or stay
longer?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>They all agreed to go
home. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"We should've brought
Tom with us," said Jane to Daria as they were walking to the door. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria smiled. <span
class=GramE>"Oh, no.</span> For real fun, we should've brought the entire
Sloane family." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria and Jane grinned
evilly to one another just before Jane reached out keep the exit from closing.
Daria turned to look behind her one last time as she was walking out the door,
and saw Cassandra, seemingly invisible to all but them, staring intently at
them still, somehow striking Daria as an omen of doom.<o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody1><span style='font-size:10.5pt;
font-family:Verdana;letter-spacing:0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody1><span style='font-size:10.5pt;
font-family:Verdana;letter-spacing:0pt'>11. </span></span><span
style='font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Verdana'><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane didn't think it was
weird that Mr. O'Neill was in her room painting her portrait on her canvas. Nor
did she think it was strange that the more defined she became on the canvas,
the weaker she felt. She heard some distant cries, and then realized they were
from the canvas Mr. O'Neill was painting on. She looked closely, and saw
several people in the background screaming for help. One of them was Lori. And
then she saw her own portrait was frozen in a horrified scream. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane sat up in the dark,
gasping. Sweat trailed down her body, and she didn't feel like going back to
sleep. She groggily twisted her head for the glow of the clock: 2:30 am. Great,
she'd been asleep for less than 2 hours. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane went down the
stairs in her nightgown. She wasn't surprised that someone was in the kitchen,
but she was surprised to find it was Alison. She paused as Alison looked up at
her and then continued in. She saw Alison, still dressed as she was earlier
tonight when they had been at Arcanum 17, had a bottle of peach brandy, and
decided that was what she was in the mood for, too. Maybe it would help her
sleep. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Mind if I join you?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Suit yourself," said
Alison non-<span class=SpellE>committally</span>. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane poured herself an
Ultra Cola and mixed some brandy in. The alcohol should counter the caffeine,
she told herself. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"You sound about the way
I feel," Jane said to Alison. "Thinking Wind isn't the one?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison looked at Jane
for a moment. She finally looked back down. "I don't know." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison looked so forlorn
and lost that Jane couldn't resist putting a hand on Alison's arm, saying,
"Hey, whatever happens, we're still friends, okay?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison kept looking
down. "I really don't know what love is. I don't think Wind does, either. I
thought I did, once, but I was deluding myself. Only the hate was real." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane bit her lip for a
moment. She had never seen Alison morose like this before. And Alison didn't
act particularly intoxicated. Affected, yes, but not intoxicated. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"<span class=GramE>This
have</span> something to do with that poem you read tonight?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison finally looked
up. <span class=GramE>"Yeah."</span> She kind of laughed. "I was instantly
inspired to write it after I saw Link's sketch of a skeleton digging its bony
finger's into that boy's ankles." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Link, yeah," said Jane.
"That boy has promise." Jane thought it was sad he would more likely be a game
designer unless his focus changed, rather than an artist. On the other hand,
game designers rarely starved. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane spoke up again.
"Link may have inspired you, but that was about someone that meant something to
you. It wasn't about us, was it?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison looked at Jane
and smiled a sad smile that had a touch of mockery to it. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I'll take that as a
no," said Jane. "So who was it about?" Jane had a hard time imagining Alison
giving herself over to love for anybody. She would be really surprised if
Alison married Wind, and then would be more surprised if the marriage lasted
longer than a year. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison stared down again
for so long that Jane figured this was a part of Alison she wasn't allowed near
yet. Then she took another drink and looked up, but still away from Jane.
"There never was any love in my family," said Alison matter-of-factly. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Yeah," said Jane
sympathetically, "my mom couldn't care if I stayed home or moved out or
anything." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison did look at Jane
with a bitter smile and shaking her head. "I think your mother loves you and
all her other kids," said Alison. "She may be self-absorbed and irresponsible
as hell, but she does manage to keep this place and let you all crash here." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane frowned, but
acknowledged it with a shrug of her shoulders. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"At the very least,"
said Alison. "She doesn't hate you." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Your mom hated you?"
Jane couldn't believe this. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Oh, yeah," said Alison.
<span class=GramE>"Very much.</span> Only I didn't know it until my last days
there." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane wondered a moment
if she wanted to hear this. For some reason, she thought of Mr. O'Neill
painting her on the canvas again and decided ANYTHING was better than that. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Tell me," Jane said
simply. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison poured herself
another cup of peach brandy and took a sip. Alison looked at Jane again,
tightening her lips in thoughts. Then she shrugged her shoulders. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I never got any
affection," began Alison. <span class=GramE>"Food, clothes, a roof over my
head.</span> These I could count on. But that was it." She shook her head
slightly. "Sometimes, I got a little, but it was <span class=GramE>fake</span>
and I knew it. It was for the benefit of <span class=GramE>whomever</span> was
watching, not for me. So I tried getting solace from my best friend. Her name
was Nancy and her life sucked like mine, even if she had all the material
benefits like I got. Comfort turned to affection, affection turned to sex, and
friendship blossomed into love." Alison looked to Jane. "But don't get the
wrong idea," she said to Jane, "It happened slowly over two years." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane poured a half cup
of peach brandy in what little brandy and Ultra Cola was left in her cup. <span
class=GramE>"So what happened?" <br>
<br>
"What happened?"</span> Alison repeated back. "Her mom and brother showed up
unexpectedly while we were in the throes of passion." Alison smiled bitterly.
"Her mom had forgotten some receipt or something. I don't really remember that
part to be sure. What was important was that she came home, and they both
caught us." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane's eyes widened. "I
take it her mom didn't take it well." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison smiled slightly,
with no joy. "You could say that," she said. "She slapped me over and over
until I finally got out of there. I had to finish dressing outside." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"<span class=SpellE>Wo</span>,"
said Jane. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Oh, that's not the
worst part," said Alison, "I heard her doing things to Nancy. I wanted to run
in there and help, but...." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"What?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I was afraid." Alison
looked ready to break over that. "I guess it wouldn't have made a difference
anyway. So I went home. And when I went in, I knew right away that Mom knew."
Alison took a deep breath. "Mom grabbed me by my hair and dragged me into the
living room. She slapped me several times, even used her fist a couple of times.
Luckily, she couldn't get enough leverage to hit me very hard." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Were you struggling?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Oh, you bet I was,"
said Alison. "I was terrified. And all the while, Mom was yelling at the top of
her lungs, demanding to know how I could have done this to her. I tried asking
what I had done to her, but couldn't get it out she was hitting me so hard.
Then she slammed my head against the wall and let go. I fell down. She jumped
on top of me, and she did go to fists, yelling how much she hated me and how
much shame I brought to her." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Fooling around is
shameful, but beating you up wasn't?" asked Jane incredulously. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison looked to Jane
with haunted eyes. "I was bleeding. She was shrieking this with passionate
intensity. I'd known the love was never real between us, but it wasn't until
this day that I realized how much she hated and loathed me." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane felt hurt for
Alison, and tried saying something. "She was upset...." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"No, Jane," said Alison.
"The affection was rare and perfunctory, but the hatred she was sharing with
utmost sincerity was real. Before all this, I was at least acceptable because I
was ribbons and lace and sweetness and light, a part of the perfect family. Or
I should say they fooled themselves into thinking I was. And maybe I fooled
myself into thinking this, too, from time to time." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane shook her head.
"I don't get why she was so upset." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison took another
drink. "Well my getting caught affected her, too. She couldn't gossip with her
own friends, because I was the subject of a lot of gossip. And so was she." She
shook her head. "I became stigmatized overnight by the adults and the other
kids both. Parents told their daughters to stay away from me. Nancy's brothers
bleated over it to everyone at school. And as a result, Mom was stigmatized,
too. So her lesbian whore of a daughter would pay." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"What did you dad do?"
asked Jane. "Surely, someone had....." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I had no one," said
Alison emphatically. "My dad beat the crap out of me even worse than my mom
did, and even threatened to have a guy 'straighten' me out. Cathy, my older
sister, treated me as a pariah. My two brothers never stopped mocking <span
class=GramE>me</span>." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"How old were you then?"
Jane asked. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"14," said Alison </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Shit," muttered Jane. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Oh, yeah, perfect
word," said Alison. "But then it gets better. I thought I could at least get
some peace at school, but then I learned it followed me there, too." she said
bitterly. "'Lesbian' was written on my locker the very next day. And it wasn't
just snubbing and gossip. There were fights, with slapping, punching, and
kicking. <span class=GramE>The non-stop harassment.</span> The locker room..."
Alison shook that off, whatever it was. "The faculty thought I was the problem,
and they openly talked about expelling me as a disruptive influence." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane was lost in what
she had never suspected about Alison. "What about Nancy?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Nancy?" asked Alison.
"Oh, Nancy wouldn't talk to me. Nancy blamed me for seducing her and she hated
my guts as intensely as Mom did. Nancy's mom tried pressing charges against me
for raping her daughter, and my own mother returned the favor." Alison looked
to Jane. "That's why I don't know if what we had was love. She threw it away so
quickly, and I couldn't believe it, because she was all I had left, and I
didn't even have her anymore." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Why would she do that?"
asked Jane. "She lost everything to. Why not stick together?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"She told me once that
she wanted to forget me," said Alison, "because look at what I and our love
brought us. We might not have been loved before, but we weren't hated, either.
And she just wanted the hate to stop. She thought she could make it stop if she
publicly hated me. But it didn't work. No one ever forgot." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison took another
drink and leaned forward. She was just starting to slur her words, Jane
realized. "So I thought I would win back my acceptance in my own way. I went
after guys. <span class=GramE>Aggressively.</span> I fooled around with a
bunch. See, I wasn't really a lesbian, I was bisexual. Really, I figured back
then that everyone was<span class=GramE>,</span> they just hid their
attractions to their own gender the same way they hid masturbating. So I
restricted myself to guys and tried to make a rep as a slut, figuring that
would be better than a lesbian." Her tone dipped. "But it changed nothing. <span
class=GramE>Other than to get treated like a slut, a whore, and a lesbian.</span>
I had boys and girls both come on to me, and then drop me. But at least they
gave me a little affection while it lasted. And I needed that, especially after
Nancy hung herself from a rope and managed to kill herself." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Damn," whispered Jane.
She was getting a little tipsy, too, but she drank some more anyway. She needed
it. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"A part of me died with
her." said Alison. "See, I had given up all hope when nothing changed in my
freshman year in high school." Alison laughed. "I even prayed to God for the
first and last time in my life for everything to change. Nothing did. It was
all over for me. I just didn't know it until my fifteenth birthday. It was
completely forgotten, nobody even wished me Happy Birthday. And then had it
confirmed when my sister's seventeenth birthday was remembered, and celebrated
by everyone but me. I had to stay home to listen for an important message Mom
was expecting." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison leaned back
again. "That was the end of my world," said Alison, "only it took me awhile to
figure it out. The suicide didn't stop the other kids and adults from torturing
me. And I had no real friends. People I could hang out with, yes, but not
anyone I was ever close to. Sometimes my crowd would gain some vicious revenge
on someone, but it never brought any satisfaction." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison looked at Jane
again. "I had always liked art, but being an artist just wasn't an acceptable
profession. And it was something others would laugh at. But now, I couldn't
imagine working with these people in the world around me. And it became my only
expression. It became my escape. I would get so enraptured with a leaf, or a
person, or a landscape, or whatever, and I would forget EVERYTHING, if only for
a while. Only my subject existed and my pain was forgotten." Alison suddenly
looked angry. "And then my bitch of a sister and her friends dumped a bunch of
my paints on my sheets. Mom was furious. <span class=GramE>At me, of course.</span>
So instead of going to bed that night, I just took my sketchbook and ran away
from home. I thought I could make money drawing portraits and caricatures." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane blinked. "It
didn't go so well, did it?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison deflated, shaking
her head. "I was very hungry, cold, sleep-deprived and scared. People could be
even more brutal than in school and at home. And people with money tried
ripping me off. Or try to get me in the car with them for a little sex." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Aren't there
shelters?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Sure there are.
They're supposed to turn minors in, though. If I didn't show an ID, they were
required by law to report me. Not all did, but they were at risk for not doing
so. Even those bastards at C-House...that's Covenant House...would visit the
more merciful shelters to make sure they abided by the law. I couldn't stand to
be sent back home so I usually avoided them." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"What about abuse
shelters?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Same thing,"
said Alison. "Oh, don't believe the hype of federal ninjas and zealous
social workers descending on parents who yell and spank. Maybe they do that
when they need to prove a need for funding, but it usually takes them MONTHS to
investigate abuse, and the investigation is shoddy. Sometimes they're even
turned away by a claim that the kid isn't living there anymore. And any abuse
shelter would have to turn me in or be charged with aiding in my corruption.
It's for my protection, you see," said Alison bitterly. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane shook her head,
remembering one of her mom's friends. "I think a lot of people feel that
these laws keep kids from running away in the first place, and are to protect
you from being exploited," she said. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison laughed bitterly.
"Yeah, the idiots feel, but don't THINK. What those laws do is put the
runaway at the mercy of such exploitation, exactly as it was willfully
intended. By denying me any sanctuary, I'll go home and stay away from the
pimps, but what if home is even worse than the streets? Hell, I couldn't even
go to the hospital without being reported. Even illegal aliens can go, Jane,
but I couldn't! Illegal aliens can go because the state wants healthy migrant
workers, but runaways and such can't go because the state wants us in brothels
so that they could pimp us by fining us. And we're the type to have parents the
least disturbed by such exploitive laws on the books. No matter if I was raped,
drugged, or beaten, I couldn't go! And since the laws are against me, I have no
choice but to have the pimps or the police, or be a fugitive hunted by both,
and that means it's either home or the very people the stupid laws are supposed
to be protecting me from!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Don't they go
after people like your 'rents?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Oh, no, haven't
you been listening? Hell, protecting perverts, Jane, is what those laws are
for. Did you know that even though I had no choice but to go home or be a
fugitive, if my Dad molested me and was convicted, I'd still be forced to live
with him after he got minimal counseling or be locked up for contempt of
court?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"<span
class=SpellE>Wo</span>," mumbled Jane, "that's fucked up." A
little louder she wondered aloud, "I wonder how many that's happened
to?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"It happened to
more than one of my lost sibs out there. One was even seized by two cops and
dragged to her father because it's the law! Gotta keep the family together! And
without her father's permission, she couldn't go to an abuse shelter! Her only
other <span class=GramE>options was</span> to endure or kill him, and you know
what's said about taking the law into your own hands, even when the law is your
greatest enemy! So FUCK the law!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Aren't abuse
shelters supposed to be places of sanctuary?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"For adults, not
for kids on their own. Unless Mom gave the shelter permission to keep me then
they had to turn me in, and she wouldn't do that. That would make her look bad
that her daughter was in an abuse or runaway shelter. So she'd take me and then
have me locked up in some teen gulag instead. Or if I was lucky, maybe a
boarding school." She shook her head and in a more quiet voice repeated,
"Fuck the law. <span class=GramE>Just like it fucked me."</span> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane, aware of a lot of
the dark side of society, was surprised at some of this, but didn't disbelieve
it. It actually explained a lot. "You were between a rock and a hard
place," she said. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison looked at Jane,
"But you know what? It was actually better than the hatred directed at me
personally. And then I met some other kids on the streets and I joined their <span
class=SpellE>krew</span>. I did that so I would have some protection from the
perverts, pimps, and everybody else. But for the first time in my miserable
life, I had a family. <span class=GramE>A screwed up family, yes, but still a
family.</span> I would still choose to live with them, my sibs, in an abandoned
building and with empty stomach than well-fed in the home I grew up in." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane had been drawn in,
and she took another drink. "How did you survive?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"We had all kinds of
tricks for that." Alison laughed a bit. "Not the kind you're thinking of,
though we did that sometimes, too. I avoided that myself, since I already felt
like a slut as it was. Even if turning tricks is more of a business deal than
anything lustful on our part." Alison took another drink, leaning back again.
"There were different groups. Some were into turning tricks. Others were into
B&amp;E, and traded what they stole for drugs, which we then sold, if we didn't
do them ourselves. Some panhandled. A few even sold plasma, after they were
coached on what to say and not to say to the clinics ripping us off for the
pharmaceutical companies." Alison grinned cynically at Jane. "So be careful of
the meds you get, if they have plasma in them." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Alison," said Jane,
"What did YOU do? I really want to know, and I'm not going to think you're a
bad person. I care about who you are now, not who you were then. But I need to
know." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison smiled a little,
and it looked like a real smile starting, though her eyes grew distant again.
"We'd rip off the pizza shops. We'd call in some orders for pizza. We had to
use different numbers to get a lot of orders, and the numbers couldn't be from
a payphone, 'cause they'd know. But when we pulled it off, or got someone else
to pull it off for us, we'd go behind whichever pizza place it was and wait.
Eventually, when no one picked up the pizzas, they'd throw some to all of them
in the dumpster out back, still in their box." Alison laughed just a little.
"We'd have to share with whatever bum claimed the dumpster as his property, but
there was usually enough. And he would often share his bottle, or even pot,
with us." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane could actually
imagine herself doing that one. "Go on," she said, finding this fascinating, as
well as being concerned for her friend. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"We'd hit stores, too,"
Alison continued, "for the five finger discount. Even with their cams, they
never caught us, and they never seemed to figure out what we were doing." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"What were you doing?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Oh, we'd slowly filter
in. Some of us would get in the deli, drinking coffee or something, but others
of us would be elsewhere. Then the guy we had set up for that would come in.
He'd usually be a minority, who'd play the part to justify a racist's view to
the hilt. But sometimes we used someone that was heavily decked out as someone
in the punk, metal, or <span class=GramE>goth</span> culture. The stupid people
would always follow them. With the cams, too, I guess. But when we saw him come
in, we'd get busy while the guy created a huge scene. We'd filter out while he
was yelling up a storm. Sometimes he'd go to jail, but he'd be let out in a few
hours. Usually, they were glad just to have him kicked off their property. And
we rotated such people around. And we tried not hitting the same stores too
often without break periods for fear that they'd finally catch on to what we
were doing to them." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Wow. And they
didn't learn?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison laughed cynically
and added, "The majority of people are really stupid, Jane, with a serious long
term memory problem. But there are limits to their stupidity. Even Mr. 'Paper
Plate Genocide' Dotson would eventually catch on, if we didn't pause and rotate
our <span class=SpellE>krew</span> members a bit." Alison smiled at Jane, but
with a little more self-depreciation now. "And of course I did what portraits
and caricatures I could. But a lot of times, the people paying me were just
scoping me out for sex. Still, it was very exciting to make money from my art.
It meant other people liked my art. It meant they liked me." Alison finished
her cup and let it stay empty. "I met my sugar daddy that way. His name was
Jim. He paid me to draw him. He was an art major himself from a well-to-do
family, and I loved it when he would go on and on about how talented I was. And
unlike most others, he wasn't even married or engaged or anything. He just
wanted to exchange the comforts of his home for sex." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Was it like he
adopted you?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison shook her head.
"Not really. Maybe it could've been, but I wouldn't let it. I went with him for
periods of time, but I always went back to the <span class=SpellE>krew</span>. <span
class=GramE>Because my <span class=SpellE>krew</span>, my family, loved me,
needed me.</span> He didn't." Alison frowned. "But that changed with the street
sweep." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Street sweep?" asked
Jane </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Where the police--the
top gang-- just went out busting and beating the shit out of everybody." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Did you ever turn them
in?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison laughed pretty
hard over that. "Unless you got all the money for a lawyer, ain't nobody who
cares, Jane. We had no place in society except as scapegoat. And they could
fine us from time to time, making their money off us like any pimp would. Pick
us up on a vice night and charge us all a hundred bucks. Instead of a 'charge'
they called it a 'debt to society' as if it didn't go in their own pockets, but
it was the same damn thing. I'm sure you know how they expected us to raise it.
Protecting kids? They're fucking pimps. THAT'S why the laws exist, Jane, not to
protect kids, but to protect their racket." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane whistled.
"Suddenly, anarchy doesn't just sound like fun, but maybe a good
idea." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison <span
class=GramE>sneered</span> a bit as she continued. "You don't know the half of
it. But every once in a while, like say an election or a gathering of
politicians, the police would get us all off the street to give the stupid
voters an illusion of crime being off their streets. That's a street sweep. And
the voters were so stupid, they couldn't even remember the previous month when
we were all out there." She looked at Jane intensely. "If you're ever in that
position, Jane, remember the police are NOT your friend. Some cops will even
turn you over to a pimp for a bounty, or will call a pimp and tell him when
you'll be getting out of jail." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane shuddered.
"Hope I'm never there," she said. She poured a little more brandy
into her cup and swallowed it all. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison got up and got
some water. "When I got pinched...that means busted...groped, and threatened by
the cops, I called Jim, saying he was my dad. They didn't believe it, but they
didn't care. As long as I was off the streets for the time being, then they
could definitely use the space I was taking up. But this was a serious street
sweep that shattered our <span class=SpellE>krew</span> for a while. I'm sure
many eventually hooked up with each other again, but not me. " </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"You stayed with
Jim?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison looked at Jane to
see how she was taking it. Jane <span class=GramE>was wanting</span> to know
more. She wasn't looking at her in a way that would make Alison clam up. So she
said, summing up now, "Jim got me off the street. He was moving after graduation,
and I moved with him. He helped foster my talent, gave me what I needed, and
even helped me get my GED and driver's license." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Why do I get the
feeling that something went wrong between you two?" asked Jane. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Because you're
psychic?" said Alison, with a small bit of cynical humor there. "As it turns
out, he needed 'someone younger.' Think about that Jane! I'm 17, and I'm too
old for him now! He was gonna trade me for a younger model, and I thought,
'What about when I'm 27?' He gave me three months. Luckily, I knew enough
people in the art community by then that I could..." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Live with whoever would
give you a place to stay?" asked Jane. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Yeah, pretty much.
Pretty fucked up, huh?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"The world is fucked up,
Alison, and it fucks us up. But you're not fucked up, okay?" When Alison still
looked down, away from Jane, she added, "And Jim was right about one thing. You
really are talented. He didn't have to make that up just to get into your
pants." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Thanks, Jane," said
Alison. "Art was my only real solace. I was pretty lonely after that, even with
the companionship." Alison looked to Jane again. "You were the first person I
really ever thought to open up to. When I saw you, on your own at that art
colony at an age I was on my own, I thought you might be like me. When I heard
you saying what I was thinking, I thought you had to be a lot like me. I mean
most people don't learn to see the stupidity for what it is unless they're
capable, and then only if they're put in a position to be forced to see <span
class=GramE>it</span>." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Alison..."
started Jane. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison put a hand on
Jane's arm, cutting her off. Jane didn't pull away. "I already told you that I
went off like a rocket, and that's true. For some reason, it never occurred to
me that you had a radically different background than I did. I thought you knew
how to pick up on the signals." Alison shrugged and pulled her arm back. "I
read you wrong. For that, I'm sorry. And I'm sorry for trying to get back at
you with Dotson." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Alison," Jane said,
with a little laughter in her voice, "I can forgive you, since I know Mr.
Dotson paid you back many times over than anything I thought you did to me." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Oh, he did, Jane, he
did." She took a drink of water. "He was one of the most infuriating, arrogant,
and condescending males I've ever met. And I felt like such a slut afterward." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"So how long did you
stay with Dotson?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"A few hours." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane laughed at that,
and Alison laughed a little herself in response. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"After you," said
Alison, "I shut myself off again, and focused on my art. I had a few lovers, of
course, but they weren't real. They were just companionship and a source to
fill my needs as best as possible until they tried crossing my boundaries. And
then I met Wind." Alison looked to Jane. "I don't know what it is about your family,
Jane. It's fucked up, yes, but there's something special here. I think under
the right circumstances I could get close to Trent, too." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"You know," said Jane,
"I tried telling you at the colony that maybe we could have a relationship
before the Dotson-thing happened. After I thought about it after I left you
that night, I thought that maybe I would like to see how it worked. <span
class=GramE>Slowly and all.</span> But then I kinda flipped out when I saw you
with Dotson." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison didn't respond to
that, except with a sympathetic humming noise that she had picked up from
Trent. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I was willing to give
it a shot with you. And I never was willing to do that with anyone else." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"What about that Tom-guy
that you liked?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Tom?" asked Jane. <span
class=GramE>"Oh, yeah.</span> <span class=GramE>Him.</span> I liked him and
all," said Jane, "but it was Daria who really hurt me. I mean in the way that
mattered." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"You like Daria, huh?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Yeah." Jane's eyes
widened. "I mean, no! I mean.... I don't know," Jane admitted. "The entire
treachery thing really confused me. And then you confused me. And when you
pulled that Dotson stunt, I felt as if I had been betrayed for a guy again, the
way Daria betrayed me for a guy." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"That was pretty low of
me, Jane," said Alison grudgingly. "I'm sorry I did that. I didn't stop to
think about what you were going through." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"You already said you
were sorry, Alison. You don't need to keep saying it. And I took as much time
to think about what your life was like as you did about mine." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Maybe we went about it
the wrong way?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Yeah, I think so." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"So this Tom-thing...
think I could help you forget all about him? Help you to forget about
everything?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane's eyes went wide.
"Uh, Alison ... just for the record, it would feel too weird if you and I did
anything while ..." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"While I'm going with
your brother, with the possibility of marriage?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Yeah." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison smiled. "And you
know what, Jane? I think I like Wind too much to break up with him. <span
class=GramE>At least for now.</span> And if I did, I would give it time before
I went with you, simply so he wouldn't feel hurt by the two of us. But if Wind
wasn't in the picture in any way, I'd be willing to start over with a little
more wisdom than we had before." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Yeah," Jane said
relieved. "Me, too." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"But we're real friends,
now, right?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Like sisters. Only I
actually like you." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>This time, they didn't
skip the hug.<o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody1><span style='font-size:10.5pt;
font-family:Verdana;letter-spacing:0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody1><span style='font-size:10.5pt;
font-family:Verdana;letter-spacing:0pt'>12. </span></span><span
style='font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Verdana'><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Link finished playing
around with Alias on his PS2. He'd definitely have to spend more time on this,
maybe even putting his play time on "Hunter: The Reckoning" on hold for the
time being. He preferred doing that when he had the house to himself. When his
step-dad was home, it didn't feel like his house. Even his mom made him
uncomfortable now. She obviously preferred his step-dad's company to his. He
was just in the way. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>But lately, his would-be
dad had been kinda cool. Not that he understood this change. He'd even been the
one to give him the Alias game just a little less than an hour ago, along with
a Sydney Bristow poster. He loved that show. He thought she was better looking
than any of the other gamer poster girls. She was also a much more interesting
character. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>In any case, he was
being much less of a jerk than usual. He'd almost completely stopped with his
never ending demands of what Link "should" be doing for his future or the
"family image," or things like having various items in a specific order on
various desks and tables, or things like peeking under the door when he was in
the bathroom. He had stopped all of that, or at least hadn't done any of it in
over a week. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Thanks for the game, Dad,"
said Link, and meant it, as he headed for the door. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Where are you going?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Out," said Link, a
little of his usual hostility creeping back into his voice. He hadn't liked his
step-dad's tone of voice. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Anywhere
in particular?"</span></span></span><span class=postbody1><span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'> The tone seemed a bit better. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"No," said Link,
softening his own tone. He wasn't about to tell him about Daria and Jane if he
could help it. He'd probably have one of his "episodes" over Alison and Trent.
He kept walking, but his step-dad caught him before he left. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Link," he said, "I
wanted to talk to you before I had to return to work. You know neither of us <span
class=GramE>get</span> to spend much time together. I'd like to fix that. I'd
hoped we could do that this Saturday morning." He actually smiled then. "You've
become special to me, someone with a lot of potential, and I want you to know
that." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Okay," said Link
somewhat subdued, somewhat suspicious. His step-dad had been trying ... he had
to give him some credit for that. Maybe he really was seeing him as something
other than an inconvenience that had come with his mom. But he felt uneasy the
way his step-dad smiled casually, but his eyes remained rigid. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>For some reason, he
wanted to talk in his home office. "How did you like the game I got?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Fine," said Link
grudgingly. "And all the others, too." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"The play station was
part of an understanding," his would-be dad said, "about not bothering your mom
with some of my hobbies." Link frowned. He didn't want to talk about that
anymore. "But the games were extras." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Did I say thanks?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>His step-dad snorted. <span
class=GramE>Then continued.</span> "I think you're old enough to know that
everything comes with a price." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Link was getting a very
bad feeling, but he couldn't put his finger on what was wrong here. But he had
a feeling he wasn't going to like it when he did. Instead, he said, "Prices are
up front, not demanded later." Link's tone of voice had gotten chilly. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Link, what did you do
when you found my stash?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Thought about how I
could blackmail you." Link didn't add about how he wondered if he could use it
to get rid of him. And that he would've if he'd known he could. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"But you not only found
my internet clubs, but also my magazines. You went to some work there." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Link shrugged. He'd
found the clubs easy enough by checking the backlogs. He hadn't actually been
able to get on, but he learned enough by what was shown before he had to give a
password. He'd then wondered if there was anything else. After a quick look
through his sock drawer which turned up nothing, he looked under the bottom
drawer, which had about an inch or two of room to a wooden bottom. Bingo. "Not
really," he said. "I was just lucky. And I knew to check backlogs." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Oh, yes," his step-dad
murmured. <span class=GramE>"Backlogs.</span> You are a clever boy." Somehow,
he sounded more annoyed than proud of him. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I'm surprised you
didn't hide it better than that. I thought you worked with computers." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I'm an executive over
sales," his step-dad said absently. "But, yes, I know how to use a computer. I
just didn't think anyone would check my backlogs." He stared at the boy a
moment, increasing his discomfort, and then asked again, "But what did you do
when you found it?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Thought about
blackmailing you." This time, he said that a little slower so his step-dad
might hear it this time. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"But what else did you
do?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Nothing." He had been
curious, of course, but the stuff was way too weird for him. Besides, a lot of
that just didn't seem real to him. It was just <span class=SpellE>glamor</span>
and glitter. He much preferred some of the girls he went to school with. Not
that he talked to them much. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Link," said his
step-dad sternly. "Don't lie to me. I can tell you've been going through some
changes. I was your age once. I know what you went through. It's okay. <span
class=GramE>Really.</span> Here, I want to show you something." He sounded as
if he thought Link would be pleased with his surprise. He opened his locked
file drawer and pulled out a sack. Turning he said, "I think you'll like this."
Link felt very nervous, but he took the sack. Inside was what he thought it
might be: more porn. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Um, thanks," said Link.
He put them back in the sack, and looked at the clock. They hadn't been in here
that long at all, Link noticed with some surprise. He felt tired, though, as if
he'd been in here awhile. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Take them out, Link,"
said his step-dad, "and look at them." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"No." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Link," said his
step-dad, finally showing unmistakable annoyance, "Do what you did when you
first found my stash." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Link was scared now. He
still wasn't sure exactly what was going on here, but he had a pretty good idea
of what was going down in some general sense. His mind raced furiously as his
breathing picked up and his entire body began to slightly tremble. Then his
step-dad pulled out a magazine, opened up to a page, and laid it across his
lap. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"What do you think,
Link?" asked his step-dad. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Um.... this is
different." He swallowed, thinking furiously. He was suddenly grateful for all
those camps he had been sent to that had developed his wits and imagination in
trying to survive the dysfunctional staffs and faculties that wanted to "help"
him. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Different?" asked his
step-dad. "You mean from what you saw in my stash? Yeah, it's a little less
sophisticated, but...." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"No," said Link
defiantly, "It's different from my stash." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>His step-dad blinked in
surprise, and then laughed loudly. "Okay, Link, what do YOU have?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Wait," said Link, "I'll
get it." He was making this up on the fly. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He got up a little too
quickly and walked out of the room, but his step-dad got up and followed him.
It seemed he just wanted to follow. Link gestured for him to come on, and then
continued to his room. As Link started to enter, he said, "<span class=GramE>It's</span>
right under here." Then he grabbed the door and slammed it shut. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>His step-dad banged
against it. Link locked it just in time. "LINK!" shouted his step-dad, furious.
"OPEN THIS DOOR, NOW!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Link wasted no time at
all. He went to his window, where he'd already taken the screws (that kept all
windows from being opened by burglars) weeks ago, and opened the window. The
banging at the door stopped, and Link hopped out. He took off running. He
quickly passed the first house next to his, and yet he felt as if he were
moving with intolerable slowness. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>His heart almost stopped
when he heard his step-dad outside yelling at him. <span class=GramE>"LINK!"</span>
He took off for a fence. He was in better shape than his step-dad, but his
step-dad had longer legs. He didn't want to find out how much difference that
might make. He ran for a backyard fence of the next house over. He resolved to
not obey his step-dad's command, even though part of him told him not to make
his step-dad any <span class=GramE>more angry</span> than he already was. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"LINK!</span></span></span><span
class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> Get over here, NOW!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Breathlessly, he leaped
at the fence and pulled himself up. His step-dad was only meters behind and
rapidly catching up way too fast. Link continued along the fence, but was
dismayed that a medium-sized dog was barking at him in one yard, trying to
reach up and grabbed him in its jaws. And almost right after, a pit bull tried
the same in the next yard, one with better reach. He had forgotten this little
detail. His mind was torn between his step-dad and the two dogs. He continued
to edge along the fence on hands and knees, but heard his step-dad climbing up,
too. He realized that his step-dad scared him more than the dogs. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>His step-dad yelled out,
somewhat pleading now, "For god's sake, Link, you're gonna get yourself killed!
Come on back and we'll pretend it never happened. Come on, Link, please!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Link pushed his glasses
back up, which had been slipping, and picked up his pace. He was halfway to the
next backyards. His step-dad crawled further along the fence after him. The
dogs ran back and forth between them. <span class=GramE>"LINK!</span> Come
back!" His step-dad almost sounded tearful. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Link made it to the next
fences as he heard his step-dad shriek in panic. He turned to look to see the
pit bull with his dad's pant legs in its jaws, and it was pulling him. His
step-dad was obviously going to be pulled off unless his pants ripped. Part of
Link gasped in reflexive concern, and a part of him cheered in jubilant hope of
a bloody end. He felt guilty for both of those sentiments. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>A man in the pit bull's
yard came out of the house, yelling incoherently. The pit bull finally let go,
but lunged again. His step-dad jerked back and fell into the yard with the
other dog. There was barking, snapping of jaws, and his step-dad screaming,
fighting to get out. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Now Link had a choice
between a yard with yapping small dogs, and another littered with toys and a
play center. He took the one with the toys and jumped, running for the gate. He
saw a shape looking out the back door at him as he went out the fence, but he
didn't stop. Anyone was likely to turn him over to his step-dad. So were the
police, unless his mom took his side, and he didn't dare trust her enough. He
was a hunted animal that didn't trust anyone. <span class=GramE>Except Daria.</span>
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Out on the street, he
ran, keeping an eye out for his step-dad or his car, while traveling off the
streets when he could. He was a fugitive. He could trust no one but a strange
high <span class=SpellE>schooler</span> with no legal power to help him, and
possibly no idea about how to help him at all. </span></span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>13. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Ms. Barch had finally
convinced her Skinny to come on over. She felt the challenge of another woman,
and was determined to secure her claim to O'Neill. At first she'd thought it
was that dead girl's mother. But she'd recently killed herself after her other
two kids <span class=SpellE>offed</span> themselves. Maybe her Skinny was just
upset over that. Or maybe there was someone else. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>And now that he was at
her place, Mr. O'Neill seemed distracted, but not in his usual way. His mind
seemed to be elsewhere. Yet at other times he seemed unusually focused, in a
way she'd never seen before. She'd felt creeped out for some reason whenever he
whistled as they'd walked together this morning. She couldn't help but worry.
Something weird was going on with him. She could feel it. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Janet?" asked
Mr. O'Neil, without turning around. He was gazing out the window as if looking
for something. "I sense you're distressed." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Again, he was <span
class=GramE>creeping</span> her out. "We've got to get you some help, Skinny,"
Ms. Barch replied. "That girl's death followed by her <span class=GramE>family's</span>
has really affected you." She glanced at him staring resolutely out the window.
He seemed to be tolerating her rather than listening to her, and that irritated
her. "You may be a man," she said with a touch of her usual venom, "but I don't
hold their deaths against you specifically. <span class=GramE>Just men in
general."</span> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She heard a smile in his
voice. "You think I'm a man?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Of course you are,
Skinny! <span class=GramE>A rare good one, at least until recently.</span> You're
not being poisoned by your own testosterone, are you?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I'm not even sure I'm
human anymore." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Ms. Barch's eyes
widened. He sounded perfectly serious. She might even have to use all her wiles
and charms to bring Skinny back from the Abyss. And that's where he was. She
knew it. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He spoke up again,
softly, but with a hint of cruel amusement that she found chilling. "Can't you
feel them out there, Janet? The <span class=SpellE>sigs</span> are amazing." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"<span class=SpellE>Sigs</span>?"
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Energy signatures." Mr.
O'Neill felt Janet's confusion. So he added, "Think of them like the scents a
bloodhound gets that calls him to hunt." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Timothy O'Neill, have
you been doing drugs?" Ms. Barch's question demanded an answer. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He turned and smiled at
her. Ms. Barch actually looked away from that grin, unable to fathom it, and
unable to stand up to it. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I have to go, Janet,"
said Mr. O'Neill distractedly. "Thank you for your hospitality." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Wait a minute!" Ms.
Barch was angry. "You're not going anywhere, Skinny! Not until.... until...."
She suddenly forgot what she was talking about. She was suddenly reliving so
many of her memories. She felt weak and tired and defeated and old. Her anger
almost pulled her out of it. <span class=GramE>Almost.</span> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I don't have to touch
anymore, Janet," her Skinny was saying casually as he walked towards her. "I
don't even need the blood now. It still helps. But it would raise too many
questions if there was more blood. The papers have been noticing the high rates
of murder and suicide lately. I'm sorry Janet." He learned down and let his
fingers touch Ms. Barch's head, his fingers in her hair. Some small part of him
did feel a sense of pity and loss as he continued to harvest Ms. Barch's soul,
but whether it was for Janet or <span class=GramE>himself</span>, he did not
know or care. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Skinny...." Ms. Barch
mewled pitifully. "Help...." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill shook his
head sadly. "I'm sorry, Janet. But I must go. In memory of our love, and for
the sake of haste, you will die almost painlessly." And so it was. <span
class=GramE>Almost painless.</span> And with her death, the last sense of pity
for the humans, and the last remnants of <span class=GramE>his own</span>
humanity, were gone. If there was a sense of loss he experienced, he was more
than compensated by an odd sense of liberation. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Janet Barch apparently
died suddenly of a brain aneurysm. Mr. O'Neill was awash in pleasant satisfaction,
both for increasing power and skill, and at the energy he took. He left. He
"scented" something good. He walked down the sidewalk, whistling casually,
allowing himself to be drawn to the energy signature that called to him. He
didn't realize that his walk had a more predatory tone to it now, one that
vaguely looked like the walk of Ms. Barch. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He ignored the dogs that
went wild within their yards as he passed them. He ignored the two cats that
arched their backs by the front door of a house, hissing and yowling. He had
better things to focus on. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>After a few minutes, he
even recognized it: Link. And so much sweeter than ever! He salivated, and he
stopped whistling. This was so pure, so sweet. He was going to gorge, and damn
the consequences. How could he ignore such a tempting treat? </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Just a
few minutes more, and he had him in his sights.</span></span></span><span
class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> He detected that Link was
very scared of being caught. <span class=GramE>Excellent.</span> He was heading
for Daria's. For a moment, he considered letting him make it. He'd take them
both. But, no.... that would raise too many questions. What he was about to do
was <span class=SpellE>wreckless</span> enough. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He reached out to Link
and SHOVED his will into Link's. Link screamed and fell to the ground. Mr.
O'Neill mentally commanded Link to crawl back into the alley he'd been hiding
in. He approached the now senseless delicacy. He sensed Link saw him as his own
father. No, step-dad. He didn't even have to try anymore with the psychic links
and the phantasms that evoked the horrors out of them. It just happened as he
willed it. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Even better, he no
longer felt pity. When he had been honing his powers by feeding on Lori's
family one by one, he had to convince and console himself that he was actually
doing them a favor. And then he was scared people would know. But no reporters
came. Two police officers asked him a few questions, but they didn't suspect
him at all. They were just doing their job, getting the paperwork filled out.
The interview didn't last more than a few minutes. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Janet was the last
victim he'd ever hold a slight regret or guilt for. He no longer needed to
rationalize his feedings. Now, not even children were safe from him. Only the
increasing awareness of his need to hide his activities and to become more
efficient and less deadly would keep anyone safe from him in the future. But
today, he was going to live dangerously. He was going to swallow Link's soul
here in broad daylight. He'd kill any witnesses, if he had to. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He was only a few meters
away, walking slowly toward the young, cowering lamb when another source
entered his awareness. A car was approaching too close. Would the car's
occupant (he sensed only one) notice? Could he fool their senses? But then he
blinked in surprise. It took him only a moment to recognize the <span
class=SpellE>sig</span> as Link's step-dad, even if he never met him before. He
was in a car alone. He was angry, injured, and terrified of what Link could
potentially do to him. <span class=GramE>Interesting.</span> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The step-dad parked the
car near a huddled Link. "Get up, Link." His voice rang with parental
authority, but Mr. O'Neill sensed his fear. It wasn't as tasty as Link's, but
it was much easier to access. "Get up!" he said again, moving to claim Mr.
O'Neill's lawful prey for himself. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>No. With an act of will,
Link's step-dad was suddenly Mr. O'Neill's thrall. The images! Not even the
prostitute O'Neill put into a coma had anything to compare to what this man had
done, and had been done to him! Interesting, he felt this one's potential to
become like himself. For a moment, O'Neill totally forgot Link. The boy could
wait his turn. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill toyed with
the man's thoughts and will as he finished closing the distance. Then he cut
the whimpering, older lamb, licked the blood, and then handed him the
prostitute's switchblade. End it, he willed toward the helpless lamb before
him. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The step-dad did. He
wrote "I'm sorry" with his own blood on the wall of the alley, and lay down to
bleed to death with no comfort to be had. Mr. O'Neill gasped, savoring every
sin, every drop of vitality, the loneliness that was giving way to a terrifying
oblivion in his victim, infusing himself with such power that he felt he was
reaching a transubstantiation. But the lamb died just before O'Neill reached
that point. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He looked around,
comically disappointed. Link was gone. </span></span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>14. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Link ran. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He had NO idea what that
was about. But he knew without a doubt that Mr. O'Neill, aka "Uncle Timothy,"
was some kind of monster. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He had felt something
that terrified him so bad, he couldn't move. And he had seen his step-dad
coming for him. Mom was behind him, accusing Link with her eyes of destroying
her happiness, looking for a reason to cast him away. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>And then he not only
relived finding his cat killed after his real dad had run over him (probably by
accident, but he wasn't sure), he felt as if he had been run over himself,
which was about how he'd felt when he saw Tabby dead. His real dad hadn't
thought he'd done anything too bad; Link needed to "be a man" and "toughen up."
Losing his friend Tabby would help build character. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Other specters were
rising to taunt him and drag him straight to Hell. <i>That's right</i>, said a
voice that vaguely reminded him of the OK <span class=GramE>To</span> Cry
Corral, only the voice made him think of The Devil. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>And then he found
himself in the opening of an alley. It was like he suddenly remembered where he
really was. He knew Mr. O'Neill was near, but he didn't know how he knew. Then
he saw his step-dad was down on his knees crying. This was bad and confusing
enough. But not terrifying until he looked up at the approaching inhuman eyes of
"Uncle Timothy." <i>The eyes of the Devil</i>. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He fled. He no longer
cared about hiding, or even dignity. Only escape. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>A few minutes later, he
was at the Morgendorffer home. He straightened himself up as best he could, as
fast as he could. He rang the bell and knocked. He forced himself to calm down,
but couldn't fully stop his rapid breath or hammering heart. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>A long minute later,
Helen <span class=SpellE>Morgendorrffer</span> answered the door. She wore a
green shirt and shoes with a casual pair of slacks that he hadn't seen her wear
before. For the first time she seemed relaxed. "Hi, Link!" said Helen
cheerfully, but then her faced grew concerned. "Are you all right?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I'm fine," said Link.
"Is Daria home?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I'm sorry," said Helen,
sounding sincere, "she left to meet Jane at Pizza King for lunch a little less
than an hour ago." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Thanks," said Link, and
he took off running. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><i><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>What a strange boy,</span></i></span><span
class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> thought Helen. She was sure
something was wrong with him. She suddenly wanted to help him for some reason,
or at least give him a ride, but if he said everything was fine ... Shaking her
head, she went back to her briefcase and pulled out the packet she'd been
working on, while Jake read a paper. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Who was it, Helen?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Oh, that boy Daria met
at Mr. O'Neill's camp." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>A few minutes later,
there was another knock. Helen sighed. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Don't worry about it,"
said Jake, "I'll get it!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Thank you." She was in
the middle of reading a briefing and she just caught something significant that
she knew could help her in one of her cases. She quickly forgot about the door.
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jake answered it to see
Mr. O'Neill. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Hey!" said Jake all
friendly, "From Lawndale High, right? What can I do you for?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"You can tell me where
Daria and Link are." Mr. O'Neill phrased that as a command, vaguely sounding
like Ms. Barch. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jake didn't notice. He
put his finger to his mouth as he tried to remember. "Damn, I don't remember!"
Turning, he yelled, "Honey, where did Daria and Quinn go?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The O'Neill creature
sighed. Was he once that bad himself? He walked in past Jake. Helen was coming
up a little annoyed, but smoothed her face for a moment when she saw Mr.
O'Neill. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Hi!" said Helen. "I'm
so sorry about that horrible incident with the new girl and her family! You
must be so hurt! What can I do for you?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Tell me where Daria and
Link are now." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Helen blinked. Something
was not right here. But she was having <span class=GramE>a hard</span> time
thinking. Her voice was low and distracted as she said, "Daria went to meet
Jane at Pizza King about an hour ago. Link just left to meet them. I think." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"When do you think
they'll be back?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I don't know. Daria
usually goes to Jane's house after pizza." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Thank you," said Mr.
O'Neill. "I was never here. Stop daydreaming." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Say what?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill was gone. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jake suddenly found
himself getting a drink and remembering the abuse he took from his old man,
while Helen wondered if she was a good enough wife and mother, spending so much
time away from her family. For some reason, she was glad Quinn was off with
that Fashion Club of hers right now. But she suddenly worried about Daria. She
hoped she was okay. She would have to do something special for Daria when she
came back. It wouldn't be long before Daria would be out of the house
completely. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jake refilled his glass
and swallowed it, mumbling angrily to his dead old man who was still imprinted
traumatically on his nervous system. Helen glanced worriedly over at him. She
felt as if she had forgotten something important. Never mind. She would look at
her planner soon and refresh her memory. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She hoped Daria and that
boy she met at camp were okay.<o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody1><span style='font-size:10.5pt;
font-family:Verdana;letter-spacing:0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:3.75in'><span class=postbody1><span
style='font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Verdana;letter-spacing:0pt'>15. </span></span><span
style='font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Verdana'><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The Creature known as
Mr. O'Neill decided against going to Pizza King. There'd be too many witnesses
there. And his prey might not be there anymore. But he knew Link would almost
certainly leave with Daria and Jane. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>So he started walking to
the Lane's home. He vaguely recalled it. He had driven Wind home more than once
after he had been so thoroughly humiliated at school that he was unable to ride
the bus without crying. He smiled now remembering. Wind had been very sweet,
and he didn't mean that as in nice. He wondered if he'd be lucky enough to find
Wind, too. No way, he decided, as he kept walking in the direction he knew
"Casa Lane" to be, he was powerful, but even he couldn't arrange that. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill suddenly
tensed in fear when he heard muffled laughter. He turned and saw a black van.
Out the shotgun window, he saw a strange woman taking pictures of him with what
looked like a <span class=SpellE>digicam</span>. She had a fit of the giggles,
and yet he vaguely sensed fear from her. Perhaps even fear of him. She turned
away from him and the van raced off. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He didn't know what that
was about. He did know that what he hadn't known on the first night he'd gone
trolling for human sheep had come close to hurting him, maybe even killing him.
He'd best be careful. What also startled him was that until he heard the
woman's laugh, he'd barely registered their being there! It made him very, very
nervous. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Maybe he should forget
about discretion, and simply kill a whole bunch of people. He wanted to be
strong enough to survive whatever was about to happen to him now. He noticed
the van passed him once more. Now that he was feeling for it, he found he could
detect them when they came very close. But other than to detect no psychic sinkhole
around them as he had around the other Predator, he couldn't get anything more
out of them, or what they wanted! </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>They weren't cops or
detectives, because he recognized such people when he encountered them as
lawful prey. Perhaps a bit more aware, but many of them had even more
weaknesses to exploit than most other adults. Some cops chose their career
because they were bullies, and bullies were full of fears. That didn't fit the
feel of the van and its occupants. He didn't know what the van was about,
except that it was almost certainly dangerous to him. He picked up his pace for
Casa Lane. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>He made it the rest of
the way to Casa Lane without the van returning. He knocked while his luck held.
To his delighted surprise, Wind Lane answered the door, and he was still
delicious! Not as vulnerable as in his school days, but he had picked up a
stronger fear of abandonment and codependency that more than made up for it. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Wind blinked at him. Mr.
O'Neill smiled warmly back. "Hi, Wind!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Wind's eyes cleared.
"Mr. O'Neill? Hi. What are you doing here?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill assumed a
concerned expression. "I need to speak with Jane and Link. They should be here
soon, if they're not already. May I come in?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>A little meddling with
Wind's mind, and he was walking in. Scanning, he detected a woman in an
upstairs bathroom cleaning <span class=GramE>herself</span> off and thinking
hard about some things, and a sleeping person upstairs, probably in his or her
bedroom. Interestingly enough, Wind's proximity was making it difficult to know
more of the two <span class=SpellE>piggies</span> upstairs. So Mr. O'Neill
looked into Wind's soul, and got a name: Trent. Yeah, he remembered Trent. He
also got that the other was an artistic type named Alison. But best to be sure
that was all. "Is your mom or dad home?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"No," said Wind, and
disappointment wafted off of him. "Mom just left for a gathering <span
class=GramE>who</span> are going to do something about filling the Evans
vacuum. She won't be back until Monday, at least. Dad's still overseas." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill didn't
really know what he was talking about, but decided it was unimportant. What WAS
important is that there were three people here. <span class=GramE>And soon to
be three more.</span> And he was going to gorge on them all, and hopefully
reach whatever transubstantiation he felt trying to happen within himself and
then track down the van filled with sheep that seemed to know a little of what
he was, but didn't show the proper respect of prey for those higher on the food
chain. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill frowned
suddenly. Something barely touched his consciousness, but he didn't know what.
Acting on an impulse, he carefully glanced through a curtain to a window facing
the street. A moment later, the van passed again. <span class=GramE>Slowly.</span>
It was looking for him, as if <i>he</i> were the prey. Hard as he tried, he was
unable to glean anything about its occupants, other than a vague sense they
knew what he was and they were trying to find him. Though he didn't fear mere
humans, he was still glad when it kept going. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then Mr. O'Neill
screamed. Spitting and hissing, two cats were attacking him! He struggled to kick
at them and fight them off, but they were too fast and too determined. He
would've run except the van was out there. He had to defeat them. But as both
cats hissed on each side of him, murderous intent radiating off of them, he
rediscovered the human emotion of fear. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=GramE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Wind!</span></span></span><span
class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> <span class=GramE>Help!"</span>
Mr. O'Neill actually followed that with a short, sharp crying sound that he'd
thought he would never make again. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Wind opened the front
door. He tried scooping them up, but one clawed him as well, and neither
allowed Wind to catch them, or even distract them from O'Neill. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill, bleeding
badly on his arms and shins, along with minor punctures on his abdomen, ran out
the door instead. The cats followed. Wind came out with a vase and threw water
at them. They both jumped aside, but continued yowling. Mr. O'Neill leaped back
inside, pushing Wind back in the process, and slammed the door shut with
preternatural speed. He stood with his back to the door, gasping for air. Eyes
open in genuine <span class=GramE>fear,</span> he asked breathlessly, "Do you
have any more cats? Or dogs?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"No," said Wind, trying
to calm him. "At least, I don't think so." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill sensed the
woman upstairs heard something and was drying herself off so she could dress
and come out. The sleeping form upstairs continued to sleep. He glanced out the
window and didn't see a van. Then turning toward Wind, he approached him with
deadly purpose. Wind had a bad feeling, but he ignored it. Well, it wasn't like
it would've done him any good anyway, Mr. O'Neill thought. "I remember how you
use to cry, Wind, and I would have to drive you home. Don't you?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>And suddenly, Wind
remembered all of it and more so clearly as if it had all just happened moments
ago. <span class=GramE>Every single time.</span> His face scrunched up, and
tears begin to fall from his face. The vase dropped from his suddenly limp
fingers and rolled towards O'Neill and stopped. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>No protection. <span
class=GramE>Kids as predators.</span> His mom and dad always leaving him alone,
feeling abandoned and at the mercy of the big bad world which, like the big bad
wolf, was hell bent on devouring him. Wind then became a toddler, sobbing his
heart out, while Amanda painted his portrait (not that he understood what was
happening at the time). At the same time, he was a few years older and his dad
sternly told him not to touch his cameras or the pictures he took. He wouldn't
even let Wind touch it after he ruined his dad's film once. He'd been locked
away from that part of his dad. His dad loved his cameras more than he loved
Wind. He'd heard Vincent wasn't his real father from an aunt, and he wondered
if it was true. A toddler and child crying became an adult clinging, the women
who would leave him as his mom and dad left him, the need for security, for
being loved and taken care of, protected from the horrible world out there. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill gasped in
ecstasy, reaching further into his soul, learning all the mistakes, all the
vices, all the shattered dreams, and all the fears of his latest bride-to-be
leaving him, even before they got to the altar. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill lost himself
in the feeding, amplifying Wind's pain and extreme anxieties. He barely
registered that Wind was on the floor sobbing, that he was crawling on top of
him, seeking the blood connection to sweeten it, gain every drop. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then pain and confusion
brought him back. The vase Wind dropped had shattered over his head. He turned
to see a black-clad steely-eyed woman with tribal tats and a vague Oriental or
Native American cast to her features. Alison. She was ready to tear him a part.
But he saw something the woman didn't show him mundanely: fear. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Remembering his mistake
with Link, Mr. O'Neill decided to hurry and finish Wind off. He looked back at
Wind and prepared himself to suck up what was left, even if he missed a lot
that way. Wind whimpered as he began. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The woman kicked him in
the face, practically in the eye. Her fury was rising, but so was her fear. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill snarled. He
shoved out at her with his will, even as he got up. Alison suddenly cried out
in surprised pain. He charged her, knocking her down, and punched her in the
mouth. He actually felt her lips cut by her teeth, and her pain registered to
him as pleasure. He leaned down a moment later and licked what blood he saw off
her chin. </span></span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison was suddenly 14
in his grip. And she was being slapped by her mother who hated her. It was
diluted somehow, and this frustrated O'Neill. She fought him, but had no idea
what she was fighting. She shrieked in mindless rage at him, struggling to free
herself or to hurt him. She struggled with every ounce of will, and felt
herself breaking from the onslaught. She felt his surprise at her resistance,
and that strengthened her resolve, but it was still wearing away. Alison knew
she couldn't keep fighting. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Get off her! Get off
her!" Wind had a clumsy arm lock around Mr. O'Neill's neck. Alison couldn't
speak, but tried using pure will to project at him to claw at Mr. O'Neill's
eyes. Then she felt the man on her in her head, promising to pluck out her eyes
and keep them for a souvenir. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill finally
reached up with one hand and pulled one of Wind's fingers, twisting it
painfully. For the moment, O'Neill was torn between the two of them. And then
Alison punched him in the throat. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill slung Wind
back impossibly hard. Alison heard Wind shout, "GET OFF HER MOTHERFUCKER!!!"
And then she was being slapped by her mother while other girls celebrated her
pain in the locker room. She'd forgotten Wind existed, as she hadn't heard of
him yet. She felt she needed to remember something, it was very important, but
the pain in her head was too much. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison "woke up" to find
Trent holding a thick stick, the kind used to make sure glass doors can't be
opened by someone outside. It was practically a club. Mr. O'Neill rolled off of
Alison, came to his feet, brutally slapped a charging Wind aside, and lunged at
Trent. Trent swung the stick again, but Mr. O'Neill was too fast. Trent fell
backwards, dropping the stick. Mr. O'Neill punched Trent and knocked him
senseless. And then Trent felt his old teacher reach inside him somehow and
grab him at his fears of being left alone and adrift, a failure that would live
by begging on the streets with no instrument to lose himself in. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>And then it was gone.
Alison had clubbed Mr. O'Neill to the head. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison suddenly felt
weakness spreading through her. Screaming, she brought the club down again. <span
class=GramE>And again.</span> <span class=GramE>And again.</span> <span
class=GramE>And again.</span> Finally, Mr. O'Neill fell over, limp, the last
traces of his foul, violating presence within her fading. Alison hit him again.
She raised the stick, now <span class=GramE>bloody,</span> to strike him again
but Trent grabbed it. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"He's out," said Trent.
He coughed. "Thanks." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison was fighting
hysteria. "What the fuck is he!? What did he do to us!?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Trent shrugged. "He used
to be my teacher. But he's changed somehow. Now he's Janey's and Daria's
teacher." Trent frowned. He couldn't allow this. He hoped Mr. O'Neill was dead
already. It looked it. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The front door opened.
Daria, Jane, and Link came in, stopped, eyes wide open. They saw Wind bleeding
and sobbing, Trent and Alison bleeding from the mouth, Alison holding a bloody
club, and Mr. O'Neill beaten to a bloody pulp at the floor between all three. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane spoke first. "Did
we come at a bad time?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>16. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill, still
unconscious, had a feed sack wrapped around his head, and ropes binding his
hands and feet. He was being carried by Trent and Wind into the back of the
Tank. Two cats hissed and spit, running alongside O'Neill, but they did not
attack. Everyone guessed he was in some sort of coma, but they wanted him far,
far away. So far, they had not planned beyond that, though they all knew they
would have to soon. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>And none of them
harbored any hope that they'd be believed by the authorities. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>They all got in the
Tank. Alison drove, with Daria riding shotgun. If Alison was obviously being
"tampered with," Daria was to grab the wheel. The rest guarded Mr. O'Neill.
Trent still had the stick. Jane had a poker. Wind had a skillet. Link had a
butcher knife. Unknown to everyone but Jane, Trent had a .38 <span
class=SpellE>snubnose</span> in a belt pouch inside his pants. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Despite the helplessness
of their foe, and the readiness of the impromptu team, they were all terrified.
Getting caught by the police like this was a minor fear compared to what they
would do if Mr. O'Neill woke up before they could do whatever they had to do to
him. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria and Jane both
weren't fully convinced. But they knew Link was convinced of it. They had
assumed that the shock of being attacked by his step-father had incurred a
psychotic episode. But even then, they were creeped out by what Link said about
Mr. O'Neill after the way he'd been this week. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then when they made it
to Casa Lane to decide what to do about Link, they saw something they never
even thought they might see: a hurt Trent, Wind, and Alison surrounding a beaten-to-a-pulp
Mr. O'Neill. Daria and Jane saw the terror in their eyes and believed. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>But now that they had
time to adjust to the situation, they were questioning how much truth there was
to this. Was this mass hysteria? Was it real? Neither of them <span
class=GramE>were</span> sure, and they were going along for the moment to see
how this unfolded. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The old feed sack had
been put over his head to help keep blood out of the Tank, and also because
they knew Mr. O'Neill seemed to need eye contact to do whatever it is he did.
What they didn't count on was that it also hid the regeneration going on for
Mr. O'Neill, a healing that was rapidly bringing him to consciousness. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>What they also didn't
count on was that Mr. O'Neill still had some of Alison's blood on his tongue.
Alison was feeling more and more tired, but she thought it was the adrenaline
burning out, and the stress of the situation. The O'Neill creature knew he had
to play this carefully, because one chance was likely all he was going to get. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The van started to
swerve. The last thing they needed was to be pulled over. Daria turned with
concern toward Alison and called her name. "Alison?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison looked back at
Daria, smiled slightly, and brought herself back. Then she fainted onto the
wheel. Daria shrieked and grabbed the steering wheel, but the Tank swerved off
the street and into a lamp post. Daria and Alison were both wearing seat belts,
but the other occupants crashed toward the front, momentarily stunned. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>With the Tank still
idling, Alison slightly senseless and with images placed in her by the bound
creature, she unbuckled her belt and she would..... </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She would save Nancy! </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Nancy was hanging from a
rope and Alison would untie the rope that was strangling her. That she was
unbinding Mr. O'Neill as Daria yelled at her to stop and the others were trying
to shake the sudden confusion and sluggishness from their head did not register
in the least. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Link was the first to
lean toward Mr. O'Neill. But he was thrown back by Alison who shouted, "Leave
her alone!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria was unbuckled and
coming back while Mr. O'Neill struggled to get the feed sack off of his head.
He managed to get it off just as Daria picked up the poker and hit him on the
head. Mr. O'Neill gave a startled cry and rolled to the rear door as Alison
seized Daria's arms, shrieking in despair. Mr. O'Neill had the doors open as
Wind hit Mr. O'Neill in the head with the skillet. Alison suddenly stopped
struggling with Daria and Mr. O'Neill fell out of the van. He quickly undid the
poorly done knot around his ankles. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The others stared at Mr.
O'Neill, not daring to jump out with their weapons. Maybe they should try
escape. Mr. O'Neill took off running with a slight limp, and they were all
tempted to let him go, despite fears that he would surely come hunting them all
down later. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Then Wind dropped the
skillet and leaped out. Alison leaped out after him. Jane followed, quickly
passing them both heading for Mr. O'Neill. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Get the Tank, Trent,"
said Daria. Trent got in the front seat and pulled the Tank out, and he counted
the slight damage to the Tank and light post a small blessing. He turned the
Tank around and sped after their three friends. They quickly caught up. Wind
and Alison were helping Jane up and the Tank stopped by them. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Get in," said Trent. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Deciding they couldn't
catch him, they desolately got back in. They drove on, and saw Mr. O'Neill up
ahead suddenly drop down, holding his ears. He shook and shuddered. He turned
to several little girls shrieking with laughter, on and around the merry-go-round
and shrieked something at them, and then ran across the street away from them. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>All the occupants of the
Tank could see besides the laughing girls was a woman was staring after Mr.
O'Neill frowning and obviously wondering if she should call the police. But as
Mr. O'Neill continued to head away, she seemed to abandon the idea. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>And then a black van in
much better shape than the Tank passed them. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Trent backed the Tank up
slightly and turned down another road. They cut off Mr. O'Neill on the next
block <span class=GramE>who</span> was running in their direction. He stopped
as several got out of the Tank, and Trent dug out his .38. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Mr. O'Neill turned,
snarling. Alison instantly fell to her hands and knees, and the others felt a
wave of nausea creep over them. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>And then the black van
that passed them just a minute ago, pulled around the Tank and stopped. A woman
got out of the shotgun side and came at Mr. O'Neill, shooting him with a Taser.
Three men who did not look as if they belonged together got out and two grabbed
Mr. O'Neill and another grabbed Alison and dragged them in. <span class=GramE>Neither
Alison or</span> Mr. O'Neill offered any obvious resistance. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The van sped out of
there. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The others ran back to
the Tank. Wind shrieked, "Go after them, Trent!" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Trent did. The black van
didn't seem concerned as it drove steadily out of Lawndale, it didn't speed,
didn't try any fancy turns. They didn't know what to think of this new
development. The strangers seemed to be against Mr. O'Neill, but they had
abducted Alison, too. And they'd seen how they moved. These people knew what
they were doing, but no one in the Tank sensed anything of "law enforcement"
around them at all. And Trent had the feeling they might need more than his .38
if this <span class=GramE>were</span> to get any more violent. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Wind sobbed once,
certain he would never see Alison again. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>17. </span></span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The black van pulled
over on the side of the road in an isolated wooded area. Trent pulled up behind
them and readied his .38. He nodded to Wind, who went out the back and walked
toward the van. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>A large, ebony-skinned
man with long dreadlocks and dark blue tribal marks tattooed on what showed of
his arms and neck and a medium-sized woman with a basic cut of shoulder-length
brown hair, both looking a little older than Wind, came out to meet him. They
moved like martial artists, maybe even <span class=GramE>commandos</span>
incognito. They appeared unarmed, but no one believed it. And they knew there
were others in the van. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Trent, Daria, Jane, and
Link watched as the two led Wind up to the back of the van and opened the door.
There were three more men and another woman, all holding stun guns around a
bound Mr. O'Neill. Alison was sitting up with a breathing mask hooked to a tank
of some kind over her nose and mouth, and she seemed to be laughing. Wind
rushed in and hugged Alison. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Trent got out, fearing
they were about to abduct Wind, but kept the .38 pointed to the ground.
Everyone else got out, too, and walked behind Trent with a mixture of fear and
curiosity, tainted by real hostility. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The medium-sized woman
said, "Hi. Name's <span class=GramE>Becky,</span> or that will do. Since you're
almost certainly as confused as we all were when we first found out about the
Stalkers, I'll get right to the point." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Someone took the mask
off of Alison, and she came out giggling. They all raised their brows when they
noticed she was wearing a necklace that held a piece of metal. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"The Stalker seems to
have bonded with Alison. He probably has some of her blood on his tongue. As
you can see, we gave her one of our amulets. It's a piece of cold iron. We use
them in killing Stalkers. And when people wear them, or surround themselves
with a quantity of them, it makes it much harder for a Stalker to form any
empathic links with humans, let alone to feed off of them." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison was crying a
little now, her head buried in Wind's chest. Jane went up and put a hand of
support on her arm, and Alison reached and touched Jane's hand for a moment. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"We gave her nitrous
oxide, or laughing gas, to purge the Stalker's link. Laughter can be painful to
them. Indeed, one of our main training exercises for Hunters like us is to
learn how to joke and laugh about anything, and mean it. Laughter to them is
like rubbing alcohol on a tick. The gas here helps. Between those two things,
and our healer, it was enough to sever the link between this Stalker and Alison."
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>While all the others
were struggling to process this, Link spoke <span class=GramE>up,</span> simply
accepting what he heard was true, given his own experience. "What is he?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"If you want, I'll tell
you. But first, we're gonna stake him. It's not pretty, so you may not want to
see it." She glanced up and down the roads a moment before sticking a hand
toward the woods. The four got out carrying Mr. O'Neill. The woman, also
ebony-skinned, stayed while the big guy took her place. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria's eyes opened.
"Are you sure about this?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Yes," said Becky. "It
has to be done. There is no way to reverse the changes once they begin, and
they tend to regenerate. About the only thing that seems to work is a stake of
cold iron pinning them to the ground. It grounds their energy and prevents them
from drawing on any other energy. Essentially, they become human again. Then we
usually blow their head off." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria swallowed hard.
"But.... he's been around for years. Are you sure you have the right person?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Becky looked toward the
ebony-skinned woman, who spoke up with a slight, untraceable accent, "Quite
sure." She ran her gaze over all of them, and they all felt something as her
eyes touched them. "You can call me <span class=SpellE>Sanda</span>. I was a
healer before I became a Hunter. And I can feel them. They're like vortexes
that suck everything around them. And I can feel when someone has been drained.
Like all of you, though you two," she pointed at Daria and Jane, "haven't been
touched by him much recently. The rest of you are lucky to be on your feet." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She walked up and put a
hand on Alison. "I sensed his blood bond to Alison. He would've sucked her dry
to save himself if we didn't break the link. That's why I told my team to grab
her." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She looked at them all
again, and nodded to Link. "One of us heard your friend there at Pizza King and
knew we had '<span class=SpellE>em</span>. It confirmed our suspicion that your
teacher was our Stalker. We'd just narrowed in on him and were about to take
him out anyway. You see, we were sent after your murder and suicide rate
skyrocketed. That's an indication that another Stalker has become active. Most
of them never activate, but a few do. And those few do a lot of harm. Some are
even police officers, prison guards, doctors, politicians, clergymen. And, of
course, serial killers." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Why not try to
expose them?" asked Daria. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She paused a bit,
licking her lips. "We can't. <span class=GramE>Because if they became common
knowledge, it would increase the fear of them, which would actually make them
stronger.</span> In the past, the Stalkers have always manipulated such
hysteria to go after innocents, from which they fed. Just about every such
witch hunt or inquisition in the past was orchestrated by a Stalker." She shook
her head. "Even worse, a few that learn of them try to BECOME <span
class=GramE>one themselves</span>." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>A car passed them by and
kept going. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"There are other
variants," she continued after the car was out of view. "Some are
what we call the <span class=SpellE>Sybaritics</span>. They drain through
eroticism and sex. They're usually more benign, but can still destroy a life. A
few of them have even been known to kill that way, much like a Stalker. We
sometimes hunt them, too, but they're low priority." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She frowned. "You should
watch out for the <span class=SpellE>Lhiannan-Shee</span>," she warned. "They
seem to drain creative people, ultimately stealing their artistic talents and
their will to live. Luckily, they're rare. Perhaps thanks to so much dry, stale
schooling and TV that crushes so much inspiration, turning artists into pale
imitators of what they get shoved in their head." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison turned away from
Wind, but let him put an arm around her. "What are you?" she asked. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"A Healer," she
repeated. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"But what does that
mean?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She sighed. "I'm sorta
the opposite of a Stalker. We need positive feelings to thrive; the ugly ones
the Stalkers like are too discordant for us. We sicken if we're around the
negative too much, and yet we're driven to confront it and drive it off. <span
class=GramE>To heal."</span> Her voice became a bit distant. "Before I knew
about the Stalkers, I healed people in my New Orleans neighborhood. I even did
it for free, if they didn't have money." She gave a distant smile as she added.
"I always knew when they were telling the truth about that." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She cleared her throat.
"Then a Stalker started preying in my neighborhood. I sensed it, and it sensed
me. It fought to kill me. If it wasn't for Jamal, my husband, he would've
killed me. They can't kill my kind the way they can others. But we can die of
all the things others can. And while we can heal much better than the average
person, we don't continuously suck off the life force of everyone around us,
and that means regeneration is almost impossible for us." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>They heard a gun shot. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"It's done," she
murmured. "In a few minutes, they'll be bringing the body back in a bag." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Uh, then I think we'll
be leaving," said a shaking Jane. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"You've been hurt," she
replied. "All of you. I would like to meet with you and help." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"No thanks," said Jane. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alison spoke up. "I
think you should. I felt her. It was very soothing, and all the despair and
lethargy went away." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I don't think we should
be seen around that van," said Daria. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Sanda</span></span></span><span
class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> sighed a bit, but smiled. <span
class=GramE>"How about if I come with you?</span> I can be picked up tonight,
from wherever you choose to drop me off at." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Yes," said Alison. Wind
nodded, supporting Alison's decision. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Trent frowned and said,
"Come on. But I'll be watching you." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"I know you will,
Trent." She smiled when he looked at her wondering if she could get in his head
the way his old teacher had done earlier. Then she lost her smile and nodded to
him. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"No tricks," he warned. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"No tricks," she agreed
solemnly. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>18. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Trent was inspired in a
way he never been before. The music flowed through him, filling his every pore,
his every inspiration. All the blocks were gone. Then he came to in the living
room. <span class=SpellE>Sanda</span> seemed pleased with herself. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Sanda</span></span></span><span
class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> had mentioned how they all
had their auras drained, some of them wounded. <span class=GramE>Mostly by the
Stalker, but from other sources, too.</span> Daria didn't believe in auras, but
maybe the visualization of one helped <span class=SpellE>Sanda</span> in a way
that she could do whatever it was that she did. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>But they had all felt <span
class=SpellE>Sanda's</span> talent, and been grateful for it. Once they felt
the "flow" of whatever it was she channeled or directed<span class=GramE>,</span>
it was like dropping cool, refreshing water down a parched, dry throat. They
all felt keenly the potential beauty in themselves and in the world around
them. It was, to say the least, an unfamiliar sensation, except for that rare
moment in early childhood in which such stark appreciation could be reached
(just as Mr. O'Neill had reintroduced them to the starkest terrors of early
childhood). </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The "extra pep" would go
away, <span class=SpellE>Sanda</span> told them, but if they worked at it, they
would all be stronger than they've ever been in their life. Alison was peaceful
and content, and found Wind more appealing than ever. But then so were Jane and
Trent. No matter, Alison mused, she was among friends, no matter what. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Wind, sitting next to
Alison, was the most obviously changed. For the first time, he showed concern
with others in a way that showed he was truly connecting with them. He radiated
a serenity he never knew before, and it was obvious that he was ready to stand
up for others, instead of just demanding everyone else stand up for him. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>But <span class=SpellE>Sanda</span>
went to Link again. Link was still somewhat down. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"You're wondering about
your family? Your step-dad may be dead, but your mom will just marry someone
else. And she's told you more than once that you're an inconvenience." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Yeah," said Link
matter-of-factly. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Come with us," said <span
class=SpellE>Sanda</span>. "There's not too many of us. We can always use
someone else. And we have an extensive underground railroad. You need it when
some of the Stalkers hold political and judicial power, or are with the strong
arm of the law." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"But what about school
and.... life?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"We can get you another
birth certificate, social security number, everything. We've plenty of
experience at extracting kids from situations such as yours. And you'll see
some school," she promised him, "as we can always use someone to scope them out
for Stalkers and their kin. Or for my type, as we can always use more like us,
and my <span class=GramE>kind are</span> especially in danger of Stalkers." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>After a minute, Link
asked, "Can I still be friends with Daria and everyone else?" </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Sure," said <span
class=SpellE>Sanda</span>. "I'm hoping we might get one or two more recruits
out of this group in the next few years. But I should warn you all," said <span
class=SpellE>Sanda</span>, looking at all of them again, "that few of us live
to see old age. The few who <span class=GramE>do,</span> do so because they
retire to raise a family. And they're haunted by what they know is out there.
Right now you think you know about the bogeyman, but there are other creatures
out there that you'd wish you'd never met, should you catch one of them at the
wrong time." </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=SpellE><span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Sanda</span></span></span><span
class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> spared them the tragic
stories--and the darker reason she and Jamal hunted them so ruthlessly. <span
class=GramE>For now.</span> If they decided to hunt Stalkers, they could know
the full grim truth then, before they signed on. Meanwhile, she would claim
Link as her own to replace her own son that had been cruelly taken from her by
the Stalker that nearly killed her. </span></span><br>

<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Daria and Jane wondered
how Lawndale High would look to them on Monday without a Mr. O'Neill, and
wondered what teacher would replace him. They wondered if Ms. Barch had any
clue as to what kind of monster he was, and how she'd react to his
disappearance. They had no idea yet that she was dead. </span></span><br>

class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Dr. <span class=SpellE>Hadeley</span>
went to greet their latest "guest." She was another rebellious teen they'd
abducted last night by two strong men working for her. They'd put duck tape all
around her leaving only two slits to breathe out of, and then shaved off her
hair when she got here. <span class=GramE>All with her mother's approval.</span>
Not only that, but the girl's mother was paying them good money to torture her
daughter. It was quite amusing, really. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She pondered what to
start her with today. Generally, she liked them to think they had adjusted to
the deprivation, the "buddies" assigned to them, beatings (not to mention
sexual abuse) by staffers who "had to restrain them," low-protein diet, and the
entire program before she introduced them to electroshock, sensory deprivation,
and other tortures. (She did not like others like herself, but she had to be grateful
that she could do these things legally--at least most of these things--and she
was sure it was another like her that made it so.) </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>When the kids realized
that it could ALWAYS get worse, and there was no hope for help or reprieve,
they tasted so..... <span class=GramE>sweet</span>. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She went in and smiled
at their latest guest. When the girl didn't smile back, the doctor reprimanded
her and then had her strapped down and injected with drugs while an orderly sat
on her chest, making it difficult for her to breathe. All this so she could
feel the utter helplessness of her situation, all the while the good doctor
promising to help her straighten out her life and realize her actuality. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Later, still buzzing
from that encounter, she remembered she was to meet with another concerned
mother. She was bringing her son who liked to skip school. He didn't know that
he would be staying. She licked her lips as she contemplated a new victim and
what she would do to him, and have done to him. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She smiled as she
entered the lobby. Two beefy orderlies were there, but gave no sign of the
brutality they routinely practiced. One sat in a chair, another on a table,
leaning against the wall seeming bored. They weren't like her, the good doctor
thought, which was good. They were just good at following orders. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>And out of all the evils
in the worlds, the great majority of them were not done in hatred, rage, or
even greed. They were done by those following orders, doing their job or even
their duty. <span class=GramE>Which is a good thing, the doctor thought, as she
contemplated some of the orders she had given, and would give in the future.</span>
They had a job to do. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She did wonder who the
new janitor was, though. He shouldn't be here now, and he definitely should not
be doing his job with headphones on (he was listening to a comedian, if she
felt him right, though it was hard to read him for some reason), but she wasn't
about to make a scene in front of the new client. Besides, he really didn't
matter. It just annoyed her that the schedules and plans were haunted by fuck
ups and snafu. In her line of work--and way of life--you needed to be in
control, or things could turn bad on you real fast. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Her smile faltered a
little when she couldn't detect much from the boy or the mother and boy's
uncle. She wondered why this was. Maybe she should've fed <span class=GramE>more
earlier</span>. Or maybe they'd just left someone else that was like her which
had drained them somewhat already. <span class=GramE>A teacher?</span> Maybe
that's why the boy skipped school. She would have to look into it and either <span
class=GramE>form</span> a working alliance (maybe even get the school to send
unruly students here! They already gave bounties to school counselors for
getting kids sent here) or eliminate the rival. There just wasn't enough sheep
for them to gather in one place. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She did catch SOME fear
from the boy. She'd turn it to terror as soon as she could. But something
bothered her. He was listed as a "Tom," but he thought his name was Link. Or
that's what a camp counselor once called him and he recognized it as being him.
She pushed aside her momentary doubts, reminding herself these were mere humans
that were meat for her, and went to meet them, a spider approaching a fly
caught in her web. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"Hello," she said in way
of greeting to the new clients, "I'm Dr. <span class=SpellE>Hadeley</span>."
She suddenly frowned as the janitor snorted, restraining laughter. She looked
at one of the orderlies and motioned for him to get him out. He got up and went
to the janitor. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>When she turned back,
the two adults and the boy each had a <span class=SpellE>taser</span> out. She
jerked as she was hit by all three together. She tried reaching out, but one
put a heavy rock on a chain around her head. She heard a gunshot. <span
class=GramE>Then another.</span> The two orderlies were down, she knew, but she
was having a hard time feeding from them, and they died too fast anyway. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She was barely aware of
being dragged out the door by the family and the janitor. She calmed herself
and tried to find a weakness in them. She despaired. These people were trained
to deal with her kind. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She could read that they
were planning to shut her "treatment center" down. And because they knew what
she was and what she could do--like control the minds of investigators,
lawyers, and judges--they were going to kill her now. Not only would that keep
her from foiling them, but her grisly death would allow the media to make the
story read far and wide. And they hoped the abuses would come out with the rest
of the story. It might change the laws that allowed such mercenary prison camps
for locking up and torturing (and occasionally killing, if
"accidental") teenagers to legally exist. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She struggled, and tried
reaching up to claw one for her blood, but was kicked in the face. Another <span
class=SpellE>taser</span> hit her. And then the man pulled out an iron bar with
a sharpened end and rammed it through her chest, and took out a hammer and
pounded it down until it went all the way through her and into the ground. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>She felt all her power,
energy, life force shooting down the iron bar into the ground, where it
dissipated, no longer of any use to her. The last thing she saw was the fire
blast of a gun shot point blank in her face. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>END. </span></span><br>

<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>AUTHOR'S NOTES: </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>A grim story. It was
useful in exorcising some inner-demons of mine and in making a tribute to
people I've known in the past. For example, the junkie that was in the Viet Nam
conflict was a street person I knew as a runaway that went by the name of
Pappy. He died, but I don't think I'll ever know if it was an accidental OD or
deliberate suicide. He was a good person that punished himself for what he done
far more vigorously than anyone else cared to. I hope he found peace in his
death and that maybe this story helped to rid him of some of his pain, as it
has helped me. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>"The Hag Returns" was
done by a Liz, and read over the airwaves of a <span class=GramE>goth</span>
radio program called Zombie Time in response to "The Hag" by Johnny. Since I know Liz, I
borrowed her poem with permission (and she was one of the beta readers for this
story), as I thought it was a good mood setter, and subtle reminder that evil
is not always seen, even when we're looking for it--maybe especially when we're
looking for it. ("The Hag" might've gone <span class=GramE>good</span>, too,
but I don't know Johnny, so I couldn't get his permission.). She also requested
that I only give "Liz" as the author.</span></span></span></p>
