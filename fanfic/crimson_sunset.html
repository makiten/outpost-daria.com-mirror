<p class=MsoNormal>“So it’s agreed that our weekly trip to Cashman’s will be
tomorrow instead of Saturday and will include a perusal of the new fall line
for appropriately hued crimson items.” Sandi eyed Stacy’s white shirt
malevolently. “Since <i>some</i> club members seem to be woefully behind the
current fashions.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stacy gulped. Labor Day had been the day before, and yet she
had worn white today. <i>Stupid, stupid, stupid! How could I have forgotten
today was the day after Labor Day?</i> It was easy since she had been so tired
that morning. Sandi had called an emergency Fashion Club meeting the night
before to discuss Waif’s new issue and the hot colors for fall, this year,
crimson. By the time she had gotten home, her mom had gotten back from her
shift at the hospital. Stacy had volunteered to make her a late dinner, seeing
how working the swing shifts were wearing her out. By the time she had finished
that and then her homework (Sandi never knew she handed it in secretly), it was
almost two in the morning. Stacy was just happy she’d been fully dressed when
she’d arrived at school, but now she was regretting not setting something
appropriate out beforehand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>If you can’t find the sun in your own day, at least you
can try to be it in someone else’s.</i> Her mother’s words always came back to her
whenever Sandi was raining on her particularly hard. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And crimson is such a good color for you Sandi, I’m sure
you’ll find lots of things that will look great.” Stacy felt better when Sandi
rewarded her with a smile, condescending though it was. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn looked over her shoulder when the bell at the counter
rang. “Number four, one large cheese-less pizza.” The acne covered teen
squeaked out. The four girls shuddered at his obvious lack of skin care
knowledge and horrendous Pizza King uniform.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’ll get it!” Stacy volunteered brightly. The other three
smiled at her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stacy walked to the counter smiling, but it faded when she
heard Sandi’s not-quite-whispered comment. “Maybe she’ll spill it on herself
and then she won’t have to bear the shame of wearing white after Labor Day.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stacy’s shoulders slumped as she approached the counter. As
she was handing the cashier the money, someone ran in the door and pushed her
out of the way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Give me all the money in the cash register! NOW!” His eyes
were wild, with huge pupils. Stacy cowered next to the counter, afraid to move
and draw attention to herself. She tried to get a good look at him with out
staring, silently describing him to herself so she could tell the police when
they came.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the cashier just stared back at him in fright, making
no motion to empty the register, the man pulled a gun out of his pocket.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I said ALL THE MONEY! NOW!” The cashier shakily opened the
register and tried to get the bills out with jerky, terrified movements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the sight of the gun Stacy let out an involuntary
whimper. The robber turned his unstable gaze to her, immediately noticing the
cash still clutched in her hand. He took an unsteady step towards her, and
Stacy noticed he was shaking almost as badly as she was. <i>He must be coming
off some drug, he must need  more money for more drugs</i>. She added these
thoughts to his description. He grabbed at the money in her hand, but in her
state of paralyzed fear, she couldn’t unclench her hand to let him take it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“LET GO, YOU BITCH!” He pulled harder, waving his gun hand
wildly as he tried to balance and wrest the money from her. The shock of a loud
gunshot made her finally let go. The robber stumbled back with her money and grabbed
the money the cashier had managed to pile on the counter then fled out the
door. Being early on a Tuesday night, he later found out he had gotten a grand
total of four hundred and twenty-three dollars, including the fifteen he had
ripped out of Stacy’s hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When he was gone someone called out. “CALL 911!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn ran over to Stacy who was shaking against the wall.
“Don’t worry Quinn, I know what he looks like, I can tell the police
everything.” She tried to breathe deeply and not hyperventilate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn’s eyes filled with tears. “Stacy?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m okay, Quinn, but he took my money. Can you get the
pizza this time?” Stacy slid down the wall, after all the excitement she was
feeling a little dizzy. “I think I just need to sit for a minute.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sandi and Tiffany rushed over and kneeled next to Quinn.
They could hear sirens in the distance. Stacy looked to Sandi. “I used the
method you taught me for coordinating outfits to remember what he was wearing.”
She laughed a bit and coughed. “Can you believe his t-shirt was crimson? I mean
a drugged-up thief was more fashionable than me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A tear ran down Sandi’s cheek. “No way, Stacy. He’s nothing
but trash. You’re way fashionable.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stacy looked up at her with a delighted smile. “Really,
Sandi?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah, Stacy.” Especially since the bright red stain had
soaked through Stacy’s once white t-shirt, turning it the exact shade of red
that Waif hailed as fall’s hottest hue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stacy closed her eyes, thinking that this was the first time
Sandi had ever sincerely complemented her. <i>I’m going to tell the police
everything and they’re going to catch that guy. Mom will be so proud. And Sandi
really meant it when she said I was fashionable. This was the best night ever…</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Her world faded to black.</p>
