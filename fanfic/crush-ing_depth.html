<U>Brian's Notes</U> - It was right about the time that I started talking
about doing a story involving a wormhole and an alternate dimension that
I really wanted to do an essay about the Daria and Trent relationship. I
even have a few drafts of it lying around in hard copy form, and one of these
days it'll get out there. One evening, however, as I lay in my room, I saw
a piece of paper that I didn't recognize. The thing was stained, and crumpled,
and ripped. And in a hand that I didn't recognize. It looked like it'd been
torn out of a spiral notebook, and then tossed in the garbage. I read it.
They were lyrics - pretty bad ones, I might add - and I thought I recognized
a few of the events he mentioned. At least, I <I>thought</I> they were lyrics.
<P>
Flipping the paper over, I saw the words to... "Freakin' Friends" by Mystik
Spiral. In the same curious hand. I began to wonder, then, what exactly I
had. After all, John Takis had allegedly transcribed and edited an essay
by Charles Ruttheimer, and released it under the title of "I, Upchuck." Was
it really so bizarre to think that maybe - just maybe - I had stumbled upon
actual, authentic lyrics by Trent Lane? I still don't know. I'm not even
sure if they are lyrics, or just the closest equivalent to a love <I>poem</I>
that he's capable of writing. After all, no chorus, and it seems a bit long
for a Mystik Spiral song. You can think whatever you want to about them.
That I'm merely ripping off Takis' flesh-crawlingly creepy story. That I'm
pulling a big hoax on you all. Or that perhaps these are real lyrics. You
never know. But all I can say is that these words do the job I was trying
to do a lot better then I did it, although some of the figurative language
is fairly... awful.
<P>
Also, I'm not the sort of guy to write lyrics like "They were stuck in my
brain like burnt cheese in a frying pan." Make up your own minds about who
really wrote 'em.

<P>
Knew you were staring at me<BR>
At the flea market that time<BR>
Like an icy drink on a hot day<BR>
And I smiled at the thought<BR>
But you were too young for me to say
<P>
Saw you at the nut stand<BR>
With my brain hijacked by nuts.<BR>
You looked so cute in that little hat,<BR>
But I didn't want to embarrass you<BR>
Or anything dumb like that.
<P>
And that time at your house<BR>
Where you saw me with Monique<BR>
And then I said I'd ask you out<BR>
If only you were 18<BR>
Why'd I spit those words out?
<P>
The music thing was all my fault.<BR>
Couldn't get the notes together,<BR>
They were stuck in my brain<BR>
Like burnt cheese in a frying pan<BR>
And driving me insane.
<P>
Now you're with him<BR>
And you broke my sister's heart<BR>
But I just can't hate you at all<BR>
Or even say what I feel...<BR>
It's a tough thing to call
<P>
Besides, I'm not your type<BR>
You're too smart, and I'm too lazy<BR>
And all we'd ever do is fight<BR>
But, for all that it hurts to ask,<BR>
Would you like to go out some night?
<P>
Don't wanna change at all<BR>
Don't wanna make you feel odd<BR>
But like clothing through a closet door<BR>
There could be something<BR>
There worth changing for...
<P>
