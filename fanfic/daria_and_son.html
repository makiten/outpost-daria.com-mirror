IN: <BR>EXT. LAWNDALE--DAY</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">The
town circa 2026. It's still Little Hell in Suburbia, but it's grown
larger in the 26 years since we were last here. There are more
subdivisions, more businesses, and the industrial park has sprouted a
few small office buildings. Not so much urban sprawl as suburban
expansion. Small town in the process of becoming small city.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">DISSOLVE
TO: <BR>EXT. SUBURBAN ROAD-- DAY</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">A green
crossover vehicle drives down the road. It doesn't look much
different from crossover vehicles today, except the edges are more
rounded and the overall aesthetic is more streamlined.</P>

TO:<BR>INT. DARIA'S CAR</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Behind
the wheel is DARIA MORGENDORFFER, age 43. She looks similar to the
older Daria we saw in her story in &quot;Write Where It Hurts,&quot;
however, there's a hint of gray at her temples. She's dressed in a
tan suit with a green blouse.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">In the
passenger seat is her 16-year-old son, Samuel Gregor Davenport - more
commonly called MARK. He bears a slight resemblance to Daria, in that
he has the same shade of hair and wears glasses. Otherwise he has
what could be described as proto-rugged good looks. Strong jaw,
pleasant features, and a slightly more expressive face than his
mother. He's dressed in a short sleeved white shirt, jeans, sneakers
and a black jacket. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">He's
currently fiddling with the latest iteration of iGadget, which is
wirelessly networked into the car's sound system.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">DARIA:
I know it's a big change, Mark, and I know how hard it is to suddenly
pack up and move cross-country--</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">MARK:
Did we--</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">DARIA:
Yes, we moved, smart ass.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">She
smirks.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">DARIA:
My point is, even though it's a new school and all, it really isn't
going to be much different from California.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">MARK:
Oh, so I can expect bomb sniffing dogs and security guards with
assault rifles at the ready here too?</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">DARIA:
Oh, you wish. Lawndale High had those when I was going there. I
shudder to think what got installed after 9/11.</P>

What do you think the football team did in the off season?</P>

One of these days, I'm going to win one of these quizzes.</P>

It's nice that young people still dream.</P>

<BR>EXT. LAWNDALE HIGH -- DAY</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">The car
pulls into the loop in front of the school.  Mark opens the door and
gets out, grabbing his backpack.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">MARK:
You coming or what?</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">DARIA:
You mean you want all the other kids seeing you go to school with
Mommy, thus ensuring perpetual ridicule and scorn from your peers for
the rest of your high school days? Do you feel mature enough to deal
with that concept?</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">MARK:
Not when you put it like that, no.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">DARIA:
That's my boy. Go ahead. I'm going around to the faculty lot. I'll
see you after school.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">MARK:
See ya.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">He
closes the door and Daria drives off. Mark turns to face the front of
the school, looks around at the other kids, and at the security
cameras mounted at the entrance and sighs.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">MARK: I
miss Santa Cruz already.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Off of
his apathetic trudge towards the front doors,</P>

<BR>EXT. LAWNDALE HIGH FACULTY PARKING LOT -- DAY</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
parks the car, grabs her shoulder bag from behind the passenger seat
and her coffee from the cup holder. She gets out of the car and
maneuvers the bag strap over her head while holding onto her coffee
and trying not to drop her car keys. After a few moments, she puts
her keys in her mouth, gets organized and we hear a familiar voice
from off screen.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">VOICE:
(Off screen) Daria? Daria Morgendorffer? Is that you?</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">DARIA:
(keys still in her mouth) Mmm?</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">She
turns to see a pudgy, grey-haired, still recognizably sappy TIMOTHY
BARCH O'NEILL. He's wearing, of all things, a brown cardigan sweater
and khakis. The overall feel is like Mr. Rogers, although nowhere
near as vicious.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
takes her keys out of her mouth and looks at her former teacher in
surprise.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">DARIA:
Mr. O'Neill?</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">O'NEILL:
(chuckling) Please, Daria, you can call me &quot;Timothy&quot; or
even &quot;Tim&quot; if you like. After all, we're going to be
colleagues now.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">DARIA
(Thought VO): It's official. Lawndale High is the tenth ring of Hell.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">DARIA
(out loud): Um. it's nice to see you again, I guess. (beat) Still
teaching here, I see.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">O'NEILL:
Oh yes. Janet asked me to retire years ago but&hellip; (sighs) Well,
after her unfortunate parasailing accident, the house just seemed
so...empty.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">DARIA:
Oh...um, sorry to hear that.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">O'NEILL:
Oh, it's all right. I mean, I may not be teaching English any longer,
but I'm just so much more suited to Communications. Besides, Ms.
Sloane has that covered.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">DARIA:
(quirking an eyebrow) Sloane?</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">O'NEILL:
Elsie Sloane. She's the head of the language arts department
nowadays. A little high strung, but she's okay. Oh! But I'm probably
keeping you from meeting with Mr. Powell.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
looks at her watch and her eyes widen.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">DARIA:
You're right. I'm late. I'll talk to you later...I guess.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">O'NEILL:
Have a good day, Daria.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Off of
O'Neill's cheerfully oblivious expression,</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">CUT
TO:<BR>INT. PRINCIPAL POWELL'S OFFICE - DAY</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
is sitting in front of the desk of LHS's current principal, Deacon
Powell. Everything about this guy screams &quot;chair warmer.&quot;
If Ms. Li was overly involved in LHS, Powell seems to have no
interest at all. If anything, he seems to find talking with his own
latest employee to be a chore.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">POWELL:
Well, Ms. Morgendorffer, I'm glad to see that your well-documented
hatred of this institution hasn't completely jaded you against taking
a position here.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">DARIA:
Excuse me?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><SPAN LANG="en">POWELL:

If you say so.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">He
slaps his hands on the desk and gets to his feet.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">POWELL:
Well, let's take a look at your new office, shall we?</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">DARIA:
Sure, why not?</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Powell
opens the door to the office and the two exit.<BR><BR><BR>

<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">CUT
TO:<BR>INT. LAWNDALE HIGH HALLWAY</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Powell
and Daria make their way down the hall. The school hasn't changed
much. Same lockers, same hall, but there do seem to more students in
the hallways than usual, and a security guard can be seen walking
past them in the background.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">POWELL:
I have to admit, Ms. Morgendorffer, you weren't exactly my first
choice for this job. There were many other qualified applicants.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
looks around at the milling student body.  One kid has two thumbs
shoved up his nose, and his face contorted into a weird and creepy
shape, while his compadres hoot and laugh approvingly.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">DARIA:
Really.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">POWELL:
Oh, yes. But I chose you because of your history here as a student,
as well as your professional reputation. You taught English at UCLA,
right?</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">DARIA:
UC Santa Cruz.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">POWELL:
Ah, yes. Slithering Snails, right?</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">DARIA:
Banana Slugs.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">POWELL:
Mm.  Anyway, as I was saying, there were many factors that
contributed to my decision to hire you as our new Vice Principal. 
One element of your teaching style, in particular, made you uniquely
qualified for the position... 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">They
come to a stop as they reach the vice principal's office. A huge line
of students waits outside the office. The first few are lucky enough
to have chairs. The other twenty or so are leaning up against the
wall, with a mixture of expressions ranging from boredom to terror.  
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">DARIA:
Why is there a line of people waiting to get into my office? 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">POWELL:
Oh, yes, well&hellip;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Powell
fiddles with his tie, unprepared for the full force of the
Morgendorffer Gaze of Disapproval. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">POWELL:
Administrative backlog. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">DARIA:
Right. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">POWELL:
When your predecessor quit two weeks ago, he left behind a lot of
unfinished business. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
stares at him for a moment in disbelief.  She turns to the line. 
Squares her shoulders, puts her hands on her hips and clears her
throat loudly, getting the attention of the crowd. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">DARIA:
Okay, let's make this fast. I'm Ms. Morgendorffer, your new vice
principal. I don't take crap from anybody for anything. Just keep
that in mind. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">She
takes a couple of steps closer to the throng of students, yanking a
cigarette out of the mouth of one wiseacre as she draws near. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">DARIA:
That said, today's your lucky day. Whatever the hell you did, you get
a free pass. I see you in my office again and your ass is mine.
(beat) Get to class. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">The
crowd of students looks at each other, not sure whether or not she's
serious. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">DARIA
(frowning again and speaking loudly): VAMANOS! 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">The
students scatter like marbles on a Hungry Hungry Hippos board. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">POWELL
(smirking): That's why I hired you. You scare them. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">DARIA:
While you coincidentally continue to look like the good guy and
manage to avoid doing anything remotely resembling your job. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">POWELL:
Well, I do take budget meetings. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">DARIA
(to herself): Why did I take this job again? 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">POWELL:
Because we were hiring. (beat) And because beggars can't be choosers.
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
gives him a look, like she's not sure if he's talking about himself
or her. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">POWELL:
Have a good first day.  And welcome to the good ship Lawndale High. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">He
claps her on the shoulder happily and wanders off, whistling. Daria
stares after him, wondering what she's gotten herself into. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">DARIA
(muttering): S.O.S. Woman overboard... 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Off of
her dark look,

<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">CUT
TO:<BR>INT. MS. SLOANE'S CLASSROOM 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">It
appears to be DeMartino&rsquo;s old room.  ELSIE SLOANE, now in her
late 30s, stands in front of the chalkboard looking fairly ground
down. She's still attractive, but there's an exhaustion to her, a
deep bitterness and resentment in her expression.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">ELSIE:
All right, class. We've got a new slab of meat joining the rest of
you zombies today.

Let's all give a big Lawndale High welcome to Samuel Davenport. Raise
your hand, please, Samuel.

raises his hand, with some trepidation.

<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">MARK:
Um...most people call me Mark. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">ELSIE:
I beg your pardon? 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">MARK: I
don't really use the Samuel name so much. My parents started calling
me Mark a while back and the name just stuck. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">ELSIE:
I see. (beat) Well, Samuel, while I'm sure we wouldn't want to
contradict the ridiculous and arbitrary whims of such a best-selling
author of airport DRECK as the great Paul Davenport, the name on my
class roster is Samuel and as long as that's the name on the
paperwork, that is the name you will answer to in my class. Do we
have an understanding...Samuel? 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">MARK:
(sighs) Yes, Ms. Sloane. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">ELSIE:
Good. (smirking) Now that we've established who's in charge, let's
see how well the diminished mass of neurons you call a brain
functions, Mr. Davenport... 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">The
smirk turns to an evil grin. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">ELSIE:
In The Count of Monte Cristo, why exactly was Edmond Dantes sent to
prison?

BLACKBOARD 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">It's
covered with notes and terms from Shakespeare's Macbeth, as well as a
disturbingly accurate drawing of Macbeth's severed head.  It's
clearly what the class has been studying.

I'm waiting, Mr. Davenport.

(deadpan): Edmond Dantes was sent to prison because his gutless
friend stabbed him in the back and accused him anonymously of being a
Bonapartist, and because the lead investigator in the case was too
busy covering his own political career to do the right thing.

<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Elsie
stares at him, looking almost impressed despite her hostile air.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">MARK:

From this we learn that it's a bad idea to publicly show support for
the whims of short, ill-tempered dictators -- no matter their station

If you were at any other school in the world, I'd be proud that you

To celebrate? Or because Grandma Helen doesn't have anything to eat

smiles - a happy but twisted grin.  Which is when a low, panicked

himself is standing in front of a whiteboard with a lot of
junk-science phrases written in faded black market.  One saying
&ldquo;Realize your actuality&rdquo; may be more visible than others.

<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Mark,
sitting in the second row, doodles idly in a notebook and tries to
block out the sound of O'Neill's soothingly loopy attempts to guide
his pupils in communication. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">O&rsquo;NEILL:
So you see, when you're really talking about you, you're talking
about &ldquo;I,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rdquo; is -  
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">MARK

What? 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">GIRL:
Devious little bastards, ficuses.  Always scheming amongst themselves
about what they'll do once they break free from their terra-cotta
confinement.  (beat; confidentially) I've heard them say things.
Terrible, unspeakable things.  That's why I only keep Venus Fly-traps
in my house.

No, but that's because I live in the real world, where plants don't

TO:<BR>INT. LAWNDALE HIGH TEACHER'S LOUNGE</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Various
members of the faculty are seated, eating assorted things.  Many of
them are peering out the corner of their eyes at Daria, seated alone
and munching idly on a peanut butter sandwich while skimming an
imposing stack of paperwork.</P>

Mind if I join you in the consumption of a vaguely food-like
substance? 
</P>

looks up to find Elsie standing over her.  In the sanctity of the
teacher's lounge, she looks less bitter than in class.  There's still
a heavy-browed expression of sarcasm, but it's much more genial. 
Almost sociable. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">DARIA:
Have a seat.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Elsie
sits down across from Daria, setting down a plastic tupperware

Nice to see that being forced to work for a living hasn't ruined your

What's the smart money say?</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">ELSIE:
Claire's got $50 on him changing his name to Valentine, subjecting
his worldly possessions to the cleansing power of fire, and starting
a self-love cult out in the Mojave.  I've got two hundred on
underground slug-fighting ring, myself.  And O'Neill, well -  
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">The two

a veggie sandwich while humming something that sounds like it came
from Schoolhouse Rocks!

So you saw through our cunning disguise. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">ELSIE:
Daria.  Paul Davenport's divorce was on page six of People.  Besides,

Okay, look.  It's not that I disapprove of you going full DeMartino

Let me guess.  That's the point? 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">ELSIE:
They don't want to learn any other way, and you can't underestimate
the value of a little public humiliation.</P>

<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">DARIA:
I don't.  We both agree it's morally wrong for him to get any
preferential treatment because I happen to be in a position of power.
 It's why we tried this futile excuse for a charade in the first

</P>
