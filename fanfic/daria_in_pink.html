<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane leaned forward tapping Trent on his
shoulder. "There it is," she said pointing toward a small strip mall. It was
indistinguishable from any of the thousands of its ilk that sprouted from the
asphalt loam of America. Eight businesses and one vacant 'ready for lease'
hugged a parking lot all under a marquee that grandly proclaimed it the 'Oaktree Plaza.' A lone pin oak, the namesake for the bastion of free enterprise, grew from
a struggling patch of grass prudently protected by an iron fence in the midst
of the blacktop.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are we looking for again?" asked Trent lethargically as he steered his car through an opening in the traffic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That place there," Jane answered. "Millie's
Diner."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are we gonna eat?" Jesse asked hopefully.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, sure," Jane replied tossing a knowing
look at her husband that sat beside her on the backseat. Chances were neither
her brother nor Jesse had more then a couple of bucks in their wallets. She
would be picking up the bill. "You are wearing shoes, aren't you?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uh, boots," he said after looking at his feet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Close enough," replied Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Cool."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (*)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Millie's was an old-fashioned greasy spoon.
Fifteen backless stools bolted into the blue and white linoleum floor fronted a
long counter dotted with salt and pepper shakers, ketchup bottles, napkin
dispensers, and laminated menus.&nbsp; There were six tables designed to accommodate
large parties but most of the seating was four person booths. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The size of the restaurant surprised Jane. From
the outside, it did not look very large. The crowd surprised her even more. She
had never heard of Millie's but most of Lawndale must have. The place was
packed. The cliental was a lazy pollster's dream. College students and
professors from nearby Lawndale State sat next to factory workers from the
plants of the industrial park. Several uniformed police officers mingled with executives
and secretaries from the office building across the street. Politics,
relationships, school, the economy and the pitiful play of the Orioles fought
for conversational dominance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Party of four?" asked an overly ripe brunette
who bustled up to hostess station where Jane and the others were standing. The nametag
on her pink dress and frilly white apron that was the uniform of the wait staff
announced her name to be Gloria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Jane answered. "Could we have Daria as
our waitress?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Daria? Let's see," said Gloria arching her neck
looking over the patrons. "Lucky you, one booth just became free in her
section. Follow me, please."&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Daria works here?" Trent asked as they fell
into step behind the hostess.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's what she said," replied Jane. "I wonder
what her scam is."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe she just wanted to earn some money," Trent said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane snorted. "Her? No way. If she got any
lazier, she'd have to join Mystik Spiral." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A short, burly young man sporting a sandy
flattop gave the tabletop one final swipe with a towel as Gloria led the foursome
to the booth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Cleaned, dried, and ready to go," he announced,
lifting a heavy plastic tub of dirty dishes and glasses with understated ease. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good job, Wes," Gloria said. She placed menus in
front of each of them as they sat. "I'll let Daria know that you're here.
She'll be with you in just a moment." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thanks uh, Gloria," Jesse stammered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You're welcome, sugar," she replied gaily. She
winked at him before sashaying to the kitchen. Jesse twisted around watching
her every step. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She's got it goin'," he said at length. "I
wonder if Daria knows her number."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Gloria's telephone number was
likely written on the men's room wall Jane thought but did not say so. Even
from a distance, she kept an eye on Trent's girlfriends but what the other
members of the band ran around with did not concern her. Jesse had a liking for
brash women but as long as they did not try to kill him, Jane did not care.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>After a few moments, Jane spied
Daria, clad in the Millie's pink and white uniform emerging from behind the
counter holding a laden tray aloft. She stopped briefly for a word with Wes.
What ever he said to her brought a small grin to her face. Her smile became
larger as she as she maneuvered toward Jane. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"I'll be with you shortly," she
said scooting on past.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Jane craned her neck, watching her
friend at work. Daria was quick, efficient, and friendly as she unloaded the
plates while talking to the consumers. If she was self-conscious about wearing
the bubblegum-colored nightmare, she gave no hint of it.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"Bon appetit, Donna, Mr DeMartino.
If everything is not to your liking, let me know," Daria said. "Is there
anything else that you need?"&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"I'm good. Tony?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"Unlike the slack-jawed zombies that
is my usual misfortune to be served by, Daria, you have forgotten nothing," Mr.
DeMartino said. "Thank you."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"Mr. DeMartino," Jane mumbled in wonder.
"On a date, even. Who's Donna?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Donna was a stocky, whiskey-voiced
redhead on the far side of thirty if she had not already hit the big four-oh.
The yellow sundress that she wore exposed heavily freckled shoulders and
muscular arms. Who ever she was, Daria seemed to be on good terms with her. The
smiles they bestowed on each other were genuine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Daria sat her tray down on Jane's
table. "It's great to see you again," she said sincerely while placing glasses
of water and cutlery rolled in napkins before each of them. "This, I take it,
is the man himself."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"The one and only, Ryan Sullivan
Merrill," Jane said breezily. "Ryan, this is Daria Morgendorffer."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"Hello, Daria," Ryan said. "Please
excuse me for not standing."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"I am pleased to meet you," she politely
replied shaking his hand. Her first impression of him was more favorable then
the e-mailed photographs that Jane sent to her earlier in the year with a brief
synopsis of his life and their elopement.&nbsp; Despite the quickness of their
courtship and the eighteen-year age gap, Daria's intuition said that Ryan was a
good one. Jane had chosen well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"Okay, that's out of the way, now
start explaining, Daria," Jane replied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"Hey, it says here you serve
breakfast anytime," Trent piped up from behind his menu. Jane shot daggers at
her oblivious brother but Daria turned her attention to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"That's right, we do," she
confirmed. "Have you already decided on what you want to order?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yeah, a western omelet with
home-style potatoes, toast, and coffee, black," he replied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"Where's breakfast at? I don't see
it," Jesse said flipping his menu over. "Do you have blueberry pancakes?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"A stack of those and a vanilla
shake," Jesse said. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"And what would you like, Jane?"
Daria asked writing down the orders on her pad.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"I would like to talk," she replied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"I haven't the time."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"Geez, Daria, make time," Jane shot
back. "Eighteen months ago you drop out of Raft because you had a nervous
breakdown and during in that interim you have scarcely spoken to me. Now, I
find out that you've been slinging hash in a roadside joint for most of that
period."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"First and foremost, I did NOT have
a mental breakdown of any sort," Daria snapped. She blushed as several heads
turned toward her. She lowered her voice when she continued. "It's a bit
involved and this is not the milieu for such a conversation."&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"You have been dodging me for a
year and a half," Jane said. "I'm not leaving town without some answers."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Daria looked at her for several
moments. Jane could not read her friend's suddenly stoic face. "I wasn't
dodging you. I simply did not have the answers that you and everybody else
wanted from me."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"If you have them now I would like
to hear them." Jane demanded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;Daria nodded. "I don't work tomorrow."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Jane got the hint. "I'll be
knocking on your door." </p>

<div style='border:none;border-bottom:solid windowtext 1.5pt;padding:0in 0in 1.0pt 0in'>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"I'll be
there," promised Daria. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>(*)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Dew was
still glistening on the grass when Ryan eased their pickup truck to the curb
before the Morgendorffer residence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Nice
place," he said looking over the house.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Yeah, it
is," Jane replied. "You don't mind, do you?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"No," he assured.
"You want a heart-to-heart with Daria and I'm a stranger to her. I'd only be a
hindrance. We can get to know each other later."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"I've got
to get to the bottom of this," Jane said. "I can't let her throw her life away
working as a waitress."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>&nbsp;"It's
honest work," Ryan said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Yes, it
is," Jane acknowledged. "But Daria's way too intelligent and far too anti-social.
She has to be going nuts dealing with the public for minimum wage."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Ryan grunted
noncommittally. "She means a lot to you." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"You, Trent
and Daria are the only people in the world I really give a damn about," she
replied. "I guess that doesn't say much for me."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"You're
being too hard on yourself again," her husband said. "You're a far better
person then you give yourself credit for."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Jane shrugged.
"I can't help thinking that if I hadn't transferred from BFAC maybe I could
have seen the signs and done something before everything fell apart for her."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Maybe,
maybe not," he said diplomatically. "But then we would not have met. Forgive me
for being selfish but I don't like that scenario." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Neither do
I," she replied kissing him lightly. He had a knack for saying the right things
to dispel her gloom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Into the
breach with you," Ryan said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Hopefully
not an apt metaphor," replied Jane opening the door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"What is
it, Honey?" he asked when she did not exit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Do me a favor,"
Jane said seriously. "While I'm with Daria, start to work on Trent for me, will
ya? He likes and respects you and you're subtle."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Trent was twenty-seven. He had no job, no training, no education, and Mystic Spiral getting
a recording contract was a pipedream that was drifting further and further out
of reach every day. Jane was increasingly worried for her brother and his
future so had been trying to get him to find another direction. She would
willingly take care of him but she did not want that to become necessary, if
only for Trent's sake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"I'll try,"
Ryan pledged. "But Jane, you must remember that Trent and Daria are adults.
They must make their own way. Even if we don't agree with their choices, we
must respect them. You can give them advice but you cannot force them to do
what you want them to do." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Yeah, I
know," Jane replied. "But Trent needs a push."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"And
Daria?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Jane shook
her head. "Right now, all I want from Daria is an explanation."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"That's
all?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Jane
grinned at her husband's persistence. "No, that's not all. I want is her back
in my life. She's the best friend I ever had. There's been a hole in me ever since
she took a bongo."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Ryan
laughed. "Took a bongo. I haven't heard that expression in years."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"What can I
say? I'm a beatnik's daughter," Jane said hopping out of the car. "I'll call
when we done. Love ya, mean it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"I love you
too," replied Ryan. "Good luck," he added before pulling onto the road.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Jane took a
deep breath then resolutely strode across the still wet grass. The time for elucidation
had come.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>A wobbly, blurry-eyed,
blue robe and slippers wearing Helen Morgendorffer answered Jane's knock. She
stared at Jane for a moment before recognition. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Oh, Jane,"
she happily said opening the door wide. "Please do come in. It is good to see
you again. Let me congratulate you on both your marriage and earning your
degree." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Thank
you," replied Jane wiping her feet. "I'm sorry if I woke you."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Please
call me Helen, one old married woman to another and don't fret. You didn't wake
me up," Helen responded leading the younger woman to the kitchen. "The coffee's
done. We can have a cup while you wait for Daria to return."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Daria's
not here?" Jane asked with concern.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"No, she's
on her morning run," Helen replied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Wait a
minute," Jane said. "Daria runs? Daily?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Helen
chuckled at Jane's astonishment. "Yes, she does, ever since she's been back. It
was reassuring those first few weeks. I took it as a sign that what ever was
wrong with her, she was not clinically depressed."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Sloth
personified willingly runs every day and works a hectic job," Jane said. "Have
you checked for electronic nodes, barcodes, or antennae?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>&nbsp;Helen
laughed heartily. "I questioned her about that shortly after she started
running and working. She lifted her hair baring her neck and said 'Look Mom. No
implants.' You two have a similar sense of humor."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"It was
what initially brought us together," Jane said accepting a cup of coffee. "We
laughed at the world to keep from screaming."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Helen
gestured toward the kitchen table. "Please be seated, Jane. Why are you here?
Just visiting?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"No, I want
some answers from her," Jane said easing down onto a chair carefully watching
her mug. She had a habit of spilling coffee, something that amused her husband
to no end. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Helen slowly
nodded taking a chair opposite Jane. "Daria and I are closer now then ever
before but she still doesn't open up very much and when she does, sometimes
what she says makes little sense to me."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"I guess
geniuses can be like that," Jane replied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Daria's
not a genius," Helen said after sipping her coffee. "I think that it is more a part
of her simply having an unconventional worldview."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Her dropping
out must have been a shock to you," Jane said. "I know that I was floored." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>&nbsp;Helen
shook her head. "Utterly stunned would have been putting it mildly. Academics
were the focal point of Daria's life even before she began school.&nbsp; She could
read when she was three and had a thirst for words even before that. She would
sit quietly for hours as a toddler as long as someone was reading nursery
rhymes aloud to her. In that light, I didn't know what to think when she
announced that she wasn't going back to Raft."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"She didn't
say why?" asked Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"No, not
satisfactorily at any rate," Helen replied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"What
exactly happened?" Jane asked. "You told me that she had a nervous break down
but Daria denied that."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"What else
would you call it?" Helen asked in return. "A few days before she was going to
drive back to Boston, I found her on a crying jag curled up before the
Christmas tree. Jake had to carry her to her bed where she stayed for two days,
crying most of the time. When she finally calmed down, she dropped her little
bombshell. Her only explanation was that she was miserable to the depths of her
soul as she put it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Nothing
else?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"No," Helen
confirmed. "Rape was the first thing that leaped to my mind but an examination
proved that false, thank God. Then I thought about alcohol, drugs, academic
pressure, romance, all of the usual things that can affect a young person's
mental well-being. Daria denied all of that. I'm just unhappy became her
mantra."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"That's all
she told me," Jane said. "She asked me to leave her alone for a while. I was
crushed but Daria swore that she was not angry with me in any way, shape, or
form."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"And I
wasn't," a perspiration-soaked Daria said slipping ghost-like into the kitchen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Whoa,"
Jane exclaimed. "What did you do? Run all the way to Annapolis?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"I only put
in five miles today," she answered snagging a bottle of Gatorade from the
refrigerator. "I thought that you would get here early but I did not expect you
this early."&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"I really,
really want to talk to you," Jane said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Apparently,"
Daria drolly replied. "But you'll have to wait until I shower."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Daria
leaned over and kissed her mother on the cheek. "Good morning, Mom. I love
you."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"I love you
too, sweetie," Helen replied wrinkling her nose. "But you do reek. Go bathe."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"I'll only
be a few minutes, Jane," Daria said exiting the room as she chugged her drink.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Helen
laughed lightly when she caught sight of an astounded Jane's dropped jaw. "My
reaction was much the same when she started doing that. It was weeks before I
stopped waiting for the other shoe to drop. That's a terrible thing for a
mother to say, isn't it?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Well, a
leopard and its spots," Jane stammered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Yes,"
Helen replied. "So tell me able this lucky man you married. Daria says that
he's a wealthy artist, two words not normally associated with each other."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>(*)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Do I know
you?" Jane asked running an eye over Daria's ensemble as she and Daria as she
and Daria exited the Morgendorffer house. It was stylish, a far cry from her
high school uniform.&nbsp; Daria was chicly dressed in a smart white cotton
short-sleeved blouse, and a knee-length dark brown skirt. A pair of brown flats
adorned her feet. A white visor protected her face to which cosmetics had been
lightly but skillfully applied. &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"No one
ever knows the heart of anyone else," Daria quoted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"That's a buzz
kill," Jane replied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"It's a
line from a Nanci Griffith song, <u>Late Night Grande Hotel,</u>" Daria said.
"And like a lot of song lyrics, it nails it on the head."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"So, you're
saying that I cannot know you," replied Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Not
absolutely. We cannot do Vulcan mind melds so there will always be secrets,"
Daria sighed. "Even among the closest of friends, even between husbands and
wives." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"So what
secret drove you from college and into the food service industry?" Jane bluntly
asked. "Your mom said that she was afraid that you had been raped or
something."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Mom thinks
in dramatic terms," Daria grumbled. "I understand why she was worried and I
appreciate the concern but it did get annoying especially when she would not
believe what I told her and I certainly could have done without a vaginal exam
that I knew I didn't need."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"It eased
her mind," Jane said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Yes, I
suppose so," Daria replied before chuckling. "Although I'm not sure that the
doctor telling her that I was virgo intacta didn't raise some other
suspicions." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Still?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Don't you
think that I would have told you if I had?" Daria asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Honestly, Daria,
I don't know," Jane replied. "You have done a good job of shutting me out
lately. You have your midlife crisis twenty years early and all you have ever told
me was that you were unhappy, as if that was explanation enough."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Daria
sighed in exasperation.&nbsp; "Why wasn't that enough? Surely, you must have had a
friend at BFAC or Hudson Valley that told you that she was unhappy at one time
or another. Did you jump to the immediate conclusion that she had a nervous
breakdown?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>&nbsp;"No, I
didn't."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Okay, so
what would you say to them then?" Daria asked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"That she needs
to get laid," quipped Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Daria
snorted. "You're the one that demanded this t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Yeah,
okay, sorry," Jane replied. "Seriously, I knew that you were Grumpy Bear but I...what?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Daria was laughing,
"I had a Grumpy Bear when I was a little girl. I picked him out as a fifth
birthday present."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Even then,
eh," Jane said. "I had Wish Bear. Getting back to the subject, I know that we
thought that the world was screwed up and that we were subjected to daily
torments thanks to the brain dead drones that were our classmates but
all-in-all, I'd have to say that you had it good. You had no reason not to be
happy." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"So why wasn't
I?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"I don't
know, Daria. You tell me," Jane retorted. "I cannot know your heart, remember?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"I was not happy
because I did not know how to be happy," Daria said as if it were the most
obvious thing in the world. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Jane stared
at the shorter woman in disbelief. "Daria that makes no sense what so ever. You
don't learn to be happy. You are or you are not. Geez, you geniuses come up
with the strangest ideas."&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"For one
thing, I'm not a genius," Daria said. "Far from it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"That's
what your mother said but I'm not buying it," Jane replied. "C'mon, Amiga, you
were a straight 'A' student in high school and a four-oh student who was on the
dean's list every semester at Raft. If you aren't a genius then what are you?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Someone
who applies herself, someone who knows how to study correctly, someone who has
learned a multitude of problem-solving shortcuts and someone with a very, very
good memory, the last of which is part of what makes me an excellent waitress,
by the way," Daria replied ticking the points off on her fingers. "I have taken
both the Stanford-Binet and the Wechsler. I test above the median but not that
far beyond it. In other words, Grumpy Bear is 'smarter then the average bear' but
not by all that much."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Jane mulled
over what Daria said before shaking her head vigorously. "Okay, that's a
discussion for another day. Let's stick to the topic. So...great, now you have me
confused. I don't even know what to ask."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Daria
smiled raising her face to the sun. "The question would be are you now happy
and the answer is yes I am."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Just
confuse me some more, Daria," Jane emphatically complained. "I mean, you're being
happy is the bomb but why? Because you quit college? Because you became a
waitress? Because you took a vow of celibacy? What? I have tied my stomach up
in a knot over this mess. I keep blaming myself for leaving you in Boston."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Daria
looped her arm around Jane's. "I have told you before that you had nothing to
do with it. Please, believe me."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"I believe
you, mostly" Jane replied. "Still there's some guilt. Just, you know, would've,
could've, should've."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"There is
no reason for you to feel that way. To sound perfectly trite and fatalistic,
things happen for a reason," Daria said. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"I'm more
of the school of thought that sh...stuff happens," Jane said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Daria
chuckled. "I'm going to take a wild flyer and say that Ryan doesn't like
profanity."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"No, he
doesn't," Jane acknowledged. "I've been working on cleaning up my language. I'd
really like to become the woman he thinks I am."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"You
probably are already, Jane," Daria said. "Ryan gives me the impression of being
a solid man who knows what he's about. I'm sure that he sees you warts, webbed
toes, and all and still loves you."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Yeah,"
Jane agreed. "I don't know what he sees in me but I wake up every morning
thanking my lucky stars. I can't believe that I am married to such a great guy."
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"You know,
there are days now that I actually believe in God and that he truly cares for
us. I know that all the crap is still with us but there is a lot of good and even
cause for hope. Things work out in such a wonderfully mysterious manner."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Such as me
and Ryan, you mean?" asked Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"I was
thinking on a bit grander scale but yes," Daria replied. "Look at the winding
road that brought the two of you together. You did not want to go to college
yet you did."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Only
because you badgered me incessantly," Jane laughed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"You're
very welcome," Daria laughed in return. "But then you get to BFAC only to find
that you did not like it there."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"It wasn't
a good fit," Jane replied. "Too many of the professors were like the
self-absorbed idiots I met at that summer art program that I went to." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Daria
nodded. "But instead of quitting completely, you transferred to Hudson Valley
Institute. Fate, serendipity, hand of God, call it what you will.&nbsp; You bounced
from Maryland to Massachusetts to New York, earning your BFA and getting
married in the bargain to a man that you would have never met if you hadn't made
specific decisions."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Ryan was
saying the same thing when he dropped me off at your house," Jane said. "Looking
at it that way, it does give you a sense of wonder."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"<i>Had it
been another day</i>," Daria sang. "<i>I've might have looked the other way and
I'd never been aware."</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Jane
laughed uproariously. "Daria, in the past few minutes you have managed to quote
the Beatles and Yogi Bear. I have really missed you."&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"I've
missed you too," Daria said almost timidly. "And I want to be a part of your
life again, if you will let me. I think that I can now be the sort of friend
you deserve."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Jane
frowned, the humor ebbing from her features. "Daria, of course, I want you as
my friend. Why would you think otherwise?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Because I have
never been a good friend to you," Daria dejectedly replied. "I never supported
you. I carped when you joined the track team. I whined when you got boyfriends.
I rubbed it in your face when Tom dumped you for me. I bitched when you
transferred from BFAC. I treated you as if your only purpose in life was to
catch the pearls that flowed from my mouth. I can't undo any of that. I can only
apologize and try to be better in the future."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Jane was
taken aback. She knew that Daria held everybody up to a very high standard,
herself most of all but never knew that Daria was that hard on herself, that
she viewed herself through the harshest of lenses, subscribing her actions to
the most unflattering interpretation possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Okay,
again, that's something I am going to put on the back burner," Jane said. "No, no,
I'm not. Look Daria; in whatever way you might feel that you have wronged me in
the past, forget about it. I forgive you. Let's get on with our lives."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>&nbsp;"Thank
you," Daria said with naked gratitude as her eyes immediately misted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Please,
Daria," Jane pleaded. "Don't cry on me. It would shatter too many images and
probably destroy the time-space continuum. Just explain Millie's Diner."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Daria
shakily chuckled as she swiped at her tears with the back of her hand. "Have
you ever read any of Spider Robinson's Callahan's Saloon stories?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Yes, I
have," Jane said. "But I'm surprised that you know them."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"More
secrets," Daria quipped. "Anyway, as you know, in the stories, people were
drawn to Callahan's because they needed to be there. They needed the support
that Callahan's could give them."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"So Millie
is a time-traveling proprietor of a bistro sent here to heal the tortured souls
of Lawndale?" Jane quipped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"No but I
did find the key I needed to be happy there when ironically all I was doing was
looking for a job, any job, to get me out of the house and away from Mom's
constant questions for a few hours a day," Daria said seriously. "I started
running daily for the same reason."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"After the
way this conversation has gone, I know that this answer is going to be weird,"
Jane said. "But pray tell, Daria, how did Millie's help you?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"I learned
the value of people."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Jane
narrowed her eyes in thought. "Okay, the value of people," she said slowly. "Daria,
you're a waitress. You must deal with dozens of jerks every day. If anything, I
would have thought that your job would have made you even more anti-social."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"For every
jerk I encounter, I met a score of pleasant people," Daria said. "And often,
with the right words, you can bring a jerk around."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"I can
imagine the words you use," Jane chuckled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"No, I'm
never sarcastic with a customer, no matter how rude they might be," Daria
replied. "It's bad business."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"C'mon
Daria, I can't believe that," Jane said. "You never took crap from anyone."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"It is not
about taking crap. Think about it, Jane," Daria replied. "What was my major
motivator in high school?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Bribes,"
Jane said. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Money,
yes. My base pay is not very much," Daria said. "So it did not take me long to
figure out that the better the tips the more money I got. And being friendly
helps get me better tips."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"So the
happy you is just a front to make more money?" asked Jane who failed to keep
the disappointment from her voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"No," Daria
responded. "Often when you begin to do one thing, you end up accomplishing
something else entirely. As I said, I have a very good memory, which gives me a
leg up on most of the staff. I do not get orders wrong which the customers
appreciate. I do not forget the details like water or silverware and I remember
names which goes a long, long way in establishing a good rapport with people."&nbsp;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"All of
that still sounds mercenary," Jane said. "Just a means to an end."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Yes, and
it was. My thinking was that if I was going to be a waitress, I was going to be
the best. I was going to have every customer in Millie's clamoring to have me
serve them. I wanted every possible dime," Daria admitted. "But an odd
metamorphous took place. As the regulars became more relaxed around me, they
began to talk to me more. Simple things like their jobs, their families, or if the
Ravens would ever get a decent quarterback. In the beginning, I would smile and
nod and not care yet somewhere down the line, I found myself looking forward to
certain customers coming in. People that I would have passed by without a
second glance just a short time earlier, I discovered were interesting."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"As it
dawned on me that I liked talking to people, I began trying to expand that
pool. I tried to draw out more and more customers. Often I got a 'just take my
order, missy' but far more often I found that people were willing even eager to
talk to me. Some were naturally sociable types but many of them were truly
lonely people, disconnected souls who appreciated that someone, even if it was only
a lowly waitress acknowledged their existent and treated them as if they had
some worth after all. With a simple hello, a smile and a sincere 'how are you'
I could make someone feel better and it would flow back to me ten-fold. &nbsp;The
upstart is that I woke up a few months ago and realized that I was happy."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Just
because you talk to people?" Jane asked skeptically.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"No, by bonding
with them," Daria said. "By sharing myself as they gave me a part of
themselves." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Daria, I'm
sorry but that sounds too much like O'Neil's warm and fuzzy pop psychology,"
Jane said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"An old
adage of business is that the world's greatest product can be sabotaged by poor
marketing," Daria chuckled. "O'Neil is a perfect example of that. He couldn't
sell sunscreen at a nudist colony. He made himself so unappealing to his target
demographic that his message was rejected by extension."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"You're not
saying he was right, are you?" asked Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"I'm going
to say that he was not entirely wrong," Daria replied after a moment. "Much of
what he espoused was banal pap, feel-good utopian nonsense that was completely
divorced from the realities of life."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Think he
was a Care Bears fan too?" Jane joked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"It would
not surprise me."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Love-A-Lot
Bear?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Tenderheart,"
Daria said. "However, that not withstanding, he was right in that my
anti-social attitude was not good for me. It did ultimately make me very
miserable. Where he failed in reaching me was in his championing the notion
that socialization meant conformity."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Gee, why
didn't you go for that?" quipped Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>&nbsp;"Really
when you look at it, most of us are by and large conformers," Daria replied.
"We adhere to the social contract and expected mores but with the exception of
the O'Neils of the world we like to retain at least a vestige of individuality.
We don't want to be faceless goose steppers parading before Big Brother but
working at Millie's, I've learned that joining the community does not mean I sacrifice
my distinctiveness." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>&nbsp;"Hey, maybe
Mr. O'Neil should become a waiter at Millie's," Jane said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"He would
be a terrible waiter," Daria said. "He doesn't listen."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Listening
is the big thing?" Jane asked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>&nbsp;"Listening,"
Daria replied. "Eye contact. Smiling. Maybe flirting a little."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Flirting? You?"
exclaimed Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Yes, me,"
Daria snapped. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Please,
please, please tell me that you never flirted with Mr. DeMartino," Jane begged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"No, that
would have been awkward for the both of us," replied Daria. "But I did
introduce him to Donna. They're getting married next month. She's asked me to
be her maid-of-honour."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Matchmaking,
too," Jane exclaimed. "That's it. You are an alien who has taken the place of
the girl I knew. Where have you hidden her, intergalactic fiend?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"I did not
hide her. I pray to God that I've truly buried her," Daria replied passionately.
"I don't want to go back to being that miserable again. I don't think that I
could handle it now." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>&nbsp; Jane slid
her arms around Daria and hugged her close to her. She always knew that Daria's
cynicism hid a lot of pain. "I don't want you to be unhappy either. Damn, this
puts me in a difficult position."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Daria clung
to her for a few more seconds before breaking apart. "How so?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>&nbsp;"I was
going to try to talk you into quitting," Jane replied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Why?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"There's no
way to say this without coming across as condescending," Jane began
uncomfortably as she resumed walking. Daria had to pick up her pace to keep
abreast of her. "But I think that you are wasting your life, your intelligence
and your talent by being a waitress but if that's what keeps you happy then by
all means, stay a waitress."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"You've
missed the point, Jane," Daria said. "It is the lessons of humanity, the
ability to accept people in an attitude of openness, patience, tolerance, and
forgiveness, all of the facets of kindness that I learned on the job that are
important, not the job itself."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"So then
why are still at Millie's?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"I won't be
after the summer is over," Daria said. "I am quitting in August. I'm resuming
my studies."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Back to
Raft?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"No," Daria
replied with a shake of her head. "I'm transferring to Maryland State University."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Why
there?" asked Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"It's not
too far from Lawndale for one thing," Daria said. "I no longer wish a great
distance between me and my parents, literally or figuratively. For another
thing, MSU offers a Technical Writing minor. That will give me a marketable
skill to complement my English degree. Furthermore, Quinn is at Potomac Basin University which is only fifteen miles from the MSU campus."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Trying to
rebuild some burnt bridges," Jane guessed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Quinn and
I made our peace a while back," Daria said. "It's just that I would like to be
near enough to her where I can conveniently spent some time with her. Our
interests are too different for us to hang out together all that much but being
able to have lunch or dinner with Quinn a couple of times a week does have an
appeal for me."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"I'm glad
to see the two of you friendly," Jane said. "I never was close to my sisters. I
always felt that I missed out on something important because of that." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Daria
nodded. "And I'll come up to New York as often as I can."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"No need,"
Jane said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Daria
stopped dead in her tracks. She opened her mouth several times but no words
would come out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Jane
laughed. "Daria, you look like a goldfish out of water. When I said 'no need', what
I meant was that it won't be necessary. Ryan and I are moving back here. We are
buying a farm outside of town on the road to Oakdale."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Really?"
Daria exclaimed. "But why? I was sure that you two would stay in New York."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"The only
reason we were still there was that Ryan wanted me to finish my degree,"
explained Jane. "His family which, with his parents dead, means a couple of
aunts and some cousins have let Ryan know in no uncertain terms that they think
that I am nothing but a gold digging tart that he was a damn fool for marrying
especially without a prenup. They call me a hippie a lot for some odd reason."&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"I'm
sorry," replied Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Don't be,"
Jane said. "Ryan knows that I love him and that I didn't know how rich he was
before we tied the knot. I don't like to see families break apart but none of
them are worth losing a moment's sleep over."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"So when
will you be back?" Daria asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"A couple
of weeks," replied Jane. "A month on the outside. Yes, soon the terrible
twosome will be terrorizing Lawndale once again, at least for one last summer.
What do you think about that?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>Daria shook
her head slowly. "I don't do how wealthy you are now..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Amiga, I
didn't think that they used that many zeros this side of the national debt,"
Jane said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>"Good,"
Daria smiled. "But right now, I feel like the richest woman in the world."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;border:none;padding:0in'>&nbsp;</p>
