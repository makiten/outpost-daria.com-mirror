<P><B>Synopsis:</B> I dislike Trent/Daria relationshipper stories. So naturally,
I decided to write one.</P>

<P>
<HR width="100%"></P>

<P>Daria woke up. She slowly turned from her side to a more comfortable
position on her back. In doing so, she groaned with the realization that
her spine had become a grotesque bulb of intertwined knots. This happened
every time she slept over at Jane's house. She was no good at sleeping
on floors.</P>

<P>Slowly sitting upright, Daria stretched in a painful attempt to loosen
her abused muscles. An inflatable mattress would be nice. She was sure
she had thought that last time she was here, also. Doubtful that she would
remember by tomorrow.</P>

<P>Finally, Daria stood up and looked over at Jane's bed. The sheet's were
incredibly twisted, and kicked into a pitiful position near the foot of
the bed. Jane always seemed to sleep restlessly. But Jane was not present.
Daria squinted, noticing that there was a piece of paper on the empty bed.
Turning around and searching the room a couple times, Daria finally remembered
where she had placed her glasses for the night, and went to retrieve them.</P>

<P>Oh, that's right. The world has detail. Daria was always amused when
she woke up to a room that seemed to be a smeared oil painting. You would
have thought the novelty of glasses would wear off eventually, but Daria
was still at least mildly impressed with them. After putting on her sight,
she turned to approach Jane's bed a second time. Calmly, she picked up
the note and read.</P>

<P>'Hey Daria. It's about 7:00 right now. I went running. You might want
to go down and get some food before it gets too late; Trent and the band
are going to be rehearsing here this morning, which usually involves clearing
the kitchen of all vaguely edible material. By the way, you snore like
hell. - Jane'</P>

<P>It was seven thirty now, according to the small clock on Jane's dresser.
She had slept in later than she normally did. Daria glanced over at the
bed once more, and observed a large wet spot. Daria smirked mentally. She
didn't snore, just breathed loudly. But at least she didn't drool on her
pillow. Her waking mind was interrupted from this half thought by the sudden
atrocity of a distorted guitar being tuned. In the kitchen. </P>

<P>Daria sat down on the corner of Jane's bed. Trent would be down there,
sitting with his guitar and talking to the other members of his band while
they gorged. Trent was down there. She shook her head. Jane always told
her Trent was oblivious, and Daria had certainly not seen anything that
would cause her to question this statement. Still, Trent.</P>

<P>Standing up, Daria looked in the cracked mirror laying in one corner
of Jane's art heaps. Well, she certainly looked attractive this morning.
Her hair was tangled to hell, she was wearing the creased and unwashed
blue shirt and yellow boxers she always wore to bed. No doubt that Trent
would find that appealing, she thought sarcastically. She berated herself
for this. Trent wouldn't look at her twice, and she knew it.</P>

<P>Walking out of Jane's room at an unsteady trudge, Daria concocted a
quick fantasy for herself. She'd walk into the kitchen, Trent would greet
her in standard Trent form. He would ask if she wanted to hear what they
had been playing, and she would say yes without sounding like a frozen
deer. He would ask what she thought, and-</P>

<P>Damn it, she had to pee. She rerouted herself into the bathroom and
closed the door behind her. Sitting down, her brain took the opportunity
to mock her. How many times had she thought about the word 'Trent' over
the last couple minutes? And why did she like him at all? She was as ditzy
as Quinn. Still, her brain quickly eased its criticism. She even began
dreaming up a new story for her and Trent while urinating.</P>

<P>All thoughts were ripped out of her skull as the bathroom door creaked,
however. Daria whipped her head towards the threatening noise to have her
fear confirmed. Even her brain was too stunned to laugh at her expense.</P>

<P>Trent started to walk in, until he saw Daria. With an expression of
complete surprise and a hoarse noise to match it, he quickly turned around
and shut the door behind him. Daria could hear her heart screaming. She
put her face down into her hands, and could feel it burning with colour.
It almost seemed to be dripping between her fingers.</P>

<P>Nothing more significant than apocalyptic feelings of worthlessness
managed to surface inside of Daria for the next few minutes. Of course
she would look like a fool in front of him. She always did.</P>

<P>Daria did not realize that she had walked outside until she was sitting
down on the stone steps of the back porch. There was a cold breeze in the
air, which contrasted nicely with the heat of shame that engulfed her body.
It was wet outside, it must have rained last night. Daria could feel the
water seeping into her socks and pressing against the flat of her soles.</P>

<P>Slowly, after what seemed like hours but was truthfully minutes, Daria
regained her mental balance. Still, the complete fear that Trent would
laugh at her. Staring at the wet and untrimmed clumps of lawn, Daria seriously
began to question why she cared about Trent so much.</P>

<P>Oh, she found him physically attractive, but it wasn't that. In fact,
that seemed to be a repercussion of her feeling attracted to him, not the
other way around. If she wanted physical, she could have chosen any slab
of meat that stood in front of her, like Jesse. Besides, the furthest she
ever went with her constant daydreams was gratuitous kissing. And maybe
a little bit of groping, she admitted. God, that would be nice. She could
picture herself leaning on a wall in the rain, and Trent pulling her forwards
and raking his hand across her back..</P>

<P>She snapped her mind to attention. That wasn't worth thinking about
now, especially since if he were thinking about her at the moment, it would
likely be in the least romantic way possible. Any human could give her
the reactions she dreamed of. Why did she obsess with Trent? What made
him so desirable? He wasn't perceptive. Realistically, Daria could easily
list every single difference between them and point out why a relationship
would never work. But she still wanted one.</P>

<P>While racking her mind for an answer to the mystery of Trent, Daria
froze, in thought and action. She had sensed the door behind her opening.
She could feel her face burn red once more, because she knew who it had
to be.</P>

<P>Trent sat down next to her, and said nothing. He sat looking out at
the grass, vaguely the same spot Daria had been focusing on. &quot;Hey.&quot;
He finally began. Daria turned to look at him for a moment, then slid her
head the opposite way. Even he would notice how embarrassed she was, with
her face the colour of Jane's jacket. &quot;Hey.&quot; She replied quietly.</P>

<P>Trent turned to look at her. &quot;Sorry for walking in on you, and
stuff. I didn't know you were awake.&quot; Daria looked at him, although
still avoiding eye contact. &quot;I should have remembered to lock the
door. Doesn't this make you think I'm an idiot?&quot; Trent gave a sort
of chuckle that ended in his near choking. Regaining his composure, he
responded. &quot;Naw. I'm in a band, Daria. I've seen a lot worse. In fact,
I see worse almost every week. A couple days ago, we had this gig at the
new pub that opened-&quot; &quot;I get the point.&quot; Daria interjected
hurriedly. &quot;But, um. Thanks.&quot; She finally looked up at him, and
was able to only blush as much as she normally did.</P>

<P>They sat quietly for a minute. Daria felt her desire for Trent grow
with the silence. He could sit here and appreciate a moment with her. Being
able to understand the compassion in silence was very romantic.</P>

<P>&quot;I've been meaning to ask you something.&quot; Trent suddenly decided.
Although he said this in his typical rasping voice, the silence it killed
made it seem twice as loud. Daria sighed. Maybe he hadn't quite grasped
the moment as she had. Still, Daria could not help but tense at his words.
It was doubtful that Trent knew how she felt, and impossible that he would
return the feelings. But this sounded too close to what she wanted him
to say. She must have misheard him somehow. &quot;Um. What?&quot; She muttered
faintly.</P>

<P>&quot;I'm kind of embarrassed to mention it. I don't want you to get
mad.&quot; Trent admitted. Daria could feel her heart escalate to a beating
frenzy. She wanted him to just grab her and kiss. What if she grabbed him?
What if she did, and that wasn't what he meant? No, better to play this
conversation through. She would never do anything that bold, anyway. Daria
opened her mouth, but Trent did not notice, and rolled along with what
he wanted to say.</P>

<P>&quot;I was going through Janie's room, to see if I could borrow some
money. I came across some papers on her floor, and I read 'em. They were
really good. I asked Janie, and she said you wrote them. And, um. Mystik
Spyral has a gig in a couple days that we have been trying to write a song
for. Some local record guys are gonna be there. I was wondering if you
could maybe help us change some lyrics around.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria exhaled coldly. Of course, not what she had expected or hoped,
but that would have been unrealistic. Sudden realization washed over her
that a number of her Trent fantasies started inconspicuously like this,
and she gathered up her hopes. &quot;Sure. I'd be happy to. But I'm going
to be honest about what needs to change.&quot; She said. Truthfully, their
lyrics were terrible. It would be hard not tell them to botch the entire
song. Trent nodded. &quot;Constructive criticism, cool.&quot; With that,
he stood up, and walked back towards the kitchen without waiting to see
if Daria followed him.</P>

<P>Walking towards the kitchen, Daria had a slight bit of realization wash
over her. The reason she felt romantic lust for Trent. He was the only
person she could think of who viewed her with honest neutrality, and respected
her, for her intelligence and personality. Jane was different. Jane was
more of a trusted and loved accomplice. But to Trent, She was not a close
friend. She was just someone his kid sister tended to hang out with. She
would be all too easy to ignore and forget. But Trent didn't. He listened
to what she said with an open mind. He respected her thoughts in a way
nobody at Lawndale High did. Not even her parents. She had a thick desire
for Trent to validate her, because he already did to a point. Daria felt
very ambivalent towards admitting this to herself.</P>

<P>Daria walked into the kitchen and sat down at the table, beside Max,
who was already arguing with Trent. Nick and Jesse were raiding the fridge
savagely. &quot;Alright, fine! I'll let her read it. But if I don't like
what she comes up with, no changes!&quot; Max whined. Trent gave an irritated
nod. Reluctantly, Max handed a crumpled sheet of notebook paper to Daria.
She looked at them both with an expression of slight surprise at being
put on the spot so quickly, but then glanced down to the piece of paper
and read it aloud.</P>

<P>&quot;My heart is as cold as a left over steak. Sitting on the counter
for you to take. But you cut off a piece and you take a big bite. And even
though it hurts, it'll be all right. But then you moved on, and you throw
me down the sink. Trading me for a piece of cake, whose frosting was pink.
And oh, what can I say except this disposer really hurts? I guess that
I'm getting my, just desserts.&quot;</P>

<P>God, what had she gotten herself into? Daria looked up to see Max eagerly
waiting for appraisal, while trying to look like he didn't care what she
said. Trent just waited. Well, she said she was going to give some constructive
criticism. But she didn't want to blow the entire thing out of the water.
It was their song. Sadly. </P>

<P>&quot;Well.&quot; Dare began cautiously. &quot;One thing you may want
to change is the fact that you jump between past and present tense. It
should be 'threw', not 'throw'. And if that is in past tense, it really
doesn't make sense to have the previous lines any other way. Also, It's
really obvious you used the word 'pink' because you couldn't come up with
anything else to rhyme with 'sink'. You might want to alter those lines.
Otherwise, it's fine.&quot; She finished, blatantly lying about it being
fine. How the hell did the last line even fit into it?</P>

<P>Max stood up, outraged. &quot;I'm not going to let some high school
kid tell me how to write music! It's a form of expression! The.. tenses
are different on purpose to, um. Signify that we don't really know where
we are! In life!&quot; Trent looked up at Max, with a look of confusion
slowly crossing his face. &quot;Wait, what?&quot; &quot;No deal, Trent!
I'm not changing my lyrics!&quot; Max seethed as he stormed off. Trent
stood up, and gave Daria an extended shrug. &quot;I think that pink cake
thing was supposed to symbolize that she left him for some other girl.
Thanks for trying, though.&quot; With that, he walked off to find Max.
Nick and Jesse looked up, and then followed Trent and Max, carrying as
much food as possible.</P>

<P>Daria sat for a couple minutes, looking at nothing in particular. That
hadn't gone exactly as she had thought it would, fortunately. Unfortunately,
it hadn't gone as well as she had wished it could have. Still, Daria finally
accepted everything that had and hadn't happened. This was real life, not
some crappy romance novel where two people as different as her and Trent
would magically confess their true love for each other and have perfect
sex for all of eternity.</P>

<P>Smirking at that thought, Daria got up and allowed her mind to finally
wander off of the topic of Trentism and think about food. She opened the
hollowed corpse of the fridge, and picked its bones for any meat Nick and
Jesse may have overlooked. With a carton of orange juice and a piece of
cold pizza, Daria sat back down at the table and ate.</P>

<P>She was finishing up her slice of pizza when the front door opened.
Jane walked into the room wearing a white tank top and black running shorts.
&quot;Yo. The band done 'practicing' already?&quot; She greeted and asked,
sitting down next to Daria. Still eating, she directed Jane's eyes towards
the sheet Max had left on the table. She picked it up and began reading,
then set it down with a look of mock pain. &quot;Sorry to leave you in
the lions den.&quot; She said. Looking at Daria, who was drinking down
the last remnants of juice from the carton. &quot;How was running?&quot;
Daria inquired.</P>

<P>&quot;Same old. What time is it now, seven forty five? A pretty good
length run, if I do say so myself.&quot; Trent walked back into the room,
and gave a nod to Jane. &quot;Hey, Janie.&quot; Standing up and moving
to the fridge, Jane turned back around with a glass of milk that had been
already poured and left half drunk. &quot;So, did any good Kodak moments
occur while I was away?&quot; Daria blushed rather heatedly and mumbled
'no' in unison with Trent. From the corner of her eye, she could see him
scratching the back of his head in an embarrassed manner. </P>

<P>Jane stared at both of them, and her eyebrows seemed to be trying to
climb off the top of her head.</P>
