Daria Pie
Author's note: Who was it that said that all good things
must come to an end?  Somehow, the staffers at MTV
must've thought so; after five seasons, they've chosen
to--ugh--cancel one of their best cartoon shows.
Farewell, Daria!! We'll miss you; as such, let's give her
and her bunch the best tribute possible--melding the
Daria universe with Don Mc Clean's immortal
American Pie.....
P.S.:Daria is a trademark of MTV, while American Pie itself is written by
Don Mclean.

Daria:
A long, long time ago, I remember
when I had my Mona Lisa smile.
After Beavis and Butt Head, there
was my show, and boy, my fans
started to grow.
It proved it pays to be a cynic....
for a while....
But 2001 made me shiver
with each show MTV would
deliver
Bad news from the bosses
--we couldn't take the
losses
I don't remember if Stacy cried
when we learned our MTV ratings
did subside
As least we didn't try suicide
the day....our show just....died.
So--

Chorus:
Bye, bye, Ms. Sweet Daria Pie
We made money to act funny
here at ol'  Lawndale High
But it's all over now, so let's
all break down and cry
Sobbing, "It ain't right our show
must now die,
It ain't right our show must
now die."

Daria:
Do your thing, Trent.

Trent:
Mystik Sprial was my fame
even if we would change the name;
for Max, Nick and Jesse told me so
I first met Daria somehow, someway
en route to Alterna Palooza that day
--and maybe dance with Daria so slow.
At first we were smitten to a tee
while Janey took off with Jesse
They found some helpful corn--
and a new band name was born.
Now I'll admit I dress kinda rank
and ride in a van we call The Tank
but we're laughing on the way to
the bank, the day, our show just
died.
And we're singin'--

Chorus (repeat)

Trent:
Go from here, Janey!!

Jane:
Now for six years, I had my arts
and stuff, so why do I feel like
it ain't enough?
For it ain't what it used to be.
There were the murals I made for
the dance party
and Quinn complained they were
bloody
What does she know, when such
stuff don't bother me.....?
So while Sandi was lookin' down,
Quinn went and stole her fashion crown
The Fashion Club was adjourned
and ol' Sandi never returned.
So while Quinn's bunch read Waif
magazine
Kevin and Brittany would act so mean
and Upchuck would play the love machine
the day our show just died.
And he was singin'--

Chorus (repeat)

Brittany:
Sing one, Quinn!!

Quinn:
Helter skelter in Lawndale's swelter
The Fashion Club was in the Cashman's
shelter
But my luck was fallin'  FA--------ST....!!
Our credit cards just wouldn't last
Worse still, the Griffin brothers made a
foward pass--and poor Sandi's laid up
at home, in a cast.
Datin' at Chez Pierre was in bloom,
while a boy band played a romance tune
The three J's got up to dance--
but they never got the chance!!
You see, my folks griped at me for
playin'  the field
Though I begged them, they refused
to yield
So does Tiffany remember what was
revealed the day our show just
died?
And I was singin'--

Chorus (repeat)

Quinn:
OK, Brittany, let's see what you can do

Brittany:
Me and Kevvy were in one place
just two dum dums lost in space
with no brains left to start again.
So come on Mack be nimble, Mack
be quick
Mack kicked, that ol'  pigskin so slick
because, football is my Kevvy's
only friend.
But one time Quinn tried to seduce
my crazy Kevvy who was on the loose
Yet no angel born in Hell
could break my romantic spell
So our romance was still all right
and while the stars lit up the night
me and Kevvy kissed with much delight
the day our show just died.
And we were singin'--

Chorus (repeat)

Jane:
Back to you, Daria.

Daria:
I met Jane Lane, who now had the blues
We tuned in to the Sick Sad World news
but it was canceled for good that day
We went down to the Zen at 4:00
where we heard Trent's band years
before--
but Trent said Mystik Sprial just....
couldn't play....
At Lawndale High, we heard Ms. Li
announce a brand new charity
--but now, not a word is spoken;
Ms. Li's P.A. is broken.
So the show you fans admire the most
just got canceled, and now it's toast.
Sometimes it just don't pay to boast
the day....our show just....died....
But we're still singin'--

Chorus (repeat)

Daria:
And we're still singin'--

All:
Bye, bye, Ms. Sweet Daria Pie
We made money, actin' funny
here at ol'  Lawndale High
But it's over for good, so
let's all break down and cry.
Sobbing, "It ain't right our
show must now die...."

OWARI (THE END)
