<b>Daria, The Hunted</b> by Love Gordon
<br>Seven years after “What is Memory?”, Trent goes searching for his long-lost
<br>girlfriend, Daria Morgendorffer. Several surprises come in the form
of the bounty hunter he
<br>employs…
<p><i>[Hyperlinks are to pictures]</i>
<p><b>Chapter One</b>
<br><b>April 6, 2009</b>
<br>&nbsp;Yes, that’s right. I, Trent Lane, had to hire a bounty hunter
to find Daria. The CIA
<br>manages the country so well, it’s driven private detectives out of
business. But in the
<br>underground, lawless society beneath their feet, you can still find
a bounty hunter or two.
<br>&nbsp;The one I was meeting in this filthy, disgusting pub in a diseased
corner of NYC
<br>was one of the best. D.D. Powers, who’d apparently taken a liberal
dose of Daria’s books,
<br>was a CIA veteran with cunning to match. Sloane had recommended her
to me, after she’d
<br>located one of Quinn’s missing Shi Tzu’s, Pooky.
<br>&nbsp;Quinn. She was Daria’s sister, and Tom Sloane’s wife. But even
she had no idea
<br>where Daria had lit out for when she took herself and suitcase out
of my door, five years
<br>and three months to this day. I’d hired some of the CIA’s best, but
even they didn’t have
<br>what this Powers woman did.
<br>&nbsp;She had the power to control the entire country from her PC.
<br>&nbsp;Or so Sloane said
<br>&nbsp;The door opened. Whoa! That was D.D. Powers. Jesus, you’d think
she was sewn
<br>into <a href="http://www.geocities.com/zer0_gurl/ddpowerz.jpg">that
outfit.</a>
<br>Her long brown hair swished about her shoulders. Despite her glasses,
D.D. was pretty,
<br>almost as beautiful as Daria, until you noticed the gun strapped at
her waist.
<br>&nbsp;“Hey,” she said, slipping into the booth. “Spiky hair. You must
be the guy Sloane
<br>told me about.” She flipped her ID on the table, flashing the CIA mug
shot.
<br>&nbsp;“Yeah.”
<br>&nbsp;“I’m D.D. Powers, call me D. What’s the name?”
<br>&nbsp;“Trent Lane.”
<br>&nbsp;“And your business?”
<br>&nbsp;“I’m searching for a Daria Morgendorffer. Quinn Sloane’s sister.
She walked out
<br>my door five years ago, and took my heart with her.”
<br>&nbsp;“May I ask why you’re searching for her <i>now</i>?” D. asked.
<br>&nbsp;“I’ve <i>been</i> searching for her, without any luck. But according
to Sloane, most ex-
<br>agents don’t have what you have.”
<br>&nbsp;“What would that be, Mr. Lane?”
<br>&nbsp;“Some sort of super computer system, and a good rapport with
the CIA. Why aren’t
<br>you still in the CIA, by the way?”
<br>&nbsp;D. pursed her lips, irritated. “I don’t see as how it’s any of
<i>your</i> business.”
<br>&nbsp;“I’m just curious.”
<br>&nbsp;“I’ve got a kid to take care of. The CIA dragged us to all four
corners of the world.
<br>At least Jimmy doesn’t have to be shot at by Iraqis in America. There’s
plenty of pond
<br>scum to feed the both us here. Bounty hunting pays well.”
<br>&nbsp;“Oh.” She looked awfully young to be a mother. Then again, since
I’m 32, pretty
<br>much everyone looks young these days.
<br>&nbsp;“I’ll look for her. But I can’t promise anything. Who did you
hire previously?”
<br>&nbsp;“McAllister. And Genevieve DuMackie, for a short period of time.”
<br>&nbsp;“Payment?”
<br>&nbsp;“A hundred thousand up front. A million if you find her.”
<br>&nbsp;“A million?”
<br>&nbsp;“A million.”
<br>&nbsp;“I’ll see what I can do.” As D. glided out of the disreputable
pub, I watched my last
<br>speck of hope follow her. She seemed able. And there was something
familiar about her, as
<br>well.
<br>*****
<br><b>April 7, 2009</b>
<br>&nbsp;She’d just left the pub. Checking her watch, she found it was
after one in the
<br>morning. <i>Oh well</i>, she thought, <i>Jimmy’s staying with Ani tonight
anyway</i>.
<br>&nbsp;She couldn’t believe she’d had the nerve. Working with Sloane,
Quinn had never
<br>seen her, but even so, she was taking a risk. But Trent hadn’t recognized
her. <i>Makeup</i>
<br><i>helps</i>, she mused. Even though Ani was busy with her two kids,
Molly and Ralph, these
<br>days, it was actually quite informative and helpful to have the Chairwoman
of the USA for
<br>a friend.
<br>&nbsp;Maybe she should have given up when she walked in the pub. Only
a few people in
<br>the CIA, as well as her publishers, knew Daria was still alive, after
all. She hadn’t seen Trent or
<br>Jane in years. It hurt. And she knew she should surrender. No use holding
grudges, after all.
<br>&nbsp;But he didn’t recognize her. And he hadn’t known she was pregnant
when she and a
<br>suitcase boarded a city bus, away from their apartment. Then again,
neither had she, but she
<br>still didn’t have to reveal herself if she didn’t want to.
<br>&nbsp;But Jimmy… oh, hell.
<br><i>&nbsp;By the end of the week</i>, Daria promised herself, I’ll tell
him. <i>After all, she had until April</i>
<br><i>13th.</i>
<p><b>Chapter Two</b>
<br><b>April 8, 2009</b>
<br>&nbsp;Two days later, D. called me.
<br>&nbsp;“Yo, Lane?” said the voice on the other end of the phone. It
was six in the morning.
<br>&nbsp;“Jesus Christ, D., what the hell are you doing calling me at
this hour?”
<br>&nbsp;“Shut up. Listen, I’ve got to run, but meet me at Monty’s on
4th Street at 6 pm. I’ve
<br>got a lead.”
<br>&nbsp;After that, I couldn’t get back to sleep. Maybe… Not in all the
time I’d worked
<br>with McAllister had he ever called me with a lead. I made myself some
scrambled eggs
<br>and sat down to the paper.
<br>&nbsp;Daria had just released another book. I sighed. I knew that she
must be alive, from
<br>reading them, but in all other ways she seemed to have vanished. I
looked at the picture of
<br>her, taken five years ago. She’d probably look a lot like D., today.
Maybe she’d even
<br>married and had a kid like D. How should I know?
<br>&nbsp;If only we hadn’t had that stupid fight over the CIA. They’d
offered her a position. I
<br>didn’t want her to go. It was so dangerous, for a man or a woman. Maybe
she had gone.
<br>Maybe she wasn’t coming back, and all these manuscripts were published
posthumously.
<br>Like I said, how should I know? I hadn’t seen her in five years.
<br>&nbsp;And all these maybes and ifs weren’t going to changed that.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>*****
<p>&nbsp;“So”, she said in conclusion. “I’ve got several leads to follow
up. I think I may
<br>have located her apartment.”
<br>&nbsp;“Brava,” said Trent. “Listen, D., could you- if she doesn’t want
to see me, could
<br>you give her a letter?”
<br>&nbsp;“Look, Lane, I don’t think we’re in any danger of finding her
right away. I’ll give
<br>you a call if and when I do find her, and you can talk to her. Don’t
screw with my job,
<br>‘kay?”
<br>&nbsp;He sighed, running his fingers through his hair.
<br>&nbsp;"Yeah, yeah, whatever. Just find her. I don’t care how much it
costs or how you do
<br>it, just find her, and tell her I love her, okay?”
<br>&nbsp;It was hard to believe that she was keeping a secret from this
man. He loved her.
<br>But… she didn’t want tell him, for some reason. <i>Why am I so frightened?</i>
she asked
<br>herself.<i> I am D., I am Daria. No matter what, I will always be myself.
No one can take</i>
<br><i>that away from me.</i><b></b>
<p><b>Chapter Three</b>
<br><b>April 8, 2009</b>
<br>&nbsp;Why was I so angry with D.? I didn’t know. All I knew was that,
if she didn’t find
<br>Daria soon, I might throw her out of a window. She seemed so… unfeeling,
I guess. It was
<br>almost as if she didn’t care if Daria was found or not.
<br>&nbsp;Even working with that incompetent asswipe, Genevieve DuMackie,
was better.
<br>Genevieve was always perky, talking about her husband, their five kids,
their dog… even
<br>though she’d made no progress since I’d hired her. The most I’d been
able to pry out of D.
<br>was that she had a son named Jimmy. How’s that for verbose?
<br>&nbsp;A fax came through early that afternoon.
<p><i>&nbsp;Lane-</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;Talked w/ ex-landlord. Remembers her, roommate, okay. Says,
Soho? Checked</i>
<br><i>that out. Dead end. CIA registers a Daria D. Morgendorffer two weeks
after move-out</i>
<br><i>date, in December 2004. Stationed in Iraq, 2005-2006. I remember
her from Iraq,</i>
<br><i>actually. One dependent, as of August 2004.&nbsp; She left when
her four-year contract ended,</i>
<br><i>in 2008. Current whereabouts unknown.</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;-D.</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;You can reach me by phone- killerboots969, or email- powers@missanarchy.org</i>
<p>&nbsp;<i>Roommate?</i>
<br>&nbsp;That was the first thing that registered in my mind.
<br>&nbsp;Then-
<br>&nbsp;<i>Dependent???</i>
<br>&nbsp;I'm no English major, as Daria had once been, but I had a pretty
good idea of what
<br>that meant. Just to be sure, I looked it up in a dictionary, if that
could somehow make it
<br>more real.<i></i>
<p><i>&nbsp;<b>dependent</b><u> adj.</u> 1: not independent; "dependent
children" [ant: independent]</i>
<p>&nbsp;I remembered, in the week before our long-ago fight, Daria had
had a terrible case
<br>of what I thought was the flu, waking up each morning and throwing
up until there wasn't
<br>anything left to come up. Truthfully, I didn't think she had known
when she walked out the
<br>door. She had a baby, my Daria, all by herself. I only wished that
I could have been with
<br>her. And now I had a child, a Molly or Jimmy all my own. It was so
hard to comprehend. In
<br>the space of days a long undiscovered truth came to light before my
eyes.
<br>&nbsp;Roomate? Probably one of Daria's New York friends or something.
Oddly, she'd
<br>made many, on all levels of society, since she'd moved the Big Apple
in late 2000.
<br>&nbsp;I picked up the phone. Janey, I had to call Janey. But before
I could dial the once
<br>familiar number of her Maine retreat, I replaced the reciever. Sadly,
we'd grown apart
<br>over the years, living in different states, without Daria to keep us
all together. When I found
<br>Daria, I hoped, we would all be as close as we had been ten years before,
when Janey and
<br>Daria were in high school.
<br>&nbsp;Then I picked up the phone again.
<br><i>&nbsp;k.. i.. l.. l.. e.. r.. b.. o.. o.. t.. s.. 9.. 6.. 9&nbsp;
</i>I dialed.
<br>&nbsp;*****
<br>&nbsp;Jimmy was peacefully coloring in his coloring book, she was working
on a new
<br>novel, and the stove was patiently bringing a kettle of water to boil.
When the kettle started
<br>to screech, she poured the water into two cups, one with cocoa mix,
for her son, and one
<br>with a tea bag, for herself. After it had brewed, she sipped the scalding
tea warily as she
<br>sat in front of her computer.
<br>&nbsp;The phone rang, shattering the peaceful silence.
<br>&nbsp;"I'll get it, Mommy!" yelped her son.
<br>&nbsp;Before she could move, he'd answered the phone. "Hi, this is
Jimmy. Who would
<br>you like to speak to?"
<br>&nbsp;Apparently it was her, for he handed the phone to his mother,
grabbed his cocoa,
<br>and was back to his coloring book in the nezt room.
<br>&nbsp;"Hello?" she said.
<br>&nbsp;"Daria?" It was Jane.
<br>&nbsp;"How... how did you get this number?" They hadn't spoken since
Iraq. She'd been
<br>suddenly transferred to England on a reconnaisance mission, Jane had
moved, and they'd
<br>lost touch. She was surprised at how happy she was to hear her friend's
voice.
<br>&nbsp;"Ani. I heard that Trent had hired a bounty hunter to find you,
and I wanted to warn
<br>you. If you're still angry with him."
<br>&nbsp;Laughing, she replied, "Jane, do you know what I do for a living
now?"
<br>&nbsp;"Are you some kind of pole dancer or something?"
<br>&nbsp;"No, I'm a bounty hunter. He hired <i>me</i> to find me."
<br>&nbsp;"You're kidding!"
<br>&nbsp;"No, absolutely serious."
<br>&nbsp;"So what are you going to do? I mean, I thought you <i>hated</i>
him."
<br>&nbsp;"Iraq... Iraq changed a lot of things. My only good friend over
there, Bull Schitt,
<br>was killed by the sniper that almost got Jimmy. I have different priorities
now. I want
<br>Jimmy to be able to go to kindergarten, to live past his fifth birthday.
Two years ago, there
<br>was a large chance that neither of us might see that day. I want him
to have a dad."
<br>&nbsp;"But do you..."
<br>&nbsp;"Still want Trent?" Daria blushed. That hadn't come out as she'd
intended. "Um,
<br>yeah. It was just me making a mountain out of molehill, and I'm actually
kind of
<br>embarrassed about the whole thing..."
<br>&nbsp;"I'm coming down to New York tomorrow. Can you meet me at the
old meeting
<br>place? At three?"
<br>&nbsp;"It'll be my pleasure."
<br>&nbsp;*****
<br>&nbsp;However, the line was busy.<b></b>
<p><b>Chapter Four</b>
<br><b>April 9, 2009</b>
<br>&nbsp;The two women standing outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art
saw each other,
<br>ran, and embraced. A little boy clung at the shorter woman's skirts,
and the taller woman,
<br>who had black hair, bent down and picked him up. They went into the
museum.
<br>&nbsp;They were standing in the spot where Daria, Jane, and I used
to meet for our
<br>Saturday routine of a museum and coffee. Over five years had passed
since I had seen her
<br>and Jane there, waiting for me.
<br>&nbsp;How could I have been so blind? As if the fact that D. was beautiful,
her wardrobe
<br>for hunting was skintight, and her hair was a few shades lighter could
disguise her.
<br>Watching her walk in the Indian skirt, her long hair hanging at her
shoulders, my sister
<br>carrying our son, I knew. That was Daria. And that was our son, our
Jimmy.
<br>&nbsp;I was lucky to have passed by, I felt. But somehow, I knew it
was more than luck; it
<br>was fate.
<br>&nbsp;Somewhile later, they emerged. My sister sat down on the steps,
and Daria stood
<br>outside the museum, the skirt whipping about her ankles, as I walked
up to her. She was
<br>holding the little boy with black hair, who was fast asleep.
<br>&nbsp;“D.?” I said hesitantly.
<br>&nbsp;“It’s still Daria,” she said.
<br>&nbsp;Jimmy woke up.
<br>&nbsp;“Mommy? Who’s this?” he asked.
<br>&nbsp;“This is Daddy, Jimmy.”
<br>&nbsp;My son held out his arms, and I gave Jimmy a hug.
<p>THE END
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>This is pretty weird, even for me. The kind of thing where you just
shrug, and go
<br>“interesting.” But I wanted to explore the future with Daria, and to
tell the truth, I couldn’t
<br>see her as anything other than a bounty hunter. Sort of an Mrs. Peel/Dark
Angel hybrid.
<br>So, if you liked it, or thought it sucked, please review? even if you
were entirely apathetic
<br>on the whole? please?
<p>Look for a prequel to this explaining the mysterious roommate, as well
as other things,
<br>sometime soon.
