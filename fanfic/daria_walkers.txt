This story is based on the Beavis and Butthead Episode 'Walkathon'. I believe Mike Judge
wrote it, but I am not sure. All the scenes with Beavis and Butthead are taken entirely
from this episode. I wrote in extra scenes centering on the Morgendorffer family.

Scene 1: Morgendorffer household.
JAKE and DARIA are reading the paper, HELEN and QUINN are running around.

QUINN
Where is my blue belly shirt?

HELEN
The laundry shrinked it, so I put it aside. Could you please hurry up, Jake?  We have got
to go. I have to drop off my car at the garage and I need you drop me off at the office.

QUINN
That shirt is SUPPOSED to shrink.

DARIA
It's supposed to be worn under the skin.

HELEN
I don't have time to get it right now. Jake, can you PLEASE hurry?

JAKE
I can drop you off, but I can't pick you up until 6. I have a meeting with a client this
afternoon. He came up with feather shaped candy, but no one will buy it.

HELEN
But most of the other people in the office are away. You know I hate walking to the
train station.

DARIA
Can't you do it as your power walk?

Helen and Jake glare at Daria

QUINN
Are you going to punish her? If so, can I have some money to buy a new shirt?

HELEN
We aren't going to punish her, and you can't have any money.


Scene 2 (from 'Walkathon'): At School Gym
PRINCIPAL MCVICKER and MR. COBB on stage. Highland High students in audience.

PRINCIPAL MCVICKER
Everybody shut up! And now please give your undivided attention to Mr. Clark Cobb, and
his good friend Socko. Uhhh hh hhhh.

MR COBB
Thank you, young students. I'm Clark Cobb, from Cobb's Family Hardware. Me and Socko
here want to tell you of the Christian Businessman's Annual Charity Case Walkathon.

SOCKO
Mr. Cobb. Is it true that Jesus invented the walkathon, when he walked though onto the
Sea of Galilee?

MR COBB
He He He. That's right Socko. Heh Hee Hee Hee Hee.

STEWART
Ha Ha Ha. Socko's great!

BUTTHEAD
Huh Huh Huh. Socko's got a hand up his butt.

BEAVIS
He He Ha He He He. Yeah!. He He.


Scene 3: Morgendorffer home
Dinnertime, JAKE and DARIA at table reading newspapers, QUINN talking on the phone.

HELEN
Anything happen at school today?

DARIA
Not much. Mr. Buzzcut yelled at us in class when he couldn't find his whistle. He was
going to make everyone stand at attention until he realized he put it on his desk.

JAKE
How come are our girls going to military school? Why can't we send them to the public schools?

HELEN
Calm down, Jake. Mr. Buzzcut is one of Daria's teachers at Highland High.

JAKE
I still think we should send them to public schools, away from those military teachers.

HELEN
I got a call from Clark Cobb from the Christian Business Association. He told me that he
was at your school talking about their walkathon.

DARIA
I seem to recall a guy in the gym with a sock in his hand. I think the sock was trying to
tell us something.

HELEN
I told him that you girls would be participating.

QUINN
(hangs up phone). Participating! What have you got us doing now?

DARIA
We are doing the Bataan Death March.

HELEN
You girls are doing the Charity Case Walkathon. Mr. Cobb is one of my clients, both for
Cobb Family Hardware, and the Christian Business Association, and he is very prominent
in the Highland Christian community.

DARIA
Since when did we become Christians?

JAKE
Religion is very important. We have to take care of our souls.
(to Helen) Does this mean we have to start going to church on Sundays?

HELEN
(whispers) No, Jake, I told him we're Jews.

QUINN
I can't do this. I don't have the right shoes.

DARIA
You got tons of shoes.

QUINN
But not walkathon shoes. Not only do I have to have shoes that are comfortable, but they
also have to match the new outfit I have to buy. I also need to know it is going be sunny,
since like, that will change the entire color scheme.

DARIA
I need a new pair of shoes, too. I can't have my shoes clash the roadways.

QUINN
Shut up, Daria. You don't understand anything about...

HELEN
Don't start girls. It's settled. Everyone is doing the walkathon on Saturday.

JAKE
Wait. I'm playing golf this Saturday.


Scene 4: Daria and Quinn's bedroom.
QUINN is on the phone while DARIA is reading a book.

QUINN
So we'll do the walkathon together. OK. So how much have you gotten in pledges so far?
That much?  I have about that much myself. OK, I'll see you later. (hangs up)
So Daria, how are you doing on the pledges?

DARIA
You seem all excited about the walkathon. You wanted to do it even less than I did.

QUINN
Well Steve asked me to walk with him. He is SO cute.

DARIA
But what about your other admirers? Mikey and Mark accounted for a good chunk of your
pledge money.

QUINN
They'll be all right. Maybe I'll have someone fill in for me.

DARIA
Well I have not started yet.

QUINN
Don't you think you should get started? The thing is in two days.

DARIA
I might not walk anyway, regardless of what Mom says.

QUINN
Mom will freak! Besides, I don't think you can get anyone to pledge for you anyway.

DARIA
I don't know. I think I can scrounge up some pledges.


Scene 5 (from 'Walkathon'): Outside Maxi Mart
BEAVIS and BUTTHEAD are sitting on curb, drinking their drinks.

BEAVIS
(Guzzling down his drink and sucking his straw loudly). slhhshh shsh shshsshhs.
Maaaaahaahahha! Aaahhh! Ow! Aah. I Got a meettybuttyinmymouth make it stop!! Ow! Ow!

BUTTHEAD
(over BEAVIS). You dumb ass. You gotta to pace yourself.

BEAVIS
Ow! Aaaahhhh! Aaaaaa! Rararraraaaaaaaa! aasaaaa!

DARIA
Hello boys. Ah, learning how to drink from a cup, Beavis?

BEAVIS
Maaa aaaaa aaa rraaa. Shut up!  Diarrhea.  Mmee. He He.

Daria walks over to Beavis and Butthead.

DARIA
How come you guys aren't out collecting pledges for the walkathon?

BUTTHEAD
Ugh. Pledges?

DARIA
The way you raise money in a walkathon is you get people to pledge money for every
mile you walk.
(Blank looks on BEAVIS and BUTTHEAD)
People give you X amount of money if you walk Y number of miles.
(More blank looks)
You get people to pay you to walk.

BUTTHEAD
Cool. Huh Huh. Why didn't you just say so?

DARIA
So. Will you guys pledge for me?

BUTTHEAD
Uhhh. OK. Like uuh how much? Uh Huh.

DARIA
How's a quarter a mile sound?

BUTTHEAD
Uhh Two quarters a mile?

BEAVIS
Seventy five cents.  Huh Huh (Butthead hits him). Aaahh!

BUTTHEAD
I just said that, dumbass.
(to Daria). OK. Uhh A Dollar.

BEAVIS
Ten!

DARIA
(writes in book) Beavis and Butthead - ten dollars a mile. Each.

BUTTHEAD
Hey! Uhh don't you have to, like, have to do something for us now?

DARIA
OK, fair is fair. For every mile you walk, I'll pledge you a nickel for you guys to split.

BUTTHEAD
OK. Huh Huh Huh.

DARIA
Great! See you at the walkathon. (leaves)

(Beavis and Butthead are laughing)

BEAVIS
Um What's so funny?

BUTTHEAD
We just totally ripped her off

BEAVIS
OK. Cool. Huh Huh


Scene 6: At Morgendorffer home.
JAKE is reading a paper and drinking a martini. DARIA walks in.

DARIA
Hi, Dad.

JAKE
Hey, Kiddo. How's the pledge drive?

DARIA
I have two hundred dollars.

JAKE
That's great, Kiddo. I knew you could do it.

QUINN
Two hundred dollars?

DARIA
I got it from two guys. I guess my boyfriends are more generous than your guys.

JAKE
You have boyfriends? When will I get to meet them?

QUINN
Let me see that (takes pledge sheet from Daria). Hey, this is your handwriting, Daria!

DARIA
They have a little trouble using a pen. But they sure came through with the money. See
you later, Quinn. (takes pledge sheet and goes up to bedroom)

QUINN
That's not fair! Daria is older, so the guys in her grade have more money!

Helen gets home and rushes in.

HELEN
I only have an hour, since I have to get back to the office for a meeting.

QUINN
Daria is cheating in her pledge sheet! She wrote in pledges for ten dollars a mile from
two guys she made up, Beaver and Butco!

JAKE
They are her new boyfriends. I told her that we wanted to meet them.

HELEN
Beavis and Butthead are NOT Daria's boyfriends! They are the two boys that she knows
from school. I don't see why she spends any time with them.

JAKE
Oh, those two. They seem like nice boys.

HELEN
Jake, how can you be so completely ignorant about your daughters? I guess I'll just have
to speak to Daria. (leaves)

JAKE
What did I say?


Scene 7: In Daria and Quinn's room.
DARIA is sitting up on her bed, reading a book with the TV on in the background.

HELEN
Daria?

DARIA
Yes?

HELEN
I hear that you got some pledges for the walkathon.

DARIA
The outpouring of support has been overwhelming. People want to make a difference.

HELEN
You know that you won't get any money from those two boys you signed up.

DARIA
I don't know, Mom. Beavis and Butthead did a lot of work on the Wall of Youth last year.
Too bad someone vandalized it.

HELEN
Are you sure they weren't the vandals?

DARIA
Well, you're always saying that we should think the best of the people. I'm thinking
they'll come through this time.

HELEN
(sighs) Well OK, Daria. But I don't think that Mr. Cobb will be too happy if they don't
come through with the money. I hope that you are right (leaves)

DARIA
Don't worry, Mom. They will come though with flying colors.


Scene 8: At starting site of walkathon.
HELEN drops off DARIA and QUINN.

HELEN
Have a good time and good luck girls.

DARIA
We'll make sure to keep hydrated in the hot sun.

Helen drives off. MIKEY and MARK approach QUINN

MIKEY
Hi, Quinn. Can I carry your backpack?

MARK
I'll take it

QUINN
You can carry my water bottle, Mark. Can you guys go fill it up for me?

MARK
Sure, Quinn.

MIKEY and MARK leave.

QUINN
Daria, can you help me find Steve?

DARIA
Find your own boyfriends.

QUINN
But you gotta help me!

DARIA
Isn't that him over there? With that girl in the blue tank top?

QUINN sees them and runs over to STEVE, who is talking with CINDI

QUINN
Steve, you said you would be walking with me!

CINDI
Steve, who is this?

STEVE
Hey, I figured we can all walk together. There is enough of me to go around.

MIKEY and MARK come over

MARK
Quinn, here's your water bottle.

QUINN opens the bottle and pours water on STEVE'S head.


Scene 9 (from 'Walkathon'): At walkathon start site.
MR COBB and SOCKO are up at the podium, kicking off the festivities.

MR COBB
Finally folks, let me say this. Each step you take is like kicking Satan in the keester.
You ready, Socko?

SOCKO
On your mark, get set, go!

(Everyone starts walking)

MR COBB
He He He He.

(Beavis and Butthead are still standing there)

BUTTHEAD
That Sucked!

BEAVIS
Yeah! They didn't even use a gun!

BUTTHEAD
It doesn't matter, dude, since we are going to be rich.

BEAVIS
Yeah! Charity is cool.


Scene 10 (from 'Walkathon'). Along the walkathon route
BEAVIS and BUTTHEAD are lagging behind the crowd.

BEAVIS
This sucks! There are too many people walking!

BUTTHEAD
Yeah! Huh Huh. Let's go this way. (they go off the main drag)


Scene 11: Along the route
QUINN, MIKEY, and MARK are walking toward the back of the pack.

MIKEY
Hey, look behind us! Those two kids are going off the route. Maybe they have a shortcut.

MARK
If they are trying a shortcut, they took the wrong way. That road goes to the warehouses.

QUINN
Maybe we should take a shortcut. These new shoes are pinching my feet.

MIKEY
I think there is a shortcut, about another mile up the road.

QUINN
A MILE? I don't think I can take this much longer!


Scene 12 (from 'Walkathon'): in the industrial section of Highland.
BEAVIS and BUTTHEAD are walking, way off the walking route.

BEAVIS
Walking sucks!

BUTTHEAD
Yeah! I don't understand what all this walking crap has to do with making money.

BEAVIS
Yeah, Really!


Scene 13: At finish line.
DARIA finishes, MR. COBB is there to meet her.

SOCKO
Congratulations, young lady. The Lord has been very kind.

DARIA
I am proud to be walking in the name of Christ.

MR. COBB
You are Daria Morgendorffer, aren't you?

DARIA
Yes, I am.

MR. COBB
You have the most money pledged of anyone. But you only have two people, and those boys
didn't pledge with anyone else.

DARIA
Beavis and Butthead are very spiritual and care deeply about the community. Most people
never look beyond their heavy metal T-shirts and don't see this. They might have pledged
their money with several people, but I was the only one who asked them.

MR. COBB
That's wonderful. I always say the Lord's word gets to everyone, however unlikely it seems.

DARIA
I did make a small pledge to them. They knew that I couldn't match their commitment, but
I insisted on giving them something. But, I don't think that they will ask me for it. Could
you please give this to them? I know they are a few miles behind me.

MR. COBB
Tell you what young lady, I would like to meet these two young men. Why don't you give me
your pledge sheet, and I'll collect the money for you. I think you have done enough of the
Lord's work for one day.

DARIA
Thank you, sir.


Scene 14 (from 'Walkathon'): near 3 mile mark
Another scene of BEAVIS and BUTTHEAD walking.

BUTTHEAD
Uuhh. We must be close to that ten-mile mark by now (they cross the main route at the
3-mile walk)


Scene 15: At finish line.
QUINN, MIKEY, and MARK meet with MR. COBB

MR. COBB
Hey kids. I don't seem to remember you at the five mile checkpoint. I hope you weren't
trying to take a shortcut.

MIKEY
We took a wrong turn

MARK
We walked at least five extra miles.

QUINN
And my feet are killing me!

SOCKO
Jesus says that suffering can be good for the soul.

MARK
So are we finished?

MR. COBB
I'm afraid I can only give you credit for five miles.

QUINN
Fine. We'll just collect for five miles. I'm going home.

MR. COBB
Wait! I am a businessman, and a Christian. As a businessman, I belive in fair trade.
Since you kids did walk ten miles, you should get credit for ten miles. And as a
Christian, I should forgive you for trying to take a shortcut. The Lord always said
to turn the other cheek.

MIKEY
All right!


Scene 16: (from 'Walkathon')
A few more scenes of BEAVIS and BUTTHEAD walking in various places, way off the
walkathon route.

Scene 17: (from Walkathon'): Finish line, nighttime.
MR COBB waits for BEAVIS and BUTTHEAD.

MR COBB
He He. Good job Boys, you made it. Your friend Daria already gave me the fifty cents
she pledged you. So if you ante up the hundred bucks apiece that you pledged her, we'll
be all squared up. You two are fine young people

BUTTHEAD
Uhh. Could you like, give us our money now?

BEAVIS
Yeah! Give us the money!

MR COBB
Don't tell me you boys weren't planning to pay.

BEAVIS
I thought we ripped off Daria, Butthead.

BUTTHEAD
Uhh. Huh Huh Huh.

MR COBB
Boys, when you play the Christian Businessman Association for fools, you play the Lord
for a fool.

BUTTHEAD
Uh, could you like, shut up?

BEAVIS
Yeah!

MR COBB
Now, because I am a Christian, I won't strike you. But, because I am a businessman, I
will see to it that you walk off this pledge at a rate of five cents a mile between you.
Now let me see, that will be four thousand miles. You better get started, boys.

BUTTHEAD
Uh Huh Huh.

BEAVIS
Um Ah, What?


Scene 18: At Morgendorffer house, that evening.

JAKE
Hey girls, how did the walkathon go today?

QUINN
I am never doing another walkathon again! My date blew me off, and my feet are full of
blisters.

DARIA
But our souls have been taken care of.

HELEN
I got a call from Mr. Cobb.

DARIA
And?

HELEN
Your two boys didn't come up with the money.

QUINN
I told you Daria made up those people.

HELEN
He said that it was sad to see a sweet, innocent, impressionable young woman being taken
in by boys willing to take advantage of girls who might not get very much attention from guys.

DARIA
That is a sad sight.

HELEN
I'm talking about you, Daria.

DARIA
Is it any worse than seeing sweet, innocent, impressionable young kids being taken
advantage of by a man prominent in the Christian Community?

HELEN
You knew the boys would not pay up. I just hope Mr. Cobb isn't too upset.

DARIA
Don't worry, I'm sure Mr. Cobb will devise some sort of torture for Beavis and Butthead.
It'll probably more than make up for the money.


Scene 19: Outside. nighttime.
BEAVIS and BUTTHEAD are walking, while MR COBB is driving his car behind them.

BUTTHEAD
If I ever catch that dude who like, invented the walkathon. Huh Huh, I'm gonna kick his ass.

BEAVIS
Yeah! I thought charity was supposed to like, be for free!

MR COBB
How about less talking and more walking, boys. You gonna make sure you finish this job,
even if it takes you until the Second Coming.

BUTTHEAD
Charity Sucks!

BEAVIS
Yeah! Huh Huh.


THE END


Few Quick notes:
I figured that Daria had to deal with her family in Highland. There are a few episodes of
B&B that are suitable, but I think this one is was the most promising. It is known they
shared a bedroom sometime in the past, so I had them do so here. I figured Quinn had her
boyfriends in Highland. I admit that I stole their personalites from Joey, Jeffy, and
Jamie, but they are only there to advance the plot. As to why Beavis and Butthead never
noticed Quinn, she isn't in any of her classes, and she isn't slutty looking. (Actually,
I like to think that Quinn was the girl that Butthead hit on in 'Held Back'. The girl he
hit on looks just enough like Quinn to be a maybe). Hope you like the story.
