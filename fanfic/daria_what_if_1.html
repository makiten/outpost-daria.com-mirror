Daria: [V.O.] five seconds, tops [out loud] one… two… three… four… five.<P>

[XCU Daria, shocked][Pan out.  Daria walks off screen Cut to…]<BR>
[…Daria walking downstairs.  Takes small, oval-shaped glasses and puts them on.]<BR>
[Reverse angle.  We see Joey, Jeffy, and Jamie at open door staring at made over Daria.]<BR>
[Reverse angle to see Daria reaching landing and coming toward open door.]<BR>
Daria:  Sorry, Joey, Jeffy, Jamie.<P>

[Daria’s POV. XCU Jamie]<BR>
Jamie: (interrupting) You got my name right!<P>

[Three J’s POV. XCU Daria]<BR>
Daria:  It’s not that hard of a name to remember.  Anyway, sorry I couldn’t deliver Quinn.<P>

[Daria’s POV.  CU Joey, Jeffy, &amp; Jamie]<BR>
Joey:  That’s okay, Daria.  So, you wanna go to a movie?<BR>
Jeffy:  Maybe we can go to chez pierre.<BR>
Jamie:  I can take you to a Broadway show.<P>

[Three J's POV XCU Daria]<BR>

[INT Pizza King.  Zoom in to Daria and Three J’s talking]<BR>
Joey:  So Daria, would you like some more pizza?<BR>
Jeffy:  I can get you a soda.<BR>
Jamie:  Would you like some twisty-bread?<P>

[CU Jeffy and Jamie]<BR>
Daria:  No thanks, Jamie.<BR>
Jamie:  You got my mane right!  Quinn never gets my name right.<BR>
Jeffy:  So do you have anymore Melody Powers?<BR>
Jamie:  Yeah!  She rocks!<P>

[Cut to CU Daria and Joey]<BR>
Joey:  A lot better than Quinn’s fry poem.<P>

[Daria fishes a piece of paper out of her book bag.  Adlibbed cry of &quot;Me, me&quot; from Jeffy and Jamie.]<BR>
Joey:  My turn to read! (Reading from the piece of paper.)  &quot;When Melody Powers found out she was on her way to Jamaica, she knew she’d have to pack some sun-tan lotion along with her bazooka and howitzer…&quot; [fade out]<P>

<CENTER><I>Scene 3—Daria and Jane walking to school</I></CENTER><P>
[CU side view of Jane and Daria.  Daria is still dressed as Quinn.]<BR>
Jane:  So Quinn didn’t take the bait, I gather?<BR>
Daria:  How did you guess?<P>

[Cut to front view of Daria and Jane.]<BR>
Jane:  Oh, I don’t know.  Maybe it was the makeup that tipped me off.  Or the belly shirt.  Just how long are you going to dress like that?<BR>
Daria:  Until Quinn comes out of it.  Or I gnaw off one of my legs.  Whichever comes first.<P>

[Cut to side view of Daria and Jane]<BR>
[Enter from left, Joey]<BR>

<CENTER><I>Scene 4—Lawndale High</I></CENTER><P>
[Ext. Lawndale High]<BR>
[Int. Lawndale High Highway]<BR>
[We see Daria and Jane on their usual spot on the locker]<BR>
Sandi: (O.S.) Hello!  Like Daria or whatever?<P>

[Pan Left to see Sandi, Stacy and Tiffany.]<BR>
[Pan as they walk until Daria and Jane are on screen with them.]<BR>
Sandi:  You have great fashion sense, and you seem like you’re getting more and more popular.  Could you be the Fashion Club’s, like, Vice President or whatever?<BR>
Daria:  But what about Quinn?<BR>
Sandi:  Quinn who?<BR>
Daria:  I’m sorry, Sandi.  But I wouldn’t make a good vice president.<BR>
Jane:  That’s a relief.<BR>
Daria:  (gesturing at Jane) But here’s someone who’s just perfect for the position.  This is my best friend, Jane.<BR>
Jane:  (surprised and annoyed) Daria!<BR>
Daria:  If I have to go through this, I’m taking you with me.<P>

[Reverse Angle.  Sandi squints at Jane.]<BR>
Sandi:  Ooo, wow!  You’re right, Daria!  She looks really alternative, and we need some new styles.<BR>
Daria:  And a complete lack of ambition on her part.<BR>
Sandi:  Really?<BR>
Jane:  Of course.  I don’t even want the veepee position.<BR>
Sandi:  Well, that’s settled. (to Daria) Now what are we going to do with you?  I don’t want a maverick hanging around.  Are you good at math?<BR>
Daria:  I know two plus two doesn’t equal five.<P>

[Sandi, Stacy, and Tiffany chuckle.]<BR>
Stacy:  Good one, Daria.  Seriously, we need a treasurer, since Tiffany doesn’t want to double with fashion coordinator What do you say?<BR>
Daria:  (sighs) What the hell.<BR>
Tiffany:  Cool.  My widdle noggin’ was getting schloompy.<BR>
Jane:  I bet.<BR>
Sandi:  And that helps cover that brain fad, too.  Thanks, Daria.<BR>

<CENTER><I>Scene 5—After school</I></CENTER><P>
[Cut to Daria and Jane in student parking lot]<BR>
Daria:  I can’t believe this.  Just over some makeup and clothes.<BR>
Jane:  And let’s not forget the cute little oval shaped glasses.  By the way, Trent’s picking us up.<BR>
Daria: (blushing) Trent?<P>

<HR NOSHADE>
<CENTER><I>Scene 6—Trent’s car</I></CENTER><P>
[INT Trent’s car.  All crammed in front seat with Daria in the middle.]<BR>
Jane:  So Trent, what do you think of Daria’s new look?<BR>
Trent: (squirming) Uh… looks okay.<BR>
Daria:  (mutters) thanks.<BR>
Jane:  (nudging Daria) Daria, Give me some elbow room!  Scoot your fat butt over!<P>

[Jane’s angle.  Daria yelps.  Trent turns]<BR>
Daria:  Trent, who’s driving?<P>

[EXT Overhead View:  Trent’s Car Skids]<P>

<CENTER><I>Scene 7—Pizza King</I></CENTER><P>
[EXT. Pizza King]<BR>
[INT. Pizza King:  Booth.  Trent and Jane sitting across from Daria.  Trent is staring at Daria.]<BR>
[XCU of Trent]<BR>
Daria:  Is he catatonic or has he just found a way to sleep with his eyes open?<P>

[Pan out to see Jane waving hand in front of Trent’s face.]<BR>
Jane:  Trent?  Trent?  [to Daria] Hey Daria, can you get us some more sodas?<P>

[Reverse Angle:  Trent’s POV.  Pan to follow Daria walking to counter getting soda and returning.]<BR>
Jane:  Don’t drool on your pizza.<P>

<HR NOSHADE>
<CENTER><I>Scene 8—The courtyard</I></CENTER><P>
Daria:  So I started dressing like Quinn…<BR>
Jane:  …a decision destined to get you thrown into the insane asylum.<BR>
Daria:  …and all of a sudden, people like me.  Trent can’t take his eyes off of me…<BR>
Jane:  Now I’ve got to get the wimp to ask you out.<BR>
Daria:  You’re interrupting my monologue.<BR>
Jane:  I beg your pardon.  Continue.<BR>
Daria:  But the funny thing is, despite my looks, or because of it, I can still act smart and people are okay with it because Quinn turned being smart into a fad.<BR>
Jane:  And the irony is that now she’s the outcast and you’re the popular one.<BR>
Daria:  Brains and honesty—good.  Superficial phoniness—bad.<BR>
Jane:  We win.<BR>
Daria:  I’m on top of the world.<P>

<CENTER><I>The End</I></CENTER>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">PostScript</H2>
Boy, it’s a good thing that it didn’t end this way!  I’d have probably stopped watching if it did.<P>
Oh, you may have noticed that #1 in the title.  All I’m going to say is that I’ve got a lot of ideas about alternate universe Darias.  Sort of like Star Trek.  But I’m not promising (or threatening, depending on your perspective) anything at this time.  TTFN!<P>
