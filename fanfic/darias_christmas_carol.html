&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Several people deserve recognition
for their contributions to the creation of this story. The incomparable
C.E. Forman for graciously allowing me to borrow the character of Daria’s
Great Aunt Eleanor. It would have been a casting nightmare without that
ex-character to draw on. And to (Ann) Diane Long for proofreading services
and invaluable observations. Di’s always been there with a helping hug.
Stave Five is for you, Diane. Also, a warm thank you to the denizens of
Outpost Daria, and all you other Internet dwellers who give me the confidence
and support I need to keep going. Last but not least, I would like to pay
tribute to the singular Mr. Dickens, without whom none of this would have
been possible.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Be sure to check out the notes after
the story for more observations on the text. As always, feedback is greatly
appreciated.</FONT>

<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">INTRODUCTION</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">I have always loved Charles Dickens’
“A Christmas Carol.” I have since childhood, when I was both enthralled
and terrified by the Disney adaptation. Now, more than a decade later,
I’m still fascinated by the complexities of this tale.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Most of us have probably been exposed
to this story in one form or another. There have been countless television
and movie adaptations, ranging from Disney animation to The Muppets. However,
I’m willing to wager that few of us have ever bothered to read the book.
What Dickens brings out more than any filmed version is an inherent darkness.
Like Dante, Scrooge must weather the black recesses of his own soul before
he can begin his acts of self-improvement.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Therein lies the universality of
the tale. What many fail to realize is that “A Christmas Carol” is <I>not</I>
about Greed, and it is <I>not</I> about Charity. It is, at heart, a story
about <I>self-improvement</I>; the identification and correction of inner
flaws. Herein lies it’s marvelous versatility. Not everyone can identify
with Scrooge’s miserly ways -- but every living person has flaws. Greed
is not the only self-destructive motive. Selfishness wears many masks ...
and extended cynicism is one of them. Don’t believe me? Keep reading.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">It is this universal application
that I find so intriguing about “Christmas Carol.” This story is not the
first time I have endeavored to find value in the reinterpretation of Dickens’
classic. In High School, I wrote an award-winning one-act play called “A
Christmas Carol Revisited” that followed Scrooge beyond the grave to find
the spirits of Christmas disillusioned and depressed. I intended it to
be thoroughly cynical, but it somehow morphed to an optimistic finish.
I have also co-scripted a <I>Star Trek</I>-based spoof for me and my friends,
but that’s another story. And, of course, I’m a big fan of modern interpretations
like Bill Murray’s excellent movie “Scrooged.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">So why give Daria the Scrooge treatment?
Simple answer: she needs it. Be realistic now. If you’ve ever been around
a perpetual cynic, especially one with a handle on sarcasm, you’ve surely
seen them go to far. It’s grating, it’s annoying, and ultimately self-destructive.
Moderation in all things is a virtue -- attitude not the least of these.
This fiction is a reminder of that, and attempts to expand on some of the
themes brought up in the episode “Write Where it Hurts.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">I tried very hard not to go too far.
If Daria the character is to undergo a transformation of such weight and
importance, I’d very much like to see it explored in a more “ground-based”
fic. Therefore, do not consider this a challenge to canonical development,
but rather an isolated experiment in character. I have endeavored to maintain
realism and truth of character. Despite this, I’m certain that I’ve flirted
with melodrama too much to please everybody. Indeed, many will probably
hate or disagree with my depictions. Very well. That’s your prerogative.
In the meantime, those of you willing to take a chance on it (regardless
of religion or creed) play a few holiday tunes, make yourself a mug of
hot cocoa, and settle yourself down. To throw out a cliche, the season
of Love is never far away if you keep it in your heart. Enjoy.</FONT>

<CENTER><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT SIZE=+1>Eleanor’s Ghost</FONT></FONT></I></CENTER>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Eleanor was dead, to begin with.
There was no doubt whatever about that. The register of her cremation was
signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the warring siblings, and the chief
mourner who was the youngest niece of the three.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Great-Aunt Eleanor was as dead as
dirt.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Mind! I don’t mean to say that I
know, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about dirt.
It teems with all sorts of bacteria, paramecium and the general sort of
stuff that suffers the flowers to grow when they are not overtaken by the
choking weeds, which I suppose bring death after all. You will therefore
allow me to repeat, emphatically, that Eleanor was as dead as dirt.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria knew she was dead? Of course
she did. How could it be otherwise? She’d attended the funeral after all.
She’d stood by her Aunt Amy and stared into the flames with the knowledge
that the dearly departed had borne the cynicism of countless generations
and that she, Daria, was a part of that tradition.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">The mention of Eleanor’s funeral
brings me back to the point I started from. There is no doubt that Eleanor
was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can
come of the story I am going to relate.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Oh! but she was a sharp one, Daria!
a quick-witted, sly, sardonic, sarcastic, observant, intelligent young
cynic! Biting and ruthless and acid-tongued. Her eyes were clever beneath
thick-rimmed lenses, her hair plain and her face devoid of makeup. Her
mouth was turned down in a perpetual frown, a neutral expression at the
best of times, and her manner of dress was both boring and drab.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">The outside world had little influence
on Daria. No populist view could sway her thoughts, no conformist hope
to gain her sympathies. She took no interest in the world and the world
took no interest in her. At her school she was a “brain,” in her home a
misfit, and everywhere alienated.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">But what did Daria care? It was the
very thing she liked. To edge her way along the crowded paths of life,
warning all human emotion to keep its distance, was what the knowing ones
call “loser” to Daria.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Once upon a time -- of all the good
days in the year, on Christmas Eve -- Daria sat busy writing in her bedroom.
There was no sign of Christmas in the room, despite the day’s proximity.
The poster depicting the desecration of Dante’s grave was unbalanced by
any sort of holiday cheer that might otherwise have occupied the padded
walls, and no ornamentation graced the windows.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">It was cold, bleak, biting weather,
and Daria could hear her family downstairs complaining loudly, coughing
and whining about the chill. It was early evening, but it was quite dark
already. It had not been light all day in Lawndale, and what glow existed
came from numerous street lamps and porch lights, shining through the thick
fog.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">The door to Daria’s room was closed,
the better to avoid accidental contact with her family. Nonetheless, her
parents had refused to allow her a lock, frowning as they did on Daria’s
self-imposed isolation. So when Helen knocked on the door with a quiet
“Daria?” she sighed and invited her inside.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Helen walked in, frost still apparent
in her amber hair and her face yet flushed from the winter air, and eyed
the room’s morbid decoration distastefully as she always did, before seating
herself at the foot of Daria’s bed.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Daria, we should talk,” she said.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Should we?” Daria asked innocently.
“Doesn’t that usually create more problems than it solves?”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Daria ...” Helen sighed in exasperation.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Perhaps we should adopt the charade
system. I hear it works well for gorillas.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“It’s Christmas, Daria ...”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“So that’s why there’s a Santa Claus
at every street corner.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“... and I want to talk to you,”
Helen finished, making an admirable effort to ignore her eldest daughter’s
sarcasm.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“So we’re talking.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Yes. That’s good. It means we’re
communicating.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Well one of us is,” Daria muttered.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“I want to talk to you about gift-giving
this year.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria shook her head and fell back
against her pillow. “We discussed this already, Mom. We inevitably end
up getting each other things we hate. We usually end up exchanging it,
negating the whole ‘gesture’ theory. The shallow notion that a present
has to be ‘picked out’ overrules the practicality of a person getting exactly
what they want.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“But Daria ... giving money ... it’s
so ...” she searched for the word. “Clinical,” she finished.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Look, I don’t know about you, but
I would rather have a sure thing, as opposed to banking on the hope that
you get lucky picking me something out.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Helen frowned. “Well you certainly
aren’t making it any easier on us.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria smirked. “Why should I?” That
was all the motivation Helen needed to shake her head and leave the room.
Still, she managed a slightly bitter “Merry Christmas” as she shut the
door behind her.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Bah humbug,” Daria said to the empty
room.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;</FONT>
<CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</FONT></CENTER>
&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“So Daria, home for the holidays?”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“The whole family,” Daria said. “No
vacation this year. How about the wandering Lanes?”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Still wandering,” Jane said. Jane
was undoubtedly used to her family being absent for most of the special
occasions in her life, but Daria still detected a note of disappointment.
“But don’t worry. Their nomadic habits will serve them well in the coming
apocalypse. I don’t suppose you’d care to spend Christmas with your best
friends?”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Friends plural?”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“My brother counts as a friend!”
Jane protested.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Hmm,” Daria said thoughtfully. “I
hate to extend myself that far. How about ‘not an un-friend?’ ”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Damn, Daria, that’s generous of
you. You’ve only known him, what, a couple of years now?”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria frowned. Jane was her best
friend, and their chief activity was exchanging gratuitous sarcasm. But
tonight, Daria could sense a touch of bitterness lacing the otherwise casual
banter. It was an edge that appeared from time to time when topics of a
sensitive nature arose. It left a sour taste in her mouth. <I>Why do the
‘Holidays’ always bring out the worst in people?</I> she wondered to herself.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Look, Jane, I’m sorry. But my family
wants me here. Maybe I could get it so you could come over here.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Thanks, but we’ll survive,” Jane
said shortly.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Uncharacteristically, Daria was short
for words, and found her only voice in a mumbled good-bye. Hanging up the
phone, she felt a twinge of guilt. Shaking it off, she got up, resolving
to see if there was any leftover food that looked edible in the refrigerator.
<I>Dammit</I>, she reassured herself, <I>why should I feel guilty over
Jane’s family problems?</I></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Strangely, the thought failed to
comfort.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria had not yet made it to the
kitchen when the doorbell rang. A quick glance around was enough to ascertain
that her family was nowhere nearby. So she answered the door, having to
squint for several seconds at the blast of cold air that assaulted her
face before she could make out the two figures standing on the doorway.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Hi Daria!” squeaked an excited voice.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Whoa! You live here, Daria?”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria blinked, filled with depressing
recognition. “Yes, Kevin. I live in a house. And what’s more, it’s the
same house you’ve been to. Several times. Hello, Brittany. What brings
you here?”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Um ... my shoes,” Kevin answered,
pointing at his feet. Daria looked down. It was only then she noticed that
Kevin was still wearing his football uniform ... and nothing else. Brittany
had at least had the common sense to put on a warm coat, and earmuffs nestled
beneath her buoyant blond pigtails. Despite his dopey grin, Kevin was shivering.
Daria frowned. It was hard not to pity someone so stupid. Hard, but not
impossible.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“We’re collecting toys for poor kids!”
Brittany chimed in, stepping back to reveal a cardboard box behind them,
filled with toys of varying conditions.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“I see,” Daria said flatly. “And
you came to me. Sorry. I don’t have any toys.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Brittany’s face fell, the tired bags
beneath her eyes suddenly apparent. “But ... I mean, Daria ... every one
has toys. You’ve got to have, like, Barbies or something.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria shook her head. “Not a one.
Quinn might, but I don’t think she’s done with them yet. Better luck next
house.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“But ...”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Brittany did not get the chance to
finish, as Daria had shut the door. She rubbed her arms for warmth as the
last vestiges of the chill dissipated throughout the room. If Kevin and
Brittany wanted to freeze on her doorstep, they were welcome to do so.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Now even the casual reader might
suppose at this point that Daria had allowed her opinion of the duo’s intelligence
to cause her to overlook the fact that they were engaging in a selfless
and charitable act on this eve of eves. But as it is the season of good-nature,
let us be sympathetic and take into account the fact that Daria was distracted
by the sight of the Christmas tree in the living room. Tastefully decorated
(chiefly by Quinn, master of all things color-coordination) it was eight
feet high, and tapered from a lovely apex to a broad circumference that
fanned out two feet above the ground, beneath which ... was nothing. Daria
walked over to the tree, fished into her pocket, and withdrew three envelopes,
which she proceeded to drop beneath the pine branches. She nodded in satisfaction.
“The gift that keeps on giving,” she quoted to herself.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">A pang of hunger assailed her, and
once more she turned resolutely to the kitchen. The journey was without
incident this time.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">It should be noted that the Morgendorffer
refrigerator had not been replaced since the day that had moved to Lawndale
from Highland. It should more importantly noted that while very much went
onto the surface of the appliance, very little was ever taken off. It inevitably
happened that some cluster of post-it notes or tired magnet would drop
off at any random moment. So it was that the moment Daria’s hand touched
the door handle a particularly thick cluster of restaurant brochures dislodged
themselves, revealing a photograph she could not recall having ever seen
before.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">The first thing that struck her about
the photograph was that it showed her smiling -- a strange enough thing.
It had been taken years ago, probably her last year in Highland judging
by the black top and pendant she was wearing. It had probably been one
of the first objects affixed to the door. Daria squinted at the picture.
There was something else strange about it ... the harder she looked, the
more defined it became, ‘til the lines on her face became suddenly harder,
her eyes sharper. And then Daria started backwards with a gasp of shock,
for the image that had moments ago been hers had been transmuted into the
steely visage of her Great Aunt Eleanor. There was no mistake about it.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">As she looked fixedly at this phenomenon
it was her own face again.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Now Great Aunt Eleanor had been dead
for more than a few months, and Daria did not think of her often. To say
that she was not startled, or that an indescribably queer sensation was
rippling down her spine would be untrue. It was with great surprise that
she be confronted with so vivid an image in such an unexpected place and
fashion.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria blinked twice, rubbed her eyes,
and reexamined the photograph. It was now unquestionably her own face.
She shook off the disorienting feeling and took a step back to massage
her temples. Suddenly, she wasn’t quite so hungry.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">She made her way back up the stairs
cautiously, for the house seemed suddenly and unnaturally quiet. The first
passage of&nbsp; “ ‘Twas the Night Before Christmas” sprang into her head.
<I>Not a creature was stirring ...</I></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Humbug!” she said aloud. The sound
of her voice startled her, and she quickly slipped inside her room and
locked the door. With a creepy sense of paranoia, her eyes flitted around
the room. No matter where she looked, she could not help but envision the
penetrating eyes of Eleanor looking back at her. Cursing herself for her
irrational behavior, she forced herself to look under her bed and inside
her closet.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Nothing greeted her, of course, apart
from the usual clutter. Nodding in satisfaction, she gained enough confidence
to dim the lights and prepare herself for bed.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">It happened as she pulled on her
long nightshirt. The moment before the hem obscured her vision, the room
was empty; the moment her eyes cleared the neck, it was occupied. With
a small cry of alarm, Daria stumbled backwards into her bed, fumbling for
her glasses, which she had moments ago removed. The lenses confirmed what
her mind had already told her, but what she had refused to believe. There
was no mistaking the spectre that glowed transparent before her.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">It was Eleanor, just as she had appeared
at her funeral.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Aunt ... Aunt Eleanor!” Daria stammered
(Daria could not recall stammering before in her entire life -- a detached
part of her mind registered it as a curious experience.)</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Boo,” said Aunt Eleanor. Then grinned.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria was briefly taken aback. “Boo?”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">The spectre of Aunt Eleanor laughed;
a faintly hollow sound. “Well what were you expecting from a ghost? I suppose
I could rattle around some chains and call out <I>Daaaaariaaaa</I>, but
what’s the point, my dear? All that posing ...”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“You’re ... you’re ...”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Dead?” Eleanor snorted. “Posh. I’ve
never felt better. You, my dear grand-niece, are another matter.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“But that’s ...”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Impossible? Yes, yes ... well you’re
supposedly the bright one. Haven’t you read Dante? Dickens?”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria nodded blankly.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Oh, for Pete’s sake, stop gawking,”
Eleanor snapped.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria suddenly relaxed. “You’re a
dream,” she said knowingly.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Wake up,” Eleanor challenged.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria couldn’t.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">The spirit smirked. “Fine then. Write
it off as your imagination, or repressed consciousness -- a dream if you
like, but you might as well take hold of your senses! I’m not here on a
pleasure cruise, you know. Honestly, I don’t really care if you ‘believe’
in me or not. I’m here, aren’t I?”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Aunt Eleanor? It's ... it's really
<I>you</I>?”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Ellie, please. And I though we’d
established that, dear.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“I was at your funeral!” said Daria,
still not quite certain of herself.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“I know,” Eleanor nodded. “You and
Amy both. I was there, remember.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria grimaced. “Well you weren’t
exactly making good conversation.” She gasped and covered her mouth. The
sarcasm had just slipped out. But Eleanor only smiled.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Now that,” she said, pleased, “is
the Daria Morgendorffer I expected to find.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria took a deep breath and closed
her eyes. “Why ... why are you here?” she asked, politely as she could
manage, eyes still closed. “I mean ... why come haunt me. You are dead
... aren’t you?”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Abruptly, Eleanor glided across the
room towards Daria, who reflexively jerked back, trembling. The shade leaned
forward with a grin that could only be described as devious. “In a sense,”
she whispered. “In a sense ... I am very much alive,” Her spectral face
was inches from Daria’s own. “You are closer to death than I.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria turned cold all over. “What
do you mean?”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“You’re quite the young cynic, aren’t
you, Daria? Just like Amy. Just like me.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria nodded.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Proud of that, eh? Don’t bother
answering -- I know I was. Well good for you. You should be.” Eleanor’s
eyes narrowed. “But pride leads to carelessness. Vanity. Remember what
Francis Bacon said -- I trust you’ve read him?” Daria nodded, mute despite
this. “Excess caused the <I>angels</I> to fall. Let alone man. You stand
at the edge of a precipice, Daria! An abyss of unhappiness! A pit dug of
your own coldness!”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Something ignited in Daria at this
statement; something angry and hard, and for a moment she forgot that she
was speaking to her dead aunt’s ghost. “Now hold on a second! I am not
the ‘misery chick.’ It’s not my fault the world is so shallow! Who are
you to criticize? You said it yourself: I’m just like you!”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Eleanor’s scowl was more than a match
for Daria’s. “Yes,” she said coldly. “Just ... like ... me. Drowning in
your own shallowness!”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria gaped. “Shallow? You want shallow
check down the hall!”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Don’t get smart with me, young lady!
Depth doesn’t come from books. It doesn’t come from intellect. The Human
experience must be your teacher ... and you have forsaken it. That’s why
you need this so much. That’s why you will be haunted this night.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria raised an eyebrow “Haunted?
What do you call this.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“By four spirits!” Eleanor continued,
overpowering Daria with her tone. “Spirits of Christmas Past, Present and
Yet to Come. Spirits given form by the design of your own mind.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“You mean like the Dickens?”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Exactly like the Dickens!” Eleanor
said with an emphatic smack of her right fist into her palm.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Actually, I never read it,” Daria
said dryly. “Too busy with other things. But I think I’ve seen enough corny
TV adaptations and reworkings to know that there are supposed to be three
spirits, aren’t there?”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Eleanor’s grin was decidedly sadistic.
“Yes, well ... in your case, the first two couldn’t be separated. Good-bye,
Daria,” she said with finality.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">And abruptly, the room was plunged
into darkness. Daria scrambled backwards fully onto the bed, pulling up
her feet and peering into the darkness on all sides, searching for shades
of grey. She found none; the darkness was absolute “Aunt Eleanor?” she
asked quietly. “Ellie?”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">And then there was a sound.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Huh huh huh!”</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>
&nbsp;
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT SIZE=+2>STAVE TWO</FONT></FONT></B></CENTER>

<CENTER><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT SIZE=+1>The First (Two)
of the Three Spirits</FONT></FONT></I></CENTER>
&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">As if the darkness had never been,
Daria’s desk lamp once more cast it’s glow over the small room ... and
it’s three occupants. If Daria had been having a difficult time reconciling
the shade of her deceased great-aunt, she was having an even worse time
of it believing the presence of the two who now shared her bedroom.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Whoa!” said Beavis. “Check it out,
Butt-head! It’s, like, Diarrhea!”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Huh-huh. Diarrhea.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria blinked. She rubbed her eyes.
She turned to try pounding her head against the wall, but remembered that
the walls were padded. Swearing softly, she turned back to the center of
the room. The duo was still there, wearing the same ratty T-shirts they
had always worn; Beavis with his shock of yellow hair, and Butt-head with
his tangle of brown. Butt-head still had his braces. Daria figured he’d
forgotten they were designed to eventually be removed. <I>Of all the rotten
--</I> she though miserably. <I>Damn, Aunt Ellie, that was a cruel joke.
Of all the people from my past ... why not Mr. VanDreissen? Why not Stewart?
Why not ANYone but ...</I></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Beavis! Check it out!” Butt-head
was taking stock of Daria’s room. “Padded walls ... and there’s bars in
the window ... you’ve, like, even got bones and stuff. Uh ... uh-huh huh
... this room kicks ass.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Yeah!” Beavis affirmed heartily,
eyeing the models on top of her dresser. “It’s, like, got cheese. And there’s
a skull on the floor! Mhehheh.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria sighed in disgust, shaking
her head at how quickly she had fallen back into the same old Highland
routine. She’d though she’d left that part of her behind years ago. “They’re
not real, guys. It’s an anthropological kit.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“An-thro-po-mogical,” repeated Butt-head,
sounding out the syllables.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“I think she means, like, the study
of monkeys. M-heh. Sumthinlikethat.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria raised an eyebrow. “Not exactly
... but still, unusually impressive ... for you.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Butt-head was also impressed. “Uh
... huh-huh. ‘Monkey.’ Uh huh-huh huh.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">There was a long silence. Daria was
the one to break it.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Well?” The twosome responded to
her question with their usual vacant stares.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Butt-head broke the silence. “Uh
... what?”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria rolled her eyes. “You’re here
to show me my past, right? Not to stand there and remind me of how incomparably
stupid it was.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Ohhhh yeah,” Beavis muttered. “Oh
yeah. Heh heh. <I>See</I> the light! Mheh eh heheheh!” Beavis delved into
his pocket and retrieved a cigarette lighter, and proceeded to flick a
small flame into existence. “Heh heh. <I>Fffire</I>!”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria squinted. The light was surprisingly
bright. “Um ... Beavis? You want to put that out before my whole room ...”
In a flash, the light shot out in all directions to fill the room. “...
burns down ...” she finished. The light faded as quickly as it had grown.
Except the three were no longer in Daria’s bedroom. Instead they were in
the front room of ...</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Highland,” Daria said with disgust.
“Home again.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Whoa!” said Butt-head. “A party!”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">He was right ... although it wasn’t
a party, exactly. Rather, a small group of toddlers were milling about
the living room. Daria didn’t recognize most of them, but two at least
were familiar. Next to the Christmas tree, baby Butt-head was amusing himself
by knocking two wrapped presents together. Over at the coffee table, baby
Beavis, clothed only in a diaper, was grasping for a bottle of juice. None
of the infants looked up as Daria approached, and she assumed her presence
was undetectable.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Something was missing, Daria realized.
It was her house ... but there was no sign of her. She had no memory of
the event. So where was she?</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Then she heard a cry from the kitchen.
Leaving Beavis and Butt-head giggling in at the front door, she moved to
investigate. It was her mother, simultaneously talking on the phone, stirring
some sort of recipe, and dressing the infant who lay on the table. Her
hair was longer, reaching down to mid-back, and she was dressed in casual,
almost Christmasy clothes as opposed to her usual business outfit. Moving
closer, Daria was surprised to find that the diapered infant on the table
was her!</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“What can we learn from this?” Daria
muttered, in a bitter attempt to gloss over the surreal nature of the moment.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Oh, yes, Willow,” Helen was saying
into the phone. “They’re all so cute crawling around in their Christmas
outfits ... oh, there’s one or two little miscreants in the bunch. It’s
adorable the way they try and talk.” Helen set down the bowl and began
sorting through a pile of baby clothes. Daria nodded to herself as her
mother paused over a green shirt ... but was surprised when she passed
over it in favor of a bright pink dress. Daria suppressed the urge to gag
as her mother slipped the outfit over her infant self.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">I probably spit up all over it, she
predicted. Much to her surprise, the infant Daria actually gurgled in delight
and began playing with the hem. Daria’s eyes widened. “Yes,” Helen was
saying, “Daria’s just the cutest one in the whole bunch. Yes I will. Yes,
good-bye.” Helen hung up the phone and picked up her daughter, who clapped
her hands excitedly. “Let’s go meet your party, guests, sweetie,” she cooed.
Daria grimaced as she followed her mother back to the living room.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Helen set Daria down and sighed as
she walked over to where baby Butt-head had managed to get his overlarge
head stuck inside one of the boxes he had cracked open. Nearby, Beavis
had obtained the bottle of juice he had been so determined to reach, and
was guzzling it down. Helen snatched it away from him. “Naughty, naughty,”
she scolded. “That’s not for you! Little Stewart needs his extra-calorie
bottle.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria was staring in amazement at
the center of the room as the other children flocked around the host of
the party. The young Daria beamed.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Hey, Daria,” Butt-head said from
behind, causing her to jump. “You were, like, popular and stuff.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria nodded blankly. “I don’t remember
any of this. As far as I can remember, I was born bitter and resentful.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">On the floor, baby Beavis had stopped
shaking and pulled his diaper over his head, gurgling maniacally to himself.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Uh ... it wasn’t always that way,
Daria,” Butt-head said. “Things changed. Huh huh. Yeah.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Quinn,” Daria murmured. A heavy
feeling drifted over the room, and the scene before her eyes flashed forward
in a distorted blur. This time her young self looked to be almost three
years old. But she wasn’t in the center of the room anymore. Instead, she
was sitting alone in one corner of the couch, glaring at her former position,
which was now occupied by the adorable red-haired vision that was Quinn.
She smiled, she burbled, she clapped her hands -- the living definition
of&nbsp; “adorable.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">On the couch, the toddler versions
of Beavis and Butt-head clambered up to sit next to the pouting Daria.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Hey, Daria,” said young Butt-head.
“Your sister’s, like, pretty cool.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Yeah!” echoed young Beavis. “Maybe
you could, like, bring her over sometime. Heh heh. That’d be cool. We could,
like, teach her to hit stuff! Mheh.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Huh-huh. Yeah. How come you’re not
cool like that anymore, Daria? You won’t even stomp frogs with us.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria’s younger self merely scowled
harder.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Huh-huh. Bet you wish you were her
right now.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">That got a reaction. “I do not!”
Daria exploded. But within seconds, she was off the couch and marching
across to her younger sister. Quinn was playing happily with a stuffed
bear that the older Daria did recognize. “That’s mine,” she told her spirit
companions. Daria’s younger self shared the assessment. Her solution was
to yank the stuffed animal from her younger sibling’s clutches. Lip trembling,
Quinn broke out into a loud wail that Daria knew too well. In an instant,
Helen was in the room and at Quinn’s side.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Daria!” she scolded. “What did you
do to your sister?” Still bawling, Quinn pointed at the bear.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“It’s mine!” Daria said stubbornly.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Helen reached down and plucked the
bear from Daria’s arms. “You can share with your sister. This party belongs
to both of you.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Young Daria’s response was to stalk
angrily back to the couch. “Not my party,” she said softly. “All hers.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Butt-head nodded in agreement. “This
couch sucks. Come on, Beavis. Let’s go get Stewart and make him climb the
Christmas tree.” He turned back to Daria. “It’s like, a good thing you
don’t care about being popular an’ stuff, or you’d, like, suck pretty bad.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">But as the unseen witness, Daria
saw the look in her younger self’s eyes and knew it wasn’t true. “I did
care,” she whispered. “My God, I really did care.” Daria saw tears welling
up in her counterpart’s eyes, and she turned away ...</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">... to find herself in a darkened
hall.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><I>I’m still in Highland</I>, she
realized. She looked up at the hall clock. It was past midnight. And she
was alone -- no sign of Beavis or Butt-head. But what ...</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Just then a door creaked open. It
was her own door, from her old bedroom. Sure enough, her young, pajama-clad
self peeked out into the hall, looking back and forth as if to make sure
the coast was clear. Daria’s forehead wrinkled in confusion. What was this?</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">The young Daria eased into the hallway
and tiptoed down to where Daria herself was standing. The girl stared for
a moment at the door next to hers, and pushed it open quietly, slipping
inside. Intrigued, and more than a little uneasy, Daria followed.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Inside, the room was ghostly still:
a congress of shades and shadows. A little moonlight shone through the
window; enough to illuminate Quinn, sleeping in her crib, and Daria felt
a sudden fear that perhaps the girl she had been was invading thus in the
middle of the night with the intent of committing some violence against
her sister. Indeed, the girl approached her sleeping sibling with a certain
deliberate posture that bespoke hostility. Daria’s heart clenched.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Quinn turned in her sleep, sucking
on her thumb. The moon bathed her in a soft glow, making her seem even
more a heavenly creature. And there was little Daria, rising from the darkness,
her small features distorted by the shadow of the moon through the crib
bars. Daria held her breath, powerless. And then ...</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“I hate you.” It was a whisper, and
Daria was shocked by the vehemence of it. “I hate you,” she repeated. “You
can have them,” she continued. “You can have my friends and my toys and
my things. I don’t care. I’ll keep going without them.” She leaned in close
to the crib, her voice even softer, eyes filled with pain. “But you won’t.
That’s my Christmas wish.” Her lip trembled. “You’re just a spoiled little
brat, and I hope you stay that way forever!”</FONT>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">No ...</FONT></I>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">A cloud covered the moon, and Daria’s
vision dimmed. <I>Forever ... forever ...</I></FONT>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Oh my God. I wanted this.</FONT></I>
<BR>&nbsp;

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</FONT></CENTER>
&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">When the light returned, Daria was
back in her room, lying in her bed, staring into the darkness.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT SIZE=+1>The Second
of the Three Spirits</FONT></FONT></I></CENTER>
&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Seconds passed. They were long,
lonely seconds as Daria reflected. Sadness and disbelief welled up as one.
There it had been, reenacted before her very eyes -- the grain of sand
that had been nourished over the years into a pearl of bitterness. It galled
her still, after all these years; worse, for the size of it.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">She was interrupted in her reflection
by a gentle sound. Daria groaned to herself and turned to the center of
the room, prepared for the worst.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Instead, she got Jodie Landon. She
was dressed in her usual neat ensemble, and her face wore a kindly expression.
Daria let out a sigh of audible relief. The dark-skinned future valedictorian
was one of the few points of sanity in her High School existence. Always
there with a kind, supportive word; always sympathetic ... had Jodie asked
then and there, Daria would have signed up for any number of extra-curricular
activities out of sheer relief.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">But Jodie did not ask, and, shaking
off that dampening of the senses that accompanies the newly awakened, Daria
belatedly realized that this was not the Jodie Landon of her High School.
This was the Jodie Landon of her mind, acting out a role that Daria’s own
subconscious had chosen.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Hello, Daria,” Jodie smiled.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“You’re the ghost of Christmas Present.”
Jodie nodded. Daria sighed. “Here we go again.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Jodie cocked her head. “You don’t
sound very happy.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“I’m sure not happy about unsolicited
haunting on Christmas Eve, if that’s what you mean,” Daria snapped.&nbsp;
“I’ve already seen enough tonight to depress me through New Years. So if
you don’t mind, we can skip this and go straight to the moral of the story.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“And what is the moral of the story?”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria opened her mouth to speak ...
but the words would not come, so she closed it and settled on the silent-defiance
approach to drive her newest tormentor away.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">It didn’t work.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Let’s see if we can’t help you find
it,” Jodie continued, and with a wave of her hand the pair was outside.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria’s first instinct was to shiver.
They were ankle-deep in snow, and Daria was still dressed for bed. But
the cold did not touch her, and so she suppressed her initial reaction
and observed her surroundings.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">It was night. The snowfall had ceased
hours ago. Most of the haze had melted away under the sharp light of the
stars. The pair were standing on a sidewalk, and although the landscape
was almost uniformly blanketed in white, the majority of the large sign
before her was clearly visible. Lawndale High School.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria stood blankly for a moment.
“The school is closed,” she said flatly. “Why bring me here.” In response,
Jodie pointed to the left, where a car was approaching. It pulled around
the sidewalk and into the parking lot. It was not alone, Daria noticed.
Several cars of varying sizes occupied the faculty parking spaces. As she
pondered this, she was surprised to see that Mr. O’Neill was the new arrival.
He was wrapped in a large jacket, and several brightly-decorated packages
filled his arms. They were the right size for books -- they probably were,
considering they were coming from an English teacher.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria and Jodie hurried to catch
up with O’Neill as he carefully made his way to the entrance, and began
fumbling with his key, attempting to get the door unlocked while simultaneously
balancing his armload of presents. Oblivious to Daria’s invisible presence,
he somehow managed to release the lock and push his way inside. Unfortunately,
the door was not yet willing to release the hapless educator from his struggles,
closing on his scarf. Jodie smiled to herself, and pulled the door open
again. The scarf slipped free and O’Neill staggered forward, barely maintaining
his balance. With a sigh of relief, he moved on, giving the wavering door
one last puzzled glance as Daria and Jodie slipped inside before it clicked
shut.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“I thought we couldn’t touch anything
or anybody,” Daria said smugly.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Jodie shrugged. “You can’t. I’m a
spirit, remember? It never hurts to help.” Daria grimaced.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">The pair followed Mr. O’Neill to
the faculty lounge. “Must be the annual staff holiday party. Bet that’s
a blast.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Many of your teachers aren’t able
to spend Christmas with family, Daria. Their colleagues are the best friends
they have in Lawndale.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“I wonder if it ends in comedy or
tragedy.” Jodie frowned. “What?” Daria protested. Jodie shook her head
and ducked into the lounge behind Mr. O’Neill. Daria followed suit.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">It looked a rather pathetic scene
to Daria. The drab colors and sparse furniture in the room were limply
strewn with “holiday cheer” ... a ragged wreath against the far wall, a
plain holiday centerpiece of nuts and dried fruits, surrounded by several
half-eaten fruitcakes. A tiny clutch of mistletoe hung from one of the
ceiling panels. The room was sparsely occupied; only four members of the
Lawndale High staff were there to greet Mr. O’Neill’s arrival. Principal
Li and Ms. Morris stood by the drinking fountain, no doubt haggling over
the Physical Education budget. Ms. Barch sat alone at one corner of the
table, her bitter posture losing some of its edge at the arrival of the
only male she did not despise.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">On the opposite corner of the table
hunched Mr. DeMartino, glaring up from the handful of crushed nuts in his
palm. “Ahh, TIMothy!” he said with his customary gruffness, and an edge
of sarcasm. “So NICE of you to drop BY. Perhaps NOW we can begin the FesTIVities.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Oh dear,” said O’Neill. “I hope
I haven’t inconvenienced anyone. I got delayed shoveling my neighbor’s
driveway ...”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Ms. Barch smiled benevolently. “Not
at all, Timmy. It’s not like we have anywhere else to be.” DeMartino opened
his mouth again, but hastily closed it again as Barch fixed him with her
dagger-like stare.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“But you are here,” Ms. Li pronounced
authoritatively, as if an important decision had been reached. “And bearing
gifts, no less! How appropriate.” O’Neill smiled weakly. “Ms. Morris was
good enough to bring the centerpiece,” Li continued, “Mr. DeMartino took
care of the decorating ...” (<I>That explains it</I>, thought Daria.) “...
and Ms. Barch brought the punch.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Better check it for poison,” Daria
said aloud. “Oh, wait. This is Ms. Li. She already has.” Again, there was
no reaction from Jodie.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“A toast,” said Ms. Li as Ms. Morris
distributed the punch. “To seventeen glorious days.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">DeMartino grinned devilishly into
his drink. “Genuine WEEKS without a SINgle boorish supplicant to CODDLE
in the hopes that they will&nbsp; VALIDATE your existence by retaining
ONE OUNCE of knowledge!”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Come now, Mr. DeMartino,” Ms. Li
snorted. “Surely not all your students are that bad ...” She trailed off
as DeMartino’s haunted look told her otherwise. “Hmmph. In any case, it
is refreshing to have security concerns limited to holiday break-ins.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Now Anthony,” said O’Neill optimistically,
“Lawndale High has some excellent students. Let's see ... For example,
I’m sure Daria Morgendorffer always passes with flying colors.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">DeMartino rolled his eyes sarcastically.
“Ah yes, Miss Morgendorffer ... isn’t SHE a bright spot in my day. Just
BRIMMing with enTHUsiasm!”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">O’Neill chuckled nervously. “Yes,
I’ve, ah ... noticed that. But at least she displays an enthusiasm for
the material ...”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Just try getting her to show any
enthusiasm in my class,” Morris blurted out. “She goes beyond not participating.
I’d go so far as to say she deliberately places herself in the way. She’ll
take any excuse to sabotage a coordinated effort.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">O’Neill began to frown. “We all have
room for growth ...”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“I’m afraid,” said Li shortly, “I’ve
given up on that. Miss Morgendorffer has proven time and time again that,
despite the <I>hooonor</I> she could bring to Lawndale High, she would
much rather sabotage my every effort.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Face it, Timothy,” DeMartino said
objectively through a mouthful of cashews, “You’re HOPElessly naive.” O’Neill
blanched at this, and Barch jumped to his rescue.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Leave him alone, you testosterone-corrupted
waste of flesh!” She seized O’Neill’s hand. “Imagine, letting one girl
with a bad attitude stereotype the entire female gender!”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">O’Neill sighed dejectedly. “No, Janet,
Anthony has a point. I’ll admit I always try to look for the best in people.
But ...” and his voice grew very soft, “sometimes dealing with Daria ...
well, I hate saying this, but ... sometimes I just want to give up.” His
lip quavered as if he were about to burst into tears.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">That and DeMartino’s triumphant grin
were the last things Daria saw before she whirled around and passed through
the solid door. A second later, Jodie joined her in the empty hall. Daria
rounded on her.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“I’ve had enough!” she snarled. “What
makes you think for one moment I care about what they -- or anybody --
thinks of me? I don’t owe them anything. So what if my gym teacher hates
me? She’s as corrupt as Principal Li! And if you ask me, Mr. O’Neill could
use a dose of reality now and then -- before he dies of optimism! Do I
look like I care?”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“You wouldn’t be this worked up about
it if you didn’t care,” Jodie pointed out.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria frowned. “Okay, so I don’t
like being badmouthed. Who does? There’s got to be somewhere everybody
isn’t taking my name in vain.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Jodie nodded, and with a wave of
her hand, they were back outside, the school nowhere in sight.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">The street and its houses were hard
to recognize under the snow, but when Daria turned around and saw the “Calvin
and Hobbes” style snowman impaled on its own ski pole she knew she was
standing in front of the Lane’s house.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“That’s strange,” Daria said aloud.
“There are cars in the driveway. That would mean ...”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Come,” said Jodie, moving towards
the front window.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria wondered what would happen
if she refused ... if she just turned around and walked home. She certainly
deserved a break after putting up with so much. But despite herself, curiosity
triumphed over rancor, and so she followed.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">She suspected the truth before she
saw it through the ice-frosted living-room window. It surprised her nonetheless.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">The wandering Lanes had come home
for Christmas.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">The look on Jane’s face said it all.
Here was a Christmas present to be remembered! Her parents, her three travelling
siblings -- even her niece and nephew -- all arranged around the living
room -- not arguing, either! Miracle of miracles, there was a smile on
every face. Even Trent wore a relaxed grin as he examined a new guitar
pedal. Wrapping paper lay strewn around the room. Every limb, every face
was in bright motion. The outside air did not chill Daria in her present
state, but the warmth emanating from the room made her feel cold through
simple contrast. Walking haltingly towards the pane, she was surprised
to feel the glass unyielding beneath her hands. She pressed again, but
the window remained firm beneath her touch. It did not even flex or make
a sound under the rapping of her knuckles. She was cut off from the picturesque
scene within as surely as if the glass had been strongest steel.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“You can not join them,” Jodie said
sadly. “This is the milk of familial warmth, of which you have cut yourself
off. But look!”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria did look. As she peered through
that frosty plane, her eyes met those of her best friend. Jane slowed in
her motion, for only an instant, as if she had seen Daria outside in the
snow. Jane smiled, and Daria saw her lips form her name. The scene in the
room took the shape of laughter. For an instant, Daria was sure she was
being scorned. But something in their posture and expressions communicated
their good humour. There was no bitterness or spite here. In his chair
Trent raised an eyebrow, smiling, but saying nothing.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“There is room in their hearts for
you,” Jodie told Daria, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Try finding that in my family,”
Daria said bitterly. “Dysfunctional as the Lane’s are, they’ve still got
one up on me.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Don’t sell your family short, Daria,”
Jodie cautioned. “Perhaps the problem isn’t completely with them. Perhaps
you’re underestimating them.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“I’d like to see that.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Very well.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Before Daria could object, the deed
was done. In less than an eyeblink, her surroundings changed once again
-- from standing outside in the snow, to indoor carpeting. She blinked.
She knew the bright swashes of yellow and pink all too well. She was in
her sister’s bedroom.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Sure enough, Quinn was standing not
two yards away. In front of her mirrors.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria frowned. Jodie opened her mouth
to speak, but Daria cut her off. “Let’s examine the evidence before us,”
Daria said hotly. “My sister is in her room on Christmas Eve holding up
outfits to her reflection and talking on the phone. And look.” She walked
over to Quinn’s makeup table. “A bunch of photos with my face cut out of
them. Same old Quinn, same loving old sister.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Daria ...”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Don’t patronize me!” Daria snapped
at Jodie. “What’s the point in showing me this? You want me to despise
her even more?” She jabbed a finger at the mutilated photographs. “That’s
supposed to help me be more self aware? This is exactly what’s wrong with
my family. Quinn ... my parents ... they try to understand me and they
just don’t get it. They can’t accept me as I am. The only way they’d ever
accept me is if I <I>change</I> who I am!”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“There can be no growth without change.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Then maybe they need to change if
they’re ever going to grow to my level!” Daria growled.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“And where is your level?” For the
first time that evening, Jodie seemed genuinely angry. “Just tonight I’ve
seen you slaughter optimism, envy your friends and reject your own sister
offhand. Did it even occur to you to look beneath the surface? You’re so
good at that!”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria was taken aback by the sudden
tide of accusation. <I>Beneath the surface?</I> She turned to reexamine
Quinn, but Jodie spun her around.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“I’m sorry, Daria. I gave you the
chance to see something true. You rejected it. Do you think this is a fairy
tale? Moments pass. Some opportunities only come once. You may consider
yourself fortunate that this one may come again. For now, we are done here.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Wait ...” Daria blurted, an inexplicable
panic betraying her earlier sentiments. “I’m sorry ... I’m ... please,
give me another chance.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Jodie narrowed her eyes and looked
down her nose at Daria in a manner that made her feel suddenly uncomfortable.
Alien chills ran up her spine. This was not Jodie Landon.&nbsp; At once,
Daria realized that she had just placed herself at odds with the very spirit
of Christmas.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Your parents,” Jodie said. Her look
dared Daria to forsake this last chance.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria nodded reluctantly. “My parents.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">If Daria had felt uncomfortable during
the night’s previous experience, the discomfort increased tenfold at the
prospect before her. When she was very small (she had just learned to take
herself to the bathroom at night) she had gotten up and, padding past her
parents closed bedroom door, had overheard an argument. She didn’t remember
what they had been arguing about. The truth was, it didn’t matter. She’d
recognized the tone they were using. It was the tone they only used on
her when she’d been very naughty. She had never before heard them turn
that displeasure on each other. Daria had been petrified with fear, and
her parents had been surprised to find her with wet bedsheets the following
morning.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Of course at seventeen she had heard
more than her fair share of parental arguments. Indeed, she had long since
weathered the emotional ramifications that come when wondering about divorce,
separation or violence. But the loss of innocence that long-ago night represented
still haunted her. The master bedroom remained a place of powerful memories.
It was alternatively sacred or forbidden; she was nestled in her parents
arms or she did not belong -- and the days of nestling were long since
past.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">So it was with no small amount of
trepidation that Daria swallowed her fears and followed Jodie down the
hall to her parents room.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Jake was reading the paper. Helen
had a portfolio spread out in her lap. They were both in bed. Daria relaxed
slightly. With any luck the “moment” Jodie had spoken of would be quick
and painless.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><I>Several</I> moments passed in
silence. Daria was about to complement Jodie on her timing when Helen spoke.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“It certainly does give us more time
to ourselves Christmas Eve,” she commented. When her significant other
remained significantly elsewhere, she gave him an annoyed kick beneath
the covers. With a small yelp of “Cold feet!” Jake dropped the newspaper
and went on the defensive. But Helen was already looking away, wistful.
“I remember when I was up until four in the morning, making sure everything
was just perfect for when the girls came downstairs. Wrapping presents,
stuffing stockings, writing little notes, cleaning up ...”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Jake’s face lit up. “And I ate the
cookies! You know, so they’d think Santa had come. I’d eat the cookies
and I’d drink the milk, and Quinn would get so cute, she’d say ‘Look, Daddy,
just the crumbs! Just the crumbs!’ And little Daria with her fingerprinting
kit ... Boy, those were the days! Hey! I almost forgot! I better get down
there before it’s too late!”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Helen sighed. “Jake, there are no
cookies!”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">His face fell. “No cookies?”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“We stopped doing that years ago,
sweetie. Besides, it’s like Daria said. We’re going to be mature about
Christmas this year.” Despite the admonition, there was distaste in her
tone.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“What was wrong with opening presents?”
Jake complained. “I liked opening presents! You never knew what you were
going to get.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Helen tried to laugh. “Well, now
you just get to guess how much money you get. That’s what the girls want.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Jake colored in anger. “Money,” he
spat. “It’s <I>aaaaall</I> about the money! I remember when Christmas was
sacred! A joyous time of peace, and goodwill towards reindeerkind. Santa
Claus isn’t just a person, you know! He’s an idea!”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Jake, please, you’re getting all
worked up,” Helen cautioned.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">But Jake would not be deterred. “Worked
up?” he shouted. “<I>Worked up?</I> This isn’t ‘worked up,’ Helen! Worked
up is getting a lump of coal in your stocking for having the nerve to ask
for a puppy for Christmas! Worked up is slaving away day in day out to
please that selfish bastard so he’d stop tormenting you in front of your
friends, and waking up Christmas and getting Lincoln Logs! Dammit, I wanted
Tinker Toys!” He shook his fist at the ceiling. “Ya hear that, old man?
<I>Tinker Toys!!!</I>”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Jake!” Helen, growing slightly alarmed.
“Remember your blood pressure!”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">But Jake ignored her. “Don’t we love
them, Helen? Don’t we give them every advantage we never had? And all they
can do is bleed us for every penny we’re worth!” He jerked up violently.
“Well I won’t stand for it! I’m going to the store right now, and when
those girls wake up they’ll have all the Tinker Toys they --”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Jake froze. His breath caught in
his chest, and his words died with them. Eyes wide, he lurched forward,
arms flailing.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">To Daria, the moment was frozen;
surreal. It was as if the world had stopped, and only her father remained
in motion. That <I>had</I> to be the case, because she did not panic, she
did not attempt to move; there was nothing to be done, because this was
not happening.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">But it was. And time moved beyond
that first terrible second. Jake fell back against the headboard, suddenly
pale. Before he hit, Helen had snagged him and was shouting his name. Then
Jake breathed, and he turned to his wife and managed to smile.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“I’m okay,” he whispered. “Just got
a little worked up. Nothing to worry about.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">For several moments, Helen held Jake
tight, allowing the weak assurance to carry them into a quiescent calm.
But the expression on her face and the tension in her frame belied any
illusions of peace or relaxation.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“I <I>am</I> worried,” she whispered.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Jake slumped wearily back into his
pillow. “Me too, honey. Me too.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria had had enough. Desperately
fighting tears (she could not remember crying before in her life, and she
wasn’t about to start now) she spun herself away. Her mind was filled with
a thousand angry, confused thoughts; some for her parents, some for Jodie,
but most for herself. But her parents were unreachable, and she was to
busy raising mental blocks to start tearing them down, so it was Jodie
who she turned to with dire intentions.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Jodie was not there.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria stormed through the bedroom
door. Jodie was not in the hall. Daria felt her anger and sorrow sink slowly
and deliberately to the pit of her stomach. <I>What now?</I> She moved
carefully to her bedroom door. Was this it? Had she been returned to the
Present? Seen what she had been meant to see? “That I’m a plague on my
parents?” she muttered. The sound of her own voice startled her. Talking
to herself was a sure indication that she was spooked.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><I>And why shouldn’t I be?</I> Daria
thought. <I>I’ve been through enough, haven’t I? I’m here outside my bedroom
on Christmas Eve. I’ve probably been sleepwalking. Nightmares like that
... who wouldn’t be spooked?</I> She pressed her boot into the carpet,
sliding it forward and feeling the texture of it; rubbed her palms together
and felt the warmth beneath the skin. She realized that her throat was
dry and her tongue felt tangibly rough. She almost smiled at the tactile
sensation. She was thirsty.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><I>Bad dreams</I>, she thought again,
and decided she needed a glass of water from the kitchen.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">At the top of the stairs looking
down, she saw the hooded figure.</FONT>

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT SIZE=+2>STAVE FOUR</FONT></FONT></B></CENTER>

<CENTER><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT SIZE=+1>The Third of
the Three Spirits</FONT></FONT></I></CENTER>
&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">In less than an instant, all thoughts
of dreaming had fled Daria’s mind, replaced by a gut-wrenching sense of
terrible reality. The spectre at the foot of the stairs was clothed in
a tall dark robe, with a long hood obscuring any sign of the face within.Daria
waited, frozen, for several interminable seconds. At last, when the shade
made no motion or sound, she mustered the courage to offer a tentative
“Hello?” There was no response. The figure was silent, displaying none
of the familiarity of the previous spirits.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">A bell tolled. Daria sprang like
a mousetrap. No sooner had she landed on her feet than she was startled
by another noise from behind. She whirled around to face whatever it was,
gaped in shock, and took a step back. Standing as she was on the edge of
the hall, she half stumbled, half fell down the stairs.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">In a daze, Daria heard another knelling.
Head in hands, she realized that the tone came from the front door. “That’s
not our doorbell,” she muttered. But then, the figure who was coming down
the stairs before her was not exactly her mother. That is to say, not the
mother she recalled from not two minutes ago.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Helen was old. Her hair was white
-- elegantly shot through with silver. Her face was creased with lines
deepened by time and loss. Her frame was diminutive. She wore a pleated,
dark-red robe and navigated the stairs with the aid of both the banister
and a cane.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Picking herself up, Daria willed
herself to turn around -- in part because it was morbidly hard to tear
her eyes away from the ancient figure her mother had become, and in part
due to the unbearable panic that followed the sudden recognizance that
something very bad (or at the least fearsome) was standing directly behind
her.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Sure enough, the Ghost of Christmas
Yet to Come towered before her. It did nothing. Disturbed yet somewhat
calmed at confronting the apparition, Daria searched the narrow hood for
any sign of human occupation and found none. She took a deep breath.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Well, since you’re not gesturing
or groaning or anything, I’ll just assume you want me to watch this.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">There was no response. Daria reluctantly
turned her back to the ghost, then thought better of it and shifted back
and to the right to stand next to it.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria had once written a short story
for Mr. O’Neill’s English class. The assignment had been to utilize people
she knew from real-life as characters in the story. She had tried valiantly
to compose something meaningful ... something true. A conversation with
her mother had helped convince her that her difficulty lay not in being
honest about what she saw, but honest about what she wanted. Daria had
thought about that. She had looked into the future and envisioned her family
as she wanted them to be.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Now, staring at her wizened mother,
the memories of that day came flooding back. Indeed, when Helen answered
the door and Quinn walked in, Daria was surprised at the accuracy (or consistency)
of her imagination. Quinn was taller, her red hair bound back, and with
a more mature face. There was a depth to her eyes that, while appropriate
for the face, seemed out of character with the Quinn that Daria remembered.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Helen’s eyes lit up. Quinn, who looked
to be in her late twenties or early thirties, set down several suitcases
and stepped into her mother's warm embrace.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Did she come?” Helen whispered,
hopeful.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Quinn smiled and stepped to one side.
“Yes.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Cue me,” Daria told the spirit.
“This doesn’t look so bad.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Jane walked into the room.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">To say Daria was surprised would
be to describe water as “wet.” Daria was shocked. Her best friend, her
sister and her mother ... together ... by choice ... on Christmas Eve.
Of all the people ... it didn’t add up. The math refused to work, no matter
which way Daria looked at it. She moved closer for a better look.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">It was definitely Jane. Taller, older,
of course, hair longer and tied back. Quinn helped her out of her long
coat, revealing a simple blue sweater and pants. Jane thanked Quinn, and
turned to Helen.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Merry Christmas, Mrs. Morgendorffer.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Helen smiled beatifically. “Jane,
it’s been decades. Call me Helen, please.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Jane returned the smile. “Merry Christmas
... Helen. Sorry we’re late. You know how holiday traffic can get.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“It <I>is</I> late,” Quinn said,
hanging up the coats on the coatrack beside the door. “I’m surprised anyone’s
up at all.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“It’s Christmas Eve.” Helen answered,
beaming for a moment. “Where are my manners? Come on in to the living room
-- I’ve got some fresh egg-nog ready.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Nodding, Jane and Quinn slipped out
of their snow-encrusted boots and followed Helen into the living room.
Daria trailed behind, shaking her head in disbelief, all but ignoring her
mysterious companion.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Helen seated herself in a large easychair,
motioning for her guests to sit on the couch. There was a pitcher and two
glasses on the coffee table. “Help yourselves,” she said. “I made it fresh
this afternoon.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Jane accepted, leaning forward to
pour a glass, which she offered to Quinn. Quinn declined with a polite
smile. “Morning sickness,” she explained. Jane gave a knowing smirk and
sampled the drink herself.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“It’s excellent Mrs. -- Helen,” she
said. Helen was still fixated on Quinn’s delighted grin. “I suppose I should
make it a toast...”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Quinn, you’re pregnant!” Helen blurted
out. “Oh!” For an elderly woman, Helen was out of her chair like a rocket,
catching a surprised Quinn in a hearty embrace. Tears streamed down her
face. “I’m going to be a grandmother!” she whispered. Quinn laughed and
moved closer to Jane to make room for her mother on the couch.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Intrigued and simultaneously bamboozled,
Daria made her way to the chair Helen had vacated and fell into it.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Helen wiped her eyes dry. “And where
is the father?” she pretended to scold.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“With his family,” Quinn fired back
with a broad smile. “That’s why we can only stay tonight. Besides, I have
to get Jane to Trent’s before tomorrow, or his in-laws will be very disappointed.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><I>So where am I?</I> Daria thought
in confusion.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“A Grandmother,” Helen breathed again,
eyes twinkling. “You know, after Daria ... left us, I’d almost given up
hope I’d ever see the day.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria felt her heart clutch in her
chest. She looked back at the spirit, but it had not changed it's stoic
posture.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Although,” Helen continued, brow
wrinkling in mild distaste, “I never did care much for Charles. I can’t
imagine him raising my grandchildren.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Trust me, Mrs. M,” Jane said, setting
down her glass. “No children was the best thing about that marriage.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“I don’t know what she saw in him,”
Helen sighed.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Jane spread her hands wide. “Isn’t
it obvious? It disappointed you and shocked us. What do you think she was
aiming for? She gave up on happiness years before she married him. Hardest
thing I ever had to do was accept that.” Jane patted Quinn on the shoulder.
“Fortunately, there are always alternatives.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Amen,” Quinn echoed. “Sandi’s on
her fifth marriage, I think ... and still no kids. You’re beating out Linda
in grandparenthood.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Helen gave a nonchalant shrug. “Oh,
I don’t care about those old rivalries.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Quinn grinned deviously. “Of course
not.” They both laughed.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Speaking of old news,” Jane said,
a touch of wry sarcasm showing through, “I heard from Lord Ruttheimer last
week. Can you believe it -- I think the little pervert was actually hitting
on me.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Some people never mature,” Quinn
sympathized.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“I couldn’t decide if he was genuinely
looking for consolation or just prowling, hoping for a rebound.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Helen yawned. “Oh my,” she exclaimed,
looking at her watch. “What would your father say if he knew I was up this
late, gabbing like a goose. I’d better show you to your rooms.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria sat motionless as Helen stood
and bustled her sister and her evidently ex-best friend off the couch and
up the stairs. She turned to the ghost, anger written on her features.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“What’s going on?” she demanded.
“Jane best friends with Quinn? I married Pepe le <I>Puke</I> -- just to
piss off my parents?!” Daria rose and took a bold step towards the spectre,
no longer concerned at the proximity. She was too angry to be scared.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“What’s happening?” she yelled, balling
her hands into fists. “<I>Where am I???</I>”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">The next thing she knew, she was
stumbling on the rough ground. She fell to her hands and knees, making
soft impressions in the loamy earth. She struggled to her feet. Attempting
to wipe the smears off of her nightshirt only made it worse -- her hands
were caked in the rough dirt. Daria looked up.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">She was in a graveyard.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">It was a picture right out of a horror
movie. A lonely hill, a crooked tree, the sky dark and fierce. There was
a distant rumble of thunder, as if to warn that at any moment the sky would
burst, unleashing the torrents it held captive. Tombstones littered the
ground around her, and she turned to see the grim spirit, framed by a jagged
burst of lightning that split the sky.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria was ready to scream at the
shock of it, or maybe laugh at the worn cliche. She suppressed both urges.
The spectre was pointing towards a solitary tombstone. Daria felt something
knot up inside of her. She didn’t move. “Is this the same Christmas we
just left at my house?” she asked softly. The ghost nodded.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria stumbled forward, but her eyes
were fixed on the shade, not the tombstone. “What?” she rallied. “I’m DEAD?
Is that what you’re saying?”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">The ghost pointed.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“What can I do <I>DEAD</I>?” Daria
screamed over the rising wind.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">The ghost pointed.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">With a thunderflash, the rain broke,
sparing Daria the trouble of wondering whether or not she was crying. She
stumbled forward again, and the ghost continued to point, stabbing a solitary
finger through the air like a dagger. She wiped her at her eyes, forgetting
that her hands were covered in filth, and she cried out in pain as grit
scraped across her cheeks.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">She didn’t want to look at the tombstone.
She couldn’t bear it. All the philosophy in the world could not have prepared
her for this moment. But the presence of the third spirit weighed upon
her. She fell to her knees before the grave, but did not want to look up.
She raised her chin, but did not want to see those words. How could she
accept the tangible sight ... to look at the stone and see the name ...</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Jake Morgendorffer,” she whispered
in horror. “1950 to 2003 ... No!” She ripped her gaze away from the headstone,
head jerking frantically up to the ghost. “<I>NO!!!</I>” she raged, the
rain whipping her hair back, streaming down her face. “<I>GOD DAMN IT,
WHY?</I>” she howled over the storm.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">In one smooth motion, the ghost reached
up and pulled back it’s hood. Daria found herself staring into the bitter,
accusatory eyes of her own aunt Amy. Daria shrank from the penetrating
glare. “Look,” Amy sneered. “Look what you <I>threw away</I>!” Stooping,
she reached down and seized Daria by the back of the hair, wrenching her
neck around and brutally shoving Daria’s face into the hard stone ...</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">... and with a jolt, Daria was surrounded
by quiet. She felt herself curled into a ball on a flat surface. There
was no rain beating on her face; no sound of storm. She realized that her
eyes were squeezed shut. For several moments, she breathed without moving,
letting her heart rate settle. When at last she was sure nothing was happening
to her, she breathed a long sigh of relief and opened her eyes.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">She was not in her room. Daria stood
up, dazed, looking without comprehension at the night sky. She looked around.
No streets save the long one she was standing on. No houses. No spirits
of any kind. She was completely and utterly alone.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“I don’t understand,” she whispered
to herself. “It’s supposed to end here.” But a nagging voice inside of
her would not be silenced. <I>It’s not over,</I> the voice sang. <I>The
other spirits -- they left too, and they left you!</I> She chilled inwardly
and turned around. Behind her, was a small hill, topped by a lonely house.
A solitary path led up to the front door. Daria stared at it in wonder.
She was inexorably drawn towards this place.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">And then, her feet began to move
-- seemingly of their own volition. They walked towards the path. They
walked towards the house. Daria was afraid, but she could not stop moving.
It was as if some alien force had seized her body. Besides, she resigned
herself, there’s nowhere else to go.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">There was a curious freedom that
accompanied the inevitability of motion. Her brain seemed to detach itself
from her body, demanding to be heard.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“I understand,” she whispered to
herself as she walked up the front steps. “It’s about a problem with my
story.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">She entered the front door.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“The story of my life, as I wrote
about it, as I wanted it.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Inside, her body turned to the right.
There was flickering firelight from an open door.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Everything was perfect because everybody
changed. In my hopes and my dreams everybody changed to fit me. Quinn changed.
She gets mature. Dad changes. He calms down. Mom isn’t worried.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">The room that cast shadows was a
small parlor, sparsely decorated. A large-backed chair faced the crackling
fire.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“But I didn’t change. I stayed exactly
the same.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">She moved towards the chair.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“What, did I think the perfect world
would just happen? That all my dreams would fall into place without me?
I got mad when they didn’t change.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">She walked around in front of the
fire.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“I got mad because I couldn’t change
them, except I can’t change them, I can only change ...”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">She turned around ...</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“... myself.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">... and stared into a pair of eyes
so cold, so dead, so completely devoid of hope and bereft of all humanity
that it froze her soul. It was a face out of Neitzsche’s nightmares.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">The face was her own.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">And Daria Morgendorffer woke up.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<CENTER><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT SIZE=+1>The End at
Last</FONT></FONT></I></CENTER>
&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">It was the warm glow of sunlight,
shining crystal-clear through the window to spread the breadth of the room,
that greeted Daria’s waking eyes.</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Then the night’s memories came rushing
back to her. Bolting upright, her head a whirlwind of emotions, Daria grabbed
for her phone and dialed.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“What day is this?” Daria demanded,
not caring who had answered the phone.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Why, it’s Christmas Day!” Jane declared,
playing along under the assumption that her best friend had <I>not</I>
gone insane. “That was easy, give me a tougher one.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria heaved a giant sigh of relief.
“Merry Christmas!”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">There was a pause as Jane rethought
her assumptions about Daria’s sanity. “If that’s a question, the answer
is yes. You’ll never believe ...”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Your family came home last night,”
Daria interrupted.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">There was another pause. “How come
Santa didn’t bring me any psychic powers?” Jane complained at last.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria stifled a laugh (a laugh!)
“Lucky guess,” she told her friend. “Listen, I’ll call you later. Right
now I need to go check on my family. Wish Trent a Merry Christmas for me!”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Sure,” Jane said. “And hey, come
on over this afternoon, we’ll go out for ...” She was talking to the dial
tone.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria, meanwhile, had leapt out of
bed and was struggling into her usual outfit. After a moments thought,
she ran over to the top drawer of her dresser and fished out the old pendant
she kept for special occasions. “It’s Christmas,” she reasoned, and slipped
it on.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Cautiously, Daria peeked out into
the hallway. Her parents bedroom door was closed. <I>Mom and Dad, check.</I>
She could hear water running in the bathroom. <I>Quinn, check.</I> Still,
she walked stealthily towards the stairs.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><I>One heck of a dream</I>, she thought
to herself. Even so, an impulse grabbed her as she walked by Quinn’s bedroom.
The door was ajar, and she couldn’t resist peeking inside. There was something
on the floor by the mirror. Moving inside, she bent to investigate. There,
spread across the carpet, were several fashion magazines. And on every
page, her own face looked back at her, having been cut out and pasted atop
those of the models. She checked Quinn’s dresser-top, and, sure enough,
it was covered in mangled photographs. She smirked in amazement. <I>For
me ...&nbsp; she was trying on clothes for me!</I></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">A movement outside Quinn’s window
caught her eye, and she walked over and looked down to see Kevin and Brittany
walking back. Quickly, she fumbled at the latch and raised the window high,
ignoring the blast of cold air on her face. “Hey!” she shouted. The pair
looked up. “What are you doing? Wait! Don’t answer that! Come to my front
door, I’ve got something for you!”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria dashed back to her room and
dove halfway under the bed, grasping for the cardboard box she knew was
there somewhere. Finding it, she forced her fingers under the lid and yanked
it out, dragging several pairs of socks and an old pair of headphones out
with it. She opened the box and smiled. Inside were books from her childhood.
Winnie the Pooh. Paddington Bear. Dr. Seuss. They were well-loved, but
they were perfectly readable. Scrambling to her feet, she ran back out
into the hall and down the stairs.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Kevin and Brittany were waiting at
the front door, shivering from the cold. Kevin was still wearing nothing
but his football uniform. He had set down the box full of toys, to which
Daria deposited the contents of her own box.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Thanks, Daria!” Brittany squeaked.
“We were just on our way to the donation center.” She examined the new
contributions, picking up a Clifford book. “Wow, Daria, I didn’t know you
had such good taste in literature.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Hey!” Kevin exclaimed between chatters,
examining the cover. “He’s got a Frisbee! Coool!”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“They’re for the kids,” Daria cautioned.
“You want a copy, ask the nice lady at the mall information booth to show
you where the book store is. You can put some of that money you made working
at the nut stand to good use.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Kevin grinned. “Hey, thanks!”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Say, Daria,” Brittany said, twirling
one long pig-tail around her finger. “I’m having a party for New Years,
and I don’t think I’ve invited a literary consultant yet. Do you want to
come?”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">To her own surprise, Daria didn’t
instantly dismiss Brittany. “I’ll think about it,” she said, and meant
it. “And Kevin? Next time, put a coat on.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Kevin managed a thumbs-up before
he bent down and picked up the box. “Oh, Kevvie, you’re so strong,” Brittany
gushed, and then they were gone.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria closed the door and turned
around to find Quinn at the foot of the steps, her parents right behind.
Daria stiffened, full of conflicting emotions, not sure what to say or
what to do. Amending things with Kevin and Brittany were one thing. But
her family ...</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Quinn made the first move. “I woke
up Mom and Dad,” she said, eyes brimming with excitement, oblivious to
her older sister’s discomfort.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Merry Christmas, sweetie,” Helen
offered with a smile. Next to her, Jake smiled and nodded in his usual
manner. It appeared a night’s sleep had done him good.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">As Daria struggled for a response,
Quinn had rushed over to the Christmas Tree and was tearing open her envelope
with unbridled enthusiasm. She unfolded the card and gave a squeal of delight
at the contents. “Daria, how did you know?” she exclaimed, waving the green
bills in the air. “God, I was so afraid you’d try and buy me clothes.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Um ... don’t mention it?”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“Here,” Quinn said, procuring a package
from behind the tree. “This is for you.”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Slowly, Daria walked over and took
it. Deliberately, she unwrapped the box, unfolding the paper and preparing
for the worst. To her surprise, she did not recoil at the first sight of
the dark-blue dress. It was elegant in a certain way that appealed to her,
with none of the excesses of design that Daria despised.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“I know you don’t like big floppy
dresses,” Quinn offered hastily, “I mean, who does? And I know you’re kind
of attached to that thing you wear, but I figured, I mean, I know you don’t
go out or anything, at least not for dressing up, but if you ever <I>do</I>
want to go out, I mean really go out and look nice, that is to say, better,
then now you have something to ...”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">She acted on impulse. It was something
she could not recall ever doing before, as far back as she could remember.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Daria hugged her sister.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Quinn fell instantly silent at this
uncharacteristic and out-of-the-blue show of affection. A million thoughts
blazed through her mind, phrases rising to the tip of her tongue. <I>“What
are you doing?” “What’s wrong with you Daria?” “Ewwww!” “God, what would
the Fashion Club say!” “Daria, puh-leeze! Not in front of the parents!”</I>
But Quinn said none of them. To her great personal surprise, she actually
found herself returning the gesture.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">To Helen, arm clasped in Jake’s,
the embrace seemed like it would last forever. The sentiment might not
outlive the day, she knew from experience, but for a few short hours that
simple act of love would bridge a gap that a decade of bitter sibling rivalry
had sundered -- a gap she had feared was permanent. “It’s the best Christmas
present we could have!” she whispered to her husband, a single tear threatening
to escape her eye.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Jake could not disagree. In that
singular moment, his heart was full to bursting, and it was stronger than
ever. The paradox did not bother him. For once in his life, he was sure
nothing could bother him. It was in that impenetrable moment that his naive
joy outweighed all his adult sensibilities and imagined dignities. It bubbled
up inside him and defined his every feature. In a sublime quirk of fate,
time stood still as the love he felt miraculously resonated between his
wife and his children, nothing held back. It was a first; a bond forged
that would never be broken; a moment that would stand through time undiminished
as the years flew by, he was as certain of it as he had ever been certain
of anything in his entire life.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">“God bless us,” he declared to himself,
to the world. “God bless us, every one!”</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">And that is one wish, dear readers,
that <I>always</I> comes true.</FONT>

&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">NOTES</FONT></B>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">The quote at the beginning of this
document is taken from <I>The Inferno</I> of Dante, Canto I,&nbsp; lines
10-12. John Ciardi translates it as “How I came to it I cannot rightly
say; so drugged and loose with sleep had I become; when I first wandered
from the True Way.” I chose it because it represents the act of recognizing
error -- the underlying theme of his <I>Commedia</I>, and the core theme
behind <I>Christmas Carol</I> (see Introduction.)</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">I want to make it plain that by using
Christmas, I am NOT proposing a religion for the Morgendorffers. While
I have my own views on the subject, the ambiguity is essential and the
debate not worth my time. They DO, however, celebrate Christmas to a certain
extent. At least, Daria did during the<I> Beavis &amp; Butt-head</I> years
-- as demonstrated in several episodes and comics.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">As it relates to the original Dickens,
this story contains many intricacies. The entire opening passage, for example,
is a careful paraphrase of the original Dickens opening. However, the simile
was impossible to extend completely, nor would it have been appropriate
to do so.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">The careful reader will note many
parallels between the events witnessed by Daria, and the original events
witnessed by Scrooge. Brittany and Kevin are the charity collectors who
Scrooge threw out. Both Daria and Scrooge witnessed a party, symbolic of
happier times. Scrooge’s rejection of his fianc&eacute;e finds its reflection
in Daria’s rejection of her new sister. The meeting in the faculty lounge
evokes the cruel party guests of Scrooge’s nephew Fred, whose devotion
to his uncle is represented in Jane’s unconditional friendship. Daria’s
own family takes the role of the Cratchit family, with Jake standing in
for Tiny Tim.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">A few words on the casting choices.
Believe me, it was difficult, and I expect that any controversy or difference
of opinion will arise over the casting of the three (four) Christmas spirits.
During the pre-production of this fic, when I asked for suggestions, I
received many calls for Jane, Daria’s family, or members of the Lawndale
High Faculty. There are a lot of good ideas for casting there, and a lot
of fun and appropriate roles. But this fic is not primarily a comedy. Since
all of the aforementioned people are focal points of the story, I didn’t
want to confuse the roles of subject and object. In other words, I wanted
the spirits to be isolated from the examples they were pointing out. Fortunately,
the cast of Daria is diverse. Beavis and Butt-head were the perfect link
to Daria’s past; Jodie Landon, always looking for the best in people, and
strong of character, was the perfect expression of the confident optimism
necessary for the part of Christmas Present; and Amy, with her sarcastic
outlook, and one of the few adults Daria actually respects, nicely stood
in to demonstrate Daria’s future. So there you have it: my reasoning, no
apologies.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">I honestly did want to slam the pathetic
Christmas spirit from “Depth Takes a Holiday,” but there was no easy way
to work it into the text, and there’s no <I>way</I> I was disrupting the
pace of my story for <I>that</I> loser. Consider this his derision.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">In conclusion, there were too many
ideas along the way to fit into this fic. In fact, my original premise
was a looser, more cynical, comedy-oriented story, and was going to be
written in script-format. Truth be told, I still want to write this version
someday. Perhaps next Christmas. In the meantime, I hope this stands as
a more reflective (if you can get past the emotional saturation) testament
to the spirit of Christmas, and more importantly, the spirit of renewal
and personal growth. Happy Holidays! And God bless.</FONT>
