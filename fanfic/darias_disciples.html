<P>Morgendorrfer living room...</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>"Tips for reconstructive surgery from Dr.  Frankenstein.  Next on Sick, Sad World."</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><EM>Jane</EM> <EM>sighs as she clicks off the TV</EM>  </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Daria	That sounded like the sigh of someone who's distraught.  <EM>After getting no answer </EM>Ok, ok
stop!  I can't take your outpouring of feelings any longer. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Jane	What?  Oh, sorry.  You know how I hate keeping things bottled up.  I might burst like
that water tower back in third grade.  How would you like pieces of my skin, blood and
guts splatter painted all over your living room?</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><EM>Daria moves from the couch to the chair with a look of feigned sickness</EM>.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Jane	<EM>ignoring Daria's reaction</EM> Did you ever wish you were popular?</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Daria	<EM>with absolutely no hesitation</EM> No.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Jane	<EM>sounding almost hopeful</EM> Not even a teeny, tiny bit?</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Daria	<EM>humoring Jane</EM> Well,... no.  <EM>She shakes her head for emphasis.</EM>  Why the sudden need for
senseless human interaction?</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Jane	<EM>moves to the other end of the couch, closer to Daria's newly acquired seat and drapes
her arms over the side.  </EM>Don't get me wrong, .I love spending the weekend hanging out
with just one best friend.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Daria	<EM>deadpan  </EM>Uh oh, this is where we break up.  Is it my breath?  My lack of personal
hygiene?  I'll bet it's my minuscule vocabulary.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Jane	<EM>ignoring Daria</EM> <EM>again   </EM>I mean, there are so many ways we can communicate.  But just
once I'd like to have a group of friends large enough to fill a table in the cafeteria.  Or
maybe be part of a group where no one really cares about anyone but themselves.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Daria	Should I tell Quinn to call a special meeting of The Fashion Club to discuss inducting
two new members?</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Jane	<EM>tumbling back into reality from her visions of popularity </EM>At least with the two of us
hanging out alone so much  we don't have to do much explaining.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Daria	I'm glad you're back.  I was beginning to think I'd lost the only other sane person I've
ever met.  <EM>After a moment of thought, Daria continues sarcastically.  </EM>But, if we were
members of The Fashion Club we'd be so popular we could hang out with different
people every night.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><EM>Ding-dong</EM></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Jane	Speak of the devils...</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Quinn	<EM>running down the stairs  </EM>I'll get it!  It's for me.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Daria	Oh darn.  I really wanted to greet The Fabulous Fashion Club.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Quinn	<EM>horrified </EM>Daria, you <EM>can't</EM> get the door!  They'll think you live here or something.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Jane	Where would they get a crazy idea like that?</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Quinn	I don't know, but I can't take any chances.  Just think what it would do to my reputation
if my friends thought you <EM>actually</EM> <EM>lived </EM>here.  <EM>She shudders and reaches for the
doorknob.  Then, she quickly ushers Sandi, Tiffany and Stacey past the living room and
upstairs.</EM></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><EM>The phone rings, and Daria picks it up.  </EM>Hello.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Helen	Hi, honey.  It's mom.  Your father and I are in our hotel room now.  Is everything ok
there?</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Daria	<EM>without emotion </EM>Sure.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Helen	Has The Fashion Club arrived yet?</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Daria	Yep.  And they've invited a few boys over.  They're all going to sleep in Quinn's room
tonight.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Helen	That's nice, dear.  You girls don't stay up too late.  We'll call again tomorrow after our
meetings, ok?</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Daria	Whatever.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Helen	Goodnight.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Daria	'Night.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Jane	Pizza?</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><EM>A peal of laughter is heard from Quinn's room followed by the ringing of her private phone.</EM></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Daria	Pizza.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Later that night...</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><EM>The Fashion Club is sleeping in Quinn's room.  Daria and Jane tiptoe past to Daria's room and
fall asleep quickly.  Daria begins to dream.  She is switching books from her backpack to her
locker as they approach.</EM></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Sandi	<EM></EM>Hello, Daria.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Stacey and Tiffany	Yeah.  Hello, Daria.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><EM>Daria grudgingly returns the greeting.  The trio encircles her and stares interestedly at her.</EM> <EM>
Jane comes up.  She squeezes between Sandi and Tiffany to get to her locker and raises her
eyebrows at Daria.</EM></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Jane	When did you become a super-model, and why didn't you tell your best friend?</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Daria	I didn't.  <EM>Turning to Sandi </EM>Did you just call me Daria?</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Sandi	Yeah.  That is your name, isn't it?  <EM>She looks terrified, as if she actually cares about
getting Daria's name right.</EM></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Daria	Yeah, but... <EM>she can't help herself</EM>   why?</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><EM>Jane starts backing off, waving her hands.  </EM>Wait a minute.  Did I miss something?</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Stacey	We just came over to ask Daria to teach us to be more like her.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Sandi	Sta-cey, <EM>I </EM>was supposed to be the one to tell her.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Stacey	<EM>looking like a scolded puppy  </EM>Sorry.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Daria and Jane	What?!</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Quinn	<EM>upset because she isn't the center of attention and becoming nervous when she realizes
that Daria is.  </EM>What's going on? </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Daria	<EM>matter-of-factly </EM>  I've got disciples.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Quinn	What?!  <EM>The three J/s catch her when she faints. </EM></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>That evening...</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><EM>The Fashion Club is huddled in Daria's room   Daria and Jane sit on Daria's bed watching as
each girl models her new outfit.  All three are wearing exact replicas of Daria's ensemble, right
down to the glasses.  In the midst of this hubbub, Quinn opens the door, screams and runs.</EM></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Tiffany  <EM>in her usual drawl</EM>  What's her problem?</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Sandi	She's not as cool as we are.  <EM>She thrusts her pointy nose into the air.</EM></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The next day at lunch...</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><EM>Daria and Jane sit at a table with Sandi, Tiffany and Stacey.</EM></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Jane	<EM>looking at all the green jackets around her  </EM>I gotta change my style of dress.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Daria	<EM>trying not to choke on the food that the three J's keep trying to shove  into her mouth </EM>   
Yeah.  Dressed like that you don't fit in at this table.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><EM>At a table in the far corner sits a forlorn looking Quinn.  She's thinking how could her friends
dessert her for </EM>Daria<EM>?  She </EM>has<EM> to do something about it.  She sighs and sneaks out of the
cafeteria.  </EM> <EM>She has no need to sneak; however, for no one is paying any attention to her.  On her
way out, she spies Joey, Jamie and Jeffery or whatever kneeling in admiration around Daria. 
Bitterly, she thinks {VO} "What would Daria do with a guy?  She'd probably let him decide
where to go and what to do".</EM></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><EM>Soon, lunch is over, and people begin filing out of the cafeteria.  As they do, they stop to gape at
a figure coming down the hall.  </EM></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Daria	Look out.  It's a walking vat of vindictiveness.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Brittany	Don't be silly, Daria.  Bats don't walk.  They fly.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Stacey	<EM>shakily</EM> What is it?</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Jane	Whatever it is, it sure ain't from this planet.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Daria	You can say that again.  It's Quinn.  And she's looking quite stylish today I might add.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Quinn	<EM>tossing her head and twirling runway style </EM>Hello, everyone.  How do I look?    <EM>She is
dressed exactly like Daria except for the large brown choker around her neck.</EM></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Jane<EM>	to Daria</EM> Like something dredged up from the depths of Picasso's imagination. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Tiffany	Where did you get that choker, Quinn?  I've never seen anything so cool.  <EM>She
approaches Quinn and fingers the choker.</EM></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Stacey	<EM>casting a tentative glance at Sandi </EM>Yeah.<EM> </EM></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Quinn	<EM>smugly, as if her choker was the Hope Diamond.  </EM>  I got it at this cool new store in the
mall.  You'll have to go there with me sometime.  The sales-guy who sold it to me was
really cute.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Sandi	<EM>still standing with the crowd, lips pursed, arms folded.  </EM>That necklace may be cool, but it
doesn't match that outfit.  <EM>Stacey looks at Sandi, folds her arms and glares in Quinn's
direction.  She can't bring herself to glare directly at Quinn.</EM></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Quinn<EM>	defensively  </EM> Of course it doesn't.  I was a little unsure of what to wear today.  I haven't
gotten enough beauty sleep lately, so my brain is a little tired.  <EM>She hopes Sandi will buy
her excuse and feel sorry for her.</EM></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Jane	A little?</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Daria	Brain?</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Sandi	<EM>displaying mock concern </EM>Gosh, Quinn.  It's a good thing you came to us now before you
wore something even more hideous than that.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Tiffany	Yeah.  And you were so brave to admit that you were having fashion trouble in
front of <EM>everyone</EM>.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Quinn	So, will you guys help me? Say, <EM>{as if she just came up with the idea}</EM> my house?  7:30
tonight?  <EM>She tilts her head and bats her eyelashes for added affect.</EM></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Tiffany and Stacey	<EM>excitedly </EM>Sure!</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>The next morning...</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><EM>Daria is at her locker when they approach her.</EM></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Sandi	Hi, Daria.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><EM>Stunned, Daria freezes.</EM></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Sandi	Daria?  <EM>Daria is too terrified to respond. </EM>Daria!</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Jane	<EM>roughly shaking Daria   </EM>Daria!</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Daria	Huh?  <EM>She sits up and rubs her eyes.  </EM>What a nightmare!  That's the last time I listen to
you before I go to sleep.  <EM>At Jane's confused look, Daria recounts her dream.</EM>  </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Jane	Wow!  I should get a licence for giving people nightmares.  Jane Lane, Subconscious
Destruction Inc.  Need a nightmare?  Call 1-800-TERROR.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><EM>There is a knock on Daria's door.  </EM></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Sandi	{OS} Daria or whatever, we really need your help. </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><EM>Daria opens the door to see the four Fashion Club members gazing expectantly at her.  She
looks at Jane, and the two exchange a mental groan.</EM></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Alter Egos.<EM> </EM></P>
