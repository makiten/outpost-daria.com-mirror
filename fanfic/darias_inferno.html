<strong>Extreme Spoiler Alert:</strong>
This novelization precisely follows the script for the computer game 
<em>Daria's Inferno</em>.  It therefore contains solutions to all
the challenges encountered in the game.  If you have never played
<em>Daria's Inferno</em> and intend to do so
in the future you are strongly advised
against reading this story!  On the other hand, if you have
already mastered the game, read on.  As Daria herself explains, 
"An action packed world of sedentary fun awaits!"  
Or, as Quinn puts it, "It isn't just for 
geeks!"&nbsp;<a href="#quotes">[5]</a>

<p>
la-la LA la-la ...
</p>

<p>
It was a hot and muggy day in Timothy O'Neill's English class at
Lawndale High
School.  As he painstakingly wrote the words
<blockquote>
Dante's Inferno
</blockquote>
on the blackboard, his students struggled to stay awake, among them
smart and cynical 
Daria Morgendorffer, her friend Jane Lane, and their classmates
Brittany Taylor, Kevin Thompson,
Michael "Mack" MacKenzie and
Jodie Landon.
</p>

<p>
"Now, just to show that medieval literature can be fun," O'Neill said
with his usual irritating enthusiasm, "we're going
to join the poet Dante on his trip to hell."
</p>

<p>
At this point the chalk broke and his fingernails scraped across the
blackboard.  As one, the class winced: "Ow!"
</p>

<p>
Misinterpreting his students' reactions, as usual, O'Neill apologized.
"Sorry!  I guess that is a harsh word ... so we call it Dante's
<em>Inferno</em>."
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the door flew open and School Principal Angela Li strode in
to the classroom.  Unannounced appearances by Ms Li were never a 
good omen!
</p>

<p>
Ignoring 
her underling
O'Neill, she immediately launched into an angry address
to the class.
"Attention Lawndale students!  It seems that larceny has enrolled at
Laaawndale High," she said, drawing out the name of her beloved
school.
</p>

<p>
"The following items are missing."
As she named each one she held up a corresponding
page from the school's disturbingly detailed inventory of assets.
"A #2 pencil that belongs to the fine people that give the
SATs.  The key to authorized freedom and bathroom use: a hall pass.
<em>Winnie the Pooh</em>, the only book in the school library anyone
can actually read."
</p>

<p>
With each item her fury grew, but the next one seemed to cause her
particular grief. "In a stunning breach of discipline, my
disciplinarian award has been stolen."  She held up a picture
of an ugly statuette.
</p>

<p>
Finally, she composed herself
a little to complete the list, "And the symbol of Lawndale's
gridiron pride, the Lawndale Lion."  The corresponding picture
showed
the motheaten head of the football team's mascot.  
"He roars no more."
</p>

<p>
Her steely glare scanned the room as she concluded,
"Until these items are returned, the entire school will be put on
detention, and there will be no more marshmallows on the cafeteria's
pudding."
</p>

<p>
With that she swept out of the room, shouting back
a halfhearted attempt at civility, "Thank you!  You may resume 
your learning."
</p>

<p>
O'Neill simply said, "Oh my!"  Similar intrusions had occurred so often 
during his tenure at Lawndale High that he saw nothing unusual in this
dramatic interruption.
</p>

<p>
Without a pause he returned to the lesson, 
"Now, let's all go to hell ... I mean, let's all go with
Dante to his inferno.  It starts in a dark forest.  A forest of
Dante's spiritual confusion."
</p>

<p>
"He meets his guide the Roman poet Virgil
who takes him out of the woods and into the inferno."
As O'Neill's soporific voice droned on his disinterested students 
rested
their heads on their desks and, one by one, nodded off.  
</p>

<p>
"Some of you
might think Dante was better off in the woods,"
continued O'Neill, oblivious as always to the reactions of
his charges, "but he has to go
through the inferno to get to purgatory.  And finally, to paradise."
</p>

<p>
The battle to stay awake was especially difficult for Daria.  Thanks
to her insatiable appetite for literature, she had long ago read the
works of the thirteenth century Italian
poet, so nothing O'Neill was saying was new to her.
</p> 

<p>
With the rest of the class asleep, Daria succumbed too.  Her eyes
closed behind her thick glasses and her head slumped down on the
desk.  But even as she began to doze, O'Neill's voice continued to ring
in her head, "So let's begin the first chapter of Daria's Inferno."
</p>

<p>
Wait a minute!  Did he say <em>Daria</em>'s Inferno?  Suddenly Daria
felt herself falling, down and down.
"I thought Dante was writing before they invented cheap special
effects," she thought, as multicolored spirals circled around her.
"This isn't English class - it's actually interesting!"
</p>

<p>
Below her wasn't the usual fire and brimstone, however.  She
seemed to be falling onto a gigantic vision of her own face, which 
was coming alarmingly close.
"A little too interesting!" she thought.  "Note to my Big Head: 
don't open your mouth."
With collision imminent she mused, "Landing is the part of falling
that I've never liked."
</p>

<p>
"Whoa!" exclaimed Daria at the moment of impact, sitting bolt upright.  
She was in her own
bedroom, on her bed.  The padded walls and barred windows 
seemed reassuringly normal.
"Oh," she thought, "It was just a dream."
</p>

<p>
But as she stood up,
something still didn't seem right.  "Hold it," she thought,
"Why am I in my room?  I usually do my sleeping in class."  
She walked over to the window.  This was creepy!
Outside, Lawndale's blue sky was filled with huge disembodied
bloodshot eyeballs,
flying
back and forth!&nbsp;<a href="#eyeballs">[6]</a>
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I see," thought Daria calmly.  "School was called off because of
the weather."  She wondered what to do next.  "So do I
stay here or go out and play in the hallucination?"
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a familiar voice cried out eerily, "Daria!  Daria 
Morgendorffer!"  It was coming from Daria's cheerful poster of
a partially-unearthed skeleton.  "What do you want, Mr Ugly Painting?"
Daria asked.
</p>

<p>
As Daria watched,
the picture suddenly shimmered and changed from a skeleton to Daria's
close friend Jane Lane.
"That's <em>Ms</em> Ugly Painting, thank you very much," she said.  
</p>

<p>
"Jane?" Daria said in surprise as the image of her friend sat up and
shook off the loose soil.
</p>

<p>
"Last time I tried that with a Picasso
and wound up with one of my eyes on my butt," commented Jane.
"And now for some fast paced spiritual journey
action.  We're going to hell!"
</p>

<p>
"That's a relief," replied Daria.  "I was worried we were going
back to class."
</p>

<p>  
Jane seemed intent on giving Daria some instructions. 
"You must find Ms Li's missing junk or endure eternal detention,"
she said.
"Follow the clues, Daria," she added meaningfully.
"Remember, I am with you ... unless I find
something else to do, or you start whining!"  
</p>

<p>
"How convenient," said Daria dryly.
</p>

<p>
Undeterred, Jane continued pompously,
"Follow me, and through your courage, virtue, wisdom and a cheesy
little bag of tricks, you shall save Lawndale High from the purgatory
of detention."
</p>  

<p>
Once again Daria felt herself falling and her surroundings changing.
"Find Ms Li's five missing items or be stuck in this dream forever," 
she thought.
"An eternity in hell or back to English class.  Choices, choices!"
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
Jane's voice continued to echo through Daria's mind as she fell.
"Lawndale High...  Give up your brains all ye who enter here and find
the disciplinarian award.  Seek the tower.  Its secret lies with Mr
DeMartino.  Find DeMartino," Jane intoned spookily
until Daria suddenly felt 
solid ground beneath her sturdy combat boots once more.
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
Daria opened her eyes.  She was standing in an ordinary looking suburban
street.  Or at least it would be ordinary if it wasn't for the
deep cracks in the earth oozing red-hot lava!
</p>

<p>
Cautiously, Daria started walking.  "I must be near Lawndale High.  
I can smell the stench of human
defeat," she said to herself.  "Or is that the cafeteria?"
</p>

<p>
The streets were deserted, but something shiny on the road
ahead caught her attention.
As she approached she saw that it was a small remote
control with a single red button.  
"Another marvel of technology - a door opening thingy," she thought
as she picked it up.  "A garage door opener for an eternity
of garage door opening fun."  No good.  This wasn't one
of Ms Li's lost items.
</p>

<p>
Nearby was another useless looking find, sticking out of a mailbox.
"A wrench," she muttered, pulling it out.  
"Isn't that what the Three Stooges use for cosmetic
surgery?"  She couldn't see any immediate use for this either.
Nevertheless, something told her these items may come in handy
later so she tucked them away in the capacious pockets of her
unfashionable green jacket.&nbsp;<a href="#pockets">[7]</a>
</p>

<p>
Daria continued to pick her way through the strangely 
distorted streetscape.  Slowly the jumble of houses and yards
seemed to close in on her until she could go no further.
The only way forward was through
a near-empty swimming pool, but it was too wide to jump across and
too deep to jump into.  And besides, Daria doesn't 
jump!&nbsp;<a href="#jumping">[8]</a>
</p>

<p>
Sitting on a nearby fire hydrant to ponder
the situation, she reasoned that if she could fill the
pool she could walk across the inflatable beds and toys currently
lying on its bottom.  That's when she remembered the wrench!
"Twisting bolts or noses can be easy and fun when you've got a real
workman's wrench," she said to herself as she used it to open the
hydrant.  
</p>

<p>
Sure enough, water gushed into the pool, filling it to the brim.
"I feel like I'm in an episode of This Old Hydrant," thought Daria as
she walked carefully over the surface of the now-full pool by treading
on the floating toys.
</p>

<p>
Having reached the other side she noticed a small red life preserver
with a yellow rope attached, now floating on the surface.  "Just the 
thing," she thought, "for that sinking feeling that this
dream's&nbsp;<a href="#dreamgame">[9]</a> going to go on forever."
</p>

<p>
Surely a life preserver
would be advantageous in hell!  This too was crammed into her
jacket's pocket.  After all, she thought, a life preserver allows one
to "say goodbye to those annoying floating corpses."
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<blockquote>
<em>
It's the charge of the trike brigade!  Half-pint bikers and the
garage doors that stop them, next on Sick Sad 
World!</em>&nbsp;<a href="#ssw">[10]</a>
</blockquote>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
In the distance Daria could see the entrance to the school.
"Lawndale High," she thought dejectedly.  "Now I know I'm in hell."
</p>

<p>
But as she got closer she noticed that its semi-circular driveway
was being used as a racetrack
by former baby-sitting job Tad Gupty on a tricycle.
He was competing with
the little girl who Daria often saw riding her 'Big Wheel' trike past
Daria's house.&nbsp;<a href="#clones">[11]</a>
</p>

<p>
"Oh no," Daria said, "Hell's Angels on Big Wheels!"
</p>

<p>
Getting closer she found another remote control on the ground.
"The subconscious of a true loser," she thought as she picked it
up, "I'm dreaming about garage door
openers."
</p>

<p>
If she was to follow Jane's directions she needed to get into the
school, but as she approached she found it impossible to get past
the two midget racers who were zooming around at amazing speed.
</p>

<p>
"Ow!  Watch it vermin!" she cried as Tad's tricycle ran over her toe.
</p>

<p>
She stepped back and looked around for a way to get rid of the pests.
Over to her left, and strangely close to the school in this
distorted world, was a garage.  Maybe she could open it and find 
something
to help.  
</p>

<p>
Fishing out one of the door openers she had put in
her pocket, she pointed it and pressed the button.
"More garage door action and thrills," she
commented flatly.
</p>

<p>
Before she had a chance to do anything else, her tiny
antagonists saw the
newly revealed pathway and, with squeals of delight, raced their 
vehicles into the garage.
</p>

<p>
Pleased by this easy success Daria walked back to the school entrance
only to find it blocked by Tad and Big-Wheel Girl yet again!  How
did they get back here without going past her?
</p>

<p>
Then she noticed another garage door off to the right, this one open.
Somehow the two garages must be connected and the annoying
kids had reemerged from the second garage.
</p>

<p>
With a sigh, Daria trudged over to the open garage.
"This would be a lot more fun if someone were under that door,"
she said as she used the
other remote control to close it.
</p>

<p>
This time when the two racers zoomed back into the first garage they
didn't emerge again.
"So much for Hell's Angel's on Big Wheels," thought Daria as
she finally made her way unimpeded to the school's doorway.
</p>

<p>
She was just about to enter when she saw Physical Education 
teacher Ms Morris nearby.  Probably her least favorite person
to encounter!
</p>

<p>
However, the normally aggressive teacher
was in a surprisingly friendly mood.
"Take this, my mighty whistle," she said, handing the item to Daria.
"You'll need it sooner than you
think.  I gotta take a lap now," she concluded before vanishing
from sight.
</p>

<p>
Daria walked the few steps back to the doorway, casually avoiding
a small stream of lava.  "This whistle's been used," she
thought as she studied it.  "Are there germs in hell?"
</p>

<p>
With a sigh of resignation she pushed the school doors open, to begin a
new stage of the nightmare.
"Note to self," she reflected, "The road to hell isn't paved with 
good intentions, just regular asphalt."
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
Daria looked around the school hallway.  It seemed fairly normal,
although she didn't recall seeing the red-hot
stalagmites poking up through
the floor before!
</p>

<p>
She walked over to Mr O'Neill's English class, where this nightmare had 
begun.  There was no one in sight.  "The hall is empty," she said
to herself, "I guess class is in session."
</p>

<p>
A sign on the door confirmed her suspicions: 
<blockquote>
Mr O'Neill<br>
English<br>
Do not disturb!<br>
Class in session
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Daria walked on, thinking to herself, "When the bell
rings, that's when the real nightmare begins!" 
</p>

<p>
The next room should have been Ms Barch's science class, but the sign on
the door read: 
<blockquote>
Court in Session<br>
The Honourable Janet Barch presiding<br>
Do not disturb!<br>
Class in session
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Both doors proved to be locked.  Remembering Jane's advice, Daria
thought, "Better find DeMartino and his friendly open door
policy first."
</p>

<p>
She walked on and found one more door at the end of the corridor.
It was huge, heavily reinforced and barred.  A sign above
the door said:
<blockquote>
Abandon Hope All Ye Who Enter Here
</blockquote>
Daria turned and started back down the corridor.  
"Must be a good place if I can't get in," she thought.
</p>

<p>
She walked all the way back to the school entrance and started
heading down a different corridor.
"I'm getting more exercise sleeping than I do when I'm awake," she
commented.
</p>

<p>
The next door was to Anthony DeMartino's history class.  Again,
however, it didn't look quite the way she remembered it.  The
heavy brickwork and reinforced timber made it seem
more like the entrance to a medieval torture chamber.
This impression was
reinforced by the legend 
<blockquote>
DeMartino's Dungeon
</blockquote>
scrawled in blood above the door!
</p>

<p>
Disturbed by the strange sounds coming from within, Daria pushed
the door open with trepidation and entered.
"Is that the sound of blood vessels exploding, or Mr DeMartino
teaching?" she wondered aloud.
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<blockquote>

Let the eyes have it when good books turn bad, next on Sick Sad World.
</em>
</blockquote>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
"I see Mr DeMartino's classed-up the joint," Daria commented, looking
around.  Although history lessons often seemed like torture, this time
they really were!  The room was a huge dungeon, filled with torture
devices.  The doorway opened onto a series of narrow ledges.  Down
below was the dungeon itself.  Daria need to find some stairs to
get down to the "class".
</p>

<p>
She stepped in cautiously, but as soon as she did so
a ghostly apparition
rushed at her!  It was another of those giant flying eyeballs,  
floating menacingly, only inches from her face.
</p>

<p>
"Hey, stop staring at me!" shouted Daria, walking away 
briskly.&nbsp;<a href="#staring">[12]</a>
But even as she did so, two more of the horrors appeared.
The three terrifying entities followed her closely as she made her
way along a narrow ledge.
</p>

<p>
Coming from below she could hear the agonized screams of students
suffering Mr DeMartino's lesson.  Looking down she recognized 
goth chick Andrea
and other classmates chained against one of the walls.
</p>

<p>
The eyeballs prevented her from pausing, 
however, and she kept moving as quickly
as she could until the pathway broadened to reveal a peculiar-looking
machine.
</p>

<p>
It consisted of two large panels laying flat on the
floor with a hinge in the
middle.  Both sides were covered with vicious spikes.
Off to the side was a lever with a small sign attached, which
read:
<blockquote>
Turn crank to release trap
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Daria wasn't quite sure what that meant,
but it was worth trying anything at this stage!  She twisted the
lever and immediately the two halves of the spiked device
on the floor snapped
together.  In doing so, it revealed that it
was really a giant book entitled:
<blockquote>
The Catcher in the Eye
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Amused by the pun, Daria walked around the trap, thereby luring the 
eyeballs into hovering directly above the spikes.  She turned the
handle once more, causing the deadly book to squash the eyes
into splatters of ectoplasm.
"Reading can be fun!" thought Daria happily.
</p>

<p>
With the eyeball menace defeated, Daria 
finally had a chance to look around.
She found a flight of stone steps leading down to where the
students were chained up and started to descend.
</p>

<p>
"Can't complain," she thought.  "Last time I had this dream I was in my 
underwear!"
</p>

<p>
Reaching the bottom she saw that the entire history class was
strapped into individual electric chairs!  Up front,
football hero Kevin Thompson and his cheerleader
girlfriend Brittany Taylor had evidently 'volunteered' to answer
some of DeMartino's questions.  The chairs they were strapped into
had wires leading to a switch in the
teacher's hand.
</p>

<p>
No one paid any attention to Daria as she edged forward until she
could hear what was going on.
"Here's a real brain sizzler," shouted DeMartino at Brittany,
his bad eye bulging with frustration.  "What was President Lincoln doing
when he got shot?"
</p>

<p>
Brittany thought for a moment and replied,
"Making a drug bust that went down bad?"
Instantly DeMartino pressed the button in his hand, giving Brittany
an electric shock that caused her to jerk around in the chair.
This might be hell for the students, but it looked like heaven for
DeMartino!
</p>

<p>
By now Daria was at the front of the class, but still no one paid
her any attention.  Instead, DeMartino directed a question
at Kevin.  "This one's for the big money!  Who was our first president?"
</p>

<p>
Cautiously Kevin answered, "Er, Vince Lombardi," before receiving the
inevitable electric shock.  Smoke rose from his hair.
</p>

<p>
Daria stood right next to DeMartino.
Seeing one of the few students who didn't drive him totally
insane, he confided in the teenager. 
"I've got to get my 'emotional wellness' pills or my head's gonna
make like Hiroshima!" he said to her quietly.  "But I gave them to 
O'Neill."
</p>

<p>
As much as Daria disliked her brain-dead classmates, this was too much,
even for her.  She figured that if she could get DeMartino his pills
she might be able to calm him down.  But how could she
get into O'Neill's
locked classroom?
</p>

<p>
Then she noticed the button on the wall
for the bell that signals the end of the period.
She reasoned that
ending the period should cause Mr O'Neill to unlock his
classroom.  As she pushed the button she thought, "That 
should fill the halls with mindless idiots!"
</p>

<p>
Daria quickly retraced her steps out of the torture chamber.
"This would be a lot easier if I remembered to dream that my feet
were wheels," she thought.
</p>

<hr width="50%">

What's the frequency Fido?  Are jocks and cheerleaders going to the
dogs?  The Wonder Years, next on Sick Sad World.
</em>
</blockquote>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
Back in the hallway, Daria found that her plan had worked a little
too well.  The classrooms were open, but now the hallway was packed
with students.  And the worst kind of students from Daria's
perspective - football players and cheerleaders!
</p>

<p>
Trying to weave her way through the mob back to Barch and
O'Neill's classes she was
hit in the face by a pom-pom waving cheerleader.  "That felt a 
little too peppy!" she complained.
Then a football-carrying jock bumped her hard.  "Ow! Go away!" she
cried, her irritation meter registering off the 
charts.&nbsp;<a href="#meter">[13]</a>
</p>

<p>
She needed a way of getting rid of these annoyances.  Then she
remembered a trick she once used to stop Kevin from leaning on her
locker.  Rummaging in her pocket she found the whistle Ms Morris
had given her.  "In hell, no one can hear you whistle," she
thought, "Or can they?"
</p>

<p>
As another pom-pom flailing cheerleader headed in her direction, Daria
blasted the whistle in her ear.  It worked perfectly - the
giver-of-pep cartwheeled in the opposite direction and
out of sight.  "Give me an EXIT!" said Daria in
triumph.
</p>

<p>
The trick was equally effective on the next jock who approached.
One blast of the whistle and his tiny mind instinctively caused
him to hug the football to his chest and run down the corridor.
"Go make us proud!" yelled Daria to the receding figure.
</p> 

<hr width="50%">

</em>
</blockquote>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
With the doors now unlocked Daria first
entered Ms Barch's class.  But
things seemed to have changed a lot since she was last there.  The
classroom had been turned into a huge courtroom.
On the walls were a series
of giant posters titled
<blockquote>
Great Women in History
</blockquote>
and featuring an eclectic
mix including Medusa, Lizzie Borden and Gloria Gaynor!
</p>

<p>
"Give up all Y-chromosomes all ye who enter here," thought Daria as
she walked around the desks.  "Looks like Ms Barch is teaching
the proper way to serve up a man on
a platter!"
</p>

<p>
At one end of the room a female guard was operating a lever which
released male students from a door
onto a conveyer belt running along the floor.
Each student was carried along until he reached a high bench at
the far end, at which sat Barch herself, evidently acting as
judge, jury and executioner.
</p>

<p>
"These guys are headed for Ms Barch," thought Daria with some
sympathy.  "Hell hath no fury like a woman
scorned ... or Ms Barch on a good day!"
</p>

<p>
As each student reached the judge's bench, Ms Barch pronounced the
same sentence, "You were found in possession of 
testosterone and that's enough for
me."  The hapless student then dropped through a trap door into
oblivion.
</p>

<p>
Looking around, Daria noticed three crudely-made, yet familiar,
dolls sitting on a table, each with a number of pins stuck in it.
Evidently Ms Barch had been practising a little magic.
Daria picked one up and, studying the tufts of red hair poking
out of its head, recognized who it was meant to be.
"A Jeffy voodoo doll," she said, "and I thought Ken looked like a dip!"
</p>

<p>
The next doll was blonde and also familiar, "This Jamie voodoo doll looks 
like GI Joe before he went psycho in
'Nam."  Daria picked up the dark-haired
third doll to complete the inevitable
trio, saying without surprise,
"Ah, a Joey voodoo doll," before adding, "I
know a troll doll you could ask out!"
</p>

<p>
Her path was now blocked by the seemingly limitless stream of
boys heading down the conveyor belt towards Ms Barch's biased
form of justice.  Daria walked to the far end where the
guard continued to pull the lever, releasing new victims.  Daria
figured that if she could distract the guard and stop new students
from being added to the line she could get past.
</p>

<p>
Searching through her jacket's
pockets, Daria found the life preserver she
had picked up earlier.  Something told her that this was just the
thing she needed, and she waved it in front of the woman's
face.  The effect was immediate and bizarre.
</p>

<p>
"Darn those kids!" yelled the guard, stripping off her uniform to
reveal a bathing costume.  "How many times have I told them not to
chew
on that pier?"  She then raced from the room, leaving the conveyor
belt unmanned.
</p>

<p>
With the conveyor belt now empty, Daria stepped on allowing it to
carry her
towards Judge Barch.  She soon began to regret this move, however,
when she realized that she may end up going down the same pit as the
other students.
</p>

<p>
Ms Barch loomed closer and closer, but when she saw Daria approaching
her usual scowl was replaced by a rare smile.
"Oh, a skirt," she said.  "You're free to go!"
And with that Daria was able to step off on the other side.
</p>

<p>
She now had a chance to explore the other side of the courtroom, but
was disappointed to find nothing other than a closet door.
Opening it, she found that it was empty except for a pedestal on
which was a
large red button.
</p>

<p>
There didn't seem to be any alternative, so Daria pushed it.
"If anything's broken, I didn't do it!" she protested loudly, just
in case.
</p>

<p>
Turning around Daria saw what pushing the button had done.
It evidently controlled the height of the judicial
bench, which has now been lowered to just a few feet off the
floor.
</p>

<p>
Daria could now see that there was a coiled whip sitting on the
bench.  As she walked back towards the courtroom door
she slyly picked up the whip and shoved it in her pocket.
"Do I want to know where this whip's been?" she thought
as she opened the door.
</p>

<p>
Taking a last look at Ms Barch's
domain, Daria announced, "I am strong, I am invincible, I am leaving."
Australian singer Helen Reddy would have been proud!
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
Walking through the corridor
towards Mr O'Neill's room Daria thought, 
"If they installed a mental detector here they'd never find
anything."&nbsp;<a href="#detector">[14]</a>
</p>

<p>
With the slight unease that she always felt when entering English
class, Daria opened the door.
"As long as Mr O'Neill isn't doing his interpretive dance version of
Hamlet, I'll risk it," she said to herself.
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<blockquote>
<em>
Annoying students flogged in-shape and out of the courtroom.  
Whip it, next on Sick Sad World.
</em>
</blockquote>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
As Daria entered she discovered that all the students
were asleep, just as they had been when this nightmare began.
"As always, Mr O'Neill's teaching dream analysis," she said,
noticing that even the teacher himself was dozing at his desk.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, as Daria walked through the maze of desks she found
that one student was still wide awake.  Charles Ruttheimer III,
better known as "Upchuck", was wandering back and forth in an
agitated state, probably trying to get a look down some sleeping
girl's blouse!
</p>

<p>
"Ow!" Daria said as he bumped hard into her, "Touched by a cootie!"
She'd have to find some way to get rid of him.
</p>

<p>
Remembering Ms Barch's whip, Daria took it out of her pocket and
flicked it at Upchuck the next time he came near.  Unpleasantly,
he didn't seem to mind at all!
"I've been a bad boy," he said coyly, doing a passable impression
of Lou Costello.
</p>

<p>
At least it stopped him getting in Daria's way.
"Um, whip it, whip it good," she said unmusically.
"Guaranteed to raise whelts," she added as she quickly
sidestepped him and put the whip away.
</p>

<p>
With the irritating Upchuck avoided, Daria now had a 
proper chance
to look around the room.  It was just the way she remembered it.
All the students were asleep, including Jane, Jodie, Popular Girl,
and so on.&nbsp;<a href="#popgirl">[15]</a>
</p>

<p>
Most disturbing of all, however, 
was that Daria could see herself, sitting
in her usual seat, head resting on the desk!
Averting her gaze from this unsettling out of body experience, Daria
walked to the side of the class where she noticed a small bottle
of pills on the floor.
They must be DeMartino's!
</p>

<p>
"I think there's enough emotional wellness in this room, thank you,"
said Daria aloud, to excuse her transgression as she purloined the
bottle.  The label read:
<blockquote>
Smiley Face<br>
Happiness in a Pill
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
"Get emotionally well with herbal happy pills," thought Daria
as she walked quickly to the door, "Never mind the
excruciating side effects!"
</p>

<p>
As she exited O'Neill's room, and the creepy sight
of her own unconscious form, Daria thought,
"I can't imagine I imagined this - I need help!"
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
Daria quickly retraced her steps through the hallway and back to
DeMartino's Dungeon.  DeMartino was still "educating" Kevin and Brittany.
</p>

<p>
As Daria walked in the sadistic teacher directed another question
at Kevin.  "I'm not even trying here!" he said.
"What country do you live in?" 
</p>

<p>
With thickheaded enthusiasm Kevin answered, "Lawndale!  It rules!"
Zap!  Kevin received yet another electric shock.
</p>

<p>
DeMartino then turned his attention back to captive Brittany.
"I'll bet my second pair of pants you don't know this one," he said.
"What's the bill that gives you your rights?"
</p>

<p>
Brittany's answer was high-pitched, even by her squeaky standards.
"TV Guide?" she responded before getting zapped again.
</p>

<p>
At this point Daria handed the happiness pills to her teacher.
Without hesitation DeMartino grabbed them and downed a handful.
Instantly his demeanor changed.
</p>

<p>
"Everything's beautiful!" he said unconvincingly.
"I'm just going to go lie down on the warm
dung heap of my life, and you kids go to hell on your own steam." 
He then flaked out where he stood.
</p>

<p>
Behind where DeMartino had been standing
was a door that appeared to lead to a basement.
"The power for the electric chairs must be in here," said Daria 
as she entered.  "Maybe I can
free Kevin and Brittany."  But she then added
to herself, "I said <em>can</em> - I didn't say <em>will</em>!"
</p>

<p>
Leaving DeMartino's history lesson behind Daria thought, 
"That class was just another argument for home schooling."
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<blockquote>
<em>
Break glass in case of error?  Electric chairs turned off with a
sprinkling of advice, next on Sick Sad World.
</em>
</blockquote>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
Entering the basement, Daria found her suspicions confirmed by the
prominent sign that read:
<blockquote>
Danger!<br>
Electric Chair Power Supply!
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Looking around at the tangle of grimy pipes and steam boilers
Daria tried to excuse the decor by commenting,
"This place has a certain janitorial charm."
</p>

<p>
As she searched for a way to turn off the electric chairs she found
her path blocked by scalding steam spurting intermittently
from the rusted and leaking pipes.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, oh!  Bad hair day!" she said in disgust as she was drenched by
a blast of steam.
</p>

<p>
Timing her steps to avoid the periodic
blasts, she cautiously navigated through
the gloom.  As she climbed a rickety metal stairway she
reflected on her unusual mission.
"I help Kevin and Brittany in all my dreams," she thought, "... 
if you call
disembowellment helping!"
</p>

<p>
Finally she found a control panel with a yellow button 
helpfully labelled,
<blockquote>
Push to turn off steam
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Daria pushed it and started retracing
her steps, as the roar of the machinery subsided.
"There, I turned off the steam," she said.
"If only I could turn off people's
hot air like that!"
</p>

<p>
Now that the steam had stopped, Daria noticed a hammer
on the floor which had previously been obscured
by a cloud of steam.
"If I had a hammer," she thought as she picked it up,
"I'd hammer the crap out of the Fashion Club."
</p>

<p>
Not far away, Daria found some intimidating electrical equipment,
which was clearly the control panel for the electric chairs.
However, the floor 
around the panel was wet and Daria didn't like
the idea of operating high voltage switches while standing in a puddle!
</p>

<p>
Looking around for some alternative way of switching off the power
she noticed a glass box bearing the legend:
<blockquote>
Break Glass in Case of Emergency
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Reasoning that the history class's plight constituted an emergency,
Daria raised the hammer to the box.  "Use a hammer and pound 
things like a pro," she said as she smashed the glass and
struck the button within.  "So much easier than
hammering with your head."
</p>

<p>
Daria jumped back as water gushed down from the overhead fire
sprinklers.
It hit the control panel and caused
the power supply
to short out in a spectacular shower of sparks.
"They call me Ms Fixit!" said Daria smugly.
</p>

<p>
"And now for more wholesome educational fun," she thought as she
climbed the stairs back to DeMartino's history dungeon.
</p>

<p>
Taking a last look at the boiler room, she reflected, "Some flowers,
curtains and a blowtorch could fix this place up really nice."
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
Daria surveyed the effects of her sabotage.
"Kevin and Brittany are free," she thought as she saw them standing
amongst the now unrestrained, but still shaken, students.
"Free as the great open sky between
their ears."
</p>

<p>
As Daria approached she noticed that they were both still smoldering.
"That's the last time I sing the body electric!" said Brittany.
</p>

<p>
Kevin was dopily cheerful as always.  "I 
didn't know how hot you were until I saw smoke coming out of your
head!" he told his girlfriend.  "Oh, Kevvy!" sighed Brittany as they
embraced.
</p>

<p>
"Frankly, I like you better howling in agony," 
complained Daria, in an attempt to break
up their sickening smooching, "but business before
pleasure."
</p>

<p>
Indicating a locked wooden door, which she realized must lead to the
tower Jane had mentioned, Daria said, "Kevin, your mind 
is the key that will open this door."
</p>
  
<p>
"His mind?" squeaked Brittany in happy surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Actually, the skull that encases it," explained Daria, killing the
mood.
</p>

<p>
"I can do that!" said Kevin enthusiastically, glad to be given
a challenge that matched his talents.
"Check this out, Brittany!" he yelled, running head first
at the door.  "I'm gonna use my head!"
</p>

<p>
Crack!  The door splintered into a thousand pieces, its heavy
planks and metal bracing no match for the thickness of Kevin's
skull.  Kevin was dazed but still smiling inanely.
</p>

<p>
As Daria stepped through the doorway she sighed in despair
as she overheard
Brittany saying "Oh, Kevvy, you're an intellectual!"
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
Through the doorway was a peculiar mix of medieval architecture and
modern technology.
"I'll bet this is the tower with the disciplinarian award thingy
Jane was talking about," thought Daria as she craned her neck
to stare up at the imposing structure.  Its brickwork was regularly
dotted with small window slits, each of which had its
wooden shutters open.
</p>

<p>
Strangest of all, however, was the intricate network of tiny elevator
platforms, each large enough to hold one person.  Most of them were
moving up and down via slots in the tower's wall.  A few were stationary.
At the end of each elevator's path there were small ledges sticking
out of the wall.  Evidently it was possible to scale the
wall by transferring from one elevator to the next via the ledges.
</p>

<p>
As she studied this bizarre situation Daria heard an unwelcome
voice.  "Welcome to my tower of love power!" cried Charles
Ruttheimer&nbsp;III from somewhere above.
</p>

<p>
Daria couldn't see him, but she soon felt his presence as a
balloon filled with water
hit her on the head!  Dripping wet she said, "I'm getting 
really irritated!"  Another water bomb hit the ground beside her.
</p>

<p>
There was nothing for it but to head up.  Daria waited until one of
the elevator platforms reached the ground and stepped on.  Quickly
it carried her up to the top of its path and she stepped off onto a 
nearby ledge before it went down again.  She repeated the process
with adjacent elevators until she had reached a considerable height.
</p>

<p>
"It's times like this I wish I had a fear of heights," thought Daria.
In reality, though, the task proved easier than it looked.
</p>

<p>
Soon, however, she reached a point where her progress was blocked
by stationary elevators.
Upchuck's water bombs continued to rain all around her, so she
needed to find a way to make the elevators move.
</p>

<p>
Daria noticed a number of small levers sticking out
of the wall at various places.  She made her way over to one and
turned it.  One of the stationary elevators started moving, and
Daria used it to gain further altitude.
"I'd appreciate life's ups and downs a lot more if they didn't make
me nauseous," she said.
</p>

<p>
By repeating this process Daria proceeded upwards until she could at
last see Upchuck, who was leaning out of one of the shuttered
windows throwing water bombs as fast as he could.  Despite his
high intelligence, Charles seemed destined never to grow up!
</p>

<p>
Getting closer, Daria found another lever and pulled it.  To her
delight it caused the shutters to snap shut, finally putting an
end to Upchuck's prank.
"Gotcha!" she cried triumphantly.
</p>

<p>
By following a few more elevators Daria finally reached
the top of the tower, and climbed onto its flat surface.
"I'm on top of the world, Mom," she announced,
surveying the spectacular
view with a sense of satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
Over in the corner of the rooftop
Daria found a small statuette.
"This must be what Ms Li was looking for," said Daria to herself.
"It's ugly enough!"
On its base was written:
<blockquote>
World's Greatest
Disciplinarian
</blockquote>
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
Suddenly eerie music filled the air and something came floating up
alongside the tower.  It was Jane posing like Botticelli's 
Birth of Venus, and held aloft by a pair of cherubs!
</p>

<p>
As Daria stared in amazement, Jane exclaimed, "Ta da!
You have achieved a goal or something, so I guess I'm here
to make it look like a big deal."
</p>  

<p>
"Works for me," said Daria.  "Now what?"
</p>

<p>
But Jane didn't seem to be very helpful.
"I don't know," she said disinterestedly.  
"I'm still trying to figure out why I'm floating on a
clam shell."
</p>

<p>
"See ya!" she concluded before drifting away.
</p>

<p>
While Daria stood wondering what to do next a strange vortex seemed
to open up in mid air.
"Just what I need," she said.  "More weirdness!"
</p>

<p>
The spirals of light solidified into a form that brought
a blush to Daria's cheeks.
"It's Trent," thought Daria, "and his Trent-mobile!"
The apparition was indeed Jane's brother Trent Lane, 
characteristically lying on his rumpled bed.
</p>

<p>
"Hey, Daria," he said calmly.  "I dreamed I was in your dream."
</p>

<p>
Struggling not to be tongue-tied in Trent's presence, Daria 
responded simply,
"You still are."
</p>

<p> 
"That explains why my guitar is in tune," said Trent, picking up the
offending instrument.  He started playing and singing discordantly.
</p>

<blockquote>
Listen to my happy song,<br>
A song I play quite well,<br>
About a Mystic Spyral,<br>
And your next stop in hell.
</blockquote>

<p>
As Trent played another vortex materialized in the floor.
It formed a spiral staircase which led down into blackness.
Daria felt compelled to follow it and walked down as
Trent continued singing.
</p>

<blockquote>
You gotta follow the Mystic Spyral,<br>
Be strong and have no fear,<br>
Everytime this song starts to get good,<br>
I have to disappear.<br>
</blockquote>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
As Daria descended into total blackness she once again felt
herself falling and Jane's voice echoed all around:
"Along with wasting your life and money, the mall's also the perfect
place to find missing school mascots and the sister who steals them."
</p>

<p>
Her voice faded into the distance as she said,
"Come to shop, but stay for Quinn, and the recycled air."
Horror of horrors!  Daria was headed for The Mall of the Millenium!
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<blockquote>
<em>
Platform pygmies add feet to their feet and ride tall in the
sandal, next on Sick Sad World.
</em>
</blockquote>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
Opening her eyes Daria found herself standing amid the harsh lighting,
garish colors, and nauseating muzak of the mall.
"You've lost your soul, now lose your money," she said.  "The mall's
got it all!"
</p>

<p>
Daria wondered what to do next.
"I guess I have to find Quinn," she thought.
"Like looking for a wet sock under
the bed, do I really want to find it?"
</p>  

<p>
She started walking through the zombie-like crowd of shoppers when
schoolmate Jamie White appeared beside her.  As usual, he seemed to
look right through Daria as he asked the inevitable question,
"Ah, seen Quinn?"
</p>

<p>
The jostling crowd of shoppers caused him
to bump into Daria.   "Contact," she thought, "Not good!"
</p>

<p>
When he did it for a second time Daria exclaimed,
"This is getting really irritating!"
</p>

<p>
If she was going to find Quinn she'd have to get rid of this leech.
Remembering the voodoo doll she found in Barch's classroom, Daria
pulled it out of her pocket.
"It's Jamie and he's a living doll," she thought as she examined
it carefully to make sure she had the right 'J'.  
"Abuse him for hours of wholesome fun."
</p>

<p>
She gave one of the pins sticking out of the doll a sharp tweak.
The response was dramatic.  "Yow!" said Jamie in pain and confusion.  
"Not the face, not the face!"
</p>

<p>
Most importantly, the distraction gave Daria a chance to slip away.
She rounded a corner and came upon a fountain (placed there to give the
impression that the mall's proprietors are artistically inclined
and not just money-grubbing parasites).
</p>

<p>
At its base Daria noticed a coin.
"Twenty-five cents?" she said with disappointment as she picked it up.
"If I can dream up another ten dollars I can order a pizza."
</p>

<p>
Nearby, however, was a snack machine which, conveniently, accepted
quarters.  Daria put the coin in and out popped a doughnut.
"A doughnut with nothing to dunk it in," thought Daria.  
"I am in hell."
Having seen how such items can come in handy, Daria decided
against eating it and instead stashed it away in her pocket.
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<blockquote>
<em>
They came for the doo, and got hooked on the dad!  Doo Dad Shop
addicts, next on Sick Sad World.
</em>
</blockquote>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
Spotting a distressingly familiar store, Daria stepped inside.
Everywhere she looked there were useless and overpriced knick-knacks.
Yes, it was the Doo Dad Shop!
"I know what a Dad is," she said.  "What's a Doo?"
</p>

<p>
Scanning the colorful plastic trinkets on the shelves, Daria
thought, "Worthless items for that worthless someone."
</p>

<p>
On the floor she noticed a round
yellow object.  It was a lost smiley-face badge.
Again she felt that it might come in handy later, so she bent over
to retrieve it.
</p>

<p>
As she straightened up,
Daria notice a large sign above the door which read:
<blockquote>
9,999
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
From bitter personal experience, Daria knew this to be a
counter for the number of customers who have entered the store.
There didn't seem to be anyone around, so she felt safe to do
a little experiment. 
</p>

<p>
Daria stepped outside and then back into the shop.  Sure enough, the
counter had now ticked over to 10,000.  But before she could leave 
again, raucous music started playing, confetti and streamers started
falling from the ceiling, and the store's staff, who had been in 
hiding, came rushing out.
</p>

<p>
They surrounded Daria and started singing the shop's awful advertising
jingle, "If you're feeling bad or sad, buy a doo dad!"
</p>

<p>
Poker faced, Daria stood her ground and waited for the celebrations
to end.  She knew from last time that being the 10,000th customer
meant she would get some prizes, which she hoped might be helpful
in her current quest.
</p>

<p>
She was disappointed, however, to be presented with only one item,
a plastic, hand-held, battery-operated fan.  Someone commented that
it was perfect "to watch while you wish you had airconditioning."
</p>

<p>
Pocketing the cheap item, Daria said flatly,
"This fan has made my life complete.  I guess it's all downhill
from here!"
</p>

<p>
She then
removed the paper 
party hat that had been
put on her head, brushed off some confetti, and made her excuses.
"I'm out of here," she said.  "I thought this place sold dads."
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<blockquote>
<em>
When the breeze shifts these girls go to smell.  Ill wind in the
perfume aisle, next on Sick Sad World.
</em>
</blockquote>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
Daria walked on until a nauseating smell attracted her attention.
The shop it was coming from was called
Eau D'Attitude.
</p>

<p>
"Perfume?" thought Daria.  "Well it's better than 
the brimstone you smell in standard
hell."  
</p>

<p>
She stepped inside.
"It smells like I just walked into a magazine," she said, taking note
of the sign inside the door that read, 
<blockquote>
Available now!<br>
Waif magazine at back of store
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Daria was all too aware that the Fashion Club were avid readers of
Waif, so she figured she might be able to find Quinn there.
</p>

<p>
Getting safely to the rear of the store wasn't easy, however.
The maze of glass-topped counters was patrolled by a veritable
army of underworked shop assistants, 
each one wielding an atomizer filled
with samples of the trendiest perfumes.
</p>

<p>
Daria ducked and weaved, but
found it impossible to avoid getting
liberally sprayed.
"Yuk!" she complained.  
"I'll keep my own scent&nbsp;<a href="#scent">[16]</a>, thank you!"
</p>

<p>
She needed a way to defend herself, so she
pulled out the battery-powered
fan.  The next time an assistant pointed an atomizer at her, Daria
retaliated by switching the fan on.
</p>

<p>
It blew the cloud of spray back into the young woman's face.
"Ah!" she squealed, "It burns!"  She staggered away, leaving
Daria free to move on.
</p>

<p>
Daria kept walking, while singing
to herself: "The answer my friend is blowing in the
pathetic breeze created by this fan."  (It doesn't scan, but what the
heck!)
</p>

<p>
Finally making it to the pile of Waif magazines, Daria 
picked one up.
"Waif magazine?" she thought.  
"Maybe it'll give me hot tips on how to master a
vacant stare."
</p>

<p>
As she put it in her pocket she quickly skimmed the list of articles
on the cover:
<blockquote>
Hot new styles for fall<br>
Are you a real waif?  Take our new
quiz<br>
The brand new beauty secret - looking pouty<br>
The latest trends
- learn them or be unpopular<br>
How to be more shallow
</blockquote>
Quality literature indeed!
</p>

<p>
Looking around for Quinn, Daria saw 
Fashion Club member Tiffany Blum-Deckler standing nearby.
</p>

<p>
Daria asked her where Quinn was.  In her usual slow-witted drawl
Tiffany replied,
"Quinn's at the Club House with Sandi, 
Girl-Who-Lives-With-Quinn."&nbsp;<a href="#tiffany">[17]</a>
</p>

<p>
Not wanting to spend eternity trying to conduct a conversation with
Tiffany, Daria headed quickly for the exit.
Sniffing at the perfume stains on her jacket she said,
"I feel strangely flammable.  Time to go."
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
Daria followed some stairs down to a lower level of the mall.
There she found a store called
Fashion Club House, undoubtedly the "club house" that Tiffany
meant.
Steeling herself against the next onslaught of annoyances, Daria
entered.
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<blockquote>

<p>
"I wonder if this place can give my soul a makeover?" thought Daria,
studying the rows of fashionable clothes.
"I thought people like me set off security alarms in places like
this."
</p>

<p>
But there was indeed a security system in force.  Blocking her
way were her old antagonists
Claude (pronounced "Cloud") and Romonica.
Formerly of New York's Amazon Modelling Agency, they now seemed to be
owners of this shop.
</p>

<p>
Eyeing Daria with disdain, Romonica said in her thick accent,
"No one comes in here without a copy of Waif magazine.
Our staff does
not have time to convert non-believers."
</p>

<p>
But Daria had the pair at a disadvantage.  Triumphantly she
pulled the copy of Waif out of her pocket, saying,
"You can never be too fashionable or skinny in Waif magazine, the
periodical of the living dead."
</p>

<p>
"I guess we have to let you in," sniffed Romonica in frustration,
"but I do not know if we can help
you."
</p>

<p>
Daria walked deeper into the aisles and found a seemingly endless
series of changing booths.
"I need to find Sandi," she thought, wondering where to start,
"and hell hasn't even frozen over!"
</p>

<p>
Patrolling the store were dozens of tall, stick-thin models, marching
back and forth, ensuring that no fashion violations occurred.
Short frumpy Daria didn't even seem to register on their radar.
Several times they bumped into her.
"Watch it!" she cried.  "Those bones are sharp!"
</p>

<p>
She needed to protect herself and searched in her pocket
for something that would strike fear into the hearts of these
fashion fiends.
Her fingers closed around
something sticky.  Pulling it out she said aloud,
"This is a doughnut.  Not to be confused with a life preserver, unless
Quinn is drowning."
</p>

<p>
Holding the doughnut above her head she approached the next shop 
assistant.  It had the desired effect.
"Bad calories!" shrieked the model.  "Get back!" she cried, cringing
with fear.
</p>

<p>
Thus protected, Daria started walking past the booths,
peeking into each one in search of 
the ever-unpleasant Sandi Griffin.  She found plenty
of Lawndale's oddball denizens in various stages of undress, but no 
Sandi.&nbsp;<a href="#booths">[18]</a>
</p>

<p>
"You're not Sandi," Daria said by way of apology to one
embarrassed customer. "Your head fits in this dressing room."
</p>

<p>
To another she said
insincerely, "Sorry.  Go back to your delusions of improvement."
</p>

<p>
A nearby mannequin in a cowboy getup attracted her attention.
"A cowboy hat and me without my spurs," she thought.  "Yee ha."
On an impulse she took the hat and stuffed it in her
pocket.&nbsp;<a href="#hat">[19]</a>
</p>

<p>
Rapidly running out of dressing rooms, Daria was about to give up
when she pulled the next curtain aside and there was a,
mercifully fully-clothed, Sandi.
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
Sandi seemed mesmerized by her own reflection, so Daria was
forced to enter the booth with her.
</p>

<p>
"On the off chance that you ever look at anyone besides yourself," said
Daria, "have you seen Quinn?"
</p>

<p>
"Quinn's meeting me at the movies," replied Sandi, still
unable to tear herself away from the mirror.
"But back to the reason we're all
here.  How would you improve the unimprovable magic of me?"
</p>

<p>
"In your case, I'd start with dynamite," responded Daria dryly.
</p>

<p>
The next voice was Sandi's, but Sandi hadn't opened her mouth.  It
was her reflection in the mirror talking!  Apparently Sandi spent
so much time in front of the mirror that her reflection had taken on
a life of its own.
</p>

<p>
"You're wasting time with this person," said Sandi's reflection
to Sandi.  "She's so
not you!"
</p>

<p>
"Why did that feel like a compliment?" thought Daria.
</p>

<p>
"Movies might be fine for Quinn," said Sandi to no one in
particular, "but my perfection's completely
wasted in the dark."  She held up a theatre ticket, 
"I think I'll just throw this ticket away."
</p>
  
<p>
But Sandi's 
reflection had a better idea.  "No, give it to that girl," the
image said, indicating Daria.  "She'll look better in
the dark and the mall will once again be safe for fashion!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm so right!" exclaimed Sandi.  She
handed the ticket to Daria.  "Here's your ticket to self improvement."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," said Daria as Sandi left.  
"Now that you're gone I feel better already."
</p>

<p>
However, as Daria turned around she was disturbed to find that although
Sandi had left, her reflection was still in the mirror!
"What's wrong with this picture?" said Daria.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's right!" said Sandi's reflection, dissolving to reveal
Daria's mirror image.
</p>

<p>
"You again," thought Daria, feeling her self-esteem drop another
notch.
</p>  

<p>
As quickly as she could she made her back to the store's entrance.
"I think I learned something here," she thought as she left,
"like what this year's idiot is
wearing."
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
Daria headed for the mall's MegaMultiPlex.  As she started to walk
in the ticket collector
blocked her path, "I don't care if it is your dream - 
you gotta have a ticket!"
</p>

<p>
It seemed that nothing was free in hell, so Daria pulled out the
ticket that Sandi had given her
and, with a shrug, the collector let her
through.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe they'll be showing someone else's dream," speculated Daria
as she passed by the confectionary stand.  
</p>

<p>
"They watch movies in
hell?" she pondered as she looked at the
posters for upcoming attractions
on the wall.  "I thought that was just where they made
them."
</p>

<p>
As she entered the darkened theatre Daria noticed a sign that read: 
<blockquote>
Theatre Exits to Mall Lower Level
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>  
Once her eyes became
adjusted to the light she looked around.
"I don't see Quinn anywhere," Daria thought.  
"She must have left.  I'll cut through
here to get to the lower level of the mall."
</p>

<p>
This proved to be harder than she expected, however.  As she tried to
walk through to the exit near the screen she found her 
way blocked
by various members of the audience who seemed to be restless and
were fidgeting about.
"It's getting kind of crowded in my head here!" said Daria with
annoyance as she tripped over another pair of outstretched legs.  
<p>

<p>
Things were no better when she made it to the aisle.  Alien abductee
Artie, apparently having lost another pizza delivery job, was
acting as usher.
"Ow!  Watch it!" yelled Daria as he swung around clumsily
and hit her with
his flashlight.
</p>

<p>
She squeezed past him and finally reached the exit at the
lower level.  On the floor she noticed another twenty-five
cent coin and picked it up.
</p>

<p>
As she left the theatre, not even having seen any of the movie,
Daria said, 
"Now I'll have to figure out some other way to waste two hours of
my life."
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
Back in the brightly lit mall, Daria was still blinking in the
glare when someone else bumped into her.
This time it was Joey, who inevitably asked, "Where's Quinn?"
</p>

<p>
Based on past experience, Daria knew just what to do.
"Step on a crack and break Joey's back," she thought as she
took a dark-haired doll out of her pocket.  
"It's easy, it's fun, it's voodoo."
</p>

<p>
As Daria twisted the pin, Joey jumped out of the way.
"I've been voodooized!" he shouted, running off into the distance.
</p>

<p>
Daria saw an opportunity to use the coin she had just found.
She inserted it into a nearby vending machine and received a 
chocolate candy bar.
"Hello pounds and bye-bye teeth," she said as she put it in her pocket.
</p>

<p>
There was a roaring sound from above and Daria looked up to see 
a miniature rollercoaster car zooming past overhead.
This really was the world's
second or third largest mall!  
</p>

<p>
More importantly, Daria noticed a familiar red-haired figure standing
near the far end of the track.
"There's Quinn," thought Daria.  
"She's by the Makeup Mill on the top level."
</p>

<p>
The question was how to get to her.  Daria spied an elevator
not far away and took it to the highest level she could.
But she was still at the opposite end of the mall from Quinn.
</p>

<p>
The start of the rollercoaster's track was on this level, however,
so Daria reasoned that if she took it for a ride she would
be able to reach her sister.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the rollercoaster attendant was unhelpful.
He pointed to a line drawn on the wall
against which was written:
<blockquote>
You must be this tall
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
With a sneer he said,
"You're not tall enough to ride.  Safety rules.  We don't want
patrons being squashed by falling short people."
</p>

<p>
With this humiliation ringing in her ears, Daria took the elevator back
down to the bottom level, to see if she could find some solution
to this impasse.
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<blockquote>
<em>
There's no buts about it when you get to the bottom of rear end
ergonomics.  Get the right stool for the job, next on Sick Sad World.
</em>
</blockquote>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
Daria found herself near a shoe store.
"Feeling Feety," she read from the sign, "Everything for the
well-dressed foot."  This gave her an idea and she walked in.
</p>

<p>
"Looks like
the circus came to town and forgot their shoes," she said, surveying
the shelves full of exotic footwear.  Then, high on a display stand,
she saw what she was looking for: a pair of platform shoes.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately she couldn't
reach them and started searching for some steps.
However, as she did so, she was bumped into by the third
of the Js.  It seemed that Jeffy was searching for Quinn in here.
</p>

<p>
With practised precision Daria pulled a red-haired doll out of her 
pocket.  "Stick pins in little Jeffy and watch him twitch," she thought,
doing just that.
</p>

<p>
"Ow!" yelled Jeffy, grabbing his derriere.  
"A voodoo doll is not a toy!"
</p>

<p>
With this nuisance safely dispatched, Daria wandered around the
store and found three small sets of steps.
"Note to self," she thought as she carried them back to the
display stand, "You're dreaming about moving furniture.  Wake up!"
</p>

<p>
She stacked the steps up, but found the shoes were still just out
of reach.  She would need to find another set of
steps, but couldn't see any.
</p>

<p>
Over in the corner of the store Daria noticed the elephantine 
Mrs Johannsen sitting down looking exhausted as usual.  But Daria
was more interested to note that the huge
woman was sitting on the last set of
steps!  Daria would have to find a way to get
her to
move.
</p>

<p>
"One more ounce of chocolate and this woman's going to pass out,"
mused Daria.  Then she remembered the chocolate bar she got from
the machine earlier.
</p>

<p>
"Life is like a box of chocolates," thought Daria as she took it
from her pocket.  "You keep wishing people would
choke on it."
</p>

<p>
Daria held the chocolate gingerly in front of Mrs Johanssen, as if
she was feeding a seal a fish.  The normally immobile woman leapt into
action, snatching the chocolate and devoring it in a flash.
She then began to look queasy and literally disappeared!
</p>

<p>
Nothing surprised Daria any more, and she simply picked up the steps
and carried them back to add to the others.
"How cute," she thought as she ascended.  "A platform to the platforms."
</p>

<p>
Finally high enough to reach them, Daria picked up
the pair of ridiculously
high platform shoes.
"I'm not wearing these," she commented.  "I'm afraid of heights."
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, she knew she needed them to complete her task, so
she carried them with her as she left the shoe shop, thinking,
"Now my feet can do what they do best - get me out of here."
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
Daria went back up the elevator to the start of the rollercoaster ride.
Putting on the shoes she tottered clumsily over to the attendant.
</p>

<p>
"OK," he said with some annoyance.
"With those shoes you're <em>theoretically</em> tall enough, so
enjoy your <em>theoretical</em> ride!"
</p>

<p>
The rollercoaster took off with Daria hanging on for dear life.  If this
was what having fun was all about she'd much rather be at home
reading!
</p>

<p>
Finally the wild ride ended and Daria staggered off, sitting down
for a moment to catch her breath and
change back into her trusty combat boots.
</p>

<p>
Looking around she saw the Makeup Mill and there was her 'beloved'
sister Quinn, holding the head of the Lawndale Lions' mascot.
</p>

<p>
"Quinn!" said Daria.  
"When did you start stealing school mascots?"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't steal it," replied Quinn haughtily.  
"I just gave it a makeover.  Our school can't
have a mascot that looks like an old hippy."
</p>

<p>
And just to remind Daria that this was a dream, the mascot head itself
also spoke up:
"And you know, I feel better too."
</p>

<p>
Unperturbed, Daria simply responded,
"Looking like an idiot can do that to a guy."
</p>

<p>
As it had before,
eerie music started playing and Jane appeared from nowhere,
this time dressed as Mercury, complete with a staff, and winged hat 
and shoes.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately she misstepped during her grand entrance 
and bumped Quinn right
out of sight.
"Security!" cried Quinn as she disappeared from view.
"I've been touched by an angel!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't worry, this is a dream," said Jane by way of
reassurance.  "Quinn's not really hurt."
</p>

<p>
"Could you try that again?" responded Daria flatly.
</p>
  
<p>
Once again Jane seemed to be enjoying her role as guide.
"You've solved the mystery of the dork mascot," she said with
exaggerated importance.  "And now you can
leave this hellhole for a new, improved hellhole.  So with a wave of
my magic wand ..."
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, Jane exhibited further clumsiness by hitting Daria with
her staff.
"Ow!" complained Daria to her winged friend.
"Do that again and I'm getting the magic flyswatter!"
</p>  

<p>
"OK, forget the wand,"
replied Jane.
"Just, um, watch the enchanted stupid hat."
</p>

<p>
And with that Jane's hat flew off her head and started to spin
hypnotically.  Once again a mystic
spiral (or is that spyral?) seemed to envelop Daria and she
felt herself falling down to the next level of her ordeal.
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
As Daria descended, she heard Jane's voice issuing further
instructions: "Ignore the lost youth of Lawndale trying to be cool, and 
just look for a lost #2 pencil trying to be cool."
Daria could think of only one place in Lawndale where anyone even
approached coolness: Degas St!
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<blockquote>
<em>
It's the face that launched a thousand goths ... in the opposite
direction!  Have a nice angst, next on Sick Sad World.
</em>
</blockquote>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
Daria opened her eyes and looked around.
"Degas St," she said,
"where Lawndale tries to be cool and just ends up dirty and smelly."
</p>

<p>
Trendy shops selling the latest must-haves lined the street and the
sidewalks were crowded with youths simultaneously posing 
and affecting indifference to their appearance.
"I've got to find a #2 pencil on Degas St?" thought
Daria.  "I didn't think
anyone even knew how to write here."
</p>

<p>
Daria started walking.
"One day someone will have to tell me what makes urban streets so
sticky," she thought.  "But do I want to know?"
</p>

<p>
The street was really crowded and Daria was bumped
into several times by spotty youths too busy trying to look cool
to worry about looking where they were going.
"Ow!" yelled Daria. "Thanks for sharing!"
</p>

<p>
Daria needed protection, so she
searched through the collection of items
she had accumulated for something guaranteed to ward off Degas St's
denizens.
"Have a nice day in hell with a smiley face button," she thought
as she found the pin she had picked up in the Doo Dad Shop.
"Guaranteed to
make damnation irritating."
</p>

<p>
Daria figured that this sixties icon was sufficiently square to 
terrify her nineties antagonists and pinned it to her lapel.
Combined with her dowdy outfit, the effect was devastating!
Daria was now so uncool that everyone avoided her.
"Someone help me!" said one dude when he saw her.  
"I'm ... feeling groovy."
</p>

<p>
Making her way past the trendy boutiques and coffee shops, Daria
turned a corner to find a red sedan blocking the street.
There was no way to get past it, so she tried opening the door, when
out popped country and western wannabe Travis.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately he didn't seem to hold a grudge against Daria after their
last encounter.
"I'm a singing cowboy, but I can't sing without a hat," he announced.
"Why I'd
trade my mother, my horse, or this club pass for a chapeau to corral
this head of mine."
</p>

<p>
Daria noticed that the club pass Travis was holding
was for The Zon, Mystic Spyral's regular gig.
Even this indirect reference to Trent's band was enough to get Daria's
pulse racing.  Although she couldn't admit it to herself, she just
had to get that pass!
</p>
 
<p>
Fortunately, she had just the thing, and held out the hat she'd taken
from the Fashion Club House.
"Get a long little doggie with this cowboy hat," she said
without any hint of emotion.  "Yee ha."
</p>

<p>
Travis took the hat and put it on his head.  It was a perfect fit.
"You saved my life little lady," he beamed.
"Why don't you take this old pass to
that club there where the kids mosh like a herd of longhorns?"
</p>

<p>
Daria took the pass and left quickly, before Travis had a chance to
pick up his guitar and start singing.
"I guess it's time for this little doggie to git along," she
said by way of farewell.
</p>

<p>
Walking the familiar route to Trent's workplace, Daria examined the pass.
"You're in the zone with this pass to The Zon,"
she thought, "your sure ticket to
sticky shoes."
</p>

<p>
Encountering a building that looked like a condemned warehouse,
Daria knew she had the right place from the sign that read:
<blockquote>
The Zon<br>
Appearing tonite at 8:00<br>
Mystic Spyral<br>
plus Spit Take<br>
and Flaxen
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
There was a long line waiting to get get in, but their progress was 
moderated by a burly bouncer.
"No one gets in here without a pass unless I think they're
hot!" he said.  Looking at Daria he added, "You're gonna need the pass."
</p>

<p>
Daria ignored the slight and held out her pass.  Reluctantly, the
thug let her through, and Daria entered the dark, deafening,
smoke-filled cavern known simply as The Zon.
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<blockquote>
<em>
What would Shakespeare have to say about going to a rave?  Mosh ado about
nothing, next on Sick Sad World.
</em>
</blockquote>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
"The Zon," thought Daria.
"All the ambience of a bus station urinal, with a lot more
noise."
</p>

<p>
The cause of the noise turned out to be Trent, Jesse, Nick and Max -
a.k.a. Mystic Spyral - up on stage playing at full volume.
The place was packed with dozens of moshers bouncing around
in approximate time to the music.
</p>

<p>
"Weird," thought Daria as she peered around
the gloom.  "Even the walls sweat here."
</p>

<p>
At this point Trent stepped up to the microphone and started singing
some typically elegant self-penned lyrics:
<blockquote>
Go to the bathroom,<br>
Gotta go there now,<br>
This song's about the where and when,<br>
Forget the why and how.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
As much as she felt strangely
compelled to stand and stare at Jane's brother, Daria knew that she
needed to continue her mission.  She wasn't sure where to go next,
so she decided to follow the advice of Trent's song and headed for
the girls' bathroom.
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
"This ladies' room never saw a lady," said Daria as she pushed open
the door and stepped into the nauseating, graffitti-covered and,
above all,
malodorous room.
</p> 

<p>
Walking over to the mirror she mused,
"I don't have to say what happens when I dream about bathrooms, but
I'm past the bedwetting stage.  I hope!"
</p>

<p>
In the trash can Daria noticed a large bone.  It looked fairly clean,
so she pulled it out.  It might make a good addition to the
collection she kept in her bedroom.
"This bone makes me feel kind of like the smart monkey in 2001,"
she thought.
</p>
  
<p>
But Daria suddenly realized she wasn't alone.  Noticing a familiar
looking pair of feet in one of the stalls she knocked on the door.
Sure enough, Brittany Taylor's squeaky voice answered,
"I'm not coming out!  I look ridiculous with spotted hair."
</p>

<p>
Daria peered over the top of the cubicle door and confirmed that
Brittany had once again tried to be fashionable by dying her hair,
but this time it had come out green
with pink spots!
</p>

<p>
This was too much information, so Daria decided to leave.
"I'll have to remember to burn my shoes when I wake up,"
she thought as she squelched out of the room.
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
Back in the club, Daria decided to leave via the exit on the far
side.  She tried to squeeze her way through the crush of 
bouncing fans.
"Ow!" she cried as loudly as she could.  "I feel 
moshed!"&nbsp;<a href="#moshed">[20]</a>
</p>

<p>
Daria retreated to the side of the stage.
She would have to find some way of calming the audience down if she
was to get past.  She noticed a flight of stairs leading up to the
lighting gantry
above the stage.  Climbing them, she found a large
electrical plug which was evidently part of the sound system and
decided to indulge in a little sabotage.
She pulled it out and the amplified sound of Trent's and
Jesse's guitars stopped abruptly.
</p>

<p>
Despite this, when
Daria descended she found that the band, and their fans, barely
seemed to notice the difference.  The song continued, although
somewhat muted, and the fans kept bouncing, albeit with less 
enthusiasm than before.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, the slight calming effect made it possible for
Daria to make her way to the opposite side of the stage where
she found an identical plug.  She pulled this one out too and thereby
switched off Trent's microphone and the keyboard.
</p>

<p>
The result was Mystic Spyral unplugged!  The band kept playing, evidently
considering this a new musical direction.  Most
importantly, however, the audience could
barely hear anything and stopped dancing.
Daria could now move around without getting
bruised!
</p>

<p>
She used this new-found freedom to reach the 
emergency exit on the far side and pushed it open.  As usual,
despite the sign on the door, the alarm didn't sound.
"Now to check out the mosh pit the rats have going in the dumpster,"
said Daria as she went out into the alley.
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<blockquote>
<em>
Are there dogs in the dumpster?  Or have rats learned to bark?

</em>
</blockquote>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
"Back for more of that loitering action," said Daria as she
stepped over some empty bottles.  But from behind she suddenly
heard a menancing growl.
</p>

<p>
Whirling around she saw two large and mean looking dogs approaching.
They circled her, sniffing aggressively.  This was getting 
serious!&nbsp;<a href="#dogs">[21]</a>
One of them came up close and almost nipped her. 
"Ow!" said Daria nervously.  
"That's why they call you <em>man's</em> best friend."
</p>

<p>
Thinking quickly, Daria pulled the bone out of her pocket.
"I'm sure someone wants this more than I do," she said as she
threw it into a nearby dumpster.
</p>

<p>
Immediately the two dogs leapt in after it and the lid slammed shut.
"What do dogs and anthropologists have in common besides the
drooling?" quipped Daria with relief
as she walked out to the relative
safety of Degas St.
"They both love bones."
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
The street was still busy.
"Ow!" said Daria as someone bumped into her.
"You're pretty annoying for someone who doesn't exist."
</p>

<p>
Crossing the street she found what she was looking for.  In front
of
Hair for Freaks was a stall with various hair care products.
"Why be a dumb brunette when you can be a dumb blonde?" 
said Daria as she picked up
a spray can of hair coloring.
"Glamor is only
a spray away with Forever Blonde."
</p>

<p>
"At last," she said walking back past
Funky Doodle and Axl's Piercing Parlor, 
"the cause of Brittany's truant brain cells."
</p>

<p>
On her way back to The Zon, Daria again pondered her task.
"I've got to find a #2 pencil on Degas St?  A crayon I can see, a 
pencil, no!"
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
Daria reentered The Zon through the emergency exit 
ineffectively marked:
<blockquote>
Do Not Enter
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Trent and the band were still performing their 
'unplugged' set.
"This place is starting to make me want to learn demolition," said
Daria as she wondered whether the band had even noticed the
absence of electricity or not.
</p>

<p>
Back in the toilet, Daria again knocked on the door of Brittany's cubicle.
"I can't come out," was the high-pitched response.
"My hair makes me look too stupid."
</p>

<p>
"I'd say the problem's under that hair," replied Daria,
"but this should get you out
of there and end your reign of toilet domination."
</p>

<p>
Daria held the can up over the door and started spraying.
"Eep! My eyes!" squeaked Brittany.
</p>

<p>
"Don't worry," said Daria reassuringly.
"This stuff only blinds lab rats."
</p>

<p>
When the can was emptied the latch slid back and the door
opened.  Brittany was looking into her compact's mirror, admiring
her newly blonde locks.
"You saved my life!" she said.  
"At least the social interactive part of it."
</p>

<p>
"Great," said Daria without enthusiasm.
"Now you're free to romp and play with the rest of the
woodhead creatures."
</p>

<p>
"And let that be a lesson to the young people," announced Brittany
importantly,
as if she was accepting a modelling award.  "Don't take hair care
advice from strangers."&nbsp;<a href="#lesson">[22]</a>
</p>

<p>
"And this young person thanks you for leaving," said Daria as Brittany
left to join the moshers.
</p>

<p>
But on the toilet seat Daria noticed that Brittany had dropped a
green coupon.  Picking it up, she saw that it read:
<blockquote>
Axl's Piercing Parlor<br>
Masochist Madness<br>
One day only sale<br>
One free hole
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
"Piercing?" she pondered.  
"Well, you never know when another orifice will come in
handy."
</p>
  
<p>
Anxious to get this nightmare over, Daria quickly retraced her
steps through the mosh pit, out into the alley and along
Degas St to the piercing parlor.
</p>

<p>
She entered with reluctance.  "I don't see the need for more
metal attachments," she thought, "I have enough trouble with
my glasses."
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<blockquote>
<em>
Nose rings not enough anymore?  Take a tip from our bovine
buddies!  Cow bells for people, next on Sick Sad World.
</em>
</blockquote>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
"I need this exactly like I need a hole in the head,"
said Daria, looking around at Axl's displays advertising a wide
variety of piercing and tattooing options.
</p>

<p>
"Shouldn't the piercing parlor be in my parent's nightmares?" she
thought as she peeked through the curtain into the back room, where
the deed was actually done.
</p>

<p>
To Daria's surprise, 
there was her goth classmate Andrea
lying on the bench, with a new and
interesting example of body decoration.
"Andrea's got the #2 pencil in her nose," noted Daria.
"And me without my rubber
gloves."
</p>

<p>
She parted the curtains, but found her way blocked by Axl himself.
"You need the two holes for the price of none coupon, or I can't
poke any holes," he said.
"You got a problem with that?  Blame your 
imagination!"&nbsp;<a href="#accent">[23]</a>
</p>

<p>
Daria was prepared for this, however, and pulled out the coupon
that Brittany had lost.  (In the back of her mind Daria wondered what
part of her body Brittany was planning on getting pierced!)
</p>

<p>
Daria handed over the coupon, saying sarcastically,
"Increase your body's ventilation and blood flow with this free
piercing coupon."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," replied Axl.
"I'm gonna go get the ice pick," he said disturbingly, 
getting up to leave.
</p>

<p>
As an afterthought, he added, "Think about wearing the
cow bell.  It'll cover the blood."
</p>

<p>
Daria picked up the gold cow bell that Axl had pointed to.
She cringed at the noise it made.
"Ding dong the witch is dead," she thought.  
"Or she'll wish she were, after
listening to this cow bell all day."
</p>

<p>
Daria walked over to where Andrea was waiting patiently.
"This pencil in my nose isn't doing it," complained
Lawndale High's resident goth chick.  
</p>

<p>
"My parents think I'm making
some literacy statement," she added.  "Got any annoying ideas?"
</p>

<p>
It wasn't often that Andrea was so talkative, so Daria figured she
must be really desperate.
"Andrea, look!" said Daria ringing the bell.
"I think this will annoy your parents a
lot more than a pencil."
</p>
  
<p>
"That <em>is</em> irritating!" said Andrea, impressed.
She took the bell and then slowly pulled the pencil out of the hole
in her septum.  Daria grimaced as Andrea then replaced the pencil
with the cowbell's hook.
</p>
  
<p>
"Perfect," said Andrea standing up.
"It was hard to write with my face anyways."
She handed the pencil to Daria.
</p>

<p>
"And wait til you hear the noise it makes when you sneeze," said
Daria, surreptitiously wiping the pencil on her pleated skirt.
</p>

<p>
Andrea took a few steps and the enormous bell obscuring half her
face started clanking.
"It's driving me nuts already," she said.  "It completely rocks!"
</p>

<p>
Andrea left, leaving Daria standing alone holding the hard-won
pencil.  But suddenly she heard a tiny voice that seemed to be
coming from her navel!
"Hey, Daria!  Down here!"
</p>

<p>
"This better not be another lecture from my stomach about snacks,"
said Daria as she cautiously lifted her jacket to bare her
midriff.
</p>

<p>
To Daria's surprise it seemed that
she had acquired a tattoo of a mermaid sitting
on an anchor.  And that mermaid was none other than Jane Lane!
</p>

<p>
"The belt line is getting a little tight," said Jane's image.
"But tattoos can't be too judgemental."
</p>

<p>
"Or they'll get removed," threatened Daria.
</p>

<p>
Once again, Jane was entering into the spirit of things.
"And now that you've found the pencil,"
she bellowed, "heave away me hearties for
another port in hell.  Lower away the mainsail."
</p>

<p>
Daria lowered her jacket and said,
"Amazing how fast you can get tired of a tattoo."
</p>

<p>
Then the now familiar spiral of light embraced Daria and she
felt herself descending even further into her own
vision of hell.  She sensed the worst.  It felt like she was going
... home!
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
Jane's voice continued to echo through Daria's mind as she fell:
"Looking for a lost old book for youngsters?  Start by looking for a
lost old youngster."
</p>

<p>
"There's no place like home," thought Daria. "And there's a darn
good reason!"
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<blockquote>
<em>
What makes Daddy tick, tick, tick?  When dads explode, 
next on Sick Sad World.
</em>
</blockquote>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
When Daria opened her eyes she found herself in her family's living 
room.  Everything seemed relatively normal.
"There's Dad," she thought as she spotted Jake Morgendorffer
sitting on the couch, "and he's reading Winnie the Pooh, the book Ms Li's
looking for."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if it's the original version where Pooh gets
shot in a card game?" she pondered as she walked over to her
father, in the hope of quickly retrieving the book.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, Jake had the book in a vice-like
grip, and he seemed to be extremely stressed.
"This book doesn't leave these hands until I'm done!"
he yelled.
</p>

<p>
"But I can't
read with all these distractions, damnit!  I feel like I'm gonna ..."
he struggled for words, 
"... explode and then I'll never get to the good part."
</p>

<p>
Daria knew that there was no reasoning with her
father when he was in one
of these moods, so she'd have to find some sneaky way of
making him let go of the book.
</p>

<p>
Daria started pacing the living room, looking for ideas.
On the floor near the sliding glass doors that led to the
backyard she noticed a battered wooden box with the
words
<blockquote>
Jake's Shoeshine
</blockquote>
painted on one side.
</p>

<p>
Daria recognized it as she picked it up.
"Someone ran over Dad's treasured shoe-shine box from junior
high woodshop," she thought.  "By accident?"
</p>

<p>
And on the mantelpiece
she noticed another memento of her father's youth.
"Dad's high school yearbook, a.k.a. Dips on Parade!" she
thought, spying the cover which read
<blockquote>
Buxton Ridge Military Academy Yearbook
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
This ancient relic gave her an idea and she walked over
to pick it up too.  As she did so, however, Daria's mother
appeared out of nowhere, blocking Daria's
way.  "Ow!" said Daria, bumping into her.
"You're dangerous when you're not on your cell phone."
</p>

<p>
Helen Morgendorffer seemed 
to be in a very strange mood.  It looked like she was going 
through one of her metaphysical phases.
"Daria, don't consider your soul empty," she
said.  "Consider it 'spacious'."&nbsp;<a href="#helen">[24]</a>
</p>

<p>
Daria deftly sidestepped her mother, having had many years of 
experience
at doing just that, and picked up the
book.  "It's Dad's
military school yearbook," 
she thought as she looked at some of the photographs
inside.  "Connect the zits and a picture of Nixon will appear."
</p>

<p>
Importantly, though, the book and the shoeshine box gave Daria
an idea.  If she could get Jake obsessing about his lost youth -
which was normally an easy thing to do - he might forget about
Winnie the Pooh.
</p>

<p>
Walking back to the couch, Daria picked something up off
the coffee table.
"A TV remote control," she mused.
"If only it could turn off this dream."
</p>

<p>
Daria stood in front of her father and held up the yearbook.
"My yearbook!" he yelled, snatching it
from her hands.
Sure enough, as Daria predicted, he immediately launched into
an emotional tirade.
"All those 'friends' who laughed at me at the prom
when I wore the orchid I was supposed to give to my date."
</p>

<p>
"Well, she
didn't show up!" he said, his face getting
red with anger.  "What <em>should</em> I have done with it?"
</p>

<p>
So far so good, but Jake still maintained his grip on Winnie the Pooh.
Daria decided to try goading him further.
"The TV remote control," she said, handing it over.
"Just point and click and watch the shows go
from bad to worse."
</p>

<p>
Again the effect was exactly what Daria wanted.
"Who took the channel listings off the TV remote?"
screamed Jake.  "How am I supposed
to memorize all those networks <em>and</em> run a business?"
</p>

<p>
Then, with an air of defeat, his voice trailed off, saying,
"I'd need a super
brain for that and I just don't have it ... I just don't have it!"
</p>

<p>
But still he maintained his grip on the book Daria needed.
However, she had one more card to deal.
"It's high school woodshop's hint to forget Harvard and think
about a job at the train station," she said, confident that the sight
of the broken box
would send her father into a rage.  "It's the shoe shine box."
</p>

<p>
But as Daria waited for the inevitable explosion, it didn't come.
"My junior high shoe shine box.  The last remnant of my boyhood.
Crushed!" he said, with more sorrow than anger.
</p>

<p>
And then, studying the artifact, he even seemed to cheer up a bit.
"Actually, now that I look at this," he said, "it really is a pretty bad
piece of work."
</p>

<p>
That wasn't the reaction Daria wanted at all.  Jake was now relatively
calm and went back to reading Winnie the Pooh.
Daria would need to find something else to stir him up.
</p>

<p>
Having exhausted all the possiblities in the living room, she
walked into the kitchen.
"I'm going where the damnation doesn't feel so eternal," she
thought to herself.  Perhaps she could find some Sugar Tarts?
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
Entering the kitchen, Daria sniffed the air.
"Do I smell brimstone?" she thought.  "No, it's Mom microwaving
again."
</p>

<p>
Once again, Daria's hyperactive mother was getting in the teenager's way.  
"Daria, do you have any idea how hard it is to organize your
subconscious?" said Helen.  "Wake up!"
</p>

<p>
Doing her best to avoid the distraction, Daria searched around for
something else to annoy her father.  She opened the fridge to find a
large glass bowl filled with multi-colored cubes.  They jiggled
disturbingly as Daria picked it up.
"I have no idea what this is, but it's bright colored and I think
people eat it."
</p>

<p>
Studying the strange concoction closer she asked herself,
"Is that a clam from outer space?"  Then realization dawned, 
"No, it's baked Jell-O a la Helen!"  This was sure to irritate
her father's culinary sensibilities!
</p>

<p>
Daria then started looking through the
cupboards but, as she did so,
Helen interrupted her again.
"Daria, could you
hide your brain?" she said.  "You're making Quinn feel left out."
</p>

<p>
This piece of sibling favoratism sent Daria into overdrive.
"My irritation meter is off the scale!" she thought, looking around
for some sort of weapon.
</p>

<p>
And there on the kitchen table was just the thing!
"A cell phone," said Daria, picking it up.  
"And it's not attached to my mother."
</p>

<p>
The next time Helen came near her,
Daria held the phone out.
"It's Mom's umbilical cordless," she thought.
</p>

<p>
With perfect timing he phone rang and Helen snatched it up.
"Hellooo, Helen Morgendorffer," she chimed, wandering away to
deal with another office crisis.
</p>

<p>
Finally left in peace, Daria continued her search.
In a cupboard she found a slip of paper titled
<blockquote>
Jury Summons
</blockquote>
and with Jake Morgendorffer's name written below.
"Jury duty notification," she mused.
"Why can't you give the death penalty for
jay walking?"
</p>

<p>
Daria shoved the paper in her pocket and went back out to the living
room.
"The only thing getting cooked in this kitchen is my brain!" she
said.
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
Jake was still gripping the book and struggling to concentrate.
Daria held out the 
bowl she found in the fridge.
"Mmmm, Jell-O," said Jake, seemingly peckish.
</p>

<p>
But after inspecting it more closely he exclaimed, 
"I don't believe it!  How many times do I have to
tell Helen she's not supposed to bake it?"
</p>

<p>
Daria's plan seemed to be working.  She figured the next item would
send Jake screaming into the night.
"Eleven angry men are looking for a twelfth," she said, holding
out the summons.  "It's time for jury
duty."
</p>

<p>
"Jury duty?" screamed Jake.
But then a grim smile crossed his face.
"Now I get to strike a blow for justice and fry the
bad guys!"
</p>

<p>
This was no good.  Jake had calmed down
again and returned to reading the library
book.  Daria would need to find something else to complete her
scheme.
</p>

<p>
She walked over to the cupboard under the stairs.  Opening it
she couldn't see anything other than old overcoats and umbrellas.
One odd item, however, was a pair of brightly-colored wooden-soled
shoes.
"Clogs," said Daria picking them up.
"I thought this was my hell, not Quinn's."
</p>

<p>
She'd have to go upstairs to find something more inflammatory.
As she started climbing she heard her mother's voice from behind,
"This must be a dream.  I haven't heard a complaint from Ms Li all
day."
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
Reaching the top of the stairs,
Daria thought, "Picking stuff up in the hall can look suspiciously 
like housework."  Instead she decided to look inside her room.
</p>

<p>
Daria turned right and walked to the end of the hallway, then
opened
the door to her room on the left.&nbsp;<a href="#upstairs">[25]</a>
"Just show me the door that gets me out of this nightmare and we're
in business," she said.
</p>

<p>
Stepping inside she sighed, "My good old private hell."  Everything
was as she liked it: padded walls, bars on the windows, human bones
and the remains of scientific experiments scattered about the floor.
</p>

<p>
Her thoughts of lying down and relaxing at last were rudely interrupted,
however.  Quinn burst into the room in a state of anxiety.
"Daria," she said, "have you been telling people we're related?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, stop!" yelled Daria as Quinn started following her around.
She needed something to scare her attractive
and popular sister away.
</p>

<p>
"Clogs!" said Daria, wielding the offensive footwear.
"Worn by the beast in the book of revelations.  The sign of
the end of fashion."
</p>

<p>
The move had the desired effect.
"Clogs?" squealed Quinn.  "Get them away, get them away!"
She beat a hasty retreat.
</p>

<p>
Daria returned to the task of finding items to distract her
father from his reading.
She opened a drawer in her
bureau and found a misplaced article of clothing.
"Dad's pants," she thought, "designed to accommodate the sag of 
defeat."
</p>

<p>
Next she looked in her wardrobe, glancing briefly at the
poetry carved on its walls.  On the floor she found an old coupon 
which
read:
<blockquote>
Buy two burgers and get a bucket of fries free
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
"A fast food coupon," she mused.  
"Free bucket of fries with a Jolly Meal.
And the money you save you can spend on your bypass!"
</p>

<p>
There obviously wasn't much of use in her room, so Daria decided to
look elsewhere.
"I'm getting out of here before I have to make my bed," she
thought.  "That's an
agony of the damned I can't endure."
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
Crossing the hallway, Daria cautiously opened the door of Quinn's
room.
Looking around she realized,
"I never dreamed that one room could contain so much that I just
don't want to know about."
</p>

<p>
Daria crept over and opened one of the brightly colored chests
that Quinn used to store wardrobe overflow and unwanted gifts.
To her surprise, however, she found another misplaced item,
a used razor.
"Here's a symbol of violated manhood," she thought as she
examined it.  "Dad's razor with one of Mom's
leg hairs on it."
</p>

<p>
This was bound to infuriate her father!  She put it in her pocket,
thinking, "Shave your legs with Dad's razor today, 
and enjoy his blood-curdling
screams tomorrow."
</p>

<p>
In the next chest she found a slip of paper, hidden beneath a pile
of clothes.
"This is an interesting phone bill," she thought.
"Who does Quinn know on planet
X57?"  The total charge was a whopping
$673.24!
</p>

<p>
Daria had just stuffed the bill into her pocket when Quinn appeared
again, still complaining about Daria revealing her kinship.
"Watch out!" yelled Daria as Quinn brushed against
her.  "You're messing up my clothes!"&nbsp;<a href="#clothes">[26]</a>
</p>

<p>
Daria repeated her trick of waving the clogs around, and once again
Quinn retreated in disgust.
</p>

<p>
Making sure that Quinn had gone downstairs, Daria kept rummaging
around.  Quinn's room was proving to be a treasure trove of items
that will anger her father!
</p>

<p>
In the third
chest she found another hidden item.
"Quinn should learn not to leave her report cards lying around," said
Daria as she extracted it from its hiding place.
"Dad's unstable enough."
</p>

<p>
Finally, in Quinn's sock drawer Daria found another
surprising object.
"So that's where the sideview mirror wound up when it, um, fell off."
</p>

<p>
Staring into the mirror, Daria reflected that
hell was doing bad things
to her complexion.  She ran her fingers through
her auburn hair.  She was wondering about ways of increasing
its bounciness, and perhaps introducing some shimmering highlights,
when she realized what was happening to her.
</p>

<p>
"I just thought about clothes and hair!" she said in a panic.
"I've gotta get out of
here," she thought as she raced for the door.
"I'm turning into Quinn!"
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
Back downstairs Daria put the final stage of her plan into action.
One by one she handed her father the items she'd found, in the
hope that they'd make him forget about Winnie the Pooh.
</p>

<p>
She started off with what she thought would be an obvious winner.
"Quinn's report card," said Daria as she handed it over,
"where Quinn shows she's building additions onto
her spacious room for improvement."
</p>

<p>
Jake's reaction wasn't what Daria expected at all, however.
"Quinn's report is all Cs and a couple of Ds!" he said.
"That's great!"  The lesson seemed to be that if you
expect nothing, every little thing looks good!
</p>

<p>
Daria's next attempt was more successful.
"The phone bill," she said.  
"Time to put your money where your mouth was."
</p>

<p>
Jake snatched at the bill and his eyes bulged as he saw the
total owed.
"Aaah!" he screamed.  "The phone bill!  It's in the millions!"
</p>

<p>
He was shaking with rage, but still clutched the book.  Daria tried
something else.
"Pants," she observed as she handed Jake the brown trousers
she'd found upstairs.
"What the man in the know wears when he wants respect."
</p>

<p>
Jake eyed them suspiciously before bellowing,
"Helen must have bought these pants for me!  I'll say she did,
because I don't wear easy-fit, old-man pants with elastic in the
waistband.  I'm not there yet, not by a long shot!"
</p>

<p>
As Jake continued his tirade, Daria pulled out the next item in her
pocket, the burger coupon.  She wasn't sure what good it would do,
but she was on a roll, so it was worth a try!
</p>

<p>
"This coupon's good for a free bucket of fries with a Jolly Meal,"
she noted.
"Small chokable plastic toy included."
</p>

<p>
Fists clenched in anger, Jake studied the coupon carefully.
"This fast food coupon expired yesterday,"
he yelled.  "Those lousy vendors are just
trying to mock me!  Get me all worked up about some fries and then
Bam!  No deal!  Well Jake Morgendorffer doesn't need your damn fries!"
</p>

<p>
Her father's face was now red with rage, so Daria quickly pulled out the
next item, his razor.
"Gah!" he screamed.
"A leg hair on my razor!  I've got to put this on my face!  My
face!"
</p>

<p>
By now Jake looked like he was about to burst.  Daria took out
her <em>piece de resistance</em>.
"Do your makeup and drive at the same time
with this handy sideview mirror," she said casually.
</p>

<p>
"The side mirror of the Lexus belongs on the Lexus!" screeched
Jake, almost incoherent with anger.  "It's gonna cost
more than a new car to get that put back on!"
</p>

<p>
Clutching the mirror in his hands Jake's fury seemed to reach
a catastrophic level when, in a reminder that this was all a dream,
he literally exploded, leaving nothing but a scorch mark and the
copy of Winnie the Pooh sitting on the couch!
</p>

<p>
Without registering any surprise, Daria retrieved the book.
"So that's why you're supposed to return overdue books," she said
to herself as Helen walked back into the room.
</p>

<p>
"Daria," she said with slight annoyance,
"did you make your father implode?"
</p>

<p>
"Technically," the teen relied, "I think I made him explode."
</p>

<p>
"Implode, explode!" said Helen.  
"Either way, I wish he'd done it outdoors."
</p>

<p>
She headed for the kitchen, muttering,
"Now, where did I leave the dustbuster?"
</p>

<p>
As Daria stood alone, surveying the strange situation, she
heard a familiar voice from behind.
"Looks like someone's dad should have switched to decaf."
</p>

<p>
Turning around, Daria found that the abstract painting on the
Morgendorffer's living room wall - the one that Mrs Gupty liked so
much - had changed subtly.  The big black
dot had become a pair of red lips
and below that was a blue eye.
</p>

<p>
As Daria watched the features rearranged until the angular
features of her best friend emerged.
"There, that's better," said Jane.
"Now I can talk and blink at the same time."
</p>

<p>
It seemed that Jane had arrived to deliver yet another pompous speech.
"You have found the magic book," she began.  
"The last step on your ..."
</p>

<p>
"Just get me to the lowest circle of hell," interrupted
Daria.  "Mom's about to make me
vacuum the living room."
</p>

<p>
"Then look into my poorly drawn eye," said the Jane-like painting.
"And do not try this at home.
I'm a fully trained and licensed hallucination."  
</p>

<p>
Once again Daria felt the mystical spiral swallowing her up, and
she began
her descent into the dark void that led down to the final level
of her personal hell.
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
In the blackness, Daria
heard Jane's voice continuing to give
instructions.
"We're almost out of this stupid dream,"
she said.  "Find Ms Li and give her
back her junk and she'll give you back your life.  Then the real
nightmare begins."
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<blockquote>
<em>
Go directly to hell, and do not collect $200!  The game of real
life, next on Sick Sad World.
</em>
</blockquote>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
Daria found herself back in the hallway of Lawndale High School.
This time, however, the imposing barred door at the end of the
corridor was unlocked.
</p>

<p>
Daria pushed the heavy wooden door open and walked in.  But
instead of a room she found herself in a huge cavern, resembling
a more traditional view of hell.  Narrow paths led away from
the doorway in several directions, separated by deep pits filled
with red-hot lava.  Watching one's step seemed like a wise 
strategy here!
</p>

<p>
"Looks like Ms Li has been doing a little redecorating,"
understated Daria.
</p>

<p>
The smoke and steam rising from the pits made it difficult to see
very far.  With no obvious alternative, Daria started walking.
"I've gotta give Ms Li her missing junk back," she
pondered.  "But there's still one
more piece of junk I need to find."  So far she had found only four
of the five missing items.
</p>

<p>
Turning right, Daria found that the path was blocked by a large
portait of Mr O'Neill etched into the rock floor.  She had no
choice but to step on it as she walked forward.
</p>

<p>
As soon as she had walked over the portrait, however, there was a
flash and a life-size image of O'Neill himself appeared.
"Ah!" said the apparition.
"I think we've learned a lot about how hell can be
... emotionally challenging."
</p>

<p>
Spooked by this eerie development, Daria walked as quickly as she 
could,
but the phantom English teacher followed right behind her.
Daria turned left and after a short distance noticed another
portrait
on the floor to her left.  This time it was Ms Barch.
</p>

<p>
Still trying to evade O'Neill's ghost,
Daria had no choice but to chance walking over
Barch's image.  
Fortunately, nothing seemed to happen when she did so, but she
found herself in a cul-de-sac, and O'Neill was getting closer!
</p>

<p>
Daria was trapped, and just as she feared the worst, the wraith
walked over the image of Ms Barch.  As it did so, Barch's voice
called out, "I will not be walked on by a man!"
And with that O'Neill's apparition disappeared.
</p>

<p>
With a sigh of relief, Daria retraced her steps over Barch's
image and back towards where she started.  This time she kept on
going past the path leading to the entrance.
</p>

<p>
The next portrait blocking her way proved to be that of 
classmate Michael MacKenzie, better known as "Mack".
Daria was reluctant to step on the picture, after what happened last
time.
</p>

<p>
However, through the haze ahead she could see another part of the
maze, this time containing a picture of Principal Li and, best of
all, on the floor nearby was the hall pass!
</p>

<p>
Daria just had to have that pass, so she tried walking quickly
over Mack's image.  Once again, a ghostly apparition appeared, this
time in the shape of Mr MacKenzie.
"Pleased to make your acquaintance," said the wraith, but
he sounded anything but pleased!
The last time Daria had heard Mack use that tone of voice was
when he was addressing the obnoxious Tommy 
Sherman.&nbsp;<a href="#mackjodie">[27]</a>
</p>

<p>
This spirit also seemed determined to catch her, so Daria hurried 
forward
towards the hall pass.  As she got closer, however, she saw with
bitter disappointment that there was no connection at all
between the part of the
pathway containing the hall pass and the part of the maze she was on.
Daria
couldn't possibly jump over the lava pit separating her from the
pass.  The only way to get there seemed to be flying, something
for which the unathletic teenager was ill-equipped!
</p>

<p>
Even worse, the path she was hurrying down turned out to be another
dead end!  She looked back and the phantom Mack was still pursuing 
her.
With her options rapidly diminishing, Daria decided to turn and head
back towards the maze's entrance.
</p>

<p>
She walked right through Mack's apparition, but the effort knocked
the wind out of her and left her feeling weak.  These phantoms
were definitely not friendly!&nbsp;<a href="#badmack">[28]</a>
</p>

<p>
Retracing her steps, Daria again encountered O'Neill's image.
There was no choice, so she walked over it and, once again,
a ghostly copy of the teacher appeared.
Now Daria had two phantoms chasing her!
</p>

<p>
Daria walked quickly ahead until she was near the maze's entrance.
This time, however, she took the left-hand path.
</p>

<p>
With the two phantoms in hot pursuit, Daria kept moving and
soon saw that not only had she walked down another dead end,
but it terminated with a portrait of her classmate Jodie Landon.
</p>

<p>
Daria and Jodie had not always seen eye to eye, but she hoped that
Jodie's portrait may have a similar effect on the monsters as Ms Barch's.
With the ghosts close behind, Daria stepped onto the image.
</p>

<p>
Mack and Jodie had had an on-again, off-again relationship for
some time, and it seemed that it was 'off' right now.
Jodie's voice cried, "Leave me alone!" in
the same whiny tone Daria had heard Jodie use on Mack 
before.&nbsp;<a href="#mackjodie">[27]</a>
Both Mack and O'Neill's ghosts vanished.
</p>

<p>
But this time there was an additional effect.
Daria felt her surroundings alter and suddenly realized that she
was in a different part of the maze!
She was still standing on Jodie's portrait, but everything else had
changed.  She had been teleported from one picture of Jodie to
another!
</p>

<p>
This discovery gave Daria an idea.  If Jodie's image could move
her between different parts of the labyrinth, then maybe
an image of Ms Li would transport her to the hall pass!
</p>

<p>
Anxious to test this theory, Daria headed back in what she
thought was the direction of the maze's entrance.  On the
path ahead, however, was another frightening obstacle, an image of
the Fashion Club!
</p>

<p>
With a fatalistic tread, Daria walked over it and, sure enough,
up popped Sandi Griffin, Tiffany Blum-Deckler and Stacy Rowe.
They chimed in unison, "We can't believe you're leaving here dressed 
like that!"
</p>

<p>
With the three ghosts in tow, Daria hurried onwards, turning right
at the next junction.  She passed the image of Ms Barch she had
used to get rid of O'Neill and instead continued straight ahead.
She was now in a part of the maze she hadn't visited before.
</p>

<p>
Turning left at the next intersection she soon came across an
image of Charles Ruttheimer III.  Daria looked back
at the ghostly Fashion Club that was haunting her.
If anything was likely to scare those girls it was UpChuck!
</p>

<p>
So saying, Daria walked over Charles' image.  As soon as the
ghostly trio tried to emulate her, however, 
there was the familiar mating call,
"Rrrrrr! Feisty!" and the three phantoms vanished.
Daria's hunch about opposites annihilating one another had proven
right.
</p>

<p>
Up ahead was an unusually wide section of the pathway, this time
with a picture of Ms Li in the middle.  Daria stopped and
studied it.  There was something strange - Ms Li parts her hair
on the left, but this image did so on the right.
</p>

<p>
Daria didn't think this too important, however, and she stepped onto
the mirror image, hoping that it would transport her to the
hall pass.  But to her dismay
Ms Li's voice boomed out, 
"A violation of the school's walking-around-in-a-maze policy has
been reported.  Return to the beginning of the maze at once.  And no
talking."
</p>

<p>
Instead of finding herself at her desired destination, Daria was back
at the beginning!  Before trying again she paused to reflect on her
situation.  If there was one thing her reading had taught her
about labyrinths, it was that the good stuff is always in the middle!
</p>

<p>
Resolving to head for the center of the maze, rather than directly towards
the hall pass, Daria set out again, starting by turning right.
</p>

<p>
Once again she walked over O'Neill's picture and awoke his spirit,
but this time she knew what to do and turned left at the next
two intersections to find the portrait
of Ms Barch and thereby eliminate the menace. 
</p>

<p>
Thus unemcumbered she followed the main path again, turning left at
the next intersection, walking over the harmless image of
Upchuck and around the mirror image of Ms Li on the wide part of the
path.
</p>

<p>
Now she was again in unfamiliar territory.
Up ahead was another image of the Fashion Club, so
Daria walked quickly over it and continued straight on.
</p>

<p>
She had now accumulated another three phantoms and was approaching
a dead end.  Fortunately at the end was a picture of
Jodie.  Daria stepped onto it, allowing herself to be
teleported away from the fashion fiends.
</p>

<p>
She found herself in another widened section of the pathway.
There were three ways to go and, choosing one at random,
Daria walked a short distance until she encountered a huge
steel gate blocking the path.  A sign on it read:
<blockquote>
No entry without hall pass
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
There was no way to go further, so Daria retraced her steps back 
past the
picture of Jodie and walked around it, going straight ahead.
Up ahead was another image of Mack and she tried crossing it as
lightly as her combat boots would allow, but still still the
ghostly image of her classmate appeared and began to pursue her.
</p>

<p>
Daria kept going forward and noticed in the distance another
portrait of Ms Li carved into the rock floor.  She crossed her
fingers that this was the right one as she walked briskly forward.
</p>

<p>
As she'd hoped, this image was the right way around.  Her heart
racing, Daria stepped onto it, barely ahead of the phantom pursuing
her.
</p>

<p>
Again Daria felt the sensation of being teleported,
but this time Principal Li's voice said,
"Go directly to the hall pass in an orderly fashion.
Single file, people."
</p>

<p>
When her vision cleared, Daria found herself standing on the isolated
section of the maze containing Ms Li's image and, best of all, the
precious item she sought.
"The hall pass," she thought
as she picked it up.
"Magic ticket to the enchanted world of loitering."
</p>

<p>
Now she just needed to return to the locked gate, and she knew
exactly how to do it.  In rapid succession she stepped on the
portait of Ms Li, which transported her back to her previous location,
walked back over the image of Mack and, keeping ahead of the 
ghost thus summoned, walked past Jodie's portrait to the steel
barrier.
</p>

<p>
As soon as she reached it she felt herself being whisked away to another
part of the inferno.
"The mighty hall pass has spoken," she thought as she fell into
darkness once more.
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
This time Daria found herself standing in a huge hall, holding a
cardboard box containing the five items she had recovered.
In front of her,
in a scene reminiscent of MGM's <em>Wizard of Oz</em>,
was a huge image of Angela Li's head, flanked by torches shooting
balls of flame into the air.
</p>

<p>
"Fe, fi, fo, fum!" boomed the terrifying vision.
"I smell things that have been stolen."
</p>

<p>
Daria stood her ground.
"You smell right, O Mighty One," she shouted back.
"Here's the stuff that got your
support hose in a knot."
</p>

<p>
Seemingly caught off guard, the image responded,
"Oh, well, um, please pay attention to the Principal behind the
curtain!"  And then Ms Li herself emerged.
</p>

<p> 
"This was a test," she said to Daria.
"These could only be found by the strong of
spirit, pure of heart and noble of mind.  Which is why I'm
surprised <em>you</em> found them, Daria Morgendorffer!"
</p>

<p>
"We're inside my head," replied Daria.
"Things tend to focus on me here."
</p>

<p>
"That explains it!" said Ms Li, relieved.
"I was worried there was something wrong with the
test."
</p>

<p>
Then, waving her arm, Li said, "Let this now be your reward."
</p>

<p>
Once more Daria felt herself falling through the same spiral of
light that started this nightmare.
"Some reward," she said petulantly.
"Leave it to Ms Li to save money by recycling cheap
special effects."
</p>

<p>
Down she fell until,
at the moment of impact, Daria was finally jolted awake!
</p>

<hr width="50%">

<p>
"Whoa!" said Daria sitting up.  
"Where am I?"
</p>

<p>
Looking around she realized she was back in O'Neill's English class.
The lesson was over and all the students had left, except
Brittany, Jane, Kevin, and Mr O'Neill himself.  They were
all standing
around Daria's desk looking amused.
</p>

<p>
"Darn!" said Jane.
"We were just betting to see if you were a drooler or a
snorer.  My money was on the drool."
</p>

<p>
"Sorry to wreck your fun," said Daria, still trying to wake
up properly.  "I just had the weirdest dream."
</p>

<p>
"You were in it," she said pointing to Jane, "and you ..." she 
continued, indicating Kevin, who replied "Cool!"
</p>

<p>
"... and you!" concluded Daria looking at Mr O'Neill.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, the even tempered teacher didn't seem annoyed that his
star pupil had fallen asleep in his class.
"And did you learn anything uplifting in this journey of the mind?"
he asked.
</p>

<p>
Daria reflected for a moment and responded, 
"I learned that no matter where my mind may wander, there's no place
like Lawndale."
</p>

<p>
O'Neill seemed pleased with this comment until
Daria added, "But hell comes very close!"
</p>

<p>
<em>Daria's Inferno</em> was released in 2000 and contains characters
and locations
from <em>Daria</em>'s first three seasons only.  (Notably,
Tom Sloane does not appear.)  Thus, <em>Daria's Inferno</em> fits
quite comfortably as a
fourteenth episode in <em>Daria</em>'s fantasy-oriented
third season.  The game's storyline is entirely linear, and the
only unusual aspect of this "episode" is that parts of it
are interactive.
</p>
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="elwell">
<p>
As well as writing the script for <em>Daria's Inferno</em>, Peter Elwell
is author of <em>Daria</em> episodes <em>The Lawndale File</em>,
<em>A Tree Grows in Lawndale</em>, <em>Legends of the Mall</em> and
<em>Lucky Strike</em>, and co-author of
<em>Daria!</em> (a.k.a. 
<em>Daria - The Musical</em>). 
</p>
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="quotes">
<p>
These two comments are made by Daria and Quinn during the game's
initialization, before the story proper begins.  One of the problems
with faithfully transcribing the dialogue from the game is that
some of the comments made by the characters relate to
the game itself, rather than the story it contains.  In writing
this novelization I have attempted to include every utterance made by
all the characters, verbatim.  However, a few instructions to the
player have been omitted.  Also, some small liberties have been
taken with Daria's reflections on the objects she picks up, 
as these are often expressed in the game as hints to the player.  (The
player can ask what a particular object is, and Daria responds with
a pithy explanation.)
</p>
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="eyeballs">
<p>
The giant eyeballs that appear twice in the story may be inspired
by Daria's reaction to Ms Li's description of the "public eye"
in <em>The Lost Girls</em>.
</p>
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="pockets">
<p>
It's not clear how Daria manages to carry
the numerous items she finds
during the game.  She isn't wearing her gray backpack, and
she is never shown carrying anything (except briefly
at the very end of the game).  Therefore, I've assumed that everything
is magically stored in her jacket's pockets.  Indeed, various
<em>Daria</em> episodes show that her jacket is capable of holding
notepads, pens and even hardcover books without so much as a telltale
bulge!  (The opening credits of <em>Is It College Yet?</em> also
reveal that there are pockets in Daria's pleated skirt.)
</p>
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="jumping">
<p>
One of the pleasing aspects of the game is that Daria is not required
to do anything uncharacteristically athletic.  
(The most energetic thing she ever does in <em>Daria</em>'s 
five seasons is when she runs a few yards to catch up to Jodie
in <em>Partner's Complaint</em>.)
In the game her actions are limited to walking around, picking up and
using various items, and talking to people.
</p>
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="dreamgame">
<p>
The actual word spoken by Daria here is "game", not "dream".  This
is one of only two self-referential statements made
in the game's dialogue.  The other one, which I have not
attempted to incorporate into the novelization, is the following
sarcastic
remark by Daria: "Is this some computer geek's idea of a good
time?"
</p>
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="ssw">
<p>
Throughout the game the player has the option of asking for a 
hint in the form of an advertisement for <em>Sick Sad World</em>.  
This aspect of the game proved
impossible to weave into the narrative of the story.  Instead,
the SSW announcer's comments are simply displayed above as interludes at
the relevant point.
(Admittedly, however, they are not very meaningful without the
accompanying visuals.)
</p>
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="clones">
<p>
At various points in the game Daria encounters obstacles in the form
of irritating people who repeatedly block her way or bump into her.
These are represented in the game by having individual characters
appear several times on the screen simultaneously.  For instance,
the entrance to Lawndale High is blocked by dozens of identical
Tad Guptys and Big-Wheel Girls.  This repetitive
aspect of the gameplay has
not been incorporated into the narrative above.  Instead a single
encounter with the individuals concerned is described.
</p>
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="staring">
<p>
Daria's comment when attacked by the flying eyeballs
is one of my favorites.
Despite facing a terrifying
supernatural menace, Daria just
complains about being stared at!
</p>
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="meter">
<p>
In the game itself Daria's "irritation meter" is a literal thing.
As various annoyances bump into her it registers on a meter at
the bottom of the screen.  When her irritation reading
reaches the top of the scale Daria is sent back
to the beginning of the current game level.  This is a clever,
non-violent alternative to the usual computer game notion of players
having a fixed number of "lives".  (Daria's Inferno is an exploration
game.  It's impossible to lose the game and
Daria can't be seriously harmed.  
Even when navigating narrow ledges and other dangerous
situations she cannot fall or be hurt.)
</p>
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="detector">
<p>
I've cheated slightly in various places by including comments that
are normally made only when Daria exits a particular location.
For instance, Daria actually makes her comment about
the "mental detector" when she exits the front door of the school.
However, unless you forget to pick up an item from outside, there
is normally no reason to do this.
</p>
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="popgirl">
<p>
This is one of only a few small inconsistencies between the game and the
series.  'Popular Girl' (first introduced in <em>The Invitation</em>)
is actually in Quinn's class, not Daria's.
</p>
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="scent">
<p>
Actually I have no idea what this word is.  Despite listening to
Daria's protest about being sprayed with perfume dozens of times, I
simply can't work out what she says.
</p>
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="tiffany">
<p>
Tiffany's delivery of her only line in the game is a classic!  
The casual way she uses "Girl-Who-Lives-With-Quinn" as Daria's
name is hilarious.
</p>
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="booths">
<p>
In the game the dressing rooms each contain a <em>Daria</em> character
either in some state of (mild)
undress or dressed as one of their alter egos.  There are far
too many to describe here - buy the game if you want to see them!
</p>
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="hat">
<p>
In addition to the dialogue cited above, Daria also says,
"I should pick it up," with reference to the cowboy hat.
Evidently this was added to the game to ensure that the player
realized they are meant to take the hat off the mannequin.
(All the other items Daria finds in the game are on the ground or
on furniture and
are obviously there to be picked up.  The hat looks no different
from the other scenery in the clothes store and is easily
overlooked.)
</p>
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="moshed">
<p>
Daria's delivery of her line
about being "moshed" is another of my favorites!
</p>
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="dogs">
<p>
Daria's encounter with the aggressive dogs in the alley behind The
Zon is surprisingly disturbing.  All the other problems she encounters
during the game are mere irritations.  This is the only situation
in which the game puts Daria in serious physical danger.  (In fact, the
dogs do not injure her, of course.  As noted above, Daria's Inferno
is an exploration game, and Daria cannot be hurt or killed.)
</p>
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="lesson">
<p>
Brittany delivers this line directly to the "camera".
</p>
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="accent">
<p>
In the game Axl has completely lost the British accent
he affected in <em>Pierce Me</em>.  (Presumably
a different voice actor plays the part.)
</p>
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="helen">
<p>
Helen's remarks to Daria during the game are exceptionally
thoughtless.  They are comparable with her worst parenting
blunders in <em>Daria</em>.
</p>
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="upstairs">
<p>
The biggest inconsistency between the game and the series is the
upstairs layout of the Morgendorffer's home.  In the game Daria's
and Quinn's bedrooms are shown to be on the left, for someone
standing at the top of the stairs.  In fact, these two doors lead
to Jake and Helen's bedroom and the guest room.  The correct location
for the girls' bedrooms is to turn right at the top of the stairs,
and follow the corridor to the end.  Daria's bedroom is then on the
left (at the back of the house, above the kitchen) and Quinn's
bedroom is on the right (at the front of the house, above the
garage).  This significant error is rather surprising, given that
the game otherwise pays very close attention to the detail of 
<em>Daria</em>'s universe.  In the novelization above I have
assumed the correct upstairs layout, rather than the one shown in
the game.  
</p>
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="clothes">
<p>
Daria's sudden concern for her clothing
while in Quinn's room is another of my favorite moments in the
game! 
</p>
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="mackjodie">
<p>
The sound bites used for Mack and Jodie in Ms Li's Labyrinth
are both taken from the soundtrack of <em>The Misery Chick</em>.
(All of the other vocals in the game were recorded
especially.)
</p>
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="badmack">
<p>
It seems a little incongruous that Mack is one of Daria's 
obstacles
in Ms Li's Labyrinth.  Of all Daria's classmates, Mack was the one
who caused her the least irritation in <em>Daria</em>.  Indeed,
Daria and Mack rarely interacted at all!
</p>
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="closure">
<p>
A slightly
disappointing aspect of the game's final sequence is that no
explanation is ever given for what happened to Ms Li's missing
stuff in real life.
</p>
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="credits">
<p>
The reward for completing the game
is to see the closing credits, which are presented in
traditional <em>Daria</em> style, but with a couple of 
differences.
Firstly, the credits feature the full-length version of
Splendora's <em>Daria</em> theme song, with additional
verses not heard
