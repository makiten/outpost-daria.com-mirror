<P>Scene 1</P>
<P><B><I>Middle February, as the leaves around the city of Lawndale have begun turning green especially around Lawndale High as the school bell rings, signaling the end of another school day and the beginning of a long holiday weekend for Daria Morgendorffer and her friend, Jane Lane as they leave school as usual, and go in the direction of the pizza parlor for after school pizza.</I></B></P>
<P>Daria: So Jane, what did you think of Mr. Di Martino's class today, as if their was anything to think about on a Friday?</P>
<P>Jane: Scary, very scary! His bulging eyes are starting to remind me of your dad...</P>
<P>Daria: Tell me about it! Both of them are headed for a killer stress attack, if not a stroke! And Upchuck was no help with his sexist drool! It almost got us double homework, and a book report over the weekend! Remind me to choke Upchuck on Tuesday</P>
<P>Jane: Hey Daria, speaking of strokes, as in a stroke of pure genius, I just remembered something! Mystik Spiral's playing at McGrundy's Pub today! Want to, eh---- stop by? I know Trent would be excited..........</P>
<P>Daria: [deadpan] Oh I'm just sure he would! <I>(snarls at Jane)</I> [thinking] <I>Why do I smell a setup?</I> [speaks to Jane] And just HOW Miss Lane, do you suppose we gain entry inside McGrundy's? You know how those idiots are about fake ID's.</P>
<P>Jane: You haven't heard? The city council took their liquor license, and now they sell coffee, sodas, juice, and food! It was right after that accident out side of the place! The family sued, got a fat settlement, and that's when they took their license! So now, legally, we can get in!</P>
<P>Daria: So they finally got smart, not that it would help them any, but what happen to getting pizza?</P>
<P>Jane: Earth to Daria, have you been listening? They now have pizza there, and its far better than the grease that awaits us at the pizza parlor, and less expensive too. Even their Shovel Full O' Onion Rings are good. (Daria gives Jane a smug look) Well, that's what Trent told me! C'mon Daria! It will be fun!</P>
<P>Daria: Jane you know I hate fun, but OK!<I>(Jane and Daria change direction as they go)</I></P>

<P>Quinn: So you see Joey, Jeffy, Jamie, you guys should never believe anything Daria says! She's a miserable liar, who just wants to be my sister, and ruin my life! She's <I>really </I>my cousin, I'm an only child! We don't even look alike, my goodness!</P>
<P>Joey, Jeffy, Jamie, : [voices, in unison] Whoa! <I>(camera pans to Joey)</I></P>
<P>Joey: I always knew there was something wrong with what she was saying! <I>(camera pans to Jeffey)</I></P>

<P><B><I>INT --A surprisingly packed crowd filled McGrundy's for an afternoon. Most of the tables were filled with mostly poseurs. Daria and Jane survey the crowd, walk in and find a table</I></B></P>
<P>Daria: Not half bad! Trent tells me this place is usual half-empty, like Quinn's head!<I>(Jane smirks at Daria) </I>Alright Jane, enough of the damn yenta act!</P>
<P>Jane: Gee Daria, I was smirking at your Quinn remark! [thinking] <I>What's gotten into her?</I> [to Daria] Hey look! A table with two of the same kind of chairs, just waiting for us!</P>
<P>Daria: Oh I just BET, they are! <I>(The two walk over to the table and sit down)</I>[thinking] <I>She had to have set this up!</I></P>

The band, which also features his long time friend, and Jane's &quot;love&quot; interest, Jesse Moreno on rhythm-guitar, were tuning up as Trent notices his sister and, of course Daria. Trent whispers something to Jesse who passes the message to the other members. Trent begins to speak through the microphone.</P>
<P>Trent: Hey! Good afternoon, and welcome to the new McGrundy's! [wild applause] Is this a hot crowd or what? [more wild applause] Anyway, We're Mystik Spiral and we want to kick it off with the B-side to our current single, &quot;Behind My Eyelids,&quot; and it's called &quot;Icebox Woman.&quot; And I'm dedicated it to someone I consider a <I>very</I> special friend, and a very special young lady, and her name is <I>----Daria Morgendorffer.</I> <I>(Trent and the band begin to play)</I></P>

<P>Daria: [whispers to a near grunt] You know, you<I> </I>just can't stop playing yenta, can you, or is that your damn goal in life, Jane Lane? [thinking] <I>Yep! She set me up!</I></P>
<P>Jane: Ooooh! Feisty today, aren't we? Trent likes a feisty lady! <I>(Daria gives Jane, the look of death) </I>[thinking] <I>Mental note to myself! Do not to quote Upchuck anymore!</I></P>

<P>Quinn: Hi mom!</P>
<P>Helen: <I>QUINN MORGENDORFFER</I>! Don't you even<I> think</I> of going upstairs. You're in big trouble, young lady! <I>(Quinn freezes in fear. Helen stops her routine)</I> I received a call from your principal, Ms. Li at school today saying <I>(Helen turns toward Quinn)</I> that you have been telling your friends that <I>Daria</I> is your &quot;cousin!&quot; <I>(CU on Quinn in a look of fear)</I></P>
<P>Scene 4</P>
<P><B><I>EXT McGrundy's Pub</I></B></P>
<P>Daria and Jane leaving the pub. You can still hear Mystik Spiral play inside. Daria was still quite shaken by Trent's actions and upset with Jane for ribbing her about it. Daria is set to blow at anytime</P>
<P>Jane: I don't know why you wanted to leave early! We didn't even get to eat, and Trent was just getting fired up, just for you! <I>(Daria gives Jane another look of death) </I>You know Daria, You've been awful damn moody and quiet since--------</P>
<P>Daria: <I>SHUT THE HELL UP, JANE!</I> <I>(Daria and Jane stop as Daria turns Jane</I>) Once again, Miss Lane, your trivial little ass set me up, but why should that surprise-----</P>
<P>Jane: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold the phones! If you're talking about the little dedication that Trent did, I had no idea he was going to do that! I thought it was kinda cute myself! But, if you're so damn upset about it, why aren't you yelling at Trent? He's the guilty party, <I>not moi</I>! But of course you would <I>NEVER</I> yell at Trent, because you're a love-sick puppy that's scared of him------</P>
<P>Daria: Bullcrap Jane! <I>(points at Jane) Unadulterated, uncorrupted, bullcrap!</I> Your trivial little ass knew damn well he was going to do that! That's why you dragged me there today! That's why I'm yelling at you, not Trent! You don't see me playing yenta with you and Jesse, do you? And, no, I didn't think it was cute missy! Far the hell from it! So don't you dare stand there and try to thrust the guilt on to Trent to cover that trivial ass of yours! I wouldn't be a bit shocked to find out you put him up to it! You know I hate that! And don't pull that &quot;I'm scared of Trent&quot; garbage,&quot; because it is just that--- <I>GARBAGE</I>! You're behaving worse than Quinn! And what's worse, is that you're now comparing me to a domestic animal! Will wonders ever cease from you? I guess not in this lifetime! If Trent wants to tell me his true feelings about me, he can do that on his own, he doesn't need you to meddle. And personally, I'm getting tired of your damn interference, Jane, because you're pushing the boundaries of our friendship, dammit!<I> (Jane becomes angry)</I></P>
<P>Jane: Dammit yourself Daria! You know you've had it bad with Trent for months and you know he has had it even worse for you! He wakes up at night, screaming your name-----</P>
<P>Daria: Another damn lie-----</P>
<P>Jane: And why is that a lie? Because you've known in your heart that you've wanted Trent more than anything in this world, even more than your own family! I don't have to put Trent up to anything! And if I did put him up to it, it's because I don't seem to know you anymore. <I>(Daria looks at Jane with disdain)</I></P>
<P>Daria: Well now, what's there to know, Jane? I don't like to be set-up to take a fall!</P>
<P>Jane: And that's another <I>damn</I> thing! You think everyone is trying to set you up! You've been acting really paranoid lately, as well as turned into an royal pain in the ass over Trent! Friendship, what <I>damn </I>friendship? You take offense to ANYTHING I say amiss about you and Trent, or just Trent in general! And when I do, you threaten me with bodily harm, if not certain death. A real friend wouldn't do that, but you do! So don't you dare start any crap about me setting you up! <I>(Daria tries not to cry as she turns away from Jane)</I> Truth really hurts now, doesn't it, Daria? <I>(Daria violently turns toward Jane as Daria takes a swing, but stops, starts to cry and runs away. Jane gasps at the horror of it all) </I></P>

<P>LS of an irritated Quinn pacing back and forth through the living room.</P>
<P>Quinn: This is so unfair, Mom! My entire social life has been completely ruined!</P>
<P>Helen: [voice] Quinn, you think <I>EVERYTHING</I> is unfair, to you that is<I>! (Helen walks into</I> <I>the picture)</I> That is why <I>YOU</I>, young lady, are going to learn to love, recognize, and appreciate your sister, and if it means you staying home instead of going out, Quinn, so be it! <I>(Quinn stops pacing)</I></P>
<P>Quinn: [whining, even more than usual] But Mom! No dates outside the house for two months? Ooooooh! I might as well die, or whatever!</P>
<P>Helen: Quinn, Daria doesn't date outside the house that much. You don't see her brooding! <I>(Quinn turns away from Helen)</I></P>
<P>Quinn: [mumbles] That's because she's a misery chick and can't get a date! <I>(Helen smacks [SXF: smack] Quinn in the back of the head) OUCH!</I></P>
<P>Helen: I heard that, Quinn! You want to make it four months? And besides, you should of thought of the end result of lying before you started those lies of yours about Daria, just because she doesn't have your kind of shallow friends! Speaking of which, have you ever tried to be a friend to Daria?</P>
<P>Quinn: And get myself kicked out of the <I>Fashion</I> <I>Club</I>? I'd rather eat mice, or whatever!</P>
<P>Helen: Is that <I>all</I> you think about Quinn, besides boys, is that <I>damn</I> Fashion Club? You know Quinn, sometimes, I'm ashamed to call you my daughter! <I>(Quinn storms off)</I> Ohhhh! What am I going to do with that <I>damn</I> child? Speaking of Daria, she's running late! <I>(A door is heard open. Helen turns in the direction of it to find Daria entering, still an emotional</I> <I>wreck)</I> Daria, my god, you've been crying! <I>(Daria eyes begins to water again as she runs to Helen's shoulder and cries)</I> It's OK, I'm here!</P>

[pause] Oh, I see you've been playing marriage broker, <I>again</I>! [now angry] Dammit Janey! We have talked about that already! I could see why she would take a swing at you! I would too!

[voice begins to crack even more]<I> </I>I, Jane Lane, on the other hand, have blown it with Daria! <I>(Jane sheds another tear as Trent strokes her hair)</I> Trent, I said things to her today, I wouldn't say to a dog! The whole episode went down so ugly! She's never going to speak to me again....<I>(Jane starts to cry)</I></P>

You know Daria, none of the guys that Quinn has dated even comes close!<I> </I>I wouldn't know how they really are anyway since she never introduces us to them! For all I know, they're all probably perverts, that only want to get Quinn laid!<I>(Daria attempts to surpress a smile and a slight chuckle through her tears, as she put her glasses back on!)</I> And I think you know it too, Daria, or else you wouldn't be trying to surpress that cute smile that you have! You know, I bet Trent would love to see that smile! And of course, you think that if you tell him how you <I>really</I> feel, you'll lose him as a friend?</P>
<P>Daria: You know me all too well, Mom!</P>
<P>Helen: Moms are suppose to know their daughters too well! <I>(Helen holds Daria's hand) </I></P>
<P>Daria: But Mom, what <I>really </I>hurts is that Jane continues to interfere, not letting us take our time, so we can tell each other how we feel!</P>
<P>Helen: I know how that can be! Take your Grandfather Barksdale! He didn't think at, first, your father was good enough for me, but we persevered! [smiles] What you need to do first and foremost, is tell Trent how you really feel, and don't be afraid if he rejects you as anything less than a friend. But I'm sure he won't! And everything else including your friendship with Jane, will fall into back into place! <I>(Daria smiles and is comforted by</I> <I>those words)</I> I see someone's feeling better!</P>
<P>Daria: Thanks Mom! I am feeling a little better! Going to finish my homework and call it a early night <I>(Daria gets up</I> <I>and gives her mom a kiss on the cheek)</I> I love you! Good night!<I> (She leaves the scene)</I></P>

<P>Helen: I am too, and please call me Helen!<B><I> </I></B>Daria's usually<B><I> </I></B>very serene! She never even cried as a baby, but now, I just don't know what to do! I really think that <I>damn</I> prison they call a high school is partly to blame!</P>
<P>Trent: I know, my sister can be the same way! I haven't seen her this wrought-up in a long time. I would have to agree with you on Lawndale High!</P>
<P>Helen: Now Trent, I know Daria has feelings for you, and she's afraid to tell you those feelings, I feel, because she thinks you'll hate her for that! <I>(Trent is shocked to hear Helen say that!)</I></P>
<P>Trent: Funny you say that, I have that same fear about telling Daria!</P>
<P>Helen: <I>Really?</I> Does Daria know about this?</P>
<P>Trent: No, she doesn't! I would like to keep it that way, for right now! Your daughter is very special young lady to me, and I would like to have the honor to tell her myself!</P>
<P>Helen: Of course, I won't tell her a thing!</P>
<P>Trent: Thanks! [smiles] Well, as far as Daria and I go, Janey's interfering is not helping matters much!<B><I> </I></B>I really need to talk to Daria soon!</P>

<P>[CUT TO]</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>CU of Sandi, as the meeting begins</P>
<P>Sandi: [deep, monotone voice] I call this meeting, like, to order!<B><I> </I></B>Our first order of business is like, this <I>matter</I> of our vice-president, Quinn Morgendorffer, lying about her sister, Daria, being her cousin<I> </I>and her mom is like, making her feel like a common criminal<I>! (camera pans to Quinn who is seemly ashamed)</I></P>
<P>Quinn: Now Sandi, there is a reason why I did that! [spastic whining] If you had a sister who was ugly as sin, would you claim her as immediate family? [calms down]No, I don't think so!</P>
<P>[CUT TO]</P>
<P><B><I>Sandi, CU, who is smiling</I></B></P>
<P>Sandi: Well Quinn, I want to assure you that---------- we understand why<B><I> </I></B>you did that! <I>(camera pans to Stacy, who is taking notes)</I> And you're absolutely correct! Why would anyone claim her or anyone like her as anything? I mean she's like extremely dull, ugly, and has absolutely no friends whatsoever, except of course, that weird art school chick she hangs out with, her musician brother and his friend! I mean, like someone should like lock them up for being so hideous<I>(Stacy shocked to hear this and snarls at Sandi)</I></P>
<P>[CUT TO]</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>CU of Tiffany with a look of pure disdain</P>

<P><B><I>CU of a very relieved Quinn</I></B></P>

<P><B><I>CU of Sandi, looking at Stacy</I></B></P>
<P>Sandi: Yeah Stacy, like have you completely like lost it or is your hair like, braided too tight?<I> (camera pans to Stacy, who is infuriated)</I></P>
<P>Stacy: Let's just consider that as my formal resignation from this shallow, pee-brain clique! I've never seen such wolf-pack insensitivity!<I>(camera</I> <I>pans back to Sandi)</I></P>
<P>Sandi: Well Stacy, look who's talking about having a pee-brain! You can't even tell the difference between stretch-pants and leggings! You also can't breathe without hyperventilating! <I>(Everyone is laughing, but Stacy, whom the camera pans back to) </I>Shall we go on or do you like feel disgraced enough?</P>
<P>Stacy: Well now, Sandi, that says a lot coming from such a foolish bitch who can't dance to save her life and who worships a magazine! <I>(Stacy comes face to face with Sandi)</I></P>
<P>Sandi: Watch it! You want to join Daria?</P>
<P>Stacy: Well, that may not be a bad idea ,since you have a very short memory, if any at all, for if you recall, <I>(Sandi steps back) </I>if you can, it was Daria who counseled and practically consoled you, <I>(camera pans back to Sandi) </I>when your inane cat, <I>Fluffy</I>, got into your make-up [Sandi gasps] and swallowed it! <I>(camera pans back to Stacy)</I> And you Quinn, <I>(camera pans to Quinn) </I>strike me as being so sick, as well as wretched by ignoring as well as deny having any siblings! Gee, I wish I had a sister! <I>(camera pans back to Stacy) </I>Well, frankly Sandi, Tiffany, and Quinn, I'd rather wear combat boots, horn-rimmed glasses, and no make-up, than to hang around a bunch of freaking fashion flakes, thinking I'm so damn cool! <I>(Stacy gets up, picks up her notebook, and pen, and leaves the meeting, leaving everyone, except Quinn, stunned)</I></P>
