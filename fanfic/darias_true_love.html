Daria's True Love<br>
By: IJM<br>
<br>
Description: Daria is so happy with her boyfriend Tom, when finally Trent decides to tell her the truth about his feelings.<br>
<br>
Scene 1: Sloane's house<br>
<br>
TV: Today in Sick Sad World, cursed egyptians cats come back from the death to be your pets!!! stay in Sick Sad World<br>
Tom: What lucky I am, I don't have cats<br>
Daria: I can give you one if you want, it's not too late<br>
Tom: No thanks, but you can still give me a kiss if you want<br>
(Daria kisses him)<br>
Tom: You must be an egyptian goddess in your past life. I can´t imagine you as anybody else<br>
<br>
Daria looked at him, these months had been so cool with Tom, and the most important thing: Jane wasn't mad anymore, she almost thought that she had forgotten her crush on Trent already, with Tom on her side, she felt than anything could be better.<br>
<br>
Tom: Daria, DARIA<br>
Daria: What?<br>
Tom: I asked you if you wanna go to the movies tomorrow<br>
Daria: Yeah, sure, ... Tom?<br>
Tom: Yes?<br>
Daria: Are you happy with me?<br>
Tom: Of course I am, why wouldn't I be?<br>
Daria: You know, I'm not the most popular girl that exists and I'm not as sexy as my sister is and I...<br>
<br>
Tom leaned and kissed her, interrupting her in the middle of the sentence<br>
<br>
Tom: Daria I like you because you're so beautiful even you don't care about it, you're so smart and talented...I...I love you Daria, I love you so much<br>
<br>
Daria smiled to him, even she couldn't believe it, Tom loved her? she knew he liked her but she never thought that his feelings were so strong and she didn't know if she was ready for that. Daria embraced him and kissed him, she just couldn't believe it! it was so good to be true.<br>
<br>
<br>
Scene 2: Morgendorffers' house<br>
<br>
Helen: I brought you some apple pie girls<br>
Quinn: If Matthew calls me tell him that I'm going go to Sandi's party with Justin 'cause his crashed his car<br>
Helen: Who did crash his car Quinn?<br>
Quinn: Matthew of course, he's so fool, how could he think go to Sandi's party without car?<br>
Jake: What happened to the car? I just drove it...<br>
Quinn, Helen & Daria: Never mind<br>
<br>
(Phone rings)<br>
<br>
Quinn: It's for me!!!<br>
Daria: Yes, maybe, but you said that we have to keep him away from you because his car, it's incredible that an accident give you some clues who's your friend and who isn't<br>
Helen: Hello?<br>
Jane: Hi, is Daria there? it's Jane<br>
Helen: Sure Jane, Daria it's for you<br>
Daria: Did he crash his car? oh, never mind, I couldn't see the difference anyway<br>
Helen: It's Jane sweetie<br>
Daria: Hi Jane<br>
Jane: Hey Daria, do you wanna go to a party?<br>
Daria: Party? are you sick?<br>
Jane: No, well, sort of, I'm gonna take some pictures of the poorest brains in Lawndale<br>
Daria: Where's the party? Kevin's?<br>
Jane: (laughs) Close...Fashion Club's party, can you believe it? it's gonna be so cool<br>
Daria: Yes, you're crazy Jane Lane, a party of the fashion club, I can't. I'm gonna get out with Tom<br>
<br>
(Phone beeps)<br>
<br>
Daria: Hang on, other call<br>
Jane: OK<br>
Daria: Hello?<br>
Tom: Hi Daria, how are you doing?<br>
Daria: Hey Tom<br>
Tom: Bad news darling, I can't go to the movies with you, my family was invited to a wedding<br>
Daria: Wedding???<br>
Tom: One of my cousins, my parents say I have to go, 'cause I missed the last fantastic Sloane's party, but I promise that we'll be together the next weekend<br>
Daria: Sure, I understand,... get fun<br>
Tom: I don't think I will,... Daria?<br>
Daria: Yeah Tom?<br>
Tom: I love you<br>
Daria: I love you too, see you the next weekend<br>
Tom: Bye, I'll miss you<br>
Daria: Jane?<br>
Jane: Who was it? You talked a lot<br>
Daria: It was Tom, he told me that we couldn't go to the movies<br>
Jane: So...do you wanna go to the brainless club's party?<br>
Daria: I don't know...<br>
Jane: You can bother Quinn<br>
Daria: Anything for my friend, I'll be there<br>
Jane: Alright, wait for me, I'll pick you up<br>
<br>
Scene 3: Lane's house<br>
Jane is painting when Trent comes in her bedroom<br>
<br>
Trent: Hey Janey<br>
Jane: Hey Trent, I was looking for you<br>
Trent: What is it?<br>
Jane: Could you take us to a party??? just in a few hours<br>
Trent: Us?<br>
Jane: Daria comes too...<br>
<br>
Trent blushed, he knew Daria was dating Tom Sloane, but he still like her, he didn't even know how or when happened but he liked Daria... a lot, since he drove them to Brittany's party,...Daria was different to the other girls, but he never had the courage to accept it<br>
<br>
Jane: Trent? TRENT?!<br>
Trent: Daria... I...<br>
Jane: Trent, what are you talking about? I'm not Daria, I'm your sister Jane... repeat: Jane Lane, my sister<br>
Trent: Stop that Janey...<br>
Jane: So, do you take us or what?<br>
Trent: Alright<br>
<br>
Scene 4: Trent's car<br>
<br>
Trent: Janey, could you sit back after we pick up Daria?<br>
Jane: Why? what did I do?<br>
Trent: Nothing, nothing, but...I...I...want Daria...next to me...<br>
Jane: Why is that? do you like Daria?<br>
Trent: Did I say that?<br>
Jane: Do you like her?<br>
<br>
Absolut silence, Trent couldn't say it although he felt it, but Jane's not a dumb, she knows what silence means<br>
<br>
Jane: So you like her...<br>
Trent: I didn't say that! why do you put words in my mouth??<br>
Jane: I asked you... if you wouldn't like her, you'd say something like "no, I don't like her, I just want her next to me because she never get lost..." I can't think in a better reason<br>
Trent: I like her<br>
Jane: Why didn't you tell her something?<br>
Trent: You know she's dating Tom Sloane<br>
Jane: I mean, before Tom Sloane, why didn't you say something? You two could...<br>
<br>
Jane's quiet, she couldn't tell Trent that Daria liked him a long time ago, and he missed that chance. But Trent was her brother, she had to tell him, she couldn't lie to him...<br>
<br>
Jane: (sighs) Trent, if I tell you something, do you promise not tell Daria I told you?<br>
Trent: I promise, what is it?<br>
Jane: Daria liked you before Tom Sloane, even when I was his girlfriend, I mean, she pierced her navel for you...<br>
Trent: For me???<br>
Jane: Of course, you told her that she should pierce her navel and she did, although she would never do something like that, since when do you like her???<br>
Trent: Since I drove you to that cheerleader's party<br>
Jane: Don't tell me more, why didn't you tell her something then?<br>
Trent: I was afraid, I could lost her even as a friend if I'd say something<br>
Jane: Well if you should try then you two could be the cutest couple in the world<br>
<br>
Trent smiled, Daria liked him! suddenly he remembered that the girl of his dreams had a boyfriend already, what he could do now?<br>
<br>
Scene 5: Morgendorffers' house<br>
(Bell rings)<br>
<br>
Quinn: That must be Justin, I'm coming!!!!<br>
Trent: Hi, is Daria here?<br>
Quinn: Tom? you shouldn't change your look, I mean, you looked better before, you look older<br>
Trent: Actually, I'm Trent, Jane's brother, Janey's in the car...I'm looking for Daria<br>
Quinn: Sure you are, Daria!!! it's Trent!!!<br>
Daria: (confused) Trent? for me?<br>
<br>
Daria went downstairs, Trent?, why should be Trent there?, she didn't know how to feel, she liked Tom, but Trent...still being someone special for her<br>
<br>
Daria: Hey Trent<br>
Trent: Hey Daria, Janey's in the car<br>
Daria: OK, let's go...are you coming with us?<br>
Trent: Sure...sure Daria<br>
<br>
Daria and Trent walked to the car, in there Jane was waiting fot them. For one secret reason Jane wanted to see Daria and Trent together, and it wasn't for Tom, 'cause Jane wasn't jealous anymore, but she thought that Daria and Trent looked good together<br>
<br>
Jane: Hey Daria<br>
Daria: Hey Jane, what are you doing in the backseat?<br>
Jane: (I'm here because Trent likes you) I don't know, I guess that I'm preparing in silence for the big party...Trent, take us to Cashman's<br>
Trent & Daria: Where???!!!<br>
Jane: To Cashman's, do you guys really think that we are gonna go to a fashion club's party with our regular outfits?<br>
Daria: That's it, you're out of your mind!<br>
Trent: I'm with Daria, we're not gonna change because you or a bunch of stupid girls say so<br>
Jane: We'll just change our outfit, nothing else, c'mon Daria, do you wanna bother Quinn or not? everything has its price, you know<br>
Trent: OK, but I don't wanna bother anybody, so I wait for you girls in the car<br>
Jane: You must be kidding mean Trent, we'll not gonna leave you in the car alone<br>
Daria: No Trent, I wait with you, I'm not gonna change anything, I can bother Quinn just in my own way, in the way I am<br>
Jane: It could be so cool, if Quinn sees you as a popular girl, you would look better than her, I swear<br>
Daria: You can't do that Jane, I'm not a model, I'm not as pretty as Quinn is, I'm not popular and I never will be, don't you see?, you can't change me Jane<br>
Jane: I'm not trying to change you Daria, it's just a weird experiment, nothing bad could happen...<br>
Daria: That's exactly what doctor Frankenstein said...OK try me, but I'm not gonna do anything but bother Quinn tonight<br>
<br>
Scene 6: Cashman's<br>
<br>
Daria couldn't believe what she was doing, when she looked herself in the mirror, she looked like a really popular and beautiful girl. Meanwhile Trent saw her in silence, he was convinced that Daria was pretty but he never knew that Daria could look so beautiful, and now he finally understood Daria's purpose, she wears her regular outfit to prove that she can find really good friends who like her because the way she thinks, not the way she looks. Daria wears black jeans, a black shirt and a long beige sweater, Jane's outifit is similiar that the outfitl she wears in "The F word"<br>
<br>
Daria: OK, could we go now?<br>
Jane: Yes, we can leave now to torture Quinn, by the way, who's dating Quinn now?<br>
Daria: I think a guy named Justin, you know he does have a good car, really important for Quinn, let's go<br>
Jane: Alright, Trent let's go... I want the backseat!<br>
Daria: Take it easy Jane, actually I don't understand, don't you prefer to be with your own brother? are you guys mad for something?<br>
Jane: We're not mad Daria, we're fine as always, and I'm always with my brother all the time when he's awake, well, almost all the time<br>
Daria: If you say so<br>
<br>
Scene 7: Sandi's house (Fashion Club's party)<br>
<br>
Sandi: Stacy, it's so good that Quinn is dating Justin 'cause I thought he was gonna suicide after I left him<br>
Tiffany: Sandi, I didn't know, but he told me that he left you, and not because Quinn of course<br>
Sandi: Tiffany, nobody left me but if he needs say so, I can prove that's he's lying, besides I'd never asked Quinn leave Justin, she can pick up the garbage I threw away if she wants<br>
<br>
(Outside Sandi's house)<br>
<br>
Jane: OK Trent, Daria, let's go<br>
Trent: I wait for you here girls, they won't let me in anyway<br>
Jane: C'mon Trent, if I gonna take pictures you can be with Daria, or will you leave her alone?<br>
<br>
(Trent blushes and so Daria)<br>
<br>
Trent: Alright Janey, I'll go, but just for a couple of hours if I can handle it<br>
<br>
(Sandi's house again)<br>
<br>
Sandi opened the door, actually, she can't recognize who is there, even they seem familiar for her<br>
<br>
Jane: Hi<br>
Sandi: Hi, haven't I seen you before?<br>
Daria: Maybe in a model contest, or in a bikini contest...<br>
Sandi: I've been in a model contest too, well I guess you can come in, you seem popular enough to me<br>
<br>
In the party Jane took off her camera and decided to left Daria and Trent alone, well, if they have been alone before and nothing happened, what could be different this time?<br>
<br>
Jane: OK perfect, we're in the party now, I'm gonna take some pictures, you guys stay together if you don't wanna be with all this model contest's winners (Jane leaves)<br>
Daria: What do you wanna do now Trent? ... great, Quinn isn't here anyway, that means that I'm suffering for nothing<br>
Trent: Quinn? your sister?<br>
Daria: Yeah, it's supposed that she should be here, and I came just to bother her, now I wanna get out of here, but I don't wanna leave Jane alone in this place<br>
Trent: If you want, we could wait Janey outside<br>
Daria: That's a good idea, let's go (they leave the party)<br>
Trent: And... how's your relationship with Tom Sloane?<br>
Daria: It's good...<br>
Trent: (a bit jealous) do you love him?<br>
Daria: Well, I don't know, actually I don't know<br>
Trent: 'cause I'm in love with someone<br>
Daria: Let me guess... Monique?<br>
Trent: No, I've forgotten Monique<br>
Daria: Do I know her?<br>
Trent: Better than you think...<br>
Daria: Quinn?<br>
<br>
Scene 8: Morgendorffers' house<br>
(Bell rings)<br>
<br>
Quinn: I'm coming!!! wait Justin, we'll go to Sandi's party in a minute<br>
Tom: Hi Quinn, is Daria here?<br>
Quinn: No, that friend of hers picked her up a couple of hours ago. Why are you here? I thought that you were out of the town<br>
Tom: I was, but the wedding was cancellated when my cousin discovered that his bride has moustache and a wife in Ohio<br>
Quinn: Aaauuuggghhh!!! well, I'm gonna go to a party, do you wanna come?<br>
Tom: Why not? it could be fun... I guess, after what I saw in my cousin's wedding I can handle everything<br>
Quinn: OK, Justin, let's go, Tom is coming with us<br>
<br>
Scene 9: Outside Sandi's party<br>
<br>
Daria: How is she?<br>
Trent: She's perfect, beautiful, talented, intelligent...<br>
Daria: Wow, she must be...special...for you<br>
Trent: She's like an angel, I mean, those beautiful eyes, I could lost in her eyes forever, even I've written songs for her<br>
Daria: Does she know how do you feel?<br>
Trent: Not yet, I'm afraid that she wouldn't talk to me anymore and I prefer still being her friend instead of lose her<br>
Daria: Well, you should tell her, if you don't do it you maybe will regret it in the future<br>
Trent: Do you think so?<br>
Daria: I'm sure, by the way, what's her name?<br>
<br>
Trent was nervous, and sad, and scared, he had to tell her, she deserved to know it although she was Tom's girlfriend<br>
<br>
Trent: Her name...is...Daria Morgendorffer<br>
<br>
Daria was shocked, what did Trent say? He just said that HE LOVED HER, Daria couldn't avoid it...she smiled<br>
<br>
Daria: What?!<br>
Trent: I love you Daria, I've always have, I'll understand if you don't wanna talk to me anymore, but I had to tell you the truth<br>
<br>
Daria was looking at him, he was so handsome, so romantic, she never knew that Trent could be such a romantic guy until then, he was so sweet, so...so... perfect, god, she still liked him.<br>
Trent looked at her, she was beautiful, he knew she could slap him if he would do what he was thinking to do, he had to kiss her, he didn't want to die without kissing Daria, even is she hated him more than anybody else.<br>
He did it, he kissed her, but he was wrong, Daria didn't slap him, she...she was kissing him too!<br>
<br>
Quinn, Tom and Justin arrived to Sandi's party, and when Tom got out of the car...saw them, saw Daria kissing Trent, god, what was going on? there she was, the girl who he loved most...kissing Jane's brother...kissing Trent. But he couldn't even talk, he just turned around and walked away<br>
When Daria and Trent finally let go, they were out of breath<br>
<br>
Trent: Wow, I don't know what to say<br>
Daria: Neither do I, Trent, I'm with Tom, and I'm sorry 'cause I kissed you too, and that shouldn't happen<br>
Trent: Daria, you know what I feel, but I need to know how do you feel...<br>
Daria: I'm confused Trent, I don't know how to feel right now, I like you, it's true, but I like Tom too<br>
Trent: I understand...I shouldn't kiss you, I shouldn't even tell you<br>
Daria: Trent, please, I thank you for telling me the truth...and well, about...the kiss...I liked it...a lot, that's why I kissed you too. But...<br>
<br>
Daria surprised them both, she kissed Trent again, Trent felt himself falling in love with Daria everyu second he was with her, and Daria felt herself melting in Trent's arms. Suddenly Daria let go and run away, Trent heard her crying after she left, although he tried to reach her, he couldn't do it<br>
<br>
Trent: Daria, wait... DARIA!!!! oh god, what did I do?<br>
<br>
Trent got in Sandi's house looking for Jane, he needed her advice, he needed to hear that Daria wouldn't hate him for that he'd done, but he loved her, she liked him, those were really different feelings... she maybe... loved Tom<br>
<br>
Trent: Janey<br>
Jane: Hey Trent,... where's Daria?<br>
Trent: She...she left<br>
Jane: What?! why? I just found Quinn... what happened Trent?<br>
Trent: I told her... the truth<br>
Jane: Did you tell her that you like her?<br>
Trent: No, I told her that I love her<br>
Jane: Wait! do you love her? what did she say?<br>
Trent: Nothing, I just... I kissed her<br>
Jane: Trent, she's my best friend and she's with Tom, didn't you think about it?<br>
Trent: I did, but she looked beautiful, I felt I had to kiss her or I was gonna do something crazy<br>
Jane: Trent, you kissed her! wasn't it crazy enough for you? what did she do? well, don't tell me, she just left, didn't she?<br>
Trent: Yeah, but she kissed me too, she told me that she still likes me, but she's confused<br>
Jane: Of course she's confused Trent, what did you expect?<br>
<br>
Scene 10: Sloane's house<br>
Tom was sad, he couldn't believe it, Daria was dating Trent too? did Daria love Trent? Tom was gonna cry, he could do anything for Daria, he loved her, he thought that Daria loved him too, maybe he was wrong, Daria was... everything<br>
<br>
Tom: I have to call her, but maybe she's not home yet, c'mon Tom, what are you saying? just say it: I'm afraid that she tells me that she doesn't love me...that... she loves... Trent<br>
<br>
Scene 11: Daria's bedroom<br>
Daria was confused, she was upset with herself, she thought she had forgotten Trent already, she thought she liked Tom, actually she liked him, Tom was sweet, handsome, intelligent, decent, so why didn't she forget Trent? Trent was intense, romantic, talented and gorgeous, she felt something for both, different feelings, or the same?<br>
Daria started to cry, how could she do that? she kissed Trent and she was Tom's girlfriend, she needed an advice, but she couldn't tell Jane, Jane could be upset 'cause she kissed her brother after she kissed Tom when he was Jane's boyfriend, she didn't know if she should tell her mom, or... Quinn, she was expert in boyfriends, she had been hanging around with many guys at the same time<br>
<br>
(Door opens)<br>
<br>
Quinn: Daria, if a guy left your best friend, should you get out with him? 'cause I mean, Justin left Sandi and now I'm with him, I ask you 'cause you're with Tom and he was with your friend before and...<br>
Daria: (sobbing) Quinn, please, leave me alone...<br>
Quinn: Daria... are... are you crying?<br>
Daria: Quinn, I don't wanna talk... I wanna be alone<br>
Quinn: C'mon Daria, you can tell me what's wrong, we're sisters, you helped me when I liked David<br>
Daria: If I tell you, do you promise not tell anybody what I'm going to tell you? and I mean ANYBODY<br>
Quinn: I promise Daria<br>
Daria: OK, you know I'm Tom's girlfriend and I like him a lot, but tonight in the party...<br>
Quinn: Did you go to the party?<br>
Daria: Are you gonna let me finish or not? Tonight in the party Trent, Jane's brother confessed me that he loves me and he kissed me too...<br>
Quinn: How dare he? you should slap him Daria<br>
Daria: I couldn't do that, 'cause I liked Trent before even met Tom, but he just saw me as a friend, well I thought that, but tonight he told me the truth, that he loves me, and I thought that I didn't like him anymore, until he said that, and then I knew that I still like him, I don't know what to do...<br>
<br>
Quinn couldn't believe it, her sister had been alone for a long time and suddenly she had two guys dying for her, finally Quinn saw that her sister Daria was pretty, of course not the kind of beuty that the fashion club had, but Daria, was... well, beautiful, and the proof was that she has a boyfriend and somebody else liked her<br>
<br>
Quinn: Daria, what do you feel for Tom?<br>
Daria: I like him... but I like Trent too<br>
Quinn: Who do you love? 'cause it's not the same thing<br>
Daria: Love??? well, I wouldn't know if I'm in love and Tom scared me somehow when he told me that he loved me<br>
Quinn: Didn't you see Tom in the party?<br>
Daria: No, he went to his cousin's wedding...<br>
Quinn: No, well, he told me that the wedding was cancellated, and he went with us to the party<br>
<br>
(Bell rings)<br>
<br>
Helen: I'm coming!<br>
Tom: Good evening mrs. Morgendorffer, is Daria here?<br>
Helen: Hi Tom, sure... Daria!!! It's Tom!!!<br>
Quinn: Oh god, Daria, what are you gonna do?<br>
Daria: I need an advice right now Quinn, anything that you say it'll be alright<br>
Quinn: A kiss doesn't mean anything if you don't feel something for that person Daria, if Tom kisses better than Trent doesn't matter, if Trent is older than Tom doesn't mather either, the only thing that really matter is how much do you love each other?<br>
<br>
Scene 12: Outside Daria's house<br>
<br>
Tom was nervous, he didn't know if he could see Daria... if he was ready for that... suddenly, an angel's voice interrupted his thoughts<br>
<br>
Daria: Hey Tom<br>
Tom: Hey Daria, we have to talk<br>
Daria: About?<br>
Tom: I saw you kissing Trent, Daria! how could you do this to me? I love you Daria, I still love you...<br>
Daria: I'm sorry Tom...<br>
Tom: I know,... you don't love me<br>
Daria: I like you Tom, you're great, handsome, intelligent, I care about you, I... I...<br>
Tom: Do you think the same about Trent?<br>
Daria: No...<br>
Tom: But you like him, don't you? you kissed him for something<br>
Daria: I like him too, but you two are so different...<br>
Tom: I think we have to talk later<br>
<br>
Tom gave Daria a quick kiss, he still loved her...<br>
<br>
Tom: (whispers) I love you Daria<br>
Daria: I know it Tom, you're the best... bye Tom<br>
Tom: See you later Daria<br>
<br>
Tom left Daria, and she was more confused than ever, he was in her heart, in her feelings, in her thoughts<br>
<br>
Scene 13: Lane's house<br>
<br>
Jane and Trent were in the kitchen, talking about what happened that night<br>
<br>
Trent: Now what Janey?<br>
Jane: You have to talk with her Trent<br>
Trent: There's nothing to say, I've said everything<br>
Jane: There's something to say Trent, she just left, sad and confused I think<br>
Trent: I gotta go to bed...<br>
Jane: Night Trent<br>
Trent: Night Janey<br>
<br>
Jane went to her room and dialed Daria, they have to talk, she needed to know if Daria loved her brother or her exboyfriend<br>
<br>
(Phone rings in Morgendorffer's house)<br>
<br>
Jake: Hello?<br>
Jane: Hi, can I talk with Daria?<br>
Jake: Of course, Daria sweetie, your friend calls you!<br>
<br>
Daria answered in her phone, Quinn is still there, trying to support her sister, Quinn and Daria imagined why Jane called for and Daria had to answer<br>
<br>
Daria: Jane?<br>
Jane: Hi Daria, Trent told me what happened... how do you feel?<br>
Daria: You can imagine,... confused,... Tom came here a moment ago, he saw us... me and Trent... kissing, he told me that he still loves me, you must be thinking that I'm cheating them, but I'm not, I wish I wouldn't be in this situation, I don't like the position I am...<br>
Jane: I know Daria, and I'm not thinking that you're a cheater, my brother, well, is kind of guilty, he should tell you this before you were Tom's girl<br>
Daria: I'm tired Jane, could we discuss this tomorrow?<br>
Jane: Alright Daria, I'll see you in Pizza King at 5:00<br>
Daria: OK, see ya<br>
Jane: Bye<br>
Quinn: Now, let's review your situation, and what a situation!<br>
Daria: Please Quinn, it's not funny<br>
Quinn: What did you feel when Trent kissed you? <br>
Daria: I felt like if a dream came true, before Tom, I dreamed that maybe someday Trent would kiss me, and love me, he's wonderful, talented, gorgeus...<br>
Quinn: And what did you feel when Tom kissed you?<br>
Daria: Guilty?<br>
Quinn: I mean before tonight, let's say yesterday<br>
Daria: Well, I felt like if all the world would be going round inside of my head you know, I don't care about anything when we're together...<br>
<br>
Scene 14: The next day, Lane's house<br>
<br>
Trent: Janey?<br>
Jane: Trent? why are you awake?<br>
Trent: I couldn't sleep,... I... I was thinking of Daria... all night, you're right, I have to talk to her<br>
Jane: What are you gonna tell her? "I'm sorry 'cause I kissed you"<br>
Trent: I'm not sorry Janey, I kissed her, I liked it, I'm not gonna apologize if I don't regret about it<br>
Jane: I understand... she saw Tom yesterday...<br>
Trent: (angry) Really? who said that?<br>
Jane: Daria,... I called her<br>
Trent: What else did she say? something about me?<br>
Jane: Well, she was confused... who wouldn't be? she told me... that Tom still loves her<br>
Trent: (more angry) what a guy, uh?<br>
