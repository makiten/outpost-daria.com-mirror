      <P>INT MORGENDORFFER DINING ROOM -- DAY
    </DIR>
  </UL>
  <P>QUINN: So then, he ordered the entr&eacute;e for both of us <I>in French!
  </I>Everyone in the <I>whole room </I>was staring at our table.</P>
  <P>HELEN: I'm glad you had a good time, dear.</P>
  <P>QUINN: That was the best date ever.</P>
  <P>DARIA: So, Quinn. What was your date's <I>name</I>?</P>
  <P>QUINN: Uagh! What <I>difference </I>does it make? I'll remember him
  when he asks me out again. He always wears this really cool silver thumb
  ring.</P>
  <P>HELEN: What about <I>you, </I>Daria, what did you do last night?</P>
  <P>DARIA: <I>I</I> went out on a date with a millionaire secret agent who
  flew me to his secluded headquarters in Honolulu. We dined on roast pig
  and swallows' tongues while his servants polished his silver sock suspenders.
  I didn't catch his name.</P>
  <P>JAKE: (looks up abruptly) You went out on a date?</P>
  <P>HELEN: There's no need for sarcasm, Daria</P>
  <P>DARIA: There's <I>always </I>need for sarcasm.</P>
  <P>HELEN: I realize you may feel jealous of Quinn's active social life,
  but that's no reason</P>
  <P>DARIA: Jealous? I can eat salad and not listen to boys every day in
  the school cafeteria. Quinn's made it her purpose in life.</P>
  <P>QUINN: At least I have one!</P>
  <P>HELEN: Girls! Daria, I want to talk to you alone.</P>
  <P>DARIA: (Looks at Jake, who's staring off into space, and Quinn, vacantly
  toying with her utensils.) Go ahead.</P>
  <P>HELEN: After supper.</P>
  <P>DARIA: Then may I be excused? I've lost my appetite.</P>

      <P>INT DARIA'S BEDROOM -- DAY
      <P>&nbsp;
      <P>DARIA is lying on her bed, on the phone with JANE.
    </DIR>
  </UL>
  <P>DARIA: I mean it, Jane. Five minutes and then call me back, or I'll
  be trapped for hours while my mom tries to make me feel better about myself.</P>
  <P>JANE: What's she doing home? I thought she usually works late on Friday.
  And every other day.</P>
  <P>DARIA: She took the day off to go with Dad to the stress counselor.
  Besides, every six months or so, she decides to recommit her energies to
  her family. We're about due for another spurt of reckless attention from
  Mom.</P>
  <P>JANE: Uh-oh. I suppose this attention usually focuses on</P>
  <P>DARIA: Fixing me.</P>
  <P>JANE: Need a wrench?</P>
  <P>DARIA: Need a life?</P>
  <P>JANE: Okay, okay. So what's broken?</P>
  <P>DARIA: According to my mom, everything that isn't Quinn. Her therapist
  tells her not to compare us to each other, but you can just see it gnawing
  at her sanity: Why can't I have two chirpy, popular, idiotic children?
  What went wrong the first time?</P>
  <P>JANE: Wow, you sound really upset about this. Well-- I mean, you don't
  actually <I>sound </I>upset. But since you haven't made a joke about it
  yet, I have to conclude that it really bothers you.</P>
  <P>DARIA: It takes up valuable time that I might otherwise use to organize
  my spoon collection. (As deadpan as ever:) So in the name of all that's
  holy, whatever that may be, please Jane, call me back five minutes after
  I hang up.</P>
  <P>JANE: Si, senorita.</P>
  <UL>

      <P>HELEN knocks on the door.

  </UL>
  <P>HELEN: Daria!</P>
  <P>DARIA: (to Jane) Gotta go.</P>
  <P>JANE: Good luck.</P>

  </UL>
  <P>DARIA: Come in.</P>
  <UL>
    <DIR>
      <P>HELEN enters DARIA's bedroom. She looks around for a place to sit, but
      we see that there's no place in the room to sit except the bed.
      <P>HELEN moves toward the bed. DARIA pulls herself upright into a sitting
      position at the head of the bed; HELEN perches at the foot, looking uneasy,
      but determined. She looks around and spots the poster of the half-buried
      skeleton on the wall.
      <P>&nbsp;
    </DIR>
  </UL>
  <P>HELEN: I hadn't noticed your poster, sweetie. What is that? An archeological
  dig?</P>
  <P>DARIA: It's the skeleton of Dante being disinterred when he was moved
  from his pauper's grave in France to an honored tomb in Italy.</P>
  <P>HELEN: I see.</P>
  <P>DARIA: It's amazing how, throughout history, many of the most prominent
  thinkers have been outcast and exiled from their homelands. I was thinking
  I might get a head start and defect.</P>
  <P>HELEN: (Obviously hasn't been listening.) Daria, there's no point in
  beating around the bush. I want you to see Dr. Walthrop.</P>
  <P>DARIA: You want me to visit your therapist? Why? Do you want me to give
  her a few pointers?</P>
  <P>HELEN: I'm serious, Daria. I'm worried about your negative attitude
  toward dating.</P>
  <P>DARIA: I don't have a negative attitude toward dating. It keeps Quinn
  out of the house. I'm all for that.</P>
  <P>HELEN: Yes, but why don't <I>you </I>ever go out on dates?</P>
  <P>DARIA: I guess I just haven't met a guy with a nice enough car yet,
  Mom.</P>
  <P>HELEN: Daria, you're such a smart, pretty girl. I'm sure there are plenty
  of boys who'd like to go out with you, if you had a more positive outlook.
  Why can't you give people a chance?</P>
  <UL>
    <DIR>
      <P>The phone rings. DARIA lunges for it.
    </DIR>
  </UL>
  <P>DARIA: Hello?</P>
  <P>JANE: Big news, Daria! My brother's sitting in for the Slushpuppies'
  guitarist for their gig tomorrow night!</P>
  <P>DARIA: Seriously?</P>
  <P>JANE: Yes! Trent's down in the basement totally freaking out. You've
  gotta come over here and watch.</P>
  <P>DARIA: I'm on my way.</P>
  <UL>
    <DIR>
      <P>DARIA hangs up the phone.
    </DIR>
  </UL>
  <P>DARIA: I gotta go, Mom. Jane's brother Trent has a big, uh, career opportunity,
  and he needs moral support.</P>
  <P>HELEN: I didn't know Jane had a brother. How old is he?</P>
  <P>DARIA: Nineteen or twenty, I think.</P>
  <P>HELEN: You think? You spend an awful lot of time over there, Daria.
  You don't know how old he is?</P>
  <P>DARIA: No. But I'm pretty sure his name is Trent, and he always wears
  this really cool silver thumb ring</P>
  <P>HELEN: All right, you can go for now, but we're both going to see Dr.
  Walthrop, Monday evening at five.</P>
  <P>DARIA: You know, I've been thinking of signing up to work on the school
  yearbook.</P>
  <P>HELEN: That's nice, but we're still going.</P>
  <P>DARIA: Gee, Mom, cheerleader tryouts are Monday evening. I'd sure hate
  to miss that shining opportunity.</P>
  <P>HELEN: No deals, Daria. We're going.</P>
  <P>DARIA: (After a pause) The law firm definitely doesn't pay you enough,
  Mom.</P>
  <P>HELEN: No one could, sweetie. Have fun at Jane's.</P>

  <P>JANE: Great! You're here! This is a historic occasion.</P>
  <P>DARIA: What, that Trent got a gig?</P>

      <P>There's a ruptured electric guitar sound in the background.
      <P>&nbsp;
    </DIR>
  </UL>
  <P>DARIA: I take it that soothing melody is the superstar himself?</P>
  <P>JANE: The one, the only. He's been memorizing the Slushpuppies' songs
  all day. So far, they all sound like &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; on
  acid.</P>

  <P>JANE: Food poisoning. His girlfriend tried to cook for him. She didn't
  realize you're supposed to refrigerate eggs.</P>
  <P>DARIA: Where are they playing?</P>
  <P>JANE: Oscar's, in Garverton. It's kind of like a coffeehouse. You're
  going to come, right?</P>
  <P>DARIA: Uh okay. How're we going to get to Garverton?</P>
  <P>JANE: Hel<I>lo</I>! With Trent! Not that I trust him to drive to this
  thing. He'll probably panic and plow his car into a tree.</P>
  <P>DARIA: Well, I'd hate to miss <I>that. </I>Why's he so nervous? Trent
  has his own band.</P>
  <P>JANE: The Slushpuppies are pretty popular in Garverton. He's actually
  going to have to play for an audience that's not too busy hitting each
  other in the mosh pit to listen to the music. Hell, it's novel enough that
  he's going to be playing for an audience.</P>

      <P>TRENT is taking off an electric guitar which has a broken string. He's
      scowling, and sits heavily beside the guitar.
      <P>&nbsp;
      <P>WE SEE JANE and DARIA coming down the basement stairs.

  <P>JANE: Hey, Trent! That was your best riff yet! You should break strings
  more often.</P>

    </DIR>
  </UL>
  <P>TRENT: Thanks a lot, Janey. (He looks up.) Oh. Hey, Daria.</P>
  <P>DARIA: It sounded good. You must've been playing pretty hard to lose
  a string.</P>
  <P>TRENT: (Depressed.) I guess.</P>
  <P>DARIA: Jane told me you've been asked to sit in with another band. Congratulations.</P>
  <P>TRENT: (He looks at them both narrow-eyed for a moment, then shrugs.)
  I'm not so sure about this. I've been learning the Slushpuppies' songs
  all day, and I don't think I'm into it.</P>
  <P>JANE: Yeahanything beyond three chords is just too limiting, right,
  Trent?</P>
  <P>TRENT: I mean, I've heard them play and they're okay, but they have
  a million songs and they all sound pretty much the same. I don't think
  I can keep all this stuff straight in time for the gig tomorrow night.</P>
  <P>DARIA: Even if you can't memorize all their stuff, you can probably
  fake it. Jane says all their songs sound like &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;
  anyway.</P>
  <P>TRENT: (Perks up a bit.) Heyyeah, they do. Janey, do you remember where
  Dad keep his old Led Zeppelin albums?</P>

    </DIR>
  </UL>
  <P>TRENT: Were you and Janey planning on doing something tomorrow night?</P>
  <P>DARIA: No. Why?</P>
  <P>TRENT: Well, when I told her about the gig, she raced off to call you.
  I thought she might be cancelling something. It's okay if you two don't
  want to come. I mean, it's an hour's drive to Garverton, and Jesse's going
  along, so the car might be kind of crowded with four people and the equipment.
  It's no big deal.</P>
  <P>DARIA: That's too bad. We were hoping you'd let us tag along. Personally,
  I can't get enough of &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;.</P>
  <UL>
    <DIR>
      <P>JANE descends the stairs with the Led Zeppelin album.
    </DIR>
  </UL>
  <P>TRENT: I guess we'll make sure there's room for you two in the car,
  then.</P>
  <P>JANE: If you run out of space, we can always strap Daria to the luggage
  rack.</P>

  I've worn my black one on a date.</P>
  <P>JAKE: A new dress? I thought you just went shopping last week!</P>
  <P>QUINN: I've already <I>worn</I> that outfit, Daddy! It's practically
  useless now!</P>
  <P>JAKE: One time and it's useless? Isn't there someplace you could <I>rent
  </I>all these clothes that you only use once?</P>
  <P>DARIA: She can't do that, Dad. It would make too much sense.</P>
  <P>HELEN: What about <I>you, </I>Daria, what do you have planned for tonight?</P>
  <P>DARIA: Jane and I are going out to see a band. We'll be back by eleven.</P>
  <P>JAKE: Quinn, you should be home by eleven too.</P>
  <P>QUINN: But <I>Daddy, </I>we're going to the <I>ballet!</I></P>
  <P>DARIA: And she'll want to stick around afterwards and get a T-shirt.</P>
  <P>HELEN: Well, any boy who's gentlemen enough to take you to the ballet
  is surely gentlemen enough to get you home on time.</P>
  <P>QUINN: But what if he wants to take me someplace afterwards?</P>
  <P>DARIA: Like a four-star hotel.</P>
  <P>QUINN: Yeah!</P>

  <P>HELEN: So <I>that's </I>what's been going on.</P>
  <P>JAKE: What's that, honey?</P>
  <P>HELEN: Isn't it obvious? Daria must be dating that Trent boy. She's
  been trying to hide it from us because he's older than she is, and she
  didn't think we'd approve. He's probably in this band they're going to
  see.</P>
  <P>QUINN: In a <I>band?!</I></P>
  <P>JAKE: I thought he said</P>
  <P>HELEN: <I>Really, </I>Jake. The entertainment industry? Don't you remember
  telling <I>my</I> father something like that, back when you were trying
  to write music and start folk-singing?</P>
  <P>JAKE: Yeah, I guess I did. (He smirks devilishly.) I sure pulled one
  over on the old easy chair that time Wait a minute! (Protective Dad emerges.)

  can take care of herself.</P>

  out until midnight, and I can only date high-schoolers and I have to be
  home by ten?!?</P>
  <P>HELEN: Quinn, there have been plenty of times when we've let you go
  out and Daria's stayed home. Don't begrudge your sister a chance to have
  a little fun.</P>
  <P>QUINN: This is so unfair!</P>
  <P>HELEN: Daria's proven she's responsible enough to handle a little additional
  freedom. Quinn, when you bring your grades up, we'll consider--</P>
  <P>QUINN: You don't understand! If Daria's actually going out with an older
  guy who's a musician, she's dating someone cooler any of the guys who ask

  put together.</P>

  <P>JANE: Dress for success, that's what I always say. Seems like Trent's
  taken my advice to heart, too. What's this, big brother, not a hole or
  a tear to be seen?</P>
  <P>TRENT: It's from the bottom of my closet. It's the only thing that was
  clean.</P>

  <P>JESSE: Are you psyched about tonight, man?</P>
  <P>TRENT: I've made my peace with the gods of music. I'm ready.</P>
  <P>JESSE: So does that mean you've finally learned the open D tuning?</P>
  <P>TRENT: You're disturbing my peace, man.</P>
  <P>JANE: That's an arrestable offense. Daria! Get the cuffs.</P>
  <P>TRENT: I gotta admit, I'm kind of weirded out.</P>
  <P>JESSE: Yeah, it's gonna be strange to watch you up there playing with
  some other band.</P>
  <P>JANE: It's gonna be strange to watch him <I>playing.</I></P>
  <P>DARIA: (Quietly, but dangerously) Don't worry, Jane, I'm sure you'll
  be too busy watching Jesse to notice anything amiss.</P>
  <P>JANE: Defensive! Always a good sign.</P>
  <P>TRENT: It's not just the gig. It's the whole day. Like, I actually woke
  up before noon.</P>
  <P>JESSE: Whoa.</P>
  <P>TRENT: Yeah. And like Daria's family.</P>
  <P>DARIA: What about them?</P>
  <P>TRENT: It's just freaky that you even have a family, Daria. <BR>

  JANE: Daria sprang fully formed from the froth of the ocean. She's just
  living with the Morgendorffers until her godhood kicks in. <BR>

  TRENT: I thought the goddess of wisdom came out of someone's head. <BR>
  <BR>
  <BR>
  <BR>
  DARIA: Right. Athena emerged from the skull of Zeus. <BR>
  <BR>
  <BR>

  JANE: Sure. But Aphrodite came out of the sea. <BR>

      <P>&nbsp;
      <P>Artsy, crunchy coffee house with weird art everywhere and a slightly
      raised platform for a stage. The customers look basically like the college
      students from &quot;College Bored&quot;, with a few more piercings &amp;
      the like visible. Trails of smoke thread the atmosphere.
      <P>&nbsp;
      <P>TRENT and JESSE carry equipment to the stage. JANE and DARIA secure
      a table and sit down. DARIA picks up a menu and looks inside.
      <P>JANE glances around the place.
    </DIR>
  </UL>
  <P>JANE: Great decorating. Early Bohemian Poverty.</P>
  <P>DARIA: (Reacting to the menu) Three dollars for a cup of coffee? Bohemian
  poverty's too rich for me.</P>
  <P>JANE: You can't be Bohemian. You're not wearing Birkenstocks. Anyway,
  you said you'd tell me what you meant about matchmaking later. It's later.</P>
  <P>DARIA: My mom wanted me to see her therapist to find out why I'm not
  dating anyone.</P>
  <P>JANE: Blame it on your toilet training. Shrinks eat that stuff up. Uh...
  so to speak.</P>
  <P>DARIA: It gets worse. My curfew's supposed to be eleven. But Mom told
  Trent I can stay out til midnight.</P>
  <P>JANE: How could she!</P>
  <P>DARIA: Jane, she probably thinks I'm dating Trent.</P>
  <P>JANE: You kind of <I>are</I> on a date with Trent.</P>
  <P>DARIA: This isn't a date!</P>
  <P>JANE: Daria, it's so close to being a date that you might as well just
  go ahead and call it a date. I consider it a date.</P>
  <P>DARIA: Yeah, but Jesse actually knows you exist. And your mother isn't
  going to interrogate you about the situation with a truncheon and a rubber
  hose.</P>
  <P>JANE: No, but with any luck maybe Jesse will</P>
  <P>DARIA: What am I going to do? If I tell her I'm not dating Trent, I'll
  have to see her therapist, and they'll probably dissect my head to figure
  out why I'm not going out with him.</P>
  <P>JANE: Option one sounds grim.</P>
  <P>DARIA: If I lie to her and tell her I went out with Trent, I won't have
  to see her therapist. But I would have to make up a fictional history of
  dating Trent to satisfy Mom's curiosity. I'm not sure I could stand that,
  either.</P>
  <P>JANE: It's like making a wish when you blow out the candles, right?
  If you tell someone what you wished for, it won't happen.</P>
  <P>DARIA: Jane. Shut up or I'll kill you.</P>
  <P>JANE: Touchy <I>and </I>defensive! Two whole emotions in one night.

      <P>The band starts to play... very guitar-heavy, Led Zeppelin sound.
      <P><BR>
      We CLOSE UP on TRENT, who's playing basic chords and starting to look panicky.
      FARLEY looks back at him questioningly; it seems like there's supposed
      to be a guitar solo opening this song.

      <P>CUT TO DARIA, biting her lip, chin resting on clasped hands, leaning
      forward anxiously.
      <P>&nbsp;
      <P>BACK TO TRENT, who's seriously starting to sweat. He looks out as he
      repeats the chords.
      <P>&nbsp;
      <P>CUT TO TRENT'S POV: Scan of the crowd, focussing in on DARIA. She's
      making a gesture with one hand.
      <P>&nbsp;
      <P>CUT TO CLOSE UP of DARIA: she's letting her fingers do the walking up
      an imaginary staircase.
      <P>&nbsp;
      <P>CUT TO a shot of TRENT starting to grin; he bends his head over the
      guitar and starts blending &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; into the music.
      <P>&nbsp;
      <P>WE SEE the crowd reacting with delight at the familiar tune. Applause
      and wolf whistles nearly drown out the music.

  <P>JESSE: Yeah, but she thought I was with the band.</P>
  <P>JANE: What are you two talking about?</P>
  <P>JESSE: We don't keep numbers from girls who just give them to us because
  we're in a band. It's Trent's idea.</P>
  <P>TRENT: We're not just going to be another garage band that plays bars
  to get girls. Besides, if they're willing to give out their phone numbers

  brightest bulbs on the Christmas tree.</P>
