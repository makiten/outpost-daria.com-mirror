Day at the Water Park


by Jane (hello_kitty_28@yahoo.com)

(Cut to see Jane drawing in class. Suddenly, Miss Li
enters the room. She looks at the teacher quickly and
turns around to face the
students.) 

LI: Okay. We'll have a trip to a water park next week.
Find you a bathing suit and someone who can drive you
there. 

(Then, she gives everyone a piece of paper and walks
to the door.)

(Cut to see Jane reading the paper: 

Dear student(s) of Lawndale high,
This is a "letter" to tell you where to go and when to
be there next week, for our trip to the Water Park.
First... you HAVE to be
there. If you don't, you'll get in very deep trouble...
It will be Monday at 8:00. You HAVE to be there at
8:00AM. And it is at...)

(Cut to see Daria deadpan looking at the paper.)

DARIA: (thought: Don't tell me I'll have to show up in
bathing suit in front of all my class and like I know
Jane... in front of
Trent!)

(Cut to see Jane smiling.)

JANE: (thought: Ah! A new way to... try to start a
relationship... between those two... eh... humans!)

DARIA: (thought: Ah damn... I do not have a bathing
suit... and I cannot count on my mom to buy one, so I
think I'll have to go
with Ja... No... Jane will try to make me buy a bikini
because Trent will be there... I'll have to go by myself
then...)

JANE: (turning to Daria) Hey, Daria... do you have a
bathing suit? I don't... if you want... we can go to the
mall together...

DARIA: (thought: Damn!) hmmm... yeah... sure...

(Cut to see Daria and Jane in a store. They both look
at bathing suits.)

JANE: Remember Daria... Trent will be there... you have to
look pretty... (laughs, then spots a black bathing suit,
takes it and
show it to Daria) You think Jesse would like this on
me?

DARIA: (glances) yeah... sure...

JANE: Ok... I have mine now... Now... we have to find yours!

DARIA: (thought: NO!) hmmm... I know!

JANE: (spots a little white bikini and hands it to
Daria) Try this one... you'll be pretty... (smiles)

DARIA: (glares) No way... there's no way that I'm going
to wear that... eh... tiny thing in front of... ah...
nevermind...

(Cut to see Jane waiting in front a door. Daria opens
the door... she wears a red bathing suit that doesn't
fit on her. Jane looks at
Daria with a look of disgust.)

(Cut to see the door opening on a Daria wearing a
black bathing suit with white lines that make her look
good... but feel so
uncomfortable...)

(Cut to see Daria opening the door. She is wearing a
yellow bathing suit that makes her look sick.)

(Cut to see the door opening on Daria, looking
beautiful in a white bikini with some weird black and
dark green shapes. Jane
glances at Daria.)

JANE: You finally found something...

DARIA: (deadpan, looking at herself in the mirror)
Yeah... I guess I should believe you next time! But that
doesn't mean I like to
wear this...

JANE: Ah come on Daria... that cannot be that bad!!!

(Cut to see Daria sleeping that night. She dreams:

DREAM: Daria is walking on a beach wearing her new
bikini. She sits down on a towel. Trent arrives and
sits beside her. Then,
he takes sunscreen and puts it on Daria's back.)

(Cut to see Daria awake, sitting on her bed)

DARIA: What a strange dream!

(Daria walks downstairs and goes to the kitchen. She
finds some "cold" toasts on the table. She throws them
in the garbage. She
walks to the fridge to find there is absolutely
nothing to eat except some lasagna her dad made a week
before. She closes the door
and walks to the phone. She dials Jane's number.)

JANE: Yo?

DARIA: Hey Jane... what's new?

JANE: Nothing... you?

DARIA: I made a strange dream and there is nothing to
eat here...

JANE: Oh... I'm making pancakes for Trent and I... you can
come eat breakfast with us if you want... I'm sure Trent
will be
able to give you some of his many pancakes to you...

DARIA: yeah... sure...

JANE: ok... bye... I'm waiting for you...

DARIA: ok... bye...

(They hang up.)

(Cut to see Daria walking to Jane... When she arrives,
she knocks on the door and Trent opens it.)

TRENT: Oh... Hey Daria! Jane told me you'd come eat with
us... 

DARIA: hmmm... hey Trent...

TRENT: Oh... come inside! Don't stay outside... the
breakfast is ready...

(They enter the house. Daria follows Trent in the
kitchen.)

JANE: Hey Daria... have a seat...

(Daria sits down at the table. Trent sits down beside
her. Jane gives the pancakes and they start eating in
silence. No one talks
until Jane and Daria finish to eat.)

JANE: Oh... tell me Daria... I'm sure you're excited about
that day to the Water Park... come on... tell me the
truth!

DARIA: Ah... shut...

TRENT: Shut up Janey... You know Daria hates school
trips!

(Jane smiles. Daria blushes.)

(Cut to see Daria Monday morning. She comes out of her
bedroom wearing her black skirt with her green shirt
on her bikini, which
we can't see. Daria made sure we couldn't see it. She
walks in the kitchen and eats a light breakfast. Then,
she hears a car
stopping by the house. She takes her bag and walks to
the door. She finds Jane standing on the front of the
house wearing black
shorts and a red T-shirt. They walk to the car and
find Trent already asleep. Jesse is almost asleep in
the back of the car. Jane
pushes Daria for her to sit in the front, then she
sits beside Jesse. Daria shakes Trent awake.)

TRENT: HUH? I'm sorry mo... Oh... sorry Daria... I was
dreaming my mom wanted to kill me because I fell
asleep while I was
working... You're ready to go?

DARIA: hmmm... I'm not sure... I hate water parks...

TRENT: Ah come Daria... try to have some fun with us
today!!!

DARIA: I'll try!

TRENT: (smiles) you will... don't worry!

(Cut to see the car stop in the parking of the Water
Park. They get out of the car and walk to the place
they had to meet the rest
of the school.)

BRITTANY: Oh Keviiiiiiii... that's sooo great that we
could come here together...

KEVIN: Oh yeah baby...

(Cut to see Jane and Daria)

DARIA: (imitating Brittany, but totally deadpan) Oh
Janeyyyyyy... that is just sooooo great we could come
here today!!! I can't
keep my joy inside me! 

(Trent laughs at this, Daria blushes)

JANE: (imitating Kevin making a dump face) Ohhhhhhh
Daria... come in the toilet with me baby...

(Jane, Daria, Trent and Jesse laugh at the joke.
Suddenly, Upchuck arrives from behind Jane)

UPCHUCK: Hello ladies!!! I just can't wait to see both
of you in your... bathing suit! Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrow!!!!

JANE: In your dreams UpChuck!

(Upchuck walks away. Miss Li arrives and search who's
missing... Actually... no one...)

MISS LI: Okay... now that I know that everyone is here...
you can go have fun... but be here for 6:00 PM!

(At this... all the students except Jane, Daria and the
boys, starts to run. Daria, Jane, Trent and Jesse walk
to the bathroom and
change themselves. After ten minutes, Daria didn't
come out. Jane walks in the bathroom)

JANE: Daria?

DARIA: What?

JANE: You spent ten minutes in the bathroom... are you
ok?

DARIA: ah... yeah...

JANE: Are you ready?

DARIA: euh... no...

JANE: Ah come on Daria... that bathing suit is looking
really good on you...

DARIA: Yeah right...

JANE: Ah come on!!!

(Daria gets out of the bathroom. She's wearing her
bathing suit. Her hair is tied with a little bow and
falls on her shoulders. Jane
pushes her out of the bathroom. When the come outside,
Trent's eyes widen, but he quickly hides his reaction.
They walk to the
pool. Once they are there, Jesse and Jane run and swim
a lot farther. Trent looks at Daria.)

TRENT: Daria?

DARIA: huh?

TRENT: What do you want to do now that Jane and Jesse
are going to be running away from us all day long?

DARIA: I don't know... you?

TRENT: I don't know... Wanna take a walk on the beach?

DARIA: Yeah... sure...

(Cut to see Trent and Daria walking on the beach. They
are alone.)

DARIA: Seems like no one appreciates the nature around
here...

TRENT: But there are you... and me!

DARIA: (smiles) yeah... I know!

(Trent smiles and walks a bit slower, so Daria can not
see what he's doing. He takes some sand in his hand)

TRENT: Daria?

DARIA: What? (She turns around. Trent throws her the
sand.) AHHH! TRENT!!! (she looks at him... he has a huge
smile...
then, she starts running after him and throws sand at
him. Then, he starts to throw sand at her again. A bit
later, they sit down on
the beach near of the water.)

TRENT: Daria? Can I ask you personal questions?

DARIA: It depends what!

TRENT: Did you already have a boyfriend?

DARIA: no...

TRENT: Have you ever think of having one?

DARIA: not really...

TRENT: Why?

DARIA: 'Cause guys think I'm too cynical. Look... I'm
not what a guy would want as a girlfriend you know!
I'm...

TRENT: But you're the kind of girl... no... you are the
girl I want as a girlfriend... you're pretty, smart,
nice... you have
everything... (Daria looks at him with a very surprised
look. She is almost ready to cry. He takes her face in
his hands and
continues his questions...) And who would you want as
your boyfriend?

DARIA: you... (Trent looks at her and pulls her face and
kisses her. She kisses him back.)

TRENT: (whisper) I loved you for so long... but I was
scared to tell you! I was scared that you'd repulse
me. I knew you were
Janey's best friend and I was scared that you were
nice with me just cause I was Janey's brother! I...

DARIA: Trent... I also loved you for sooo long... but I
was afraid to tell you too cause I was scared to lose
your friendship and I
was scared that you would have think that I'm stupid...

TRENT: You're not stupid... and I never thought that you
were stupid and I'll never think that you are stupid... 

DARIA: Maybe... but I was scared...

TRENT: I know... But I was stupid to hide my feelings
for you... Look how much time it took us to be together...
I missed your
voice every time you weren't over my house... I missed
your face almost all the time... I missed talking to you
when you were not
with me or when you were with Janey...

DARIA: Oh Trent... stop this... you'll make me cry...

TRENT: cry?

DARIA: of joy Trent... of joy...

(Trent answers by a smile, Daria smiles back.)

(Cut to see Jane and Jesse sitting in front of the
car. Trent and Daria are sitting in the back, close
together. The car stops in front
of Daria's house)

TRENT: Bye sweet... see you tomorrow! (kisses her)

DARIA: Yeah... (kisses him back) Bye!

(she gets out of the car. Jane looks at Trent)

JANE: Awww... that's so cute...

The end...
