<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Claire Defoe ambled down the
hall to the bedroom she and her soon-to-be husband, Anthony Demartino, had only
begun to share six months ago. <i>Talk about timing. The first night we spent
together in his &ndash; our &ndash; house, I catch the silver bullet. Maybe I shouldn't
talk about bullets...</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The gently beautiful woman's
thoughts drifted to Anthony's basement &ndash; far, far larger than anyone would have
imagined, and set up to act as a long-duration bomb shelter &ndash; and the cache of
weapons he had down there, along with ammunition and the means to handload his
own ammo. <i>The war made him more fearful than people realize, not crazy; no
wonder he never seemed to have money &ndash; he put in all in the house, pun
certainly intended &ndash; and after his book sold last year, he added more. If
people actually knew what he has twenty feet below the surface &ndash; or how we
could probably live for years down there...</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Blushing as she thought about
the actor Brendan Frazer (who she'd always been attracted to and had all of his
films on DVD, even bootlegs), Claire thought about the comedy where his family
lived underground in a bomb shelter. <i>Thank God my baby won't ever have to
live like that,</i> she said, breathing a sigh of relief. <i>I'll be able to
talk some sense into Tony, after the baby's here. He'll see that there's protective,
and overprotective-</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Claire."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>A look of surprise crossed the
former teacher's face as she looked to the other end of the hall, where a
morbidly obese woman stood. "Claire, there's isn't much time. I &ndash; you're the
only person I felt I should warn."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Hilda? Hilda, what are you
doing here?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The look on Hilda Johanssen's
face was confused for a moment. "Oh! That's right &ndash; the <i>Glamour</i>! Sorry-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Claire almost fell over as the
appearance of Mrs. Johanssen changed dramatically; the obese woman suddenly became
a tiny, classically beautiful brunette with crystal-blue eyes (that reminded
her of Jane Lane, she thought) and a figure the frumpy jumpsuit she wore
couldn't hide. "I'm sorry, Claire," the young woman said, her accent that of a
young woman raised in Southern 'high society' as a 'young woman of means and
distinction'. "South Carolina."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The young woman's eyes
widened. "Yes &ndash; until I turned fourteen and I was sent to Grove Hills. It's the
curse of being beautiful and intelligent in equally, and astoundingly, large
measure. I came to help you &ndash; and we only have a couple of minutes. Listen
closely."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The young woman held out her
right hand<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>- on which she wore a plain
silver ring &ndash; and the entire area was suddenly engulfed in a purplish-white
light! "What's happening?" Claire said, stumbling and almost falling when she
felt something holding her up. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"I'm sorry I've scared you,"
the young woman said, and Claire's fear immediately dissipated as a blue flash
came from her ring. "Look, this won't last long and you've got an open mind.
Please listen and don't talk much. Your life and the lives of Anthony and your
baby are on the line."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Who are you?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"My name's Vidalia Johannsen &ndash;
like the onion. Just call me 'Vi'. In another universe, I'm one of the nieces
of the woman you know. I took her place almost two years ago to watch over
things here in Lawndale."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The dinner that she recently
had with Jane Lane immediately came to Claire's mind. "You're here to watch <i>the
Legion</i>. They all have powers like Jane?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"You always were quicker than
people believed," Vi observed.. "The world as you know it is about to end,
Claire. The people I work for &ndash; the ones that sent me here to watch the
Legionnaires &ndash; have said that we can't stop it from happening, but we can help
to save as many people as we can, and that 'we can act to save the species'. As
far as I'm concerned, the best way for me to do that is to do <i><u>this</u></i>."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Vi held out her clenched fist,
and when she opened it, a ring identical to the one she wore rested on her
palm. "You were always kind to me, Claire," she said. "In the time I was here &ndash;
I took my aunt's counterpart's place here; I used my Ring to give her a new
life on another world, you'd be surprised what the <i>Elixor of Life</i> can do
&ndash; you were the only person who made an effort to see beyond the weight and to
who I was as a person. Not that being overweight is okay, but you know what I
mean. You were the only person who tried to be friendly to me."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"You were &ndash; are &ndash; a nice
person."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Vi smiled as she held up the
Ring. "Thank you. This... is a <i>Defender Ring</i>. It's going to allow you to
do a world of incredible things. You'll be able to protect Anthony and the baby
and many other people; you'll be able to heal them, feed them, provide them
with shelter and help them in so many ways &ndash; if you have to, you'll even be
able to take them to a safe place on other worlds. If you take it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"What's the downside, Hilda &ndash;
Vi?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"For you, I don't think there
will be," she told the pregnant woman. "You're going to be busy helping people
survive and rebuild on this Earth, so you won't be called to go anywhere else.
You'll find out that there are things that you can't do, even with the Ring,
and that sometimes, <i>Hobson's Choice</i> tars and feathers <i>Murphy's Law</i>
before running it out of town. If you take the Ring."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Claire looked around the
hallway. "What's happening right now?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"A trick I learned &ndash; right
now, we're just outside space and time, riding the edge between seconds," Vi
said. "I can do this for about three hours, if my Ring's on a full charge<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&ndash; it uses up energy like crazy &ndash; but right
now, the entire planet, except for other Ringbearers &ndash; is in a state of
temporal stasis. Whether you take the Ring or not, I figure I have more than
enough time to make sure that you and your new family will always be safe."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The Ring sat in Vi's
outstretched hand; Claire reached out and took it. "I won't let anything hurt
my family."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The underground chamber Vi had
created was the size of two football fields set side-by-side; the DeMartino
house was seated near the middle, surrounded by trees and other vegetation,
with a large pond at the north end of the chamber, one easily big enough to
swim in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Claire saw a fish flick its
tail as it dove under the waters; she turned and looked upwards to see the
glowing orbs that lit the entire chamber. "You'll learn how to make the orbs,"
Vi said, running her left hand through the cool waters of the pond. "They're
perfect for the plants, and they'll brighten and dim automatically to duplicate
the Sun moving through the sky. You'll be safe down here &ndash; no one can get in
unless you let them in, and with your Ring, you can always maintain the entire
area &ndash; more water, keeping things healthy... you know, if there's anyone else
that you trust, you can let them live down here, too. You can maintain a number
of people here, and with the Ring, you can maintain the peace."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The two women looked back at
the house, where Anthony DeMartino still lay asleep. "I've got about five
minutes more before I have to drop the stasis field, Claire," Vi said, looking
around. "The Ring will teach you all you need to know about what it can do."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"It's alive?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"No; it gives your
subconscious a voice and access to what it can do, so you're really teaching
yourself," Vi said. "It's kind of funny that way; different Ringbearers can use
their powers in different ways, because they put their own little spin on
things. I mean, it's variations on a theme..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Could you show me again how
you made me calm earlier?" A smile went across Claire's face, a smile she
allowed, knowing that there wouldn't be much to smile about soon enough.
"That's going to be important, with Anthony the way he is... I actually can't
wait to see how he reacts when he sees how you brought the house down here &ndash;
and everything still works?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"There's a young woman in
almost every universe &ndash; Sherrie Klein &ndash; who works with technology, well, with
anything she touches. I made a deal with her for a device I put under the
field. It'll provide water and control the environment, act to regulate waste &ndash;
I fixed the waste disposal and the trash compacters, by the way... there's also a
fusion generator. You'll be able to get rid of any waste you have and get
additional power."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>She took a dark-red apple from
a low-hanging tree branch, and smiled as she saw Buster &ndash; Anthony's beagle &ndash;
drinking from the pond. "Now, don't start brewing a lot of hard cider, okay?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"I promise."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Vi looked at the house.
"Everything in the house works just as it did before. There's a device she gave
me that I placed beneath the house that will act as a generator, and as a
conduit for water and waste &ndash; of course, you'll need to go shopping for things
on other Earths...I've already, ah, <i>borrowed</i> a lot of baby supplies from
the Lawndale Smarty-Mart &ndash; diapers, bottles, clothes, cribs &ndash; lots of baby
stuff, and other supplies you'll need, are in those storage sheds and your
barn." She pointed to the west wall of the cavern, where a line of garage-size
medal sheds sat next to several large mobile homes, and shrugged at the look on
Claire's face. "You might need to have a place for somebody else to live down
here &ndash; they're already hooked up and ready to live in, each one has a device
hooked in &ndash; and besides, all of that would have just gone up in the fire,
anyway. It's not exactly stealing."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Claire looked over at Vi. "Why
are you doing all of this, Vi?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Well, I figure that you'll
eventually run into something that needs a barn &ndash; you should get a couple of
cats."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Why, Vidalia? Not that I'm
not grateful-" She looked at the Ring she now wore. "Why?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Vi grasped Claire's hand.
"Because you're my friend. Because I can."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The purplish-white light faded
away, and Vi hugged Claire. "I have to go," she said, opening up a
purplish-white ring of energy in the air next to her. "Need to go recharge this
thing &ndash; don't forget that, either. You have to recharge the Ring by exposing it
to natural sunlight every twenty-four hours. If you don't you can still use it,
but it'll run off your body's energy &ndash; that's why you'll need these."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>She handed Claire a small
pouch; the older woman opened it to see eleven small stones inside. "Hold your
Ring to one of the stones, and it'll release the energy to recharge it. Each
stone will give your ring a full twenty-four hour charge, and you can recharge
the stones by letting them sit in the sun for a full hour. I'd stay down here
at least six of seven months after you have the baby before you try to go to
any inhabited areas on the surface &ndash; you might want to wait a year or so. It'll
still be very rough out there &ndash; of course, you'll be able to travel to other
Earths and other worlds now, so it's not as if you guys are trapped down here."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"If I need to do a recharge, I
can always go to a mountaintop," Claire said. "I doubt anyone's trying to live
on top of the Devil's Tower in Montana, or any of the mountains on the East
Coast to ski."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Vi smiled as Claire pulled her
into a hug. "See you soon?" the older woman asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Count on it." Vi replied.
"Call me if you need anything, and there's going to be other Ringbearers on
Earth from now on, setting up safe places for people to live. Considering what
I've been told, there's going to be a number of underground cities coming to
life in the next couple of years. You might be getting a visitor or two from
now on."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The young Ringbearer stepped
through the portal; as it vanished, Claire turned and began to make her way
back towards the house. In her mind, she went over how she was going to tell
her &ndash; <i>husband</i>, yes, that was now the proper term for who he was, all
things considered - what was about to happen, and about the gift that they both
had been given. </p>
