<br>
<i>Carbondale, Illinois</i> - <b>(Earth Designation: Daria-823)</b><br>
<br>
<br>
The man known to his fellow members of the DELPHI operations section as <i>Project
Uatu</i> as <i>Archangel</i> (well, on his Earth) turned in his sleep,
eliciting a soft moan from the woman lying next to him. <br>
<br>
Deep in sleep, Archangel dreamed...<br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>I hate it when it happens like this.</i><br>
<br>
Archangel knew at once that he was dreaming. "Hello, Chynna."<br>
<br>
The young woman he knew as Chynna Henry &ndash; a woman that he hadn't seen since
college, the break-up wasn't a happy one for either of them &ndash; stood in front of
a bassinet, and as she picked up a crying baby, Archangel looked about the
nursery he found himself standing in. "Oh, she's just a little cranky &ndash; Mommy's
little girl just wants to get a little attention, doesn't she? Mommy has you..."<br>
<br>
"I haven't dreamed of you in &ndash; my God, I haven't thought of you in <i><u>ages</u></i>..."<br>
<br>
The sensation that always heralded a very bad prescient dream &ndash; Archangel was
certain that's what he was having now &ndash; trickled at the small of his neck and
down his spine...<i> this is not going to be good, in any way, shape or form.
Every single time that I've dreamed of Chynna, it's signaled something <u>truly</u>
horrible... This is going to be a very bad trip...</i><br>
<br>
The nighttime sky lit up, and Chynna grasped her child close as Archangel went
to the window, opened it, and disappeared into the night sky now brightly lit
by a spectacular display of the Aurora Borealis.<br>
<br>
<i>Something's very wrong &ndash; it's not supposed to be this bright, this wild...
well, not here in Southern Illinois. The display's so damned bright that it's
like spotlights in a football stadium &ndash; you can use this to read and see
everything around you easily-</i><br>
<br>
A large, gleaming ring of brilliant silver-white energy suddenly appeared in
the air above Archangel's head; unlike the purplish-white rings generated by
Defender Rings like the one he wore which generated rings which stood on one
end, like doorways... <br>
<br>
<i>Oh, my God,</i> he thought, as the ring swiftly descended and he found
himself in a large chamber. <i><u>The Ringmasters</u>.</i><br>
<br>
<i>"Master Ringbearer."</i> Intent and direction from the all-consuming glow
around him took meaning as words and images simply formed within his mind. <i>"We
allow this intrusion, for we will allow you little more in the coming days."</i><br>
<br>
"What are you talking about?"<br>
<br>
<i>"The hour of your greatest trial draws near."</i><br>
<br>
"I truly hate the cryptic messages."<br>
<br>
<i>"Master Ringbearer &ndash; complete the journey within your dream."</i><br>
<br>
Archangel suddenly found himself back in the sky over Carbondale &ndash; <i>this
isn't Carbondale, it's &ndash; holy hell, that's <u>New York City</u></i>!<br>
<br>
Going invisible &ndash; <i>thank God my affinity allows me to do that instead of
needing to use a Glamour to disappear,</i> he thought &ndash; Archangel swooped down
over the crowds that had filled Times Square to see the spectacular,
once-in-a-lifetime stellar drama in the skies overhead &ndash; until the first
laser-like beam of dawn light sliced over the horizon-<br>
<br>
<i>Every light in New York City suddenly blinked out. <br>
<br>
Every vehicle suddenly stopped moving. <br>
<br>
Every single machine suddenly stopped working.</i><br>
<br>
He could feel the collective spike of fear from millions &ndash; no, <b><u>billions</u></b>
of people &ndash; that seemed to rise up through the planet himself and punch through
him like a white-hot railway spike. <i>Oh, God, it can't be &ndash; that would come
from above, unless it's a sub-launched salvo, carpet-volley pattern designed to
shower the entire East Coast, but why would they &ndash; <br>
<br>
My God, they're actually doing it...</i><br>
<br>
A wave of light and force like an angry sun god's vengeance poured across the
horizon; Archangel's shields held against primal energies that washed over him
and the landscape below, bathing it in fire that scoured everything in its path
away to leave magma and bubbling volcanic glass behind... skyscrapers became
towering crematoriums of flame, with massive electrical charges dancing over
them and completing impossibly long, massive arcs of lightning that melted,
carbonized, or detonated whatever they moved across, making Manhattan Island
appear from above like a colossal Tesla globe.<br>
<br>
And the screaming began; a collective wailing of humanity that threatened to
overwhelm him until he forced the Ring to dampen its ability to sense pain and
suffering down as far as he could. <i>It never shuts off,</i> he reminded
himself, after a few moments of trying to keep the icepick of emotion from
below from continuing to jab at the side of his skull. <i>And this is just in
my premonition of what's to come, instead of the actual event...</i><br>
<br>
The pain continued to build, a massive tsunami of pain miles high that drew
closer and closer, threatening to drive him insane as he suddenly realized that
what he was seeing wasn't just on this Earth, but on several, on many other
alternate worlds... he was reminded of a similar event, a <i><u>Crisis</u></i>
from almost twenty years ago, when a blistering wave of white moved across
infinite Earths, killing untold numbers and reducing worlds to nothingness...<br>
<br>
He found himself back in the presence of the Ringmasters. "Can it be stopped?"
he asked, lifting his head with an effort as she struggled to stand. "The war,
the nukes flying &ndash; can it be stopped?"<br>
<br>
There was a moment of silence. <i>"You and the others who wear the Ring will
not interfere."</i><br>
<br>
<b>"What?"</b><br>
<br>
<i>"Your request is <u>denied</u>."</i><br>
<br>
"But I was-"<br>
<br>
<i>"That which is to come can not be stopped. It is a part of what is to
happen."</i><br>
<br>
"I don't understand," Archangel called out. "If you know what's going to
happen, then tell me, so the Ringbearers can stop it!"<br>
<br>
<i>"A similar situation has occurred before, in another reality. Then, as now,
the way is clear. The Corps of Ringbearers, by our Mandate, is seen as allied
with that which is known as Order. That which is to come is not a product of
Chaos &ndash; it is a result of the natural order of things. If the Corps of
Ringbearers interferes, their actions <u>may</u> be seen as attempt to alter
The Balance &ndash; and this will allow Chaos a free reign in the matter. Do nothing,
and Man may survive this trial. Interfere &ndash; and Chaos will see fit to ensure
that Earth will fall, her corpse birthing darkness that could spread like a
cancer throughout the universes."</i><br>
<br>
"You're not sure if the Other Side will react if you let us go in, so just to
be sure, you want us to stand down? That's bull!" he roared. "Many of them
won't listen &ndash; <i><u>I</u></i> won't just stand by and do nothing! The other
Ringbearers will help <i><u>anyway</u></i> &ndash; they'll try to stop it, or set it
right!"<br>
<br>
The silence seemed to smother him like a thick, choking mass that he was unable
to escape. "Say something!"<br>
<br>
<i>"You may act to save lives. You may act to preserve the species. These
actions would not be seen as a violation of the Mandate. No Ringbearer may act
any further."</i><br>
<br>
There was a heavy silence. <i>"<u>You</u> may not act any further. You have
never chosen to defy our orders, for you have always held a deeper
understanding of our Cause. We understand that you will not do so now."</i> A
blue globe of light appeared in front of Archangel. " Your Ring."<br>
<br>
Archangel held his right hand out. <i>"We strengthen and charge you to do our
bidding. We place upon you the means to enforce our will among your brothers
and sisters in the Order - and in so doing, to save the race of Man."</i><br>
<br>
The Defender Ring he wore glowed as the globe encircled Archangel's hand, and
then vanished. <i>"Awaken, Master Ringbearer. You have precious little time...
before the Final Dawn."</i><br>
<br>
<br>

*****<br>
<br>
<br>
Archangel snapped awake. "It was more than a prescient dream," he thought
aloud, looking at the way the words that encircled his Ring, written in
Interlac, burned with a blue-white fire that made them visible &ndash; confirmation
that the Ringmasters had indeed spoken to him, as they refused to allow anyone
to step foot upon their world except in the absolute worst of circumstances.
"It was a message."<br>
<br>
He slid out of bed and reached for his cell phone, dialing a number. "This is <i>Archangel</i>
for <i>Godseye</i>," he said, sleep fully out of his voice. "This is a Priority
Psi Upsilon signal - and I need this flagged as <i>CRITIC</i> traffic for <i>POTUS</i>."<br>
<br>
The woman lying in bed stirred. "Hey, you."<br>
<br>
Archangel turned to the woman, who had reached over to her table and brushed
masses of thick, luxurious black hair from her face before pulling her glasses
on. "You know, I was expecting more than just 'wham, bam, thank you ma'am' from
a guy like you... besides, I have to make sure that you get to the Tolnai
Auditorium on time for your second presentation this morning. The board will
have my butt if you're late again."<br>
<br>
The woman looked at her clock. "It's almost four in the morning. Gerald. Who
are you calling <u>now</u>?"<br>
<br>
"Jennifer &ndash; you need to get up and get dressed," Archangel said, annoyed by the
length of time it took to connect his call and run it through the scramblers &ndash; <i>like
that'll matter in a few hours, a day at most.</i> "You mentioned that you don't
have any family, right?"<br>
<br>
"Only child, and my parents passed away a few years back," Jennifer Henstridge
said, a slight edge of fear appearing in her voice that neither of them could
ignore. "Is something happening...?"<br>
<br>
<i>It would be wrong to lie to her now &ndash; and it would be wrong to leave her to
die alone. The Ringmasters said that we could act to save lives...</i> "This is
your house, right? All of your things are here?"<br>
<br>
"Yes &ndash; I got a decent-sized house so I could have guests, and not have to worry
about storage space &ndash; Gerald, what's going on?"<br>
<br>
Jennifer slid into a SIU-Carbondale sweatshirt that emphasized her ample bosom,
and then pulled on the matching sweatpants as her eyes stayed on Archangel.
"You remember last night, when you said that I got lucky? The truth is, I think
we both did &ndash; luckier than you've ever been before."<br>
<br>
Goosebumps rose on Jennifer's arms as Archangel continued. "The demonstration I
was going to give to those military and academic big-shots? Looks like you're
going to be the only one to see it now..." <br>
<br>
He turned away from Jennifer as a voice sounded in his ear. <i>"Secretariat
Control, meta-ops section - American desk, this is the watch officer."</i><br>
<br>
"This is Wright &ndash; authorization Zeta Chi Phi
zero-six-zero-nine-zero-five-seven-two. Authenticator code is <i>'Weeping
Angels'</i>.<br>
<br>
There was a series of clicks. <i>"Confirmed as 'Archangel' &ndash; special field
operations commander, <u>Project Uatu</u>. Go ahead, sir."</i><br>
<br>
"I am declaring a Code 513 event. <u>This is not a drill.</u> I am requesting
immediate global activation of all 513 protocols and immediate notification of
all personnel. Patch me in with General Trainor immediately. <i>Repeat - I am
declaring a Code 513 event &ndash; this is not a drill."</i><br>
<br>
He turned to Jennifer, who (to her credit) was not shaking with the terror she felt,
and which he could feel through the Ring he wore. "Don't worry." he said,
reaching out to take her trembling right hand in his own. "You're going to be
safe. I'm taking you with me."<br>

<br>
"Paula, who's that-?"<br>
<br>
Sammi Rudolph tried to brush masses of dark-blonde hair and hard-fought sleep
from her eyes. "I hate how you have meetings in our bedroom."<br>
<br>
She saw Paula Trainor, wearing a bathrobe as she sat on her side of the bed and
spoke on the secure phone as Dr. Lori Richmond and Master Sergeant Paxton Tran
Noc &ndash; her most trusted assistants, both in fatigues and heavily armed &ndash; stood
silently nearby. "Oh, it's just you two - Oh, my God. <i>Paula-?"</i><br>
<br>
She snapped awake and pulled the blankets up to cover herself as the world came
into sharp focus. "Paula, what's going on?"<br>
<br>
The attractive Black woman turned to Sammi, and the younger woman felt herself
go cold as Paula took her hand. "Sammi &ndash; remember what I asked you once before...
what is it that you have to take with you if you're leaving for good?"<br>
<br>
"A couple of things at the shop, and a few things here."<br>
<br>
"Get dressed. The Master Sergeant is staying with you &ndash; and please, do what he
tells you to, Sammi, I'm not kidding. He's going to take you there and then
bring you to my office. Get your gun &ndash; I know you don't like them, but get it
anyway. You've got one hour &ndash; and don't talk to anyone." As Sammi slid out of
bed, Paula turned to the tall Vietnamese non-com. "You don't take your eyes off
her. If she has to go to the john, you stand in the door to the stall. Use a
SMART-field generator to get her things &ndash; and you keep her safe. If necessary,
use your powers."<br>
<br>
The non-com's grip on his Heckler &amp; Koch PSG1 assault rifle tightened
slightly. "Yes, ma'am."<br>
<br>
"Meet us on the field at Tennyson. One hour."<br>
<br>
Sammi wiggled into a pair of jeans and sweater before leaving the room, Paxton
on her heels as Paula turned to the tiny brunette remaining in the bedroom and
accepted the fatigue uniform Lori had taken from the closet. "Make the calls
while I get dressed," she told the younger woman. "Get the <i>Gridrunners</i>
on station at Tennyson &ndash; one hour from now. We're heading for Niagara Falls &ndash;
the <i>Fast Forward</i> complex. Tell them to get ready for us, and send the
message to USAES. <i>Activate Zero Area now &ndash; and run the Homestead protocol.</i>
They have an hour to retrieve everyone they can, and to go 'hard shell' in
ninety. I don't care how overt they have to be. Warn Quest Industries and the
Legion &ndash; we may need them soon. Full disclosure. Run the <i>Hard Aurora</i> and
<i>Aurora Borealis</i> protocols; send the warning out to all of our friends &ndash;
here and overseas. They have one hour to get what they need and be ready. "<br>
<br>
Lori's expression was coolly impassive. "You're running with this."<br>
<br>
"This is a <i>Code 513</i> event with high confidence, <i><u>Oversight</u></i>.
Archangel's only confirmed what you and the other precognitives have warned us
about for the past week," Paula said, using Lori's code-name as she finished
dressing, went to a large wall safe in the bedroom, and took a machine out that
looked like a videotape player. " After we use the SMART-field to take the
brownstone, we'll stop at your place - and be at Tennyson University in an
hour. Send our people out with SMART-field boxes for Amy and Reese &ndash; his
parents are there, bring them along, too &ndash; as well as Angela, Lyle, and Sharon
at the British Embassy. One hour. Don't let <i><u>anyone</u></i> stop them from
getting there." She hesitated for a moment. "Have them pick up Cheryl and
Daniel, too."<br>
<br>
Lori nodded as Paula drew an H&amp;K G36 assault rifle &ndash; identical to the one
Lori had slung over her left shoulder &ndash; from the safe, and placed it on the
bed. "Send the codes to <u>all</u> DELPHI operatives and installations. 'Engage
Code 513 &ndash; the <i>Slowing Sun</i> and <i>Shadow Recall</i> protocols.' <i>All
other protocols are hereby vacated.</i> They have one hour to be on station.
Overt and public use of metahuman abilities and Next-Gen tech is hereby
authorized. SMART-field use to secure areas is authorized. Ignore all existing
laws if they get in the way of extractions. <i>The use of lethal force by all
personnel is hereby authorized."</i><br>
<br>
Paula looked up to Lori. "<i>Tell them to move.</i> Anyone who's late will have
to find their own way off Earth."<br>
