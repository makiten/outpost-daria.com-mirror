climbed down the plastic rungs leading down into the cement chamber.

had invited Stacy out to split a pie at Pizza King after their
rousing success of a magic show. Somewhere in their conversation,
they had gotten around to the upcoming turn of the millennium, only
two weeks away. &ldquo;Upchuck,&rdquo; Stacy had said, &ldquo;be
honest: is this whole Y2K deal for real? Could the whole world be
thrown into chaos just because computers can&rsquo;t get the date
right?&rdquo;</FONT></P>

took a pull on his soda. &ldquo;Yes and no. The dire predictions
could certainly happen &ndash; banks losing data for their
transactions, nuclear plant systems going haywire, all sorts of
issues &ndash; but only if the systems weren&rsquo;t upgraded in
time. Programmers have been working on it all year and even before.
The only computers with problems would be really old computers that
nobody thought to upgrade. Anything life-or-death would be taken care
of by now.&rdquo;</FONT></P>

at least that&rsquo;s the government&rsquo;s line on it. The last
thing I remember the government assuring us about was Slick Willie&rsquo;s
&lsquo;I did not have sexual relations with that woman,&rsquo; so
take it for what it&rsquo;s worth. Plus, there are all sorts of dire
predictions about the end of the world, and the year 2000 is a

end that quickly. I mean, there&rsquo;s so much I haven&rsquo;t done.
I haven&rsquo;t&hellip;um, nothing leaves this table, right?&rdquo;
Upchuck nodded his agreement. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t even gone to
second base with a guy yet, never mind, um, that other stuff. I&rsquo;d

got an evil grin on his face. &ldquo;Well, my dear. I can solve that
little&hellip;problem for you, my little cupcake.&rdquo; Stacy
narrowed her eyes, and Upchuck sighed. &ldquo;Actually, that&rsquo;s
a worry we share. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re not surprised that the
Ruttheimer charm has left me a virgin as well.&rdquo;</FONT></P>

not sure how to take that. I would adore being alone with you,
allowing your wanton&hellip;&rdquo; Upchuck shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry; I really don&rsquo;t mean to slip into that, most of the time.
I would be interested in getting to know you better, but if your
popularity is that important to you, then why even bother with me?&rdquo;</FONT></P>

sorry; I didn&rsquo;t mean that the way it sounded. It&rsquo;s not
that I really care about my popularity with most of the school, but
I&rsquo;d get thrown out of the Fashion Club for sure. Sandi would
never speak to me again, and even if Quinn or Tiffany did, they&rsquo;d
have to see me in secret or risk their own popularity. I really don&rsquo;t
want to look for new friends now when I may need to after high

be proud of our Miss Griffin.&rdquo; Upchuck took a bite of pizza,
while Stacy tried to remember who Mussolini was. Then a light bulb
seemed to go off over Upchuck&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Actually, I have
an idea; something to solve our problems and prepare us in case the
world really does come to an end, and possibly improve your
popularity if it doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</FONT></P>

fully functional, uses state-of-the-art technology, and even has its
own bedroom and bathroom for privacy. He says he got it for safety,
but I&rsquo;m more inclined to believe he just wanted an excuse for
building a private party room. He&rsquo;ll be out of town for New
Year&rsquo;s Eve, so I&rsquo;ll have access to the shelter all night
long. In fact, I was already planning to just stay there all night
and watch the ball drop in Times Square. You could join me, and get
to know each other better. Then, if the world does fall apart and
descend into chaos, we won&rsquo;t have to die virgins. Questions?

what he wants women to believe. He&rsquo;s actually gotten sick of
dating, and is taking a rest from the grind, so to speak. I&rsquo;ll
talk him into telling his friends about your upcoming date on New
Year&rsquo;s Eve, and then how wonderful it was afterward. I can see
it now: a romantic dinner by candlelight, watching the old year come
to a close on their big screen TV, and even sharing some champagne.
His parents will be home, so your parents shouldn&rsquo;t have a
problem with that, and there&rsquo;s always some in the shelter, so
you can report to your friends how it tastes. At midnight, you&rsquo;ll
share a brief, but tender, kiss, and he&rsquo;ll kiss your hand as
you leave the next morning, after you spend the night in the guest
bedroom; by yourself, of course. That way he has a cover for staying
home, drinking beer, and playing Super Duper Plumber Cousins 5 all

smiled. &ldquo;Perfect, with her mom being a lawyer, we could even
draw up a legal document, should you feel the need. Using Quinn or
her mother, or both, we put everything in writing, and if anything
bad would happen to you, they could bring it to the police. Of

started putting things together. &ldquo;Okay, so if I have this
straight, I spend the night with you in your fallout shelter. If
anything happens, we&rsquo;re safe, and we don&rsquo;t die virgins.
If nothing happens, the night never happened, and I was with your
cousin. If it turns out you&rsquo;re trying to trick me, we&rsquo;ll
have everything in writing and you&rsquo;ll be found out immediately.
All that, and the only thing I have to do besides showing up is be
willing to lose my virginity.&rdquo;</FONT></P>

wish. Quinn gets a lot of dates. Sandi seems to get dates, but lately
she's been guarded about that. Tiffany gets her share, but always
with one of a handful of guys. As for me, I practically have to beg
for a date when a major event comes around. It doesn't seem like it,
and Sandi's good at helping me look more desired, but a lot of guys
are either intimidated, distracted by my friends, or know not to date
me if they're looking for, um, things I don't want to do.&rdquo;</FONT></P>

she&rsquo;s all mental. It started off with small suggestions. I&rsquo;d
make a comment; she&rsquo;d disagree and make me think I was wrong.
By the time Quinn showed up, she could have told me the sky was green
and I would have thought I was wrong for seeing it blue. Quinn took
her off her game, but then she got meaner. Not as focused, because
she had to attack Quinn too, but that much nastier. Quinn never
really fell for the games, except for a few panic moments early on.
There was the dance where Sandi convinced Quinn to be in charge of it
with us as the committee. Quinn made some good suggestions, Sandi
shot down each one. Sandi made one completely unusable suggestion,
then used it as an excuse to abandon Quinn when it was even
questioned. I wanted to stay and help, but Sandi practically forced

clothes and food she could, as well as toiletries for both of them.
Charles packed the four best bottles of champagne left, as well as
contraceptives and a number of &ldquo;novelties&rdquo; to use as
barter. &ldquo;Disaster or no disaster, people are people,&rdquo; he
argued. He also packed the survival kit, with first aid implements
and potassium iodide for radiation treatments, as well as four .22
caliber pistols and the available ammunition, into a third bag, since
Quinn would be able to carry one if she arrived. Even if they didn&rsquo;t

sat on the couch and thought. <I>She&rsquo;s really concerned. I
can&rsquo;t really blame her; if I had a friend like Quinn, I&rsquo;d
be worried too. She&rsquo;s helped Stacy more than she realizes. Back
in junior high, she was a real loner. A lot of the other girls picked
on her for being so na&iuml;ve. Sandi befriended her, but she just
wanted someone to push around, like she tried to make Tiffany. At
least Tiffany never realized what Sandi was doing. Almost a pity,
because watching Sandi get frustrated with her was one of the
highlights of seeing Sandi. Quinn came along, gave Sandi competition,
and gave Stacy someone who actually listened when she spoke. Maybe if
I&rsquo;d found someone like that, I wouldn&rsquo;t have kept up this
sleezeball image for so long.</I></FONT></P>

Charles than without him, but without you, I don&rsquo;t know what
I&rsquo;ll do. It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t trust him, but I
don&rsquo;t know him. I want someone who won&rsquo;t fall apart when
everything goes down, and he&rsquo;s been easy to back down before. I
almost wish Sandi was coming, because she would be strong enough.
Maybe she&rsquo;d be too strong. Well, maybe they&rsquo;re both OK.
They have to be. Tiffany too. Everyone will be OK. I know it.</I> She

view out of the Peeping Tom showed a familiar red-haired girl walking
into view, wearing her usual pink top, which was uncharacteristically
torn. Her hand seemed to be bandaged, and she limped a bit, which
emphasized the tears in the knees of her jeans. She seemed to be
yelling, but no sound was heard. &ldquo;QUINN!&rdquo; Stacy shouted,
jostling Charles out of his thoughts. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s alive! She

next to the viewer, still crying, but with a smile on her face. &ldquo;She

She wished she could take the bed with her, but she was satisfied
taking one of the pillowcases as a reminder. She looked at Charles,
who looked at her. They both nodded, and Charles opened the door and
powered down the system. Stacy climbed first, as she carried fewer
burdens and was faster. &ldquo;That and I can enjoy the view&rdquo;

brought Quinn out of her state, and she turned around to see what she
had been praying to see for the last two days. Neither could say a
word, but all the communication they needed was in their faces and

yesterday morning, something happened, and all of the electronics
started shorting out, catching fire, and even exploding. I crashed at
Jane&rsquo;s place the night before. I&rsquo;d gone to some stupid
party, got drunk before I realized it, and got someone to drop me off
at her house. If I went home, I&rsquo;d get yelled at, and if I
didn&rsquo;t go somewhere safe, they&rsquo;d yell even more. I was
sleeping when it happened. I heard a pop, and woke up to see the
light fixture broken and sparking. I slept in my clothes, thank God,
and ran out of the room. Things all over the house were sparking and
catching fire. I woke up Jane just before her computer
self-destructed, and both of us got out in time. The house pretty
much collapsed a couple minutes later. We saw that was happening all
down the street. Both of us thought of Daria, and we rushed to my
house.&rdquo; Quinn was tearing up again. &ldquo;We got there&hellip;our
house was on fire too. Dad and Mom were in the kitchen. Dad must have
been cooking, and Mom had her phone to her ear. Daria, though&hellip;she

flashlight that should still work, but we can&rsquo;t count on any

you, Quinn.&rdquo; He handed each one of them a pistol and holster,
which clipped into the belt loops on their jeans. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
fully loaded, and extra rounds are in Quinn&rsquo;s pack. Hopefully

support. Quinn walked ahead, willing to risk herself in case
something jumped out. This walk had been a disaster. Stacy&rsquo;s
home was in ruins. There was nothing left to salvage, other than a
teddy bear that had somehow survived with a slight black tinge. Her
parents hadn&rsquo;t been so lucky. Tiffany&rsquo;s parents were
still alive, so at least that spared them having to search another
home for her body. Small comfort in such trying times. Along the way,
they had found a myriad of survivors. Some aggressive, some hiding

Brittany, and Quinn and Sandi would look for the three J&rsquo;s.
Nobody was quite sure where to find Andrea. Charles gave Jane the
spare pistol from his pack, so that each group had at least one
firearm. All the unnecessary things, like the champagne and extra
clothes, were stored in the shed.</FONT></P>

and Sandi had the longest walk, but all three of their targets would
be in the same neighborhood. Joey, Jeffy, and Jamie had grown up
together, which is probably why they all went after the same girl. On
the way there, Sandi kept an eye out for anyone, friend or foe, that
could help or hinder their progress, while Quinn kept her hand on the
handle of her pistol. Their path was fairly devastated, even when
compared to much of the surrounding area, and though they hadn&rsquo;t
seen anyone by the time they reached halfway, they weren&rsquo;t
taking any chances.</FONT></P>

escaped death by mere chance, though they refused to detail their

Everyone quieted down at that. &ldquo;Mack&rsquo;s house doesn&rsquo;t
&ndash; well, didn&rsquo;t &ndash; have a basement like most do. The
people who built the house during the &lsquo;50&rsquo;s had decided
to make their basement a fallout shelter in case the Cold War turned
hot. Because of that, his dad got a good deal on the house. Mack&rsquo;s
set up shop down there, and we spent the night there after watching
the New Year&rsquo;s celebration upstairs. So, after everything went
down on that morning, we opened up the door and found that everything
was on fire around us. We couldn&rsquo;t make it out, so we closed
the door. Before we did, Mack&rsquo;s stereo and alarm clock fried.
They weren&rsquo;t next to anything flammable though, so we were able
to put them out with a fire extinguisher. We came back out of the
shelter hours later, and the whole house was gone, other than our
shelter and the charred remains of the house.&rdquo;</FONT></P>

right now, bragging about how his house saved his kid and came in at

five, with enough supplies to last a good two months at least. We
could take up to three of you in with us, but there&rsquo;s no way we

night had mostly passed by the time Charles and Sandi&rsquo;s shift
had come up. With four sets of two, they only needed to watch for a
couple more hours before everyone would be up. However, the quiet was
broken by a rustling noise near the shed. Sandi nudged Charles, and
motioned for him to be quiet. They made their way towards the source
of the noise.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Sandi
carefully crept towards the sound; hand on her hip in case she needed
to draw her pistol. Charles followed behind, his pistol drawn to
frighten off anyone who didn&rsquo;t take no for an answer. Stacy
found the brush where the noise had come from, and pushed it aside.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">A
stray cat darted away from the camp at full speed. Sandi and Charles
wiped their brows in relief. Sandi&rsquo;s relief was short-lived, as
she started to gasp when she saw a man come up behind Charles. Before
either one could react further, however, both were seized by
rough-looking men carrying rags soaked in ether.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">It
was hard to pick out what the men looked like in the darkness. They
had some three-day stubble, but then most men had that by now. They
had some faded jeans and shirts on, but they were unable to determine
any definite coloration, including skin color, in the brief moment
before unconsciousness.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">The
men turned around, hands on their pistols, and saw the man behind
them wielding a shotgun. They didn&rsquo;t draw, so Stu decided not
to fire right away. &ldquo;If you value your lives, I&rsquo;d suggest
leaving right now. You don&rsquo;t have to go home, but you can&rsquo;t
stay here.&rdquo;</FONT></P>

two men hesitated, not sure what to do. The first man decided to
chance it, and drew his pistol. Stu shot him before he could raise
his gun, but the second man had enough time to draw and fire, hitting
him in the chest three times. Stu staggered, but was able to fire a
second shot at the man, taking him down as well.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">The
noise woke up everyone in the camp, and probably most people within
many blocks around them. Max had looked up in time to see Stu
collapse to the ground. He rushed over to him, yelling his name. The
rest of the conscious survivors surrounded him while Max examined his
wounds, which were grave indeed. The first two shots had punctured
his lungs, and the third was now lodged in his spine. &ldquo;Speak to
me, Stu! Stay with me! Say something!&rdquo;</FONT></P>

coughed up blood. &ldquo;Max, h-how&rsquo;d you like to own this

sobbing his eyes out.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">When
the sun rose, they agreed to bury Stu right next to the ruins of the
Zon. Without materials for a proper marker, they took two intact
planks from the ruin and nailed them together in the shape of a cross
with a hammer and nails found in the shed. They paid their respects
to the man who had taken them in and shared his remaining food with
them, and paid with his life.</FONT></P>

two bodies of the would-be thieves were brutally beaten and thrown

was given a backpack with their share of food, as well as shells for
Stu&rsquo;s shotgun. Everyone had decided they would need it, for
show at least, more than the crew staying in the shelter. Canteens
were filled and distributed amongst the four and Mack gave Stacy a
supply of Vitamin C, reasoning that &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to
find much for oranges for awhile.&rdquo; Upchuck&rsquo;s offer of his
&ldquo;marital aids&rdquo; was rebuffed by Mack and Jodie, though
Jane did disappear with him shortly after their discussion.</FONT></P>

with the introduction of the Daylight event by The Angst Guy. I'd had
an idea for some time concerning people coming down into a fallout
shelter for a reason other than the end of the world (partying,
getting away from a party, just relaxing), then being saved when the
end of the world occurs on the surface. The story basically spiraled
out (of control) from there. Chapters were posted to PPMB as they
were written and proofed. Originally posted as Daylight: When The
