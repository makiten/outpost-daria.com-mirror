Swanson relaxed in his camping chair. Nearby, a campfire pit was
completely out from last night&rsquo;s fire. Behind him was his van,
full of supplies for his planned trip to Patuxent River State Park.
The parks were always quieter in the winter, and after New Year&rsquo;s
Eve, he was ready for some quiet. Dave opened up a can of beer, and
thought about how he&rsquo;d be there right now if he hadn&rsquo;t
stayed up watching Dick Clark as the ball dropped, as he had the last
25 years. There he sat, in the shade of a sign stating &ldquo;Welcome
to Frederick&rdquo;, watching the dregs of humanity pass by.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Because
he didn&rsquo;t leave until 8 AM that morning, he was just past the
sign when the first wave hit. His 1976 conversion van stalled, and he
maneuvered it to the side of the road before anything happened. His
stereo shorted out, and the mini-television he brought for the Rose
Bowl practically exploded. There were still burn marks on the van
where it had been sitting. He decided not to walk back to town when
he saw other cars on fire in the distance, and he confirmed his
decision when everyone passing him from both directions was even more
terrified than he was.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Nobody
was sure what happened, other than all the electronics and electrical
stuff disintegrating, catching fire, or outright exploding. Strangely
it was just electrical things, as his spare bullets and road flares
were still intact. He had no family and he was unemployed after the
holidays, so he decided to just move his van back to the
attention-getting sign and act as a one-stop shop for whoever passed
by. If some tourists came through or the cops told him to move along,
he knew he could just head back then.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">That
was about two weeks ago. His food was still ok, since he&rsquo;d
planned to be well-fed for two weeks on the road, and the last couple
people were generous enough to trade food for some of his other
supplies. Hey, he didn&rsquo;t need all three fishing poles, just
&ldquo;Old Betsy&rdquo;. He dipped his hand into a box of metal
pieces, fastened them onto the silver chains, and set them out on the
card table in front of him. Maybe they wouldn&rsquo;t sell, but it
was better than just sitting around worrying about what would happen
when the food ran out.</FONT></P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">He
spotted a group of people on the horizon. After the first couple
days, he&rsquo;d only seen a handful of travelers from either
direction. The last two groups were ruffians, groups of teenagers
trying to intimidate him with knives and guns. One look at his
hunting rifle had scared off the first group right away, though the
second group almost decided to chance it. This group looked a lot
friendlier though; if nothing else, they sure looked prettier.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">A
red-haired woman led the way. She couldn&rsquo;t have been much more
than 18, if that. Actually, they all looked about the same age. The
redhead was carrying a shotgun, but waved to him with a friendly
smile, so he waved back. Behind her was another girl, a brunette,
holding hands with a red-haired freckled boy. At the back was another
brunette, watching behind them every few steps. They all looked so
thin; before all this happened, he would have sat them down to have a
decent meal at Irma&rsquo;s Caf&eacute;. Of course, they actually
looked well fed compared to the last few groups that were desperate
for food.</FONT></P>

you coming from?&rdquo;</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Lawndale,&rdquo;
replied the boy Quinn had called Chuck. &ldquo;Is it as bad in
Frederick as it is around Baltimore?&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Dave
smiled. &ldquo;Well, if you mean electrical doodads shorting out,
fires and explosions, and people running around scared and desperate
for food, then pretty much, yeah.&rdquo;</FONT></P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Just
like you figured,&rdquo; said the girl, Stacy was it? The one holding
Chuck&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;This CME&rsquo;s probably taken out the
whole east coast.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s
a CME?&rdquo; asked Dave.</FONT></P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Sandi,
the girl in back, responded. &ldquo;Basically, a huge solar flare
erupted and sent a humongous electrical charge through anything that
would carry it. At least, that&rsquo;s what Upchuck&rsquo;s data or
something is saying.&rdquo; Dave smiled when Sandi had called the boy
Upchuck. He wondered what Chuck had done to earn that nickname.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Were
you driving when this happened?&rdquo; asked Chuck. Dave nodded. &ldquo;Do
you remember if the sun was up?&rdquo;</FONT></P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo;
said Dave, &ldquo;It had just come up at 7:30 or so.&rdquo;</FONT></P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Hmm,
then it would have been just coming up around the Mississippi. Maybe
if we get far enough west there&rsquo;ll still be civilization,
assuming this was just one event&hellip;&rdquo; Chuck trailed off.</FONT></P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Quinn
jumped in, &ldquo;Well, with what we have left, we had better worry
about getting to the next town, never mind the Mississippi.&rdquo;</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Trouble?&rdquo;

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Well,
let me grab my map from my old job.&rdquo; Dave got up slowly,
stretched, then went into his van for a minute. He came out with a
map with a number of blue triangles. There were a large number of
them in Pennsylvania and a few in Virginia, not to mention two down
near Annapolis.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;What

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Nuclear
power plants.&rdquo; Everyone gasped at Dave&rsquo;s statement. &ldquo;I
used to work at one at the Calvert Cliffs facility. They&rsquo;re a
lot safer than people think they are, but if their electrical systems
reacted like these did, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be in 10 miles of
one.&rdquo;</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Quinn
bent over to look at the map. &ldquo;Hmm, then our best bet would be
Charleston. It looks like there&rsquo;s none in West Virginia or
Kentucky.&rdquo;</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;And

you have something to trade.&rdquo;</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Sandi
had just tried to shake some water out of her now-empty bottle. &ldquo;Um,
that would be great. What are you looking for?&rdquo;</FONT></P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">&ldquo;Well,
I&rsquo;m ok on food and the water should hold out fine. I guess
anything I can use in trade that doesn&rsquo;t have a shelf life will
do.&rdquo;</FONT></P>

smiled. &ldquo;My friend, would you have any objection to selling,
shall we say, marital aids?&rdquo; he said as he took Dave around the
side of the van to display his salvaged wares. After a few minutes,
they both came back with smiles on their faces.</FONT></P>

it&rsquo;s a deal; water and a couple cans of food for your little
gizmo. I&rsquo;ll tell you what though; to even out the trade, please
take a set of these necklaces.&rdquo; Dave picked up a pair of
necklaces. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got more than I&rsquo;ll probably sell,
and the market on these things has probably dropped to nothing, but I
think they&rsquo;re right up your alley.&rdquo; He handed one pair to
Chuck, who looked at them and handed one to Stacy.</FONT></P>

it was still light, Chuck opened his map of the area. He was studying
it carefully for about five minutes when Stacy joined him in looking.
&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s the plan, Charles?&rdquo;</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Chuck
looked deep in thought. &ldquo;Well, I figure we should follow the
main roads where we can. Getting off on a back road might lead us
into a trap or some unfriendly country. I see two main paths to
Charleston. We could go northwest on 70 past Hagerstown to Hancock,
then 68 through western Maryland to Morgantown, then south on 79 to
Charleston. Otherwise we could take 81 south to Lexington, Virginia,
west on 64 to Beckley, then 64/77 north to our destination. I figure
the south route adds 30-50 miles, depending.&rdquo;</FONT></P>

on whether we get to 81 at Hagerstown or down by Winchester. We can
follow 340 out of here, but the roads tend to get a bit smaller past
the Maryland border. We&rsquo;d save a good chunk of walking, as long

answered. &ldquo;Well, going north might be a bit hillier. South
would bring us around these mountains here, giving us a bit flatter
terrain. Still, we&rsquo;re following a highway, so it can&rsquo;t be
that rough. Plus, having Maryland ID&rsquo;s may serve us better
going the north road. Who knows if they&rsquo;ll mean anything
outside the state?&rdquo;</FONT></P>

It&rsquo;s shorter, and we&rsquo;ll encounter more small towns; towns
that may not have been as ravaged as the bigger cities.&rdquo;</FONT></P>

at first for not sharing food, then for having food in the first
place, and eventually just because they were there. Some people had
even turned to cannibalism after less than a week, desperate to
survive at any cost. The police tried to keep the peace for the first
few days, but many criminals targeted them first. Within a week, many
of the police forces were laden with casualties and forced to concede
that the situation was out of their control. Those few precincts that
were able to keep up had started to declare martial law to keep the
peace, whether they had the authority or not.</FONT></P>

four made it to Hagerstown without incident, but had decided to skip
going into the city after stopping by a small suburb called Halfway.
People had been streaming out of Hagerstown for days since the New
Year started, begging for food and talking about the same kind of
violence Baltimore had seen. Two days ago, people suddenly stopped
coming out of the city. Nobody was sure why, and nobody really wanted
to find out the reason. They were able to restock a couple days worth
of food and their water, enough to get them to the next town at
least, at a local emergency relief center that looked to be stretched
to its limits. It wasn&rsquo;t the best food or the purest water, but
they were safe, and these days that&rsquo;s what mattered.</FONT></P>

next made the twenty-some mile trip to Hancock, a small town of about
1700 people (or so the sign said) that marked the beginning of both
Interstate 68 and the Maryland Panhandle. Again, their trip there was
mostly uneventful, other than spotting a man in his twenties riding a
small motorbike. It turned out that his model was very low-tech, and
the only electrical system was for the lights, which the man had
removed after they stopped sparking. The engine still worked, and the
starter was mechanical, so it had survived the recent events
relatively intact. Judging from the man&rsquo;s build and lack of
weapons, not to mention his trust shown in stopping for them, the
bike might have been the only reason he was alive. He was heading in
the opposite direction, to try to find relatives in Wilmington, so
they bid each other adieu.</FONT></P>

found. While many of the larger communities, as well as some of the
smaller ones, had largely turned against each other and struggled to
survive. Here, where less than a thousand had survived, they worked
together to start rebuilding their community. Already a makeshift
meeting hall was being built where the high school baseball diamond
had been. The football and track facility had already been turned
into an outdoor forum of sorts, where large group meetings could be
held as well as small dramatic productions put together by locals to
keep spirits up. (According to one of the locals, they had just
missed a dramatic reenactment of the lightsaber fight from Star Wars,
preceded by a performance of &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s On First&rdquo;, put
on by two members of the high school Forensics team last night.)</FONT></P>

going, you&rsquo;ll want to follow 144 until you hit 68 again. 68
will be a little bit steeper, but it&rsquo;s a lot shorter. Besides,
if cars can go over it, you can. Pratt, Gilpin, and Flintstone were
all pretty much deserted when they came through. When you get close
to Cumberland, you&rsquo;ll reach Elk Lick Run and the Baltimore

though they were in a theoretically safe neighborhood, the four
agreed to keep watch as usual, for safety and to ensure their usual

Chuck the second, then Quinn, and finally Sandi. More often than not,
Chuck would stay up talking with Stacy until her shift was over (when
Quinn and Sandi noticed, they made sure talking was the extent of
their activities), and Sandi would talk with Quinn when she woke up
early.</FONT></P>

enjoyed their breakfast, pancakes and summer sausage (one of the few
meats that kept well at room temperature thanks to its
preservatives), with the townsfolk, traded a few supplies for extra
summer sausage, and filled their canteens. Thankfully, there were a
number of small rivers and streams on the way, and they could boil
the water over the campfire with Stu&rsquo;s stew pot. Without any
guarantee of people until Cumberland or friendly people anywhere
ahead, they had to rely on what little resources they had.</FONT></P>

struck out on their journey with the thanks and good wishes of the
people of Hancock. It was about 25 miles to Flintstone, which they
covered in two days, and another 10 to the outskirts of Cumberland.
When they arrived in Flintstone, it was as deserted as Bob had said
it would be. Gilpin and Pratt could barely be called villages, and
neither had a single sign of life, outside of the myriad small
creatures claiming the ruined and abandoned houses for shelter.
Flintstone was bigger, though not by much, and just as devoid of
people.</FONT></P>

the houses was a depressing, and often disgusting affair. Most of the
bodies were decaying or down to skeletons from predators searching
for a meal. Where fresh food had not been destroyed by fire, it was
covered in mold, worms, and other parasites. Some family portraits
survived, and the four knew that even if the people in them had
survived, they would likely never return. Amongst the ruins, parts of
toys, decorations, furniture, and other belongings told the story of
the destruction. One pine tree with remnants of tinsel and crudely
cut paper ornaments colored in crayon reminded them of the past
Christmas, while New Year&rsquo;s party favors spread around one
burned out house captured the true spirit of this New Year.</FONT></P>

were able to find a few useful things amongst the wreckage. A tool

awl and a brand new socket wrench set, still in the gift box with a

former owner&rsquo;s first choice for a Christmas gift.) A six-pack

the back yard of the party house, apparently forgotten in the haze of
the celebration, stowed in Chuck&rsquo;s bag next to his last bottle

they came to an older house that looked to be relatively intact. It
was tucked back in some woods, and had been picked relatively clean
before they arrived. However, it was insulated, and sturdy enough to
spend the night in, a blessing as a snow storm had just blown into
the area. There was a king-sized bed in the bedroom, as well as a
couch in the living room. They decided to split the night in half,
with Quinn and Sandi taking the bed during Chuck and Stacy&rsquo;s

awoke with a pounding headache. As she opened her eyes, she realized
she was indoors. She went to wipe her eyes, and realized her arms and

five minutes after waking up, a young man, possibly college age,
poked his head into the room. He had shoulder-length brown hair that
seemed to defy any attempts to lay flat, a pair of wire-rimmed
glasses, and a nose big enough to grab onto. Quinn gasped, which
prompted the man to say, &ldquo;Ah, good; you&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo;

High School</SPAN> sits on the northwestern side of Cumberland, not
far from Wills Creek. In years past, actors Eddie Deezen and William
H. Macy had walked the halls of this school, almost fitting given the
acting job the Doomsday Device would be performing. As many of the
halls had collapsed, the only inhabitants were a handful of small
animals, and the Device made sure it stayed that way.</FONT></P>

the west of the school lies a standard high school track encircling
what once was a practice football field. Today, however, a large
wooden table, salvaged from the school, sat at roughly the fifty yard
line, and the battle waged would be quite different. On the west side
of the table sat Biff, the new leader of the Doomsday Device as of
9:30 that morning, when a disagreement in direction led to the change
in leadership. Biff normally stood 6&rsquo;5, weighed 300 before the
New Year and had probably lost only a bit of his paunch since then.
He&rsquo;d been a Lineman in college, but got thrown off the team for
academics. Since then he&rsquo;d developed a bit of a beer belly, but
still worked out, delusional that the NFL would come calling.</FONT></P>

Biff&rsquo;s left and right sat his two most trusted associates, and
his best two brawlers stood at the ends of the table. To the far left
and right were his two best marksmen, ready to fire should the need
arise. This left only the man bringing Ryan and the prisoner, and the
man who would bring the other three travelers to the table. Only the
three men at the table knew that the Doomsday Device, not counting
those they had bullied, blackmailed, or otherwise forced into
service, only numbered nine men, many of whom were untrained thugs,
after the death of their former leader. At least, that&rsquo;s what
Biff believed.</FONT></P>

a nice guy; always helping people out. Just the kind of person Biff
liked to beat up in front of his friends. George had always liked
Ryan, but with George gone, Biff could do what he pleased to him. No
need to kill him now though. He couldn&rsquo;t harm a fly. Next time
he stepped out of line though, goodbye, Ryan. That prisoner was a
fox, though. At thirty, Biff hadn&rsquo;t sampled something quite
that young and fine in some time. She better survive, or else whoever

holsters, while the boy in the middle focused on carrying their
belongings to the table. The girl on the right seemed to be the
leader, but from her shaking, Biff figured she wasn&rsquo;t much to
worry about. Probably never had a real man in her life. The other
brunette seemed to be a bit more pissed off. Biff figured it was her
time of the month or something. He&rsquo;d have to make sure of that
if she survived. The boy in the middle looked to be the classic
90-pound weakling, used to having sand kicked in his face. He
wouldn&rsquo;t be much good as a worker, and he might just have to
die to teach the others a lesson. What that lesson was could be

through his left aorta. Ryan had been fairly sure he wouldn&rsquo;t
get that good of a shot twice, so he switched his aim to the gunman
and thug to his left. He was able to kill the gunman and hit the thug
in his right arm as he ran behind the man he took the gun from, who
had tried to draw his gun before realizing it was gone. Quinn, Chuck,
Stacy, and Sandi dropped down out of instinct, and Sandi and Stacy
drew their guns as they dropped. Stacy rolled and turned to shoot the
man behind her, who dropped dead to the ground just as his shot
entered the ground an inch from Chuck&rsquo;s head. Sandi hit the
thug on the right in the leg, sending him to the ground as well. The
gunman to Ryan&rsquo;s right fired at him, but first hit only the man
whose gun had been taken. After that man fell dead, Ryan tried to
shoot at the two men on the right. However, he wasn&rsquo;t fast
enough to avoid the gunman, who hit Ryan in the chest before he could
fire again, then followed up with two more direct hits before he

fire. Both would fall, but Sandi only sustained a wound to the
shoulder on her firing arm; the gunman took one to the temple. The
two men at the table fired blindly at first, breaking the champagne
bottle and a few of the beers, but not hitting anyone. Finally, the
man at the left screamed as Chuck fired at his midsection, puncturing
his lung. The man on the right flailed at Chuck, went to fire, but
was prevented by a shot from Stacy, who hit him on his right elbow
just before the trigger was pulled. Chuck followed it up with a shot
to the head.</FONT></P>

out of bullets, and while Stacy might have had time enough to reload,
Chuck did not. Stacy ran over to the table and grabbed the chef&rsquo;s
knife, but by then the man was pummeling Chuck. Stacy ran over with
the knife, but the thug had seen it coming, and he grabbed her by the
neck as she came up to him. She dropped the knife in terror, and she
fought to breathe. Chuck, seeing the knife, wriggled his arm free,
grabbed the knife, and plunged it into his stomach. The man let out a
guttural groan, and Chuck retrieved the knife and stabbed him again
in the chest, between two ribs. With that, the thug dropped to the
ground. Both Stacy and Chuck sat up, looked each other in the eyes,

watch where you were going. It&rsquo;s just me. If I&rsquo;d seen
that man before I ran, or if I&rsquo;d have stopped him from pushing
me, I&rsquo;d be dead, not him, just like I should be.&rdquo; Stacy
turned back around, her back to the others.</FONT></P>

was speechless, so Sandi filled the void. &ldquo;Come on, Stacy; do
you really think you&rsquo;re the only reason Charles is dead? If I
hadn&rsquo;t gotten shot, you never would have rushed over to me. If
I&rsquo;d seen that he wasn&rsquo;t dead, I still had at least one
bullet in my gun, and he would never have had the chance to shoot.&rdquo;</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: #000000"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Quinn&rsquo;s

cut my way out of rope with the razor blade Ryan gave me. I stood up,
saw the man raise his gun, and I grabbed Ryan&rsquo;s gun. I stopped
to steady myself because my hands were shaking, and because of that,
I fired three seconds too late.&rdquo;</FONT></P>

snapped this time. &ldquo;Stacy, <B>your</B> gun was out of bullets.
Even if you saw the man, all you could do was point him out. Sandi

jumped in. &ldquo;Stop it, both of you! This isn&rsquo;t getting us
anywhere! This whole thing was a trap, and I led us right into it
because I couldn&rsquo;t think of anything but getting Quinn back.
I&rsquo;m blaming myself for this as much as you two are, but if we
keep yelling at each other about who blames themselves more, we&rsquo;ll
never get anywhere. Don&rsquo;t forget, if that Ryan guy or whatever
hadn&rsquo;t shot half of their people, we&rsquo;d be slaves or

paused, and the other two said nothing, just bowing their heads. She
continued, more calmly this time. &ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;re not
heroes, even if this town thinks we are. The only two heroes from
last night are buried in this ground. Ryan knew he was dead when he
took that gun. He knew it when he gave you that razor blade, Quinn.
Charles saw that you were going to die, Stacy, and he risked his life
to save you. Us?&rdquo; Sandi snorted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just the
ones who got away. We shot a few people that would have shot us
first, and saved our own lives because that&rsquo;s all we had the
chance to do. I know each one of us would have done what Charles did,
and probably Ryan too, if we were in their shoes, and we&rsquo;d be
in the ground instead of them, while they blamed themselves for it.&rdquo;</FONT></P>

out on you guys. We can kick ourselves and bitch about what we should

where we go from here.&rdquo;</FONT></P>

us here as heroes, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to take their

knelt at the freshly dug grave. &ldquo;Hey, Charles. I guess this is
it. You know, before that night in your bunker, I never thought you&rsquo;d
be as great a guy as you were. Not just because of the sex. I mean,
don&rsquo;t get me wrong, those were some of my favorite times with
you, but you meant so much more to me than that. You made me feel
special; like I deserved to be alive. I still feel that, thanks to
you. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll ever find someone like you
again. If not, at least I had this time with you. You gave me a taste
of heaven when the rest of my world went to hell. Then, you took that
bullet for me. You died, so that I could live. My mom told me that
Jesus did the same thing. Maybe you&rsquo;re not Jesus, but that&rsquo;s
what you were to me. I&rsquo;ll never forget you, and you&rsquo;re
right, you&rsquo;ll be right with me, wherever I go.&rdquo; She
closed her eyes, and a single teardrop fell from her right eye, onto
Charles&rsquo;s grave. &ldquo;God, where will I ever find another man
like you?&rdquo;</FONT></P>

scream brought Stacy out of her thoughts. It belonged to Quinn, and
Stacy rushed to her side, where Sandi stood. A man wearing a tattered
navy-blue business suit and sunglasses lay on the north end of the
track. His makeshift walking stick lay at his side. All three
gathered around the man, who was still alive, though barely so. They
rolled him onto his back, and saw a bullet wound around his navel. He
spoke haltingly, but deeply. &ldquo;Are you going to Charleston?&rdquo;</FONT></P>

remembered the man&rsquo;s last words and went to his vest pocket.
There was a note and a wallet. She read the note. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s

understand. I guess this pin on his jacket is what they&rsquo;re
referring to, and the address on the second page is north of
Charleston if I remember the map. Didn&rsquo;t he say the Secretary
of Labor?&rdquo;</FONT></P>

while he was tutoring me. If the President dies, the Vice President
