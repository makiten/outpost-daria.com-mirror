<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter 1</FONT><BR><BR>&ldquo;Welcome
to Wild and Wonderful West Virginia,&rdquo; reads a sign just past
the Maryland/West Virginia border on Interstate 68. In the past,
thousands of travelers passed by the sign on a daily basis.
Generally, they would either silently note they were on the right
road, panic that they were not, snicker at the state motto, or, most
commonly, ignore the sign outright as they passed by at 70 miles per
hour. <BR><BR>However, in the last month, that flow of traffic had
slowed dramatically, both in terms of speed and volume. On this day,
January 31st, 2000, only three travelers would pass by the sign, and
their reactions were quite different.<BR><BR>&ldquo;West Virginia! We
made it!&rdquo; rang the cheery voice of Quinn Morgendorffer. Quinn&rsquo;s
voice betrayed none of the hardship she had to endure over the last
month.<BR><BR>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about freaking time,&rdquo; added
Sandi Griffin. Though Sandi had always been quick to complain, she
had reason for concern, as the trio had expected to see that sign by
the previous night.<BR><BR>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s check around the sign
to make sure nobody&rsquo;s using it for cover,&rdquo; suggested
Stacy Rowe as she pulled out her pistol. Over the last few days,
Stacy had been acting braver than usual and had been eerily calm. Of
course, when the one you love sacrifices his life to save yours, it&rsquo;s
normal to undergo some personal changes.<BR><BR>The sign and
surrounding trees were thoroughly checked and found to be devoid of
human existence. Confident that they were alone, they set down their
bags and started setting up camp. Stacy and Sandi set to gathering
wood from nearby trees while Quinn took their large pot to a nearby
stream to gather water. As Quinn was setting to her task, she thought
about the course of events that led her to where she was. After all,
it was just a month ago that she was commanding boys to bring her
diet soda.<BR><BR>---<BR><BR>On the last day of 1999, Quinn
remembered dancing at a house party being thrown by the football
team. Sandi and Tiffany had both been there, as had Joey, Jeffy, and
Jamie. Someone, she couldn&rsquo;t remember who, had brought the
mixings for Hairy Navels, and just about everyone at the party was
drunk by the time 2000 arrived. Quinn remembered getting someone
sober to drive her home, and then begging him to not take her home
because her parents would kill her. The only other house she could
think of was Jane Lane&rsquo;s house, because Jane&rsquo;s parents
were never home anyway.<BR><BR>That morning, Quinn had awoken to the
sound of electrical snapping noises. The light fixture above her
sparked and caught fire, and she dived out of the way as it crashed
down. She ran to tell Jane about it, and ended up pulling Jane out of
the way when her computer monitor exploded. They ran from the house
and escaped with their lives. Upon returning to Quinn&rsquo;s house,
they found that her parents and sister Daria had not been so
lucky.<BR><BR>It would turn out that, due to some sort of solar flare
or something, Quinn wasn&rsquo;t exactly sure, everything electronic
and electrical was shorted out and either stopped working, caught
fire, or exploded. They moved on to the Zon, where Jane&rsquo;s
brother Trent had stayed the night, but the only survivors there were
Max, Trent&rsquo;s drummer, and Stu, the owner. Quinn remembered her
promise to Stacy to meet her above Charles &ldquo;Upchuck&rdquo;
Ruttheimer&rsquo;s fallout shelter, where Stacy had spent New Year&rsquo;s
Eve. There she found both Stacy and Upchuck were still alive, though
their shelter self-destructed minutes after they emerged. Through
explorations they found Sandi cowering in her storage shed, as well
as Mack and Jodie safe in their reinforced basement. Stu ended up
being killed by bandits in the night. Jane and Max had opted to join
Mack and Jodie, while Quinn, Sandi, Stacy and Upchuck chose to head
out.<BR><BR>From there, the quartet walked west, trying to find a
safer civilization and the means for survival. They traveled across
the panhandle of Maryland, just now seeing the next state. Stacy and
Charles had become inseparable lovers, and Sandi and Quinn had grown
closer together. Quinn felt safe in Sandi&rsquo;s arms, but every now
and then she wondered if their relationship was one of love or mere
necessity.<BR><BR>When they came to Cumberland, Quinn had been
kidnapped by a local ruling gang of thugs who called themselves the
Doomsday Device. The man in charge of keeping her prisoner, Ryan, had
given her the means of escape, and had planned to take down the
Device, even at the cost of his life. Her companions arranged to
negotiate for Quinn&rsquo;s release, but soon learned that the
Doomsday Device planned to take them all prisoner and confiscate all
their belongings. Ryan made his move, and after an intense minute
Ryan was dead, along with apparently the entire gang. Sandi had taken
a bullet to her shoulder, a wound she still favored to this day, and
Stacy had run to her side. One gang member had survived, and took a
shot at Stacy. Charles pushed Stacy out of the way, only to take her
place in the line of fire and sustain a fatal wound.<BR><BR>In the
aftermath, an unknown Secret Service agent barely stumbled to the
three girls before collapsing in front of them. He asked them to
deliver a message with his dying words. The message, labeled
Executive Order 509, appeared to be a top secret communication meant
for the Secretary of Labor, who had apparently spent the New Year&rsquo;s
at a house in Nitro, a suburb of Charleston, West Virginia. After
realizing that this Secretary may be the next, or even last, person
in the line of succession to the Presidency, all three eventually
agreed that they had to deliver this letter at almost any
cost.<BR><BR>---<BR><BR>Quinn looked at her two friends and
considered how they all had changed over the last month. While none
of them had been overweight before the New Year, they all were in
much better physical condition. Instead of eating light salads and
low-calorie everything, they were eating whatever they could find;
from beef stew and canned pasta to MRE&rsquo;s and whatever else they
could pick up on their way. Once afraid to work up a sweat, they now
walked for as long as they could, sometimes several hours over the
course of the day. Their bodies, once wan from dieting and
maintaining the <I>Waif </I>standard of beauty, had developed
significant muscle tone. Their faces hadn&rsquo;t seen makeup in a
month, and their hair had grown longer and tangled. Their initial
longings for facials, veggie platters, and dates at Chez Pierre had
been replaced by memories of hot showers, home-cooked meals, and
having families to rely on when the going got tough.<BR><BR>Quinn
brought the pot up to the fire Sandi had gotten started. She hung the
handle over their makeshift spit to boil out any bacteria or other
harmful materials. Stacy had set up their canteens and the funnel
they used to fill them with. Sandi worked on taking stock of the
food. She knew exactly how much food she had to work with, but she
insisted on checking daily; this was partly to ensure none of the
food had disappeared and partly wishful thinking that extra
provisions would magically appear. Thus far, neither had
occurred.<BR><BR>&ldquo;Ladies,&rdquo; began Sandi, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
that time again. This time I want each of you to pick a number
between one and thirty-six.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Stacy spoke first.
&ldquo;One.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn thought it over.
&ldquo;Twenty-Three.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi moved a few things around,
out of the view of the others. &ldquo;And for me?&rdquo;<BR><BR>Stacy
and Quinn looked at each other, and said in unison,
&ldquo;Thirteen.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi smiled and tossed the girls
MRE&rsquo;s. &ldquo;You really should stop being so predictable.
Thirteen gives me the chicken with Thai sauce. One gets Stacy
meatloaf, and twenty-three is spaghetti. Dig in, girls.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn
kicked the ground. &ldquo;Aw, we still had a Thai sauce left?&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi
shrugged. &ldquo;Well, not any more. We do have plenty of beef franks
left if you prefer to change.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn shook her head,
while Stacy thought it over. &ldquo;How many meatloaf do we have
left?&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi knew the answer but looked to be sure.
&ldquo;Just the one.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Stacy nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
keep mine then. At least we&rsquo;ll be done with meatloaf until the
next outpost.&rdquo;</FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter Two</FONT><BR><BR>47-year-old
Peter Senerchia rode his horse out to the edge of the woods on his
property. He paused to look out into the forest, seeing nothing but
trees and small woodland creatures. He thought about the last time
he&rsquo;d been at this property, gathering his friends and a few
co-workers for hunting season. He&rsquo;d shot an 8-pointer, the
biggest buck they found that year, and he carried the picture of him
posing with the deer in his wallet.<BR><BR>It was right next to the
picture of his wife and kids, whom he would never see alive
again.<BR><BR>---<BR><BR>Peter Senerchia was entering his final year
as Secretary of Labor. Being a family man, he volunteered to spend
the New Year&rsquo;s holiday at his summer home just outside Nitro,
West Virginia with his family. The Secret Service double-checked the
security of the property a week prior, and two Secret Service agents
had accompanied his family on the trip.<BR><BR>On New Year&rsquo;s
Day, he awoke early and decided to take a ride on his favorite horse,
Chestnut, as the sun was rising. One of the agents, John Palmer, had
accompanied him on his run. As they returned from their ride, they
saw smoke in the direction of the house. They rushed back, only to
find the house engulfed in flames. John ran inside first, followed
closely by Peter, but neither could believe what they saw. Peter&rsquo;s
wife and two children were already dead, along with the other agent,
at the table in the kitchen. The two men barely escaped the house
with their own lives.<BR><BR>Peter had never gotten around to
installing lighting for the stable, which meant it survived the event
intact. After finding out the extent of the issue, the two men had
made the stable their shelter. The storage cellar was largely
untouched, so a number of preserved foods were still available, and
most of the mandatory supply of rations provided by the Secret
Service was safe inside the stable at the time of the event. The
electrical pump had failed, but a hand pump they kept for decorative
purposes was fully functional. They had the tools to survive, so all
they could do is wait.<BR><BR>---<BR><BR>Peter saw John coming
towards him out of the corner of his eye. John still wore his
sunglasses, but had been convinced to stop wearing his ties. &ldquo;Any
luck with the radio.&rdquo;<BR><BR>John trotted to a stop next to
Peter and shook his head. &ldquo;Negative, sir. The radio&rsquo;s
working but it&rsquo;s not picking up any stations.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Peter
nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not surprised, since it takes juice to
broadcast. Hell, if you hadn&rsquo;t remembered your hand-crank
radio, I&rsquo;d have doubted that a radio existed anymore.&rdquo;<BR><BR>John
agreed. &ldquo;Even with a working receiver, it&rsquo;s useless
without a working transmitter within a 50-mile radius. We should
really get back to the stable, sir.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Peter looked out at
the forest. &ldquo;We should really get back to Washington.&rdquo;<BR><BR>John
replied, &ldquo;You know we have our orders, and you know
why.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Peter sighed. &ldquo;I do, but that doesn&rsquo;t
make me like them. I feel bloody useless sitting around here when I
could be doing my damn job instead of wondering if there&rsquo;s even
a Washington to go back to. Two more weeks and we head back, news or
no news, right?&rdquo;<BR><BR>John nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
correct, sir.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Peter smiled. &ldquo;Good, and seriously,
stop calling me sir.&rdquo;<BR><BR>---<BR><BR>Conditions in the heart
of the Charleston Metropolitan Area weren&rsquo;t any better. In
fact, with so many people fighting over so few supplies, chaos seemed
to be a somewhat lacking description. After nearly a month of food
riots, drug wars, and fights for practically any reason under the
sun, most of the ordinary, decent folks had been killed, died of
starvation, or run for the hills. Those who remained were either
ruthless enough to take what they needed, strong enough to keep what
they had, or stubborn enough to believe they&rsquo;d survive no
matter what happened. Jordan James could be considered all three.<BR><BR>On
December 31st, 1999, he had been a mere page for the West Virginia
State Senate who dealt cocaine to make ends meet, hoping to
eventually make his name in politics. When the events of New Year&rsquo;s
occurred, he used his connections, both political and underground, to
band together a force to keep the peace after the police had failed.
The Jordan James Five-Borough Force, commonly known as the JJ5,
slowly gained control over a vast majority of the city. Most of those
areas out of JJ5 control either had agreements with the Force or were
too hostile to be of use. That would change as time went by.<BR><BR>Jordan
stood before a gathering of his higher-level &ldquo;supporters,&rdquo;
who took care of most of the actual dirty work. He surveyed the
twenty-five or so bosses and administrators before him, all of whom
looking at him expectantly. He knew many of them wished to see him
dead &ndash; some to take his place, others to have one less mouth to
feed, and still others just for the hell of it &ndash; but he also
knew his value to the organization he founded. He was the public
face. He was the man painted on the walls still standing in the inner
city. He was the man who people recognized as their leader, and he
gave them a chance to believe, no matter how untrue it was, that he
cared for their well-being.<BR><BR>&ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; started
Jordan, &ldquo;tonight is the last night of January. It has been a
month of both highs and lows. We all know about the destruction that
occurred on New Year&rsquo;s Day. I lost my Mother, my sister, and a
number of close friends on that day. This city descended into ruin.
Brother fought against brother just to survive to the next day. The
remaining stores of food continued to dwindle. People were trapped
inside what was left of their homes, wondering where it all would
end.<BR><BR>&ldquo;I could no longer stand idly by as the city
destroyed itself, and neither could you. The people of Guthrie, Davis
Creek, South Charleston, Dunbar, and Tyler Mountain banded together
to form the group known across the city as the JJ5. We brought order
to the chaos. We brought shelter to the homeless. We clothed the
naked and we fed the hungry. And then, some of the undesirable
elements of our town pointed to us and said, &lsquo;they&rsquo;re
only out for themselves&rsquo; and &lsquo;they&rsquo;re trying to
rule the city.&rsquo; They didn&rsquo;t see that we were making sure
everyone got a piece of the pie. Sure, maybe we kept some of the best
pieces for ourselves, but everyone got their share. It&rsquo;s
because of the great work you do and your constant vigilance that we
have kept order in Charleston, West Virginia. It&rsquo;s because of
you that there still is a Charleston, West Virginia, and not an
abandoned ruin. My friends, January started out low, but ended on a
high note. Now that the so-called Saint Albans Saints have been dealt
with, I have no doubt that together we will make this a February to
remember!&rdquo;<BR><BR>The group at the meeting all cheered as
Jordan&rsquo;s speech ended. He basked in the applause which, for
him, made it all worth it: the killings, the turf wars, the terror
tactics; all of it. After all, if he didn&rsquo;t do it, someone else
would, and he&rsquo;d be just another victim.<BR><BR>Jordan&rsquo;s
second-in-command, Bryce Johnson, stood behind his leader, outwardly
supportive of the speech. Inside, he knew there were minor
inaccuracies in Jordan&rsquo;s speech. The Saint Albans Saints had
been broken, certainly, but the remnants from that gang threatened
their push to the northeast into Amandaville, Virginia Heights, and
Nitro. Still, victory was inevitable; it was merely the cost of
victory that was still up in the air. By the end of next month, the
JJ5 would control practically all of the Charleston area: from Scary
to Elk Hills and from Pocatalico to Port Amherst. This prospect
pleased him greatly. In fact, the only thing that would please Bryce
Johnson more is if, by the time it happened, the JJ5 had become the
BJ5.</FONT></P>

and Quinn lay intertwined on their blanket in a grassy meadow. A few
feet away, the remnants of a picnic lunch sat waiting to be put away.
Quinn smiled and looked deep into her lover&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;You
know I love you.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi nodded. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn
continued. &ldquo;And eventually, you&rsquo;ll realize you love
me.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi looked away. &ldquo;How will I know?&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn
turned Sandi&rsquo;s face back to hers. &ldquo;When the time comes,
you&rsquo;ll know.&rdquo; She then placed her lips against
Sandi&rsquo;s.<BR><BR>Just then, a man on a horse appeared in the
distance. He rode towards the two girls with a fire in his eyes and
an axe in his hand. Sandi looked at Quinn, kissed her one last time,
and shooed her away as she stood up before the rider. Quinn hesitated
before running off.<BR><BR>The rider came to a stop before her. &ldquo;You
know you can&rsquo;t stop me.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi nodded. &ldquo;Maybe
not, but I can&rsquo;t stand aside and let you take her from
me.&rdquo;<BR><BR>The rider considered this. &ldquo;So be it.&rdquo;
He raised his axe and brought it down on the shoulder of the girl
before him, who stood defiant.<BR><BR>---<BR><BR>Sandi woke with a
start. Looking around, she remembered she was in a tent in Weston,
and that it was February 5th. Her pack had fallen onto her shoulder,
waking her. &ldquo;That does it,&rdquo; she said aloud to nobody in
particular, &ldquo;even if I get the chance, no more freaking romance
novels ever again.&rdquo;<BR><BR>&ldquo;Hear hear,&rdquo; said a
familiar voice outside the tent. &ldquo;Are you decent,
Sandi?&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi smiled as she made sure her blanket
covered her lingerie-clad body. &ldquo;No, Quinn.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn
opened the tent flap and entered the tent, closing it behind her.
&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; She lay down next to Sandi and snuggled close.
&ldquo;Another nightmare?&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi nodded. &ldquo;Yeah;
well, kind of. It was pretty good for a while.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn
kissed Sandi gently on the lips. &ldquo;Oh really? What was it
like?&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi smiled. &ldquo;About like this, only no
tent and less clothing.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn grinned wider. &ldquo;I
like it so far. Let me guess, another slab of beefcake on a horse
spoiling the party?&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi nodded. &ldquo;You guessed
it. It almost makes me afraid to try anything with you in real
life.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn appraised their current position. &ldquo;It
doesn&rsquo;t seem to be stopping you.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi stifled a
laugh. &ldquo;I said almost.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn shook her head and
smiled. &ldquo;I love you so much, Sandi.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi turned
away, partly from the memory of her dream, but mostly from her
feelings inside. &ldquo;I know you do.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn sighed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m not trying to pressure you. I just
can&rsquo;t help how I feel about you.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi continued
to look away. &ldquo;I wish I knew one way or another. These days I&rsquo;m
not even sure what love is.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn thought about it. &ldquo;I
do, but I don&rsquo;t know if I can describe it. It&rsquo;s like,
when you&rsquo;re with that person, they&rsquo;re all that matters in
the world. The rest of the world could go to hell, but it&rsquo;s
heaven all around them. You would do anything, pay any cost, to make
that person happy.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi sighed. &ldquo;Then I guess I
used to be in love; with myself. Now, I just don&rsquo;t
know.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn turned Sandi&rsquo;s face to hers. &ldquo;When
the time comes, you&rsquo;ll know.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi turned white
as a sheet. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what you said in my
dream.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn shrugged. &ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s
because it&rsquo;s the truth. There was a moment I just knew how I
felt about you. When you put your arms around me, just after we
rescued you from your shed, I knew there was something different.
Saving Jane made me happy. Finding Stacy made me happy. Finding you
was something more. It was like I realized how afraid I had been that
I would never see you again, and how good it felt to have you in my
arms.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi pondered what Quinn was saying. &ldquo;I
guess that makes sense.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn smiled and kissed Sandi
briefly on the lips. &ldquo;Now get dressed. Another half-hour and
you&rsquo;ll have to find your own breakfast.&rdquo;<BR><BR>---<BR><BR>&ldquo;If
it were all to come back tomorrow, there&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m
going back to salads.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn and Sandi turned towards
Stacy, who had just stabbed a sausage link drenched in pancake syrup
and inhaled it with one bite.<BR><BR>Quinn smirked. &ldquo;Stacy,
it&rsquo;s a good thing you&rsquo;re the straight one.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Stacy
looked confused as she chewed. &ldquo;Hmmm?&rdquo; A sudden look of
recognition was accompanied by a roll of the eyes and a swallow. &ldquo;I
still don&rsquo;t get your problem with it.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn
rolled her eyes in response. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a problem with
it; I just don&rsquo;t see why you&rsquo;d be so eager for
it.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Stacy shook her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not eager
for it. I just like the taste; and the texture.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn
shrugged. &ldquo;Well, to each their own, I guess. I&rsquo;d rather
have a slice of ham any day.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi, who&rsquo;d been
following the conversation with a bemused smirk, suddenly coughed up
the water she had been drinking. &ldquo;Wait, what are you talking
about?&rdquo;<BR><BR>Stacy smiled. &ldquo;Sausage.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn
batted her eyelashes at Sandi. &ldquo;What did you think we were
talking about?&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t long after that when Quinn and
Stacy broke into laughter, with Sandi not far behind.</FONT></P>

Johnson walked into the makeshift office that Jordan James had turned
into the hub of operations for the JJ5, keeping his smile on the
inside. <I>After all, we don&rsquo;t want Jordan to think we&rsquo;re
being too optimistic, do we? </I>&ldquo;Good morning,

&ldquo;Excellent! Any trouble integrating them into our
coalition?&rdquo;<BR><BR>Bryce let the smile leave his face. &ldquo;None
in Amandaville proper, but Virginia Heights is being&hellip;troublesome.
We were prepared for their assault on our flank, but they&rsquo;re in
it for the long haul.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Jordan shrugged. &ldquo;Well, we
knew it wouldn&rsquo;t be that easy. How long is the long
haul?&rdquo;<BR><BR>Bryce answered, &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re still

stifled a laugh at that. &ldquo;If we can&rsquo;t put them down by

Nitro, which may be the perfect place to use as a staging area for
the final push to Scary. There have been rumors that the Secretary
was supposed to be in town on the First Day, but there have been no
confirmed sightings of him or his family since then. There are,
however, reports of someone claiming to be a Secret Service agent who
stops anyone who tries to enter.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Jordan considered
this. &ldquo;I certainly hope he&rsquo;s just bluffing. The last
thing we need is the federal government on our backs.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Bryce
scoffed at this notion. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t seriously think the
Federal Government still exists outside of Washington, can
you?&rdquo;<BR><BR>Jordan scowled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the
government that worries me; it&rsquo;s the army. If they come through
here, and they find out we had to subdue someone in the line of
succession for the Presidency, I don&rsquo;t see martial law being
kind to us.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Bryce thought this over. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
the Secretary of Labor. How many people would have to die before they
got to him?&rdquo;<BR><BR>Jordan shrugged. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
recall, but it&rsquo;s less than thirty at the most. How many of them
survived just that day, though? How many may have run short on food
or run out of the medicine that they needed to survive in the last
month? For all we know, the Secretary of Agriculture and a
Congressman from Wyoming are running the whole show by now. No, if we
run into the Secretary, we thank him for his service, give him
whatever he needs, and send him on his way. Or, if he wants to stay,
we leave him alone.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Bryce frowned. &ldquo;I disagree.
If he goes back to Washington and alerts them to what we&rsquo;re
doing, that might bring the Army right after us. I say we kill him if
we find him.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Jordan shook his head. &ldquo;Your opinion
is appreciated, but we can&rsquo;t chance that right now. Anyway, if
he&rsquo;s even there to begin with, he probably hasn&rsquo;t
survived this long without outside supplies, so the point is moot.
That &lsquo;agent&rsquo; is just some kook trying to squat the
property. Continue to plan his estate as the staging ground for the
Scary push, and give your men orders to approach the estate
diplomatically. Steve&rsquo;s a good guy to arrange for any
negotiations. If he fails, we won&rsquo;t miss having one less bean
counter&rsquo;s mouth to feed. I&rsquo;ll make sure he&rsquo;s there
after you deal with the Heights.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Bryce nodded. &ldquo;Yes
sir. It will be done as you request.&rdquo; <I>And now,</I> he
thought as he walked away, <I>I have found your weak point. All I
have to do is find the right moment and squeeze, and you&rsquo;ll be
out of my way.</I><BR><BR>---<BR><BR>The three girls stood at the
dispensary; their mood was certainly different from at breakfast.
&ldquo;Are you sure that&rsquo;s all you can spare?&rdquo; asked
Quinn.<BR><BR>The man behind the desk frowned along with the three
girls before him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, girls, but even the two
days of meals you have now is more than I should be offering. If you
hadn&rsquo;t helped us last night preparing the fields, I couldn&rsquo;t
offer anything other than breakfast today. I&rsquo;m afraid the
stable food supply will run short fairly soon. Are you sure you can&rsquo;t
stay and help us rebuild?&rdquo;<BR><BR>Stacy looked solemn. &ldquo;We
can&rsquo;t let that agent have died in vain.&rdquo;<BR><BR>The man
nodded. &ldquo;A word to the wise: out in the countryside are a lot
of good ol&rsquo; boys that are happy they&rsquo;ll probably never
have to hear another police car coming to take their moonshine stills
or bust up their hoedowns. I don&rsquo;t reckon they&rsquo;d take too
kindly to strangers saying they&rsquo;re on government
business.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn bowed slightly. &ldquo;Thank you. At
least good advice is still free and available.&rdquo;<BR><BR>The man
tipped his hat to the ladies before him. &ldquo;When that changes,
it&rsquo;s time to pack it up. Good day, ladies.&rdquo;<BR><BR>---<BR><BR>Steve
Jensen sat at the table in his living quarters. Several papers were
arranged in various stacks before him. It was an odd life being an
accountant for a corrupt organization at a time when money no longer
has any value. Aside from the obvious problems with the barter system
&ndash; exactly how many bushels of wheat did a guard dog cost? &ndash;
he had to help make sure the supplies they had would last
indefinitely. Of course, he didn&rsquo;t really have much else to do,
since he was practically a prisoner. Sure, he could get up and walk
around his block for exercise, but any further and he faced the
people he portioned food out to; people who often got barely what
they needed or less.<BR><BR>Of course, Steve couldn&rsquo;t tell them
that he was living on one meal a day. He couldn&rsquo;t tell them
that he hadn&rsquo;t seen his family up in Ripley since Day One when
he was stranded in his office building. He couldn&rsquo;t tell them
that the JJ5 had kept him as a glorified prisoner to do their
accounting since the takeover.<BR><BR><I>Well,</I> he thought, <I>I
could tell them, but they wouldn&rsquo;t care.</I><BR><BR>Unlike most
of the people, he got his meal every day. Unlike most of the people,
he wasn&rsquo;t forced to fight against neighboring towns to increase
the JJ5&rsquo;s sphere of influence. Unlike most of the people, he
had a secure place to call his own. Most importantly, unlike most of
the people who lived in the area just over a month ago, he was
alive.<BR><BR>A knock at the door made him raise his head from his
documents. &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; he called, thankful for the modicum
of respect shown in not just barging in.<BR><BR>The door opened, and
a man Steve knew only as Johnson walked inside. &ldquo;Good morning,
Steve.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Steve smiled, as he finished the perfunctory
greeting they&rsquo;d said every day for weeks. &ldquo;Every morning
we&rsquo;re alive is a good one, sir.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Johnson nodded.
&ldquo;How are things coming?&rdquo;<BR><BR>Steve knew what Johnson
meant. &ldquo;Fairly well considering the circumstances. At the rate
we&rsquo;re going, the eastern villages shouldn&rsquo;t have any
issues with the food supply for another three months.&rdquo; Steve
knew that Johnson didn&rsquo;t consider the general populace
suffering from mild malnutrition to be an issue.<BR><BR>Johnson
smiled and took the papers that Steve held out. &ldquo;Excellent. I
assume this does not take into account the stores of
Amandaville?&rdquo;<BR><BR>Steve nodded. &ldquo;That is correct, sir.
Without knowing what we gained, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to ascertain
its benefits, nor the costs of feeding their people. Once I have that
information, I&rsquo;ll revise my projections.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Johnson
waved his hand. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry too much about that right
now. Whatever work you can do on that will be appreciated, but I want
you to get ready for an extra assignment.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Steve became
nervous at that word. &ldquo;Assignment?&rdquo;<BR><BR>Johnson
nodded. &ldquo;Jordan personally informed me that there&rsquo;s a
rumor going around about a high-ranking politician that may be holed
up in Nitro. Someone claiming to be with the Secret Service is
keeping people away from the area, so we may need your expertise as a
negotiator there, in case he cannot be persuaded to join our team. We
expect to be there by the 10th, if not before, and you&rsquo;ll be
mobilized the day before we&rsquo;re ready with a protection squad.
You&rsquo;ll be upgraded to the next class of meals starting today
until the assignment is complete, and for an additional week when
negotiations are successful. I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t need to
remind you why you should have a successful negotiation.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Steve
was quite aware of the last negotiator who failed to negotiate the
surrender of a village. He reminded himself that if negotiations fell
through, it would be better to switch sides than return empty-handed.
Still, his job wasn&rsquo;t up for debate, and B-Meals wouldn&rsquo;t
leave his stomach quite as empty as the C-Meals tended to. &ldquo;Of
course not, sir. Thank you for your consideration.&rdquo;<BR><BR>&ldquo;Be
ready to move when the time comes,&rdquo; Johnson said, turning to
leave. &ldquo;With any luck, you may be out there sooner than
later.&rdquo;<BR><BR><I>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m afraid of</I>,
thought Steve, as he watched his superior leave.</FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter Five</FONT><BR><BR>The
town of Sutton proved to be a ghost town, like so many of the others
the girls had passed. Burned out buildings dominated, with a few
brick structures still standing. The girls had decided to take
shelter in an abandoned Catholic church across from a wall reading
&ldquo;Chew Mail Pouch: Treat Yourself to the Best.&rdquo;<BR><BR>&ldquo;Ugh,&rdquo;
said Sandi as she saw the old advertisement while entering the
church. &ldquo;Why would anyone chew tobacco? It&rsquo;s so
disgusting.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn, following behind, agreed. &ldquo;I
know, having to spit all the time, all that brown stuff,
ewww!&rdquo;<BR><BR>Stacy, watching their backs, replied, &ldquo;Well,
I don&rsquo;t know. I mean, these people are out on a farm where
nobody&rsquo;s going to see them, and can you imagine lighting up a
cigarette in an open field when it&rsquo;s raining?&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi
rolled her eyes and turned around. &ldquo;Stacy!&rdquo;<BR><BR>Stacy
turned to meet Sandi&rsquo;s look. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi
realized her mistake, blushed and mumbled, &ldquo;Um, sorry. Old
habits die hard and stuff.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn, taking the moment in,
put her arms on both girls&rsquo; shoulders. &ldquo;Come on girls;
let&rsquo;s check this place out.&rdquo;<BR><BR>---<BR><BR>The girls
checked out the entire building to ensure it was empty, coming to the
chapel last. The chapel was fairly simple for a Catholic church. The
light fixtures were all broken at best, but sufficient light streamed
in from the stained glass windows, most of which were still fully
intact. Several rows of pews led up to the altar at the front,
partitioned off by a communion rail. To the sides, several depictions
of Jesus, Mary, and other biblical figures dominated the artwork. In
one corner was an altar with a picture of Mary, surrounded by several
candles.<BR><BR>The trio walked into the room, and immediately Sandi
walked to the rail, knelt, folded her hands and closed her eyes.
Quinn looked on surprised, but when she started to talk, Stacy put
her hand on Quinn&rsquo;s shoulder. After about half a minute, Stacy
stood, crossed herself, and walked back to the other two.<BR><BR>Quinn
spoke first, &ldquo;Sandi, I didn&rsquo;t know you were
Catholic.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi sighed. &ldquo;I was. I guess I still
am. After my Confirmation, I started losing faith. The head priest at
our church went senile as my Confirmation was ending. One day he gave
a sermon about going to a mountaintop or something, and then the next
day he made an obscene phone call to a teenage girl and drove miles
away. They found him and put him into a nursing home. The next guy
they got was just mean. Anything and everything I did was a sin.
Nothing I did was right in his eyes, unless I were to become a nun or
something. All that drove me away, but since all this happened, I
don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Stacy nodded. &ldquo;I remember that.
Between that and that one dance you got roped into planning, eighth
grade wasn&rsquo;t a fun year for you.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn nodded
thoughtfully. &ldquo;And then I come into the picture and threaten
your popularity. No wonder you were such a grouch; no
offense.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi smirked. &ldquo;None taken. It&rsquo;s
not like you were always the nicest person yourself at times.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn
smiled. &ldquo;Yeah, I guess so. Moving to a new city, making all new
friends, hoping my popularity would carry over; I was working
overtime just trying to be &lsquo;Quinn.&rsquo; The two of us started
butting heads and whatever friendship we&rsquo;d made got left
behind. That night I tried to spend at your house didn&rsquo;t
exactly help matters.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi remembered that night. &ldquo;Oh
yeah. Sam and Chris tripped over each other to do your bidding, and I
got so frustrated I threw you out.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn thought back.
&ldquo;Then I went to Tiffany&rsquo;s, God rest her soul, and she
kept trying on outfits and asking if they made her look fat. I mean,
honestly, parachute pants couldn&rsquo;t make her look fat! After the
tenth straight outfit asking only that question, I got frustrated,
she kicked me out, and I went over to Stacy&rsquo;s, where you scared
the hell out of me.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Stacy sighed. &ldquo;I know. I just
saw you as this perfect being back then. I thought that if I became
you, then maybe I&rsquo;d be perfect too.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn looked
down. &ldquo;Stacy, I&rsquo;m sure by now that you know I&rsquo;m far
from perfect.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Stacy nodded. &ldquo;Yeah, I know. Some
part of me knew then. When I saw the look of terror in your eyes, I
knew I stepped over some line, but I didn&rsquo;t realize what I was
doing. Then I saw this movie where this woman starts dressing like
her roommate and tries to kill her, and I realized how creepy I&rsquo;d
been. It took a while, but I finally started to make progress. I
started to become my own person. Then, I met Charles.&rdquo; Stacy
had her head down and seemed to be softly crying, a change from her
usual outbursts of tears.<BR><BR>Quinn walked over to Stacy and led
her to sit on one of the pews, and Sandi followed. Stacy continued.
&ldquo;At first, Charles just had the solution to that magic trick I
couldn&rsquo;t figure out. Then, I became his confidant; his partner.
I really enjoyed living this other life where popularity didn&rsquo;t
matter. I liked fashion, and I liked being in the club, but I was
never going to be as popular as you two. You were always the popular
ones, and I was constantly trying and failing to keep up with you.
When I started helping out Charles, though, I realized that it didn&rsquo;t
matter. Why be the worst at being popular when I could be the best at
this whole new persona? Why try to be someone I can&rsquo;t be when I
can be myself?&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi had been listening intently. When
Stacy went quiet, Sandi said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my fault.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Stacy
looked over at Sandi. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not&hellip;&rdquo; She
stopped herself, realizing Sandi was right to an extent. &ldquo;Well,
maybe it is, but it&rsquo;s more my fault than yours. I let you use
me. I wanted to be you, and then I wanted to be Quinn, and then I
didn&rsquo;t know what I wanted. I finally found what I wanted in
Charles.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn sighed. &ldquo;And then it was taken
away from you.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Stacy looked over to Quinn. &ldquo;Not
really. He may have been taken from me, but I still have all he&rsquo;s
given me: the confidence and the determination to be myself.&rdquo;
She looked down at her feet. &ldquo;I only wish he&rsquo;d had the
strength left to hold me in his arms one last time.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn
paused in thought, and then looked over at Sandi. &ldquo;Sandi, if
you knew one or both of us wasn&rsquo;t going to make it, what would
you do?&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi turned to face Quinn. &ldquo;What do you
mean?&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn shrugged. &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s say
there&rsquo;s a steam roller or something coming at us, and in ten
seconds, we&rsquo;ll be dead, and we can&rsquo;t stop it. What do you
do?&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi thought it over. &ldquo;Hmm, I guess I&rsquo;d
pray for forgiveness, and if there&rsquo;s any time left, yell to the
heavens whatever came to mind, like &lsquo;I never saw Paris!&rsquo;
or &lsquo;Eye shadow is overrated!&rsquo;&rdquo; This brought all
three to laughing. &ldquo;So what would you do, Quinn?&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn
settled down, thought for a second, smiled, and then spoke. &ldquo;One
last passionate kiss, like there&rsquo;s no tomorrow.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi
looked into Quinn&rsquo;s eyes, which were fixed on her own. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
like to change my answer.&rdquo; They laughed again at that. &ldquo;So
Stacy, where do you go from here?&rdquo;<BR><BR>Stacy thought while
she spoke. &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t replace Charles. I mean, I
could find some guy, but it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m looking for a
cheap lay or anything. After him, I get the feeling it wouldn&rsquo;t
be the same.&rdquo; She paused then continued. &ldquo;To be honest,
the only people I really care about right now are you two. Everyone
else that mattered to me is dead or bound to be impossible to find.
We have our duty to deliver the message to the Secretary. Other than
that, I&rsquo;ll follow you around as long as you&rsquo;ll have me
and figure out what to do from there.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn smiled.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always welcome to stay with us, wherever we end
up.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Stacy hugged first Quinn, then Sandi. &ldquo;Thanks;
that means a lot to me. Now, you two need some time alone, and
personally, I&rsquo;d rather not be in earshot.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi
shuddered. &ldquo;Stacy, it&rsquo;s a church!&rdquo;<BR><BR>Stacy
shrugged and smiled. &ldquo;What, you never had that fantasy?&rdquo;
She walked over to the entrance to the kitchen and Sunday school
areas, leaving her two friends shaking their heads.<BR><BR>&ldquo;There
are many things,&rdquo; said Sandi, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;ve thought to
do in a church. Until now, that was not one of them. How about you,
Quinn? I&rsquo;m fairly sure I&rsquo;ve never asked you about your
religious beliefs at our daily make-up checks.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn
shrugged. &ldquo;My family has never been the most religious. Mom and
Dad pretty much told us to treat people how we want to be treated and
to figure out our own relationship with God. Daria always claimed to
be agnostic, but every now and then, when she was at her lowest, I
could tell she believed in something. As for me, well, I&rsquo;m sure
you remember that whole angel deal. I still believe in angels, or
something like that, but I know I can&rsquo;t just rely on them and
hope everything works out. So I just try to do whatever I can, and
hope God&rsquo;s not mad at me when I need him, her, it, or
whatever.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi looked grim. &ldquo;Do you think God&rsquo;s
mad at us for&hellip;you know.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn didn&rsquo;t.
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi looked slightly annoyed. &ldquo;You
know; being lesbians and all.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn was taken aback.
&ldquo;Oh. Is that why you&hellip;&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi stopped Quinn.
&ldquo;No! That&rsquo;s not why I haven&rsquo;t said&hellip;that.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn
nodded, relieved. &ldquo;Oh. Well then, if a guy had done to you what
I did to you, would that have made it any more pure and holy or
whatever?&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi shook her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
see that mattering.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn put her arms around Sandi and
continued. &ldquo;Well, do you think God would have a problem with us
just being really close friends?&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi rolled her eyes.
&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn shrugged. &ldquo;Then
there&rsquo;s not much for God to punish us for.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi
smirked. &ldquo;Well, other than when your tongue was inside
my&hellip;&rdquo;<BR><BR>Quinn interrupted. &ldquo;And you enjoyed
every minute of that.&rdquo;<BR><BR>Sandi nodded. &ldquo;Totally
worth a few more years of penance.&rdquo;</FONT></P>

stood ready to face anyone and everyone coming their way. Over the
last few days, they hadn&rsquo;t had much to worry about. There were
a few wanderers looking for sustenance and a traveling salesman (who
claimed that despite the devastation, there was still quite the
market for ladies&rsquo; unmentionables) looking for business, none
of whom could have caused trouble had they wanted to.</FONT></P>

their post were enough to rouse the interests of the two larger men,
who each stood over six feet tall and weighed well over 250 pounds
each. The man on the left clapped his hand on the prone form of the
third man, who may have been five-foot-ten and at best 135 pounds.
The previously slumbering man bolted awake, and said, &ldquo;Owwww!
What&rsquo;d you do that for, lummox?&rdquo; The larger man merely
gestured to the approaching women, and the smaller man smiled and
stood. All three readied their weapons of choice &ndash; the larger
men shotguns, the smaller man a short sword he&rsquo;d gotten from a
convention a few years back &ndash; and allowed the women to
approach.</FONT></P>

his duffel bag, he thought back on his life. Back when he was fresh
out of college, he thought about packing everything into a backpack
and wandering around just to see what the country was like outside of
West Virginia. Then the girl of his dreams arrived, the one he&rsquo;d
been looking for since he knew the difference between men and women.
When he met her, he almost forgot his wanderlust. Soon he was taking
an entry level job, working his way up in the company to supplement
his fianc&eacute;&rsquo;s part-time job. Soon he was making enough
that his wife didn&rsquo;t have to work, and she brought him two
beautiful children. A part of him still wished he could see the
country, but he knew he would only go if he could bring his family
with him. It wasn&rsquo;t that he felt obligated to provide for them;
it just wouldn&rsquo;t be the same if he couldn&rsquo;t share the
wonders of the road with them.</FONT></P>

he ever got the chance to run away from the JJ5, he knew he had to go

dead. After all, if it wasn&rsquo;t for his invisible shackles, he&rsquo;d
have been home long before now. He wasn&rsquo;t sure what would await
him when he got home. Maybe it&rsquo;d just be burned-out rubble.
Maybe it&rsquo;d be picked clean by bandits and folks passing through
just looking to survive. Maybe he&rsquo;d even find his family, or at

&ldquo;The Best of What&rsquo;s Left&rdquo;, &ldquo;Chateau de

always ate vastly better food than the peons. In reality, they simply
had a bit more variety, got a bit bigger portions, and didn&rsquo;t
have to deal with moldy or outdated food. Being 2<SUP>nd</SUP> in

both her left and her right were rocky hills, with Lakeview Drive,
the next leg of their trip, cutting right through the burned out
buildings before her like a river. Slightly to the right in front of
her, the sun had approached the horizon, and the sky had melted into
a spectrum of reds, oranges, and purples.</FONT></P>

Steve Jensen&rsquo;s group had made the 1/3 mile trek down Blake&rsquo;s
Creek Road, stopping before a driveway. The driveway led up a hill,
out of sight, towards the location known to the JJ5 as the former,
possibly current, home of Secretary of Labor, Peter Senerchia. On
either side of the driveway, the forest blocked any possible view of
the estate. A simple wooden gate, held together by an old, rusty
chain, blocked off access to the estate to most vehicles, though one
could easily step over the gate on foot. Lakeside Drive formed the
northwest boundary 300 feet to the left, and Lakeview Drive flanked
the southeast side to their right. Near Lakeview Drive, a decorative
outcropping of rock standing five feet high bore the same sign that
the gate did: &ldquo;Warning: Keep Out. Trespassers may be subjected
to imprisonment or execution.&rdquo;</FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">As you are likely aware, on 1/1/2000, an ELE
occurred that simultaneously destroyed every electronic device and
electric wire in the Washington D.C. area. We have since determined
that the area of effect includes, at the least, all of the
northeastern states and several to the south. We have yet to find an
unaffected region, and fear that this may have been a global event.
Determining the extent of the event has been hampered as most forms
of motorized transportation have been neutralized, along with all
power plants and most fuel supplies. All power, telegraph, telephone,
cable, and data cables have been destroyed or rendered unusable,
cutting off practically all communication. In fact, if not for
salvaging the typewriter I am composing this document on, it would
have been handwritten.</FONT></P>

President Pro Tempore of the Senate and Speaker of the House have
also been confirmed dead in separate reports, as well as other
Cabinet members, Senators, and Congressmen. To be blunt, there are
now only three known living Cabinet members, yourself excluded.
Secretary Allen is incapacitated and unable to serve. Frankly, our
doctors are not optimistic about his chances of survival. I am
currently serving as acting President until your arrival. Secretary
Taylor is assisting me as my second in command. You are currently the
next in line to become President, barring a miraculous recovery from

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Burt Smith had grown into his family name ever
since that January morning when the world turned upside down. He was
an All-American Offensive Tackle playing for Marshall University and
was celebrating the New Year, along with their resounding victory in
the Motor City Bowl, when everything turned upside down. He ended up
in Washington, DC, where his strength and the skills he&rsquo;d
learned from his late father allowed him to take over one of the few
surviving iron forges in the nation&rsquo;s capital.</FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">That was five years ago, when the government
was in chaos. Now, that chaos had been mostly calmed, and President
Senerchia&rsquo;s forces depended on Burt&rsquo;s forge to keep their
horses shod and their sabers sharp. He never complained about his
life. I mean, sure, he wanted to play in the NFL and become a legend,
but chances were he&rsquo;d have ended up third string for a team
that never contended. Maybe if he was lucky, he&rsquo;d get signed by
some team with a shot at a Super Bowl ring, but he wouldn&rsquo;t
have earned it. Here, he earned everything he got and, all things
considered, maybe his life here was a bit safer not having to let
defensive linemen try to kill him a hundred times a game.</FONT></P>

this story bears little resemblance to him (though the number 13 on
