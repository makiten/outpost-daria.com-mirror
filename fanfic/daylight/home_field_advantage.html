<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>From what his mother had told
him, resisting a psionic attack was the very first thing that David Allen
Farrington had ever done with his powers &ndash; and that when he was barely two
weeks old, a crying child instinctively feeling as if he were being attacked in
force by the four skilled psionics who were only seeking to bind his powers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>It was an instinctive
reaction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>That was twenty years ago.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Now, Cadet First Class
Farrington &ndash; now, also Deputy Commander-of-Corps Farrington, as the insignia on
his USAES uniform proclaimed - was well-versed in the use of his powers, but
that feeling, that <i>memory</i> of dread, followed by living fire inside his
mind, had never gone away...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Neither had the instinctive
reaction to strike back &ndash; as hard, as viciously as possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The young man, lying asleep in
bed, suddenly blinked awake as that feeling of dread pulled him from sleep &ndash;
and then, began to burn inside his mind as a violent mental attack, easily as
powerful as the most brutal he'd ever experienced, made him scream before his
psi-screen deployed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>David Allen's pupils burned
with a brilliant blue light as his head turned to face the armored figure that
stood next to his bed, drawing back from where it had touched his forehead with
a single finger &ndash; a finger now engulfed in cosmic flame that burned like acid,
dissolving in an instant. "No. <u>I sleep when I want</u>. My room &ndash; my rules."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Like a creature out of a
Gothic horror film, David Allen telekinetically rose from the bed and slowly
turned to face the armored figure, which backed away as it began to project a
wildly vibrating wave of translucent energies at his head. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Twin beams of absolute white
suddenly pierced through the door of David Allen's room and scored deep marks
across the breast plate of the armor the figure wore, ceasing the figure's
attack as the death-light of David Allen's Prime Bolts began to fill the room
but then, suddenly shut down. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The door erupted into a cloud
of splinters as Kelly Springer and Maryann Lyter dove through and tackled the
figure in a headlong rush, hitting milliseconds after the lightning bolts
Fabian Nogura and Carolyn Field fired from the other side of the doorway struck
the armored faceplate and momentarily blinded the creature within!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The tall, lanky blonde and the
athletic girl with short, wheat-colored hair went flying through the entire
length of Gilmore Hall's third floor as the armored figure grasped them both by
the backs of their necks and simply flicked her wrists, sending them hurtling
off into the distance!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i>"<u>Die</u>, bitch!"<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>A sound that could only be a
scream exploded through the air as Zoey Robinson came through the window at
super-speed and rammed a shimmering resonance javelin down through a point
between the left shoulder and neck of the armored creature, forcing the
razor-sharp tip out through the right leg just above the knee!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Get clear, Zoey!" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The sound of another familiar
voice forced David Allen to focus past the sensation of crumpling into a heap
on his bed and throwing up (which happened at the first touch of the armored
figure's energy wave) to see Martin Peters come through the door, wearing an
Air Force uniform with single silver bars on the lapels and followed by a
waiflike girl of obvious Sikh descent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"You're history."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>A thick, fleshy gash began to
chew its way through the walls of reality, flooding the entire room in
blood-red illumination as it widened into a huge opening that seemed a cross
between a giant gaping wound and a portal to another reality &ndash; one that seemed
to act as a magnet upon the armored figure. "It's fighting the pull of 'The
Bleed!'" Martin called out. "Do it, Chandni!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>An impossibly intricate
pattern of arcane energy formed around the Sikh girl's wrist as she pointed at
the creature. "I banish you," she whispered, and the pattern swept forth to
carry the armored figure through the opening and into the void. "Begone from
this place."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The grotesque open resealed
itself as Jeffrey Brace and Carolyn Field lifted David Allen from his bed, each
wincing at the smell. "Well, at least you didn't drop a load in your shorts!"
the short, muscular cadet said, his trademark smile huge across his face.
"Let's stick him in the shower &ndash; quick!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Roman Vargas stepped into the
room behind Martin and Chandni Kaur, relief evident on the young Latino cadet's
face. "You were right &ndash; you got here just in time." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Martin sagged against a wall,
pulling a flash drive from his uniform and handing it to Roman as he slid down
upon a chair. "We did it &ndash; me and Kaur. Thank God we have an actual <i>cleric</i>
in the Corps of Cadets; I couldn't have gotten rid of it myself."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Chandni, a Cadet Second Class
with the beauty and demeanor of a china doll, sent her impossibly long
eyelashes fluttering at the compliment. "I could sense that it was an
extra-planar being. Banishing it was simple."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Roman looked down at the flash
drive Martin kept poking him with. "What's this?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Get this to the Commandant &ndash; now,
Cadet," Martin said, part of him hating to pull rank and yet knowing that Roman
understood. "Priority One. Consider this installation at DEFCON One. This is
not a drill. The Commandant will confirm it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Jeffrey!"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The cadet appeared at the tone in Roman's
voice. "Get this to the Commandant. Run all the red lights."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The flash drive - and Jeffrey
- was gone before the end of his sentence. "What's going on?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"In the last timeline, I
didn't bring Kaur, and David Allen blew half the campus apart fighting that
armored creature. The fight cost us far more lives than were lost in the
explosion; <i>Zero Area</i> was cut off for five hours, and that meant we lost
hundreds of cadets and thousands of other people." Martin's voice and posture
spoke worlds about the physical stress it took to physically traverse the
interdimensional void known as 'The Bleed' and hit a specific point in space,
let alone time. "I was two minutes off. I nearly didn't make it through."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Roman didn't waste time with
disbelief; Martin pulled a second flash drive from his uniform. "Bring up the
folder marked 'DAYLIGHT'."</p>

(David Allen was in a sweat suit, and the others had returned) and Martin had

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"<i>'DAYLIGHT &ndash; Story
background and timeline by 'The Angst Guy'? </i>What the hell is this?" Carolyn
snapped, a bit ruffled by the saved web page on the screen. "Is this some kind

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Without saying a word, Zoey
grasped Carolyn's shoulders as she turned her towards the gaping holes in the
walls of Gilmore Hall that led to the outside, and then turned her back to the
computer. "All right, then," she corrected herself, ignoring Zoey's cross glare.
"His power lets him see things from other realities. What do we do?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"One thing's for certain &ndash; we
keep an eye out for <i>'Chrona'</i> from now on," Maryann growled, flexing her
hand around the hilt of the K-Bar blade in the sheath on her right leg. "That
resonance javelin was a good call, Zoey, if she's some sort of time traveler
like this suggests &ndash; oh, stop smiling."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"She's just happy that she got

indecently pleased look resting on Zoey's face. "Thank God for this <i>'Roentgen'</i>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Not to mention 'John

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"First things first &ndash; read
this," Kelly said, scrolling down, unaware that David Allen was sending a
telepathic message several thousand miles away, warning his family about
everything. <i>"On Earth, the Industrial Age and its offspring (the Atomic Age,
the Space Age, and the Computer/Internet Age) end in a matter of minutes as
monstrous geomagnetic currents produced by solar storms completely destroy all

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The room went quiet as they

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Within the next five
minutes," Martin agreed. "You guys need to get moving if you're going to get
your families &ndash; I was lucky that I made it through The Bleed to give you even
this much of a head start. You've got just under three hours before Hell's
gates blow open. I wish I could help more."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"What do you mean?" Kelly
asked, as Martin stepped to the middle of the room and was encircled in a
column of blood-red energy. "Where are you going?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"To rescue my family and as

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The column of energy
disappeared, Martin along with it, and Roman turned to the others. "Carolyn &ndash;

everything, and have her collect all of our families from Denver to the Pacific
Northwest &ndash; her shields can carry and protect all of them-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Everyone turned to face
Jeffrey. "What's on that web page &ndash; if it's anywhere near correct &ndash; means we're
going to run the <i>Homestead</i> protocol." The others nodded; it was barely a
month before that <i>The Alliance</i>, all now Cadets First Class, had been
briefed on the high-level protocols that the Academy had in place for a myriad
number of vile and unthinkable circumstances. "I'm the only one fast enough to

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>As Jeffrey disappeared, Roman
turned to the rest. "Kelly &ndash; call Lindy and have her get back here <i><u>now</u></i>.
Anybody that she can grab and bring back in the next hour or so, then do that,
but get back here within the hour. Ian &ndash; stop being a statue with a dumb look.
Get down to the commo section and have them issue a recall order on all Cadets
Third Class immediately. Do it on my authority, and by the time they ask for
confirmation, Admiral Harriman will have everything rolling. Maryann, Zoey - go
find Castillo and the other precogs. Make sure they're all right, then get them
to <i>Zero Area</i> and secure those hourglass things. Carolyn &ndash; get over to
Cocking Hall. Put the <i>Phantom Eagles</i> on ready alert &ndash; the Commandant

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The female voice from behind
made the two male cadets turn as Julia Carlyle flew through the gaping hole,
her wings fluttering as she settled to the floor. "I can't believe you gave it
to <u>him</u>, Roman &ndash; I'd have been <u>worlds</u> better as the number two."</p>

forward and nodded at David Allen; both having healing abilities, they knew one
another from classes and field exercises. "I came with Lieutenant Peters and
Cadet Kaur &ndash; in case someone was hurt. Commander Vargas &ndash; I've studies the
Legion. Without Cadet Carlyle there, they have no healer, and even if they have

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Her eyes flicked over to David
Allen, who knew in an instant why she wanted to go. "I say let her go, if
Admiral Harriman signs off," he said, sharing a look with Julia. "She has a
point. She's already gone through all of her primary EMT certifications and
Level Two healer boards &ndash; any medical problems they'll have, she can fix or
learn how, very quickly &ndash; besides, God knows they'll need a <i><u>soldier</u></i>
there to show them how to do things right."</p>

doing that, get your things from your room. You won't be coming back."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Here." Julia took off the
wrist-communicator she wore, and tossed it to the other young woman. "When you
see Quinn Morgendorffer, that's for her. Tell her to keep her ears open &ndash; I'm
still a Legionnaire, too, and I might come calling, sooner or later."</p>

smile as she looked at the communicator &ndash; a smile that disappeared as David Allen
cut in. "You also need to tell them about that fast food place where their
mother- just tell Daria to do a wide-band psi-sweep for her mother. The power
is called 'telelocation - it's the same power that I have. According to this
other writer &ndash; <i>Brother Grimace</i> &ndash; she's got it already, but hasn't used
it yet. Tell her to hurry... if she doesn't use her power to find her mom-"</p>

"We're going active any minute now, you two, and it's going to be worse than we
can imagine."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Julia and David Allen both
began to speak, but were rendered mute by a single wave of Roman's hand. "Shut
'em," he snapped, with a touch of understanding in his voice. "You two need to
have words before we all get busy &ndash; and you <u>should</u> have done it long
ago. This is the last chance you'll have for small talk for a long time. Don't
waste it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Roman had barely cleared the
door before Julia moved forward to kiss David Allen; she melted into his arms
as they embraced, and they parted after a long, slow kiss that left them both
winded. "Don't ever say that you came back just for the chance to kiss me," he
said, as they held each other close. "I know you."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"I didn't," she replied. "Oh,
I came back for me. If anything happens to you, not only do I have to find
someone who's worth the bother of always being pawed on, but I'll have to work
extra hard to make sure that he's someone who'll annoy my parents."</p>
