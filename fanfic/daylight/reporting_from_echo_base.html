<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span lang=EN
style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>As reported earlier, unknown factors interfered
with the tesseract platform at USAES, which resulted in Cadre 2996 (and the unit
of USMC troops also assigned to reinforce the detail at Legion Tower under
Colonel - now General - Armalin) arriving in real-space just outside the city
of Chicago. We barely survived the near-complete destruction of the city and
the general area; it is my considered opinion that what remains of the area
known as Chicagoland be designated as a 'red zone', as only high-powered
metahumans could possibly survive the conditions that exist there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span lang=EN
style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>As I have reported in earlier dispatches, Cadre
2996 (later to be joined in-theatre by Cadres 2917 and 3335) and a force of
United States Military Command personnel had discovered a large cache of pre-<i><u>Zero
Hour</u></i> materials and supplies in the remains of the Fostoria Smarty-Mart.
To be more precise, we later discovered that the Fostoria Smarty-Mart was also
the regional supply and distribution center for the area; as such, vast
stockpiles of items were stored at this facility for distribution of additional
materials as needed to various other stores in the western part of Ohio within
a twelve- to eighteen-hour period. Upon examination of the entire underground
facility, we determined that the facility had been re-supplied no more than
five to seven days before <u>Zero Hour</u>; consequently, the facility was at
between 87% to 93% of its total storage capacity. The strategic value of this
facility cannot, therefore, be underestimated. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span lang=EN
style='mso-ansi-language:EN'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span lang=EN
style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>After realizing the value of this area, we acted
quickly to secure it and to keep the information out of the hands of all
non-essential personnel. We also felt that it would be advantageous to build a
permanent settlement; given the environmental conditions, the need for a
defensible position, a sanctuary for defenseless civilians, a means of
psychological impact upon rogue elements and a staging area for USMC elements,
we borrowed a page from the past.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span lang=EN

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span lang=EN
style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>As you can see, we built <i>a fort</i>. Built in
the space of nearly four months, <i><u>Echo Base</u></i> is constructed
directly over the storage depot, and posseses the advantages of a fusion of
medievial and modern technologies. We have the capacity to permanently shelter
over 1,000 citizens, as well as support a military force large enough to defend
the area. <i>Echo Base</i> has also begun to serve as a trading post for the
area; we have become a nexus for many throughout the area for a multitude of
goods and services, and the small community of <i><u>New Fostoria</u></i> has
arisen next to <i>Echo Base</i>. For example, we have eight doctors and a
number of other medical personnel who have survived <i>Zero Hour</i> and the
resulting chaos; they have formed the basis of our medical facility.We are even
fortunate enough to have two physicians from the University of Chicago College
of Medicine at Peoria, Il; they were near Fostoria when <i>Zero Hour </i>stranded
them. The benefits of having them include the fact that they have been able to
act as mentors in Lieutenant Farrington's medical training; he may actually
realize his desire to become a fully-trained M.D., in time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span lang=EN
style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>For some reason, we have had very little contact
with metahuman forces, and not a single active encounter with those forces.
Considering our information from other USMC bases and the activities of <i>The
Elite</i> and <i>Arcana</i> in North America, this is a source of ongoing
concern. It is almost as if they have all chosen, for some reason that we are unaware
of, to leave us alone. However, we have had frequent encounters with well-armed
criminal elements and two quasi-religious groups, all of which have proven to
be quite dangerous in their own way. One of the religious groups is known
simply as the <i>Conservatives</i>; they are a large group of scavengers who
have managed to build low-tech vehicles and effective weapons that they have
used to terrorize several counties. Their scavenger credo -- that of using
anything and everything they can get their hands on -- has led to our discovery
that the <i>Conservatives</i> are cannibals, eating even their own dead and the
bodies of their victims in order to survive. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span lang=EN

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span lang=EN
style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Of course, one wonders why they have named
themselves after a political ideology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Undoubtedly,
the name is both a play and a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ploy</i>; a
play on words and a ploy to sucker anyone encountering them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Little 'c' conservative stragglers that
survived <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Zero Hour</i> are given hope
that there is a remnant of survivors that share similar beliefs when they
encounter this dangerous mob; all too late do they learn the truth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span lang=EN
style='mso-ansi-language:EN'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span lang=EN
style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>The second group, which has proven to be far more
dangerous, refers to itself only as <i>'The Flock'. </i>This group seems to
have at the core of its ideology the complete elimination of all metahumans in
response to the events of <i>Zero Hour</i>, which they believe was caused
somehow by the existence of metahumans. We have found that they have brutally
tortured and killed many metahumans and 'meta-sympathizers', as they refer to
them; after an all-out assault on Echo Base in which we decimated the attacking
force, they have shifted tactics and made several attempts to infiltrate <i>Echo
Base</i> to kidnap members of our forces. This has led to several unfortunate
incidents &ndash; including one that I was personally involved in, where a female
member of <i>The Flock</i> tried to sway my affections and then deliver me to
her fellow cultists. If not for my powers and Lieutenant Farrington's
psi-abilities, I would not have survived the ordeal. Accordingly, we have
adjusted security protocols to compensate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span lang=EN
style='mso-ansi-language:EN'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span lang=EN
style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Our biggest problem, however, has been the
environment. The massive cloud cover caused by the Alaskan fire caused caused a
winter of such severity that it is a minor miracle that no one living at <i>Echo
Base</i> or in New Fostoria died from winter-related causes. (The lowering of
temperaures even before winter caused many problems, as well. We are also
subject now to suddenly-occuring, extreme weather events such as
'thundersnows'. These events are now even more dangerous due to the atmospheric
conditions, and a person could easily be killed if outside during these
storms.) Nevertheless, there were numerous illnesses and injuries. If not for
the addiditional colonization equipment brought to the base by Cadre 3335 (a <i>Project
Starseed</i> unit), the combined powers of our cadres, the metahuman allies
living with us and the sheer desire to survive, things could have been much
different. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span lang=EN

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span lang=EN
style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>It is at times such as this that the medievial
design of <i>Echo Base</i> has proven useful.During the most severe points of
the winter, the people took shelter inside <i>Echo Base</i> and the vast
underground shelters below the facility; also, many of the people here have
taken it upon themselves to perform jobs and duties (without being asked) that
one would find in any period structure of this ilk. For example, a large group
of young women have found the means and the time to weave elaborate blankets,
rugs, and other items - even tapestries for the walls; a group of men have
found several dogs and are in the business of breeding pups for pets, hunting
dogs, guard animals, and so forth. There are cooks, laundry workers (there is
an underground burrow where we have installed numerous washers, dryers, and
other laundry materials) - there is even a group of men and women who refer to
themselves as 'The Arrows'; these individuals pride themselves on going out in
even the harshest weather, hunting down wildlife, and bringing it back for the
most lavish of feasts. (For some unknown reason, the harsh weather has not affected
most of the animals as it has humans. Deer are especially plentiful, and have
become a staple of most survivors' diets in the area.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span lang=EN
style='mso-ansi-language:EN'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span lang=EN
style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>On a related note, the building of several
fireplaces within <i>Echo Base</i>, particularly the large fireplace within the
Great Hall in the main castle, has provided places for social gatherings that
have provided an unexpected morale boost for the personnel and citizens living
here. During the winter, a tradition has developed of evening gatherings in the
EM-shielded Great Hall, where people gather for various social activities; two
such activities of note are Wednesday evenings, where DVD movies are shown in
concert with the most current <i>Movietone News</i> newsreels detailing events
in the world. (My special thanks to the men and women who had the foresight to
come up with the recreation of an old idea, the technical expertise to create
hand-crank cameras with modern film and the bravery to carry out the dangers in
bringing news to the people.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span lang=EN

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span lang=EN
style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>The second activity of note is Saturday; it seems
that 'date night' is a tradition that will never die. Young people (those from
their late teens to mid-twenties &ndash; the demigraphic for the old MTV) frequent
the Great Hall (and the alcoves adjoining it) on Saturday nights for the
age-old tradition of 'reindeer games', as it were. As almost all the members of
the cadres are in the appropriate age bracket, there have been more than a few
times when verbal reprimands have been given for conduct unbecoming. Given our
circumstances, however, I have relaxed restrictions on USMC personnel. We are,
after all, part of the community.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span lang=EN
style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Because of the ongoing threat of <i>The Flock</i>
and the <i>Conservatives</i>, only the immediate area around <i>Echo Base</i>
can be said to be secure. Travel at night outside of New Fostoria is strongly
discouraged, and movement outside the secure zone should be considered only by
heavily-armed groups. We are currently planning strikes against both groups; as
soon as we find their primary bases of operation, we will begin sweep and clear
missions to put down both groups. Once that is done, I feel confident that the
threat level in this area will decrease considerably. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The shivering, dirty mass of people
began to move closer as Zoey Robertson jammed a thermal javelin solidly into
the ground; a soft blister of reddish light lit the area from the seven-foot
long javelin as heat began to flow outwards into the large chamber. "I'll see
about getting supplies for all of you," the young woman said, her unusually
kind tones calming the people as much as her words as she set a second javelin
thirty feet away from the first. "Do you have anyone who needs immediate

punk's head wide open with it, took his gun and started shooting. I'd drop
someone, grab their guns and keep going, and I just kept shooting until they
were all dead or running &ndash; then I grabbed Tate's 30-06 and picked off the last
