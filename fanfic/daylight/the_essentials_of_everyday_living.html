<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"I don't suppose there's any
chance of everyone being reasonable about this, is there?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>There were twenty-three of
them in the cavernous underground storeroom &ndash; four metahumans, and nineteen
normal people, all armed with a hodgepodge of weapons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Of the metahumans<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>- two were African-American girls in their
late teens, and so similar in appearance that they had to be sisters. The third
was also female &ndash; one of those young, exotic beauties of indeterminate origin
seen only on television or at the most exclusive clubs... when there were clubs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The last of the four was a
lean <i>bishonen</i> of a boy with long, black hair, night-blue eyes and a
smile born to distract females of all ages. The fact that he was a centaur &ndash;
with an energy bow currently fitted with five arrows - also drew attention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>First Lieutenants David Allen
Farrington and Rafael Vargas shared a glance; Rafael motioned with his hands,
and the quintet of USMC troops with them lowered their weapons. "We can be
reasonable," the young Latino officer said, holstering his weapon. "Who are you
four?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"We're not interested in being
drafted into the new army, that's for sure," the exotic-looking girl said, her
sparkling eyes catching Rafael's attention &ndash; especially after he noticed that
her eyes were actually violet crystals. <i>That's a hell of a power &ndash; she's
only the second person I've seen with a version of it.</i> "We've heard how the
USMC is open for business, drafting people to be bully boys protecting the rich
people or breeding stock &ndash; it's like <i>28 Days Later</i> and <i>Soylent Green</i>
rolled all up in one!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The girl turned her eyes to
David Allen. "You don't think we know what <u>you</u> are? Almost very psychic
we've run across is getting his or her God complex on - you think we don't know
what you'll do if you get the chance?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Actually surprised that his
fellow officer said nothing, Rafael took a step forward. "You said you wanted
to be reasonable. Okay. Let's be reasonable."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The younger of the sisters
nodded; the centaur lowered his bow, the weapon disappearing as he did so, and
the crystalline eyes of the exotic girl splintered outwards and faded away as
she stepped forward. "Okay. Let's not fight. We can all use supplies out of
this storage; how do we do this without things getting sticky?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"I'd say that your being
reasonable was a really good start."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The four rogue metas turned to
see Maryann Lyter, Carolyn Field and Zoey Robertson perched high above them;
Maryann's eyes, white with power, returned to normal as she landed in front of
the centaur. "So &ndash; when was the last time you and your friends tied on the feed
bag?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>She extended her hand. "I'm
Maryann. What's your name?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The centaur looked at her
before reaching out. "I'm Boone."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>*****</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The skies seemed to open up
and pour rain down in unseasonably cold torrents over the ruins of what had
once been Fostoria, Ohio.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The seven trucks that carried
the members of <i>The Alliance</i> and a squad of USMC regular troops were
hidden inside the underground storage area of the Fostoria Smarty-Mart; as
Zoey, Fabian Nogura and half of the troops stood guard (with Fabian using his
powers to ease the downpour around the entrance), the others set down to make
friends in the old-fashioned way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>They cooked dinner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>*****</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"The thing is, everything that
I could ever need to cook with is down here somewhere," Jeffrey said, removing
a sheet of dinner rolls from an oven he had fired up (with the assistance of
Carolyn, who was wearing a modulator cuff that allowed her to act as a
generator for the appliances, as well as recharge several power cells) and
sliding them into a warmer. "Everything should be ready in about fifteen
minutes. Pizza rolls?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>He set out a pair of large
bowls filled with the snacks for the civilians and Galena before taking a bowl
over to the sisters, who whispered their thanks and then dove in; Jeffrey
walked over to Boone the centaur, who was lounging comfortably on a pair of
king-sized mattresses and box springs laid out for him by Maryann, and offered
him a large bag of Corn Squares snack mix.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Thank you," Boone said,
allowing Maryann to place several pillows beneath his head and shoulders and
not caring that she let her eyes run over his bare chest... or occasionally, down
further, as she covered him with a very large, heavy woolen blanket. "Whenever
we found food, I made sure they ate &ndash; they need to keep up their strength, and
I can &ndash; well, I can eat things that they can't. It's not the best way to live,
though."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>David Allen had used his
telekinesis to unwrap several comfortable chairs, as well as several other
items that the combined group could use, and then cleared out an area that he
(the team healer) and Zoey (a certified EMT) could use as a makeshift medical
ward. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"I'm going to get Zoey back in
here in a few minutes, and we'll start checking out your people for any medical
problems they might have," he told Boone, two large medical bags in hand as he
turned to the med ward. "I just need a few more minutes, and if we could have
some hot, running water and working toilets..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Rafael nodded; moments later,
while Carolyn and Kelly Springer went to work repairing the bathrooms (Kelly,
the tall blonde, smirking as she saw the look on her friend's face when Rafael
told them to fix the plumbing &ndash; "You're the engineers - rig something up.") and
Lindy Lomard and some of the troops fired up a series of portable heaters to
warm up the area, Rafael sat down to talk with Boone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"We've all been together on
the streets for the past couple of years," Boone told them, letting his head
fallback on the pillows; it was tiring for him to keep his head up while
talking, and it was obvious that he was weak from hunger. "My people ran me
off."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Maryann nodded in an
understanding way as Boone continued; Rafael was going to have her (as another
engineer) help with the plumbing, but the way Boone reacted to her presence
convinced him to have her stay. "I can't go out in the daytime for the most
part &ndash; I can change to normal human form for a while, maybe four hours at most,
but this is my real form &ndash; so working a real job is out. I wasn't about to go
hungry or freeze, so I used my power to get what I needed and find places to
stay."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"With that bow and arrow?"
Lindy sounded a bit skeptical.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"No &ndash; that's a gift from
Royal." He motioned over to the sisters and the exotic-looking girl, who were
being entertained by Jeffrey's chef routine. "The sisters &ndash; the older one's
Regan, the younger one's Royal. Regan's a psi &ndash; telepathy, empathy, TK; your
guy's a whole world apart from her in terms of power but she can sense people
with powers from miles and miles away &ndash; and Regan's like her, but she can give
people psi-powers. Me - she gave me the power to create that bow."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"The bow's not your power,
then?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Boone lifted his head to look
at Rafael. "No. I can turn invisible and intangible &ndash; I can make specific parts
of my body intangible only, too - and when I'm intangible, I can run on the
air. I also don't have to breathe, and anybody I take with me doesn't have to
breathe, either. That's been handy, the last few weeks since &ndash; what did you
call it?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i>"Zero Hour,"</i> Maryann
said. "For all that matters &ndash; the moment the world that we knew died."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Tell me about it." Boone lay
his head back down. "We were in Detroit when it happened. Galena &ndash; that's the
other girl's name &ndash; we had gotten up early to scam some breakfast from the
local Donut World. We came back with a couple of dozen donuts, coffee, and some
milk for the two rats; everybody had finished eating, and we were about to bolt
when everything started to burn or explode."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>He took a breath. "I had snuck
all of us into the luxury suite of this hotel &ndash; it's a dodge we do all of the
time. The sisters scan the place for empty rooms, everybody climbs on my back
and we just walk right through the place up to the room &ndash; and if anybody ever
catches up, somebody like a maid, Galena gets a small rock and turns it into a
ruby or emerald for them. They leave us alone, then, and bring us things."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"If she can make diamonds,
then why were you guys living on the streets?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Boone gave Lindy &ndash; who had
reappeared and was listening in - a look of searing scorn as he lifted his
right front leg and waved it at her. "Cloppity. Clop. Clop. Cloppity. Clop.
Clop." He shook his head. "We didn't get the same deal as you Academy types &ndash;
yeah, we heard about you guys, especially your psychic. Where's the redhead
with the wings, by the way? From what I heard, I thought those two didn't move
too far apart."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Lindy's eyes widened, Roman
coughed, and Maryann's eyes twinkled as she tried not to laugh. "She's off
doing other things."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"As for Galena &ndash; you keep
coming up with precious gems, and people start looking for you if you're not
careful. Galena wasn't careful. She's hot, and she can do things with crystals
you wouldn't believe, but she's not the fastest boat on the lake, you know? The
sisters were on their own because they were living like Harry Potter before
Hogwarts &ndash; both parents got killed and the relatives were..." His voice trailed
off. "Regan's power came up first, she kind of kick-started her sister's
powers, and they ran off. They found me, and then Galena, and here we are. After
what happened, we occasionally found people who needed someone and didn't mind
that we were different. They found you, too."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"It's an accident that we're
here," Maryann told him. "We were being sent to Maryland &ndash; our former commander
has a friend there, and we were being sent to beef up his forces. Something
went wrong with the transport, and we ended up just outside Chicago."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Rafael again whispered silent
thanks for his power of altering probabilities; he had no doubt that, except
for his power, the gateway &ndash; the CME's affecting it as they went through -
would have dropped them directly into downtown Chicago. "The way my power works
&ndash; combined with what you said about your psi finding us - that might be what
happened. We barely made it away from the blast zone."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Then you saw what it was
like," Boone said. "We barely had time to grab the few things we had before the
entire place went up &ndash; they all got on and I ran through the wall." He took a
breath. "I ran as high and as fast as I could; it was like something out of a
bad movie..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>He put his head back down; it
was obvious that he was incredibly tired. "We've been moving ever since &ndash; find
some food and water, a safe place to stay for a few hours, dodge the freaks and
losers and crazies that managed to survive, help out people and bring them
along so we can protect them... the things that people are doing to one another
out there, it's the first time I've ever been glad that I was born like this.
We'd all probably be dead otherwise. Even with our powers, we've lost half of
the people that we were watching. There are other people out there with powers,
and you wouldn't believe the miniature armies that have sprung up already..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The leader of <i>The Alliance</i>
stood up. "Boone &ndash; you're tired, and God knows what you've been exposed to out
there since things went up," he said, leaning forward. "Just get some rest.
We'll get you and your people back up to speed, and then, decide on what we're
