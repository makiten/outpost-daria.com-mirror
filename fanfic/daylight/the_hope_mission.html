surprisingly clear, given the worldwide disasters that had polluted the
atmosphere and darkened the skies, increasing the severity of the holocaust
that had already wiped out over five billion people.</p>

one hundred and twenty meters in diameter and circular, with eight metal

spheres silently separated from the circular craft. It drifted slowly away;
thirty seconds after separation, the sphere separated, revealing a circular

six- and ten o'clock positions on the satellite. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Quinn thought dark and unholy
thoughts about Bump &ndash; her sister's adopted kitten (although she still wasn't
sure who adopted who). As far as she was concerned, the Adlers &ndash; Derek and
Karen &ndash; didn't give that little hell-spawn to Daria... that furry, white-pawed
wraith simply brought a new manager onto its staff. </p>

through Quinn's hair. "I know that look, copper-top," she said, seeing a

away, "but I can get that anytime. What's in the cup?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Quinn turned back to give
Danielle a look that combined equal parts pouting and glare &ndash; <i>and how she
can do that, I'll never know,</i> the dark-haired young woman thought quite
loudly. "Okay, I'll tell you," she said, letting go of the cup as Quinn downed
it quickly before holding it out for a refill. "You remember a few months ago,
when those guys brought that tiny herd of cattle in, in exchange for a safe
place to stay? Well, long story short &ndash; when they took some of them down for
meat, I got hold of some of the sheep intestines and bladders. I treated them,
figured out a way to mass-produce &ndash; well, more or less &ndash; the material, and I've
been making condoms."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Come on, Quinn," Danielle
said, pouring her more soda. "You're a big girl &ndash; and there's an important
reason to make them, too. There's been a big rise in STD's, and it's not as if
I can synthesize all of the antibiotics and inhibitor drugs they had before <i>Zero
Hour</i>. A lot of them &ndash; well, if I actually knew what they were, or had
samples, it would be a different story. If I were Sherrie Klein, it would be a
whole new story, because she could just create new ones &ndash; but they have her
sequestered at <i>Zero Area</i>, coming up with things to bring humanity back
up on its feet. Fighting the clap isn't high on the list."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>She stroked Quinn's hair as
she continued. "There's also the matter of birth control. With al the pollution
and contaminants in the environment... well, having babies isn't exactly the
safest thing to do &ndash; at least, not for a while. Those condoms are saving people
from a whole world of heartbreak, and medical problems no one really wants to
think about. The birth defects that could &ndash; that have been occurring now, with
the way things are..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Quinn took Danielle's hand, knowing
that as part of the few persons at Legion Tower with actual advanced medical
training &ndash; and the only metahuman with healing skills within a couple of
hundred miles of Lawndale &ndash; Danielle had seen some hideous things since the day
that humanity had almost died out... especially in regards to childbirth and
infant care. A normal, reasonably safe delivery and a healthy child afterwards
was actually a reason for celebration now &ndash; and the makeshift cemetery at the
far end of the quarry was occupied by far, far too many tiny occupants...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"A lot more than you'd
believe. It's just synthesizing the original samples from the sheep, and then &ndash;
oh, you don't want to hear the gooey details." Danielle brushed her hair back
'It's not as if I'm profiteering, Quinn &ndash; and the fact is, the ones I
synthesize are actually safer than some of the older ones... We've been giving
them out as part of the pay that workers get, if they want them, and they're
also a hot trading item."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"So you traded for diet soda?

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Well, I was talking to that
trooper that you knew in school &ndash; Sergeant White &ndash; and he was talking about all
the dates he took you on." Danielle smiled at the look that appeared on Quinn's
face. "He was part of the detail that escorted me to <i>Camp Defiance</i>, just
outside Langley, and we talked a bit. Boy, did he have a thing for you."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Quinn finished her second cup
of soda as images of Jaime White flashed through her mind. "<u>Had</u>? Well,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"I think he just realized that
competing with an officer for the hand of an attractive Legionnaire wasn't a
fight he wanted to get into," Danielle said. "Or maybe it's the fact that all
of those young women that see him as their strapping young hero have distracted
him. You should see the girls he's pulling in now &ndash; I mean, if I wasn't seeing
someone, I'd be out there chasing after the girls with him! He's an excellent
wingman, and <i>funny-!</i> He can keep any best friend occupied while you seal
the deal with someone you're interested in..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Quinn pulled her hand back,
crossed her arms and gave her girlfriend a glance that should have left powder
burns on the wall behind Danielle, who laughed at the Legionnaire's attitude.
"Oh, come on! I'm talking about the first night <i><u>we</u></i> snuck off
together! Don't you remember how the sergeant started doing that comedy
routine, doing jokes about everything and everybody in sight? No one even
noticed we had left!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Danielle saw how the jealously
flowed out of Quinn &ndash; but she wasn't about to let her off the hook yet. "It's a
good thing, too, Quinn, because you're entirely too loud. I don't mind at all,
when we're in your nice, soundproofed room &ndash; but do I have to remind you of
that time when we were in the medical center that night and the General came
charging in with the security detail, because they thought someone was killing
us both?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The deep, burning blush that
covered Quinn's entire body made Danielle laugh out loud. "So you do remember.
Anyway &ndash; he got four two-liters of diet soda and a case of root beer from a
scrounger who works the area around the camp for twenty condoms, two magazines
for a M9 pistol, and a box of 9mm ammo. He gave me half of the diet soda and a
six-pack or root beer for fifty condoms."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Quinn tried not to fixate on
the idea of cold soda with her dinner in a few hours. "So that's why the
General's been so happy the past week."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"The General told Jaime &ndash; I call
him that off-duty &ndash; that if they run across anyone else with root beer for
trade, to offer them a PFT if they have it in bulk," Danielle replied.
"Basically the same deal we've been making for viable medical supplies &ndash; ammo,
light weapons, or even a full-power M2. He <u>really</u> wants more root beer."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"So, that's how you kept him
from screaming bloody murder after he shooed me out of the medical ward," Quinn
said. "You gave him that bag of root beer candies you had!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"And, I promised him that I'd
talk David Allen into digging up a case of root beer." Danielle almost laughed
when she remembered how she did so. "Of course, being a complete and total
bastard, he's been teleporting two cans of the stuff in every Friday night for
the past six weeks &ndash; and to top it all off, he sent the empty box <i>first. </i>Kind
of explains why he and Julia get along so well."</p>

will not seek to lessen your trials, your suffering, or your losses by saying
that I understand what you have lived through over the past eighteen months,
for all of you listening have been witness to an event unimaginable by any who
have not experienced for themselves what can only be described as the death of
cultures, of nations, of a world forever lost. I will not demean that which all
of you now endure as your way of life by suggesting even for a moment that I
can somehow envision those struggles; I will not patronize any of you by saying
that things for you will be better, now that the solar disturbances have
ceased, for we all know that is not to be &ndash; not for years, not for decades or
centuries, and perhaps, never again. The lives you once had are now a part of
history. The world that you once knew now belongs to the ages."</i></p>

broken only by sporadic sniffling, the shuffling of feet, and the quiet weeping
of many who were listening to President Obama's address<i>. "I speak of these
things not to reawaken wounds old and new or to revisit the horror of your
recent past and your present, but to remind all of you listening now that
despite everything that you have suffered through &ndash; <u>you have survived</u>.
Through unspeakable cataclysmic events, through the burning of continents,
though the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse have walked the lands you call home
unchecked and touched each and every single one of you, forever changing all
that you know and that which you are &ndash; <u>you have survived</u>. At that place
where the road to Perdition forever ends, at the blackened gates of Hell
itself, you have all stood and held the line. With a profound determination,
with courage beyond imagination, you have chosen to stand and begin life anew &ndash;
and today, I am proud to tell you that we stand with you. Let it be known that
on this date, the Untied States of America and her allies have chosen to stand
with the men and women of your world, and provide any and all forms of

with cheering, but others quickly quieted them down as President Obama
continued. <i>"This is only the first of many, many excursions to your world,
which will provide humanitarian relief for you and yours. We will provide the
means for you to rebuild areas in which you may restart safe, secure
communities, free from disease, the climactic changes affecting your world for
decades to come, and from the collapse in society which has allowed the worst
in humanity to rise from the darkness and thrive. We will assist you in every
way imaginable in order to begin to shape your world in the visions that you
and your people have chosen, rising from the ashes in order to build a future
that pays tribute to those lost; one that gives hope to your children and all
those yet to come afterwards that your sacrifices were not in vain, and proves
to one and all that this race of Man shall not perish from this Earth. On this
day, on two worlds, let these words ring out so that all may hear them and
rejoice: 'You are not alone anymore.' From this day forth and forevermore &ndash; you
will never be alone. God bless you, and God watch over you all."<o:p></o:p></i></p>
