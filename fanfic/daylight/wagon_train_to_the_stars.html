<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Lily Kressley (only her
parents and her Nana called her 'Lillian') stood in the stadium-sized
underground area jokingly called 'the Gate Room' by the cadets at the United
States Academy of Extranormal Studies, and adjusted the equipment she wore over
her fatigue uniform before her fingers reached up to stroke the darkened bar on
her lapel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i>First Lieutenant Kressley</i>,
the former Cadet First Class thought, her head spinning as she remembered being
presented her degree in meteorology and commissioned not fifteen minutes ago -
and then, being given her first (her only, a little voice said sourly)
assignment by the United States Air Force. <i>You will report to Demarcation
Area Alpha for immediate deployment and permanent resettlement to the Eastern
United States. You will proceed to establish a secure long-term habitat from
which to begin receiving potential settlers in order to create a community in
which to maintain the American way of life. If you encounter other U.S. forces
within your legitimate chain of command, you will defer to them in all military
matters, save those orders which would inhibit or override your standing
primary assignment. You will act in all ways possible to ensure the survival of
the human species, including any viable possibility of procreation of future
generations.</i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Great. Go out, homestead a
piece of land, raise the American flag, salute anybody with greater rank but
shoot them if they want to use you to make his or her own little fiefdom
outside the boundaries of what's lawful, and after everything's set up, settle
down and have lots of kids. I thought I'd at least get to see another planet, that's
all &ndash; and to ride in a spaceship &ndash; God, now I'll never know what it feels like
to have the world pressing down on you during takeoff...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The luminous, shorthaired
blonde (she actually preferred it very long, and had to cut it constantly to
keep it at this length) looked around the room at the six other cadets who were
going with Tiffany Blum-Deckler to Maryland &ndash; to the famous <i>Legion Tower</i>.
<i>I wonder if Trent Lane is there?</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>She felt a quiver of girlish
excitement as the image of the tall, lanky brother of the Legion's first leader
danced in her mind &ndash; <i>no, he does more than dance, if I have anything to say
about it</i>. Lillian smiled; since the Legion's visit five months ago, Trent
had been the focus of a great many of her fantasies and dreams. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i>I didn't get a chance to
get near him, thanks to Sherrie Klein. Even before The Alliance became a big
thing around here, she's always been a headliner. If she touches it, comes near
it or even looks at it, she can upgrade it, find a means to defend it from
anything or find a way to stop it in its tracks. If the world weren't about to
end in about two hours... well, five years from now, she would have been a
billionaire. At <u>least</u> a billionaire. As it is now, she'll be one of the
few people who will find a way out of this for the human race.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:233.25pt'>All I do is control the
weather or reverse weather effects, I have an innate awareness of the
environment around me &ndash; oh, and magic can't hurt me. I wonder who came up with
that addition to my DNA?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Her pale blue eyes moved
around the area, focusing on the other members of <i>Training Cadre 3011</i> &ndash;
although since they had all entered the Elite Academy, they weren't as close as
they had been. <i>We're definitely not as close as the guys in <u>The Alliance</u>
&ndash; Field's a Phantom Eagle, and she <u>still</u> stays with her cadre. It works,
though &ndash; everybody knows that when the Legion was here, 2996 beat them like
red-haired stepchildren - There's <u>Hermes</u>!<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>She smiled at Charles Herman,
a wiry Black cadet who also wore lieutenant's bars on his uniform. Nicknamed
'Hermes' because of his love of Greek mythology (he was also an excellent
storyteller, and spent as much time as he could with the small children at the
Academy day-care center) and his speed as a runner &ndash; he was a star on the
Academy track team, and was considering trying out for a spot on the U.S.
Olympic team. <i>He's going to be the heavy gun on the team.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Lily remembered watching
Hermes' powers in action &ndash; the ability to generate fire with different effects:
white-hot standard flames, a flaming blue destructive energy called 'acid
flame' by his friends that could chew through heavy metals, armor or even
energy fields, given enough time, searing green plasma fire that he could
project underwater or in a vacuum (where it also allowed him to survive without
help), scarlet flames that could affect only intangible objects and made him
intangible (not to mention scaring the hell out of people when he walked
through walls like that), purple-hued flames that could incinerate anything
inorganic or non-living without harming living things in its path, and black
flame that affected mystical forces . <i>He can even protect himself and fly
with an energy sheath of any color flame around himself.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Standing next to Hermes was
Fred Nunez, the Latino-American tech-specialist for the team, and probably one
of the most important members of the group. <i>He can talk to or control any
kind of any sort of technology or mechanical device, take any solid materials
and build upon those machines to make new machines with a completely new purpose,
or even reconstruct destroyed technology and machines. From what they've told
us &ndash; he's going to be very busy</i>. <i>Really busy - creating air scrubbers
for our underground habitat, the thermal generator for primary power, protein
re-sequencers for food &ndash; and if he doesn't end up trying to build some sort of
Road Warrior-type vehicles, I'll eat rocks. 'Gearhead' doesn't even begin to
describe him...<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"So, did you bring your box of
condoms?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Yeah &ndash; both of them," she
said sarcastically, not looking up from checking the M4 assault rifle she had
slung from her uniform as Sidney Simon &ndash; 'Simple Simon', as she was known
around the Academy &ndash; came up to her. "Of course, we know that you'll use your
powers to create as many condoms as you need." <i>Tramp.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The willowy, dark-haired
cadet, whose dark eyes twinkled as she looked over the other cadets &ndash; and Lily
shook her head as she felt Sidney's eyes move over her approvingly &ndash; then
tossed the pair of duffel bags she had on the back of the heavy truck that
carried hundreds of pounds of supplies. "Five deuce and a halfs, and only six
of us are going, besides the Dragon Princess? Sounds a bit light &ndash; and who's
going to unload these things?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"That would be me. I loaded
them up, I'll unload them."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Lily smiled by the way Sidney
winced at the sound of Chris &ndash; <i>Christine</i> &ndash; Blum's voice, and the two
young women saw the petite Jewish cadet, who was eerily identical in appearance
to Kirsten Dunst (how the hell does a girl with a Jewish name end up with hair
and eyes like that? Lily once again wondered) drop from the back of the truck. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Try to keep your pants on
until you've helped build an underground chasm for us to live in and made a
geothermal vent for us to generate power, Ensign." Chris' green eyes flared,
and the two young women remained silent. "You need to respect others and the
uniform you wear &ndash; since you obviously have no respect for yourself &ndash; or I <u>will</u>
pound you straight down into the ground that you control. Understand?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Yes, ma'am." Sidney saluted
the young woman who wore the bar of a First Lieutenant, after she left, she
sighed. "Damn," she said, watching her leave. "If she wasn't a telepath and
telekinetic &ndash; and a <u>strong</u> one &ndash; I'd have comments for her."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"She can hear your thoughts

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Yeah, well, that's a lesson
for you," Sidney smiled. "Never sleep with someone in your training cadre if
you both get drunk off fermented fruit juice you find, if you both get trapped
in a supply bunker for a few days during a freak snowstorm in Antarctica and you've
both taken big doses of 'flush' beforehand. She'll take it personally when she
finally sobers up &ndash; especially if she really got into it during the
festivities. Until she freaked and did her 'It never happened' attitude, our
internship year down there at Mcmurdo was <i><u>great</u></i>." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Thank God you didn't try that
with Field, McClure or any of the other cadets who went down with you for their
internship." <i>Thank God I spent my year at The Weather Channel. All I had to
do there was dodge Jim Cantore's quick hands, and dodge the occasional twister
out in Tornado Alley without using my powers openly.</i> <i>At least I'll be
able to make things out there a bit easier on people... if things were different,
I'd have become the world's best meteorologist. Not that having great legs
doesn't help out &ndash; but I'd have loved doing it.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Maybe if she had to TA
classes she was in, her opinion would be different." Sidney let a long breath flow
from her as she brushed a wayward lock of hair from her eyes. "She's vindictive
and snotty, she carries herself like she's a royal, and she's as dense as a
constipated lead block!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Sidney turned as Hermes called
her name, and went over as Joe Durance stepped through the side of the truck
where Lily was standing. "If it helps, Lily &ndash; she did rank higher in her
Starseed certifications than anybody in our year who tested for them," the
boyish-looking Marine Second Lieutenant said, going solid and becoming visible
next to her. "Just because she forgets everything the uniform represents the
moment it hits the bedroom floor... hey, look on the bright side. You know that
she'll have babies almost as soon as the protection she has runs out, and that
means she'll be a frontier mom and out of our hair."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"That's just it &ndash; I don't
think she does, not for a long time. She wants to make sure she has a lot of

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The young cadet, awarded his
dual degrees in advanced physics and astronomy just before he and the others
were commissioned earlier, shook his head. "You don't really understand what's

can make it &ndash; and then, keep digging."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Our orders have changed,
too," Chris said, coming back over to them as Sidney drifted back into earshot.
"We're <u>all</u> now going to Legion Tower with Ensign Todds, to act as a
supplemental metahuman force under Colonel Armalin. We're going to reinforce
the Tower, and create a supplemental underground habitat adjoining the existing
underground levels that can form the basis of a new community for survivors.
I've got instructions for him, once we get there."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The others nodded. "If it
wasn't like this, this would be a cool assignment," Sidney said, leaning
against the truck; Lily shook her head, knowing that she still harbored a
slight resentment against Julia Carlyle for being chosen as the first cadet to
go to the Legion as part of the fledgling <i>USAES Student Liaison Program &ndash; or
for the fact that David Allen's never given her a moment's glance. Sorry, Sid &ndash;
the poor boy's been seeing red for the past ten years.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>A giant flash filled the room,
and the cadets heard several truck engines roar to life; they all moved to the
front of the truck to see a line of five trucks &ndash; each occupied by two cadets
and a Marine, all in full tactical gear &ndash; as they moved towards the giant
section of the wall that looked like the largest plasma-screen TV any of them
had ever seen. "Hey, there's Jacks!" Joe said, his eyes lighting up &ndash;and before
the others could stop him, he had run across the area to the passenger side of
the second truck in line. "Jacks!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Jacklyn Ward, a female Ensign
with the same youthful looks as Joe, smiled as he hopped up on the truck.
"Sorry, Marine, this truck's full."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Really? I see that <u>someone's</u>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The freshly minted Ensign at
the steering wheel and the Gunnery Sergeant who sat in the middle seat sighed
as Jacks and Joe shared a surprisingly chaste kiss. "They're sending us to
Never-Never Land, in Nevada," she said, smiling as they parted. "I think I
might have stories to tell, next time we see each other."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Well, look at you &ndash; Miss
Fancy-Pants!" Joe smiled, his slight Georgian accent coming through. "Girl
teases me about the Legion, and she's one of the few of us who's actually going
to get to see aliens." His voice grew somber. "You be careful out there. What
did we learn in VR?"</p>

Sailor Moon-shot." The way she mooned the Vegas Strip from a hotel room &ndash; her
buttocks glowing a bright yellow as her disintegration powers dissolved the
windows and became a makeshift beacon that drew attention from miles away &ndash; was
a treasured memory from the summer before they parted to do their internships.
Joe had spent a year at the National Reconnaissance Office learning about the
special deep-space satellites that were actually more advanced than Hubble, and
made up a vital part of Earth's early-warning system, while Jacks, a former <i>Phantom
Eagle</i> &ndash; won what most cadets considered better than the lottery: a year
with the U.S. Secret Service, on the Presidential Detail.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Jacks blushed a very deep red,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Joe hopped off the truck as a
whistle blew, and he watched as the line of trucks began to drive into the
gateway and disappeared in flashes of light. "Shame that they didn't let them

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Everyone turned as Fred spoke;
an unusually quiet person, he only spoke when necessary or in cases when no one
else would have dared to. "They decided to only send whole cadres out. Sucks.
That's why Todds is probably taking so long &ndash; they're getting 5035 ready to
come out with her." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Almost as Fred finished
speaking, a group of eight cadets &ndash; Danielle Todds in the middle of the pack &ndash;
entered the Gate Room, each hefting a duffel bag, their service rifles and
other parcels. Behind them were three cadets with handcarts, each loaded down
with duffel bags and several hard-shell cases. "Cadre 5035 reporting as
ordered," one of the male cadets said, the stripes of a sergeant on his
sleeves. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Load up," Chris told him; as
the new arrivals began loading their things on the last truck in line, Lillian
noticed that all of the cadets wore sergeant's stripes except for Danielle; she
wore the bars of a Warrant Officer. <i>Healers always come out with rank &ndash; if

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Danielle nodded; she grabbed a

a cart, and trotted behind Lily as the older girl went to the second truck in

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Hermes slid into the driver's
seat as the girls got in; seat belts were fastened, and Lily noticed that
Danielle's eyes were slightly wide as the trucks roared to life and drove into
position in front of the gateway. "It's a tesseract," she said, giving an
obviously nervous Danielle a smile. "Didn't you ever take any of the courses or
the tests?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"I-I volunteered," she said,
blushing at he sudden nervousness. "They &ndash;the Legion &ndash; they don't have anyone
with medical or healing skills there. I volunteered to go &ndash; I've passed all of

voice passed. "I can help."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Danielle looked about the cab
of the truck, and her eyes settled upon a patch on the right shoulder of
Hermes' fatigues &ndash; a patch with three old-style covered wagons on a trail of
stars moving through space, and a starfish with three eyes and four tentacles
waving from a planet it stood on in the lower left-hand corner. "What's that?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"You ever watch the old <i>Star

he used whenever he told stories to the kids. "Well, when the guy who created
the show, he wanted the guys at the network to be able to immediately get an
idea in their heads of what he wanted to do with the show &ndash;you, big adventure

forward into a new frontier &ndash; you know, like the old pioneers who went out West
