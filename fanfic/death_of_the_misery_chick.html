Daria Morgendorffer was the star of a popular show on the MTV network, and
a world-renowned celebrity. But did someone plot her untimely demise?

She was... the sort of girl I'd been looking for all of my life, and never
been able to find. Until then. I was never happier. I just looked at her
eyes, and I felt electrified. Like someone'd just recharged all of my batteries
and given me a push. I was head over heels in love for this girl I'd just
met.

Morgendorffer was my kind of girl. Sure, she was rather nice, but also completely
unafraid to speak her mind, and to do whatever the hell she wanted, whenever
the hell she wanted. She didn't take [bleep] from anyone - she dished it
out.

Good evening, and welcome to Sick Sad World. I'm Robin Kylie. Tonight, we

<P ALIGN=Center>
The show Daria first began airing in the mid-1990s, a spinoff of the popular
MTV franchise Beavis and Butthead. At first, the cast was a fairly close-knit
community, with the exception of two people - Daria and the woman who played
her sister, Julia Michaelis.

Trent runs by the camera, making a funny face. Daria and Helen are having
a discussion in the back central part of the screen, and they both laugh.
In the front, Jane and Jake are speaking. Everyone looks happy and in a good
mood, except for Quinn, who's glaring at Daria surreptitiously.

In the early days, this was without a doubt the most fun I'd ever had doing
television. Almost everyone got along great, excluding Daria and Julia. At
least they weren't openly hostile. There was never any fighting on the set,
during those first two seasons.

JULIA
<P ALIGN=Center>
Daria was the sort of person I disliked on sight. If she hadn't been so nice,
I would never have been able to stand working with her. She was so critical
of my performance. Always telling me, 'Julia, don't chew gum while you're
acting' or 'Julia, don't touch that camera.' But I never did try to fight
with her. It would have been impossible even had I tried. She was just too
damned... chipper all the time, in the beginning.

Julia was a bit of an unfortunate addition to the cast. She and Daria never
really got along, and the rest of us were always amazed that Daria kept her
on the cast. But, for some reason, she stuck by Julia. We never did figure
out why they didn't seem to like each other. I don't know how you couldn't
like Daria.

I mean, I know that Daria was always sticking her neck out on the line for
me, back in those days, but I couldn't stand her constant nagging. Telling
me how to say this line, or how to react to that line. If you want my opinion,
she was a perfectionist.

Julia? Well, she and I don't see eye to eye on everything, but she's a great

see us doing the show with anyone else.

It's no secret that Julia and Daria didn't get along, but it never really

It was a relaxed atmosphere, helped out by the fact that Daria was so...
outgoing, and pleasant to be around. She was the nicest person I'd met in
show business. No trace of an ego at all. She could have been the daughter
I'd never had.

you ever saw on the show. And she was always funny. Always.

It had to be a few weeks before the shooting started for "Esteemsters," the
first episode. We were short an actor to play my brother, Trent. I then thought
about this guy that I'd gone to high school with, name of Bruce. He was perfect
- vaguely grungy looking, a little on the clueless side, and dedicated to
acting. So I told Daria about him, and she said 'Bring him on in.' When the
two of them met, it was like each had been struck by a bolt of lightning.
Rather sweet, in a way. They were crazy about each other.

to find. Until then. I was never happier. I just looked at her eyes, and

Everyone was happy for the two of them. They made such a great couple, really.
I mean, they were rather different from each other, but it was more of a

the show as a result.

(Voice Over, off-screen)

Everyone remembers all of the romantic tensions in those early episodes.
It's part of what gave Daria its charm, I've always thought. Here we have
this really cool and emotionally distant girl who seems to melt whenever
she sets on eyes on her best friend's older brother. That wouldn't have worked
if Daria and Bruce hadn't been an item, I don't think.

That was the damned funniest thing I'd come across in a while, although I
suppose it really shouldn't have surprised me that you'd see romantic elements
between their characters. I just thought the whole idea of a girl like Daria's
character being attracted to a slacker musician like Trent to be hysterical.

I always hated that romantic sub-plot. It was blatantly unrealistic, and
always detracted from the real focus of the show, which was Daria and Jane
versus the morons in Lawndale High. On the other hand, I suppose it was
inevitable. Romantic plots on shows like this are to be expected, sooner
or later. But it never compared to the real thing. Daria and Bruce were...
absolutely inseparable for years.

<P ALIGN=Center>
You know how it sometimes seems like you've found that person you were meant
to be with? The one who understands the way you think, the way you feel,
and all that sort of thing? That was Daria to me. I guess she was really
the love of my life. I couldn't stand the thoughts of being without her.
If that's not love, then nothing is.

We were all amazed that we'd been picked up for a second season. I mean,
we had decent ratings, but we were on MTV. A music channel. What are the
odds of their continued interest in a program about a cynical high schooler,
right? Especially one who's not particularly musical, and especially a show
that doesn't have a whole lot to do with music?

It's really been great to be given a second season. There are so many things
we want to do on the show. Of course, I can't really tell you what they are,
because if I do then Glenn's going to come and steal my soul.
<P ALIGN=Center>

I think the first time I really noticed anything was wrong was about the
time we were filming "It Happened One Nut." Daria had grown somewhat
<P ALIGN=Center>
(bt)
<P ALIGN=Center>
distant, I think, is the term I want. She wasn't quite as happy, or as outgoing,
but I couldn't get her to talk about it. Neither could anyone else. Not even
Tori, who was as close to her as her own sister.

She'd started closing herself off from us all. She never even told me why,

Where to go for dinner. Whose place to go to tonight. That sort of thing.
It was hurting me, and I tried to make things better, but they kept getting
worse. She wouldn't talk to me anymore. But one day, I found out.

The day she broke up with Bruce was a dark day for the show. Not just personally,

most of them were rumors.

I felt like someone had ripped my heart from my chest and made me eat it.
It hurt like nothing I'd ever been through before or since. I couldn't believe
it. It was so unlike her to do this to me. I remember thinking that it was
some sort of dream, as I caught her in bed with that bastard. I remember
thinking, 'Why me?' And then I don't remember anything for days. I came to
in a motel in central Maryland of all places, screaming her name and hurling
empty bottles of Jack Daniels at the TV, which was showing one of our episodes.

It was a trying time for us all when Marvin came in. The fact that we managed
to keep the show together at all is astounding. We all hated his guts, Bruce
most of all. It was hard for me, and for him, to pretend to like this guy.
To pretend to have any sort of attraction at all to him. I wanted to rip

show that I've been on for three years. Almost as if he wanted to taunt me.
I hated him. I couldn't stand him. And Daria never once told me why she did
it to me. Not once. This was the ultimate humiliation. But I just couldn't
stay mad at her forever.

Morgendorffer was my kind of girl. Sure, she was rather nice, but also completely
unafraid to speak her mind, and to do whatever the hell she wanted, whenever
the hell she wanted. She didn't take [bleep] from anyone - she dished it
out. But after she started snorting that [bleep], she changed.

She was a very... troubled young woman that last season. It's sad when a

we she turned to the crack, except that Marvin had gotten her hooked. We
didn't know why she'd take the drugs, and anyone who ever stood up to her
about it was insulted, or worse.

Withdrawal is the worst thing that can happen to anyone, right after getting
