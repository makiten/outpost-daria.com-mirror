Setting: Lawndale Highschool in front of Daria's Locker.

Daria: Jane do you think that Mr. DiMartino was a little mad when Kevin thought that 
Vietnam was a new Chinese Resteraunt in town?

Jane: Hmm I don't know but I suspect the use of four letter words and that he was going 
to do many unhappy things to kevins body may have been a slight tip-off.

Daria: Yeah I especially liked it when he mentioned how Kevin was going to be eating 
those annoying sholder pads!

Jane: Do you think they may make him smarter?

Daria: I don't know we'll find out and if its true we'll sell the story to Sick Sad World!

Jane: Hey now thats an Idea! "Sports equipment that makes you smart" boy the coachs will 
all have heart attacks knowing they won't have to bribe teachers into passing the jocks 
anymore!

Daria: I think were onto something here! Ohh well wanna discuss it at your house?

Jane: Sure why not we can talk it over why trying to withstand the constant noise of Trent 
and Jesse practicing thier music.

Daria: *Blushes at the thought of being near Trent* 

Setting Lane Household Janes Room

*Daria and Jane are sitting in front of the TV watching Whatelse? Sick Sad World*

T.V.: Bud Ice, Killer Penguins, Nazis all together? Next on Sick Sad World...

*Daria shuts the TV off*

Daria: So what are the plans besides letting our ears bleed listening to Trent and Jesse 
try to make music?

Jane: I don't know. Wanna grab some Pizza later we can make it a double date with Trent 
and Jesse? hmmmmm *smiles and gives daria a "Come on you know you wanna" look*

Daria: Date? How about we rephrase it to "Friendly Social Gathering" or "Post Practice 
meal"?

Jane: But we didn't practice they did.

Daria: Thats why they can pay for it.

Jane: Come on Daria think about it Trent, Jesse, Jobs, Money Kinda ring a bell? No Jobs 
equals no money! Besides it'll be fun and it'll get them and us out of the house for a bit 
besides Trent may come onto you! You do know hes crazy about you right?

Daria: *blushes slighty* Yeah right your just trying to trick me into telling him how I 
feel about him and I'm not falling for it. But I'll go anyway besides I'm hungry and i 
could go for a breath of fresh air those new paints you got are starting to get to me.

Jane: Really? I thought they smeeled kinda cool myself kinda like sniffing glue without 
having to put your face strait up to the bottle.

Daria: Sometimes I wonder about you.

Jane: Me to hmmm I wonder if Jesses does the same thing?

Daria: What sniffs Paint Fumes? I think he might considering he does some up with some pretty 
wierd guitar rifts.

Jane: No I mean wonder about me.

Daria: I wouldn't know but I do know Upchuck wonders about you all the time. What your 
wearing underneath your clothes and what you look like without them.

Jane: Please your making me sick.........Wait a Minute Upchuck, Sickness, Paintfumes my god 
I think I'm coming up with another Sick Sad World theory or atleast another painting idea.

Daria: I'd stick with the painting idea if I were you. Come on lets get the guys and go.

Jane: Ok

Setting: Lanes Household Basement

*Trent and Jesse are trying some new guitar rifts and trent is standing on top of a Chair*

Trent: Ok I'm gonna stand on this piece of aluminum foil and use sandpaper instead of a pick 
I want you to turn up the amps and cut off the lights.

Jesse: Ok Dude ready?

Trent: Yeah go for it!

*the lights go off right as daria and jane are walking into the room theres a load screech 
then a bang and when the lights come back on and Trent is laying ontop of Daria Guitar in 
hand. He quickly gets off of Daria*

Trent: Sorry about that Jesse accidentally knocked me off the Chair in the dark. Here let me 
help you up *offers Daria his hand thinking (I was just on top of the woman of my dreams and 
I didn't make a move DAMN!)*

Daria: *blushes very hard thinking (I just had the man of my dreams on top of me and I didn't 
make a move DAMN!)* umm its ok. *takes trents hand and he pulls her up and very close to him*

clean up and discuss possible plans for after words *she winks at Jesse*

*Jane and Daria leave the room*

Jesse: So you gonna tell her tonight on our "Double Date"?

Trent: Its not a date its probably just a Social Gathering! Besides I might I just don't 
know if she'll accept me or not.

Jesse: Come on man open your eyes look at the way she blushed when you acted all gentleman 
like and helped her up.

Trent: Nah she wasn't blushing she was just red from embarasment!

Trent: This is a song I wrote for my Girlfriend Daria.

To love, To Hold
To live, To Die
To be with you
Or forever Cry
These are the words
That come to Mind
When You come
Walking By.

Hey Hey Hey
I think I love you
Hey Hey Hey
I think I want to be with you
Hey Hey Hey
Why don't you come with me
Hey Hey Hey
Why don't you stay with me...

Without you 
the sun would not shine
Without you
the moon would crash
Without you
My heart would die....

I love you 
I always have 
I always will
We'll never be apart.....
