SEGMENT 1 OF "DISAPPEARING ACT"<br>
<br>
(SCENE - The Fashion Club in a car. Stacy is driving, and is visibly nervous.)<br>
<br>
Sandi: Gee, Stacy! If you grip that steering wheel any harder, you're going to break it!<br>
<br>
Tiffany: Yahhh! Your knuckles are all whiiiite!<br>
<br>
Stacy (nervous): Look! This is the first time my Dad's let me drive the car without him beside me, so I'm a little nervous, OK?<br>
<br>
(They turn into the parking lot of the Lawndale Mall.)<br>
<br>
Quinn (pointing): Look! There's something going on at the entrance!<br>
<br>
(SCENE - In front of the mall - Upchuck's magic show - the ball and cups trick.)<br>
<br>
Upchuck: I've placed the ball beneath a cup, with dazzling skill I mix them up! The ball withdraws, like a bashful maid, who runs away when attention's paid! Where, oh where, did my pretty one go? Risk ten bills if you think you know!<br>
<br>
DeMartino: Despite your disTRACTing and POORly metered rhyme, my eagle EYE tells me the ball is CERtainly underneath THAT cup! And I've got the ten-spot to PROVE it!<br>
<br>
(DeMartino puts down 10 dollars.)<br>
<br>
O'Neill: I hate to contradict you, Anthony, but (nervous laugh) it's under *that* one.<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Would *you* like to bet, Mr. O'Neill?<br>
<br>
DeMartino: Yeah! I'M not afraid to back up my sporting suppoSITion with cold, hard CASH!<br>
<br>
O'Neill: Well, I suppose I should have the courage of my convictions.<br>
<br>
(O'Neill places ten dollars on the table. Upchuck lifts the third cup, which neither DeMartino or O'Neill has bet on, to reveal the ball.)<br>
<br>
DeMartino: Oh, No! How could my RAZor-sharp intellect beTRAY me?<br>
<br>
O'Neill: In loss there is wisdom.<br>
<br>
DeMartino: Go aWAY!!<br>
<br>
O'Neill: Um, yes. (he leaves)<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Thanks for the assistance, Mr. De-Plant-ino.<br>
<br>
DeMartino: I quite enJOY helping the credulous hordes learn a valuable LESson about gulliBILity and trust! Gimme my cut!<br>
<br>
(He gives DeMartino some money. DeMartino leaves.)<br>
<br>
Upchuck: The cash is sweet, but sweeter still: the chance to attract the most luscious of ladies with my mesmerizing stage presence!<br>
<br>
(The Fashion Club walks toward Upchuck.)<br>
<br>
Aha! It's working already!<br>
<br>
(They walk past Upchuck.)<br>
<br>
Beautious maidens! May I show you something that will astound and amaze?<br>
<br>
(The Fashion Club stops.)<br>
<br>
Sandi: Only if it's a disappearing act.<br>
<br>
Upchuck: No, it's a feat of illusion!<br>
<br>
Tiffany: Like contouring your noooose to make it look thiiiin?<br>
<br>
(Sandi, Stacy and Quinn look at Tiffany, horrified.)<br>
<br>
Tiffany: Not meeee!<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Please! Spare just a moment to behold my astonishing magic skill!<br>
<br>
Sandi: Make it fast, Charles! I don't want to get stuck in the mid-day cosmetics counter crush.<br>
<br>
(Upchuck hold up a ten-dollar bill.)<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Observe, genuine U. S. currency! Which I shall now tear into pieces!<br>
<br>
(Horrified looks by the Fashion Club as Upchuck tears the bill up.)<br>
<br>
Sandi: *That* is most certainly illegal!<br>
<br>
Upchuck: But, wait! Through the commanding force of my virile presence, the bill is magically restored!<br>
<br>
(He unfolds the pieces. The bill is intact.)<br>
<br>
Sandi, Stacy, Tiffany and Quinn: Oh!<br>
<br>
Sandi: Truly astonishing!<br>
<br>
Stacy: But how'd he do that?<br>
<br>
Sandi: Oh, Stacy, you are so naive. He obviously used mirrors or something.<br>
<br>
Quinn: Besides, who cares if he can fix a ten? It's not like it was a fifty!<br>
<br>
Sandi: C'mon, let's make some *real* money disappear!<br>
<br>
(Quinn and Tiffany laugh and turn to leave with Sandi. Stacy stares at Upchuck a few seconds, still curious about the magic trick, then turns to go.)<br>
<br>
Tiffany: That was a good one, Sandiiii.<br>
<br>
(SCENE - O'Neill's class. Class has not started yet. Upchuck sees Jane dressed in 1940s style.)<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Grrr!! Has the artistic Miss Lane gone retro?<br>
<br>
Jane: Rumor has it you're doing magic tricks now, Upchuck. Can you make yourself disappear?<br>
<br>
Daria: Or make her new retro boyfriend disappear?<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Ahhhh! Dressing to please her new man! A custom of which I wholeheartedly approve!<br>
<br>
Jane (annoyed): Thanks for the support, Daria.<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Perhaps Miss Lane would be interested in a different sort of garb? I need an assistant for my next magic show ...<br>
<br>
Jane: Not unless I get to set you on fire.<br>
<br>
Upchuck: How about the lovely Miss Morgendorffer?<br>
<br>
Daria: Do I get to use a guillotine on you?<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Grrr! Feisty!<br>
<br>
(SCENE - The Fashion Club in the lunchroom, sitting at a table.)<br>
<br>
Sandi: What's with those get-ups your sister's friend is wearing, Quinn?<br>
<br>
Quinn: Uh, Jane's got a new boyfriend. He's like really, really into retro stuff.<br>
<br>
Tiffany: Reallyyy.<br>
<br>
Quinn: Yeah. I saw his car. It has these huge tail fins ...<br>
<br>
Sandi: Hmmmph. I'm sorry I asked. I guess I shouldn't be prying into the social lives of the unpopular.<br>
<br>
Stacy: Uh, speaking of the unpopular ... (hesitates)<br>
<br>
Sandi: ... yes, Stacy? ...<br>
<br>
Stacy: ... have any of you been able to figure out how Upchuck did that magic trick? The one where he tore up the ten-dollar bill?<br>
<br>
Sandi (exasperated): Who cares, Stacy?<br>
<br>
Tiffany: Yahhh.<br>
<br>
Quinn: He probably taped it together really fast.<br>
<br>
Stacy: I don't think he had time to ...<br>
<br>
Sandi: Ahem! (waits for everyone's attention.) Is Charles Ruttheimer really a suitable lunchtime topic of discussion for the Fashion Club?<br>
<br>
(Sandi stares hard at Stacy.)<br>
<br>
Stacy (small voice): I suppose not.<br>
<br>
Sandi: Now, about those new sweaters we saw at Cashman's. Did you like the pink or the blue better?<br>
<br>
(Stacy is not paying attention. She pulls a dollar bill out of her pocket.)<br>
<br>
Quinn: The blue, but it's not like the blue they've had before!<br>
<br>
Tiffany: I thiiink it's bluuuer than beforrre.<br>
<br>
(Stacy holds the bill like she's going to tear it into pieces, then stops and looks thoughtful.)<br>
<br>
Quinn: It's so blue it's almost not-blue.<br>
<br>
(Stacy folds the bill in her hand, straightens it out, and looks thoughtful again. She's not listening to the others.)<br>
<br>
Sandi: That doesn't make sense, Quinn ...<br>

(Background Vocal: "Real American Heroes!")<br>

Today we salute you, Mr Medical Oddities Museum Curator!<br>

Some jobs require intestinal fortitude, but you come face-to-face with *real* intestines on a daily basis!<br>

(BG vocal: "Blood and guts!")<br>
<br>
If it weren't for you, we'd never know what malformed spleens, hyper- extended bones and ill-shaped skulls even looked like ...<br>
<br>
(BG vocal: "ill-shaped skulls")<br>
<br>
So this Bud's for you, Mr Medical Oddities Museum Curator, because without you, we'd never get to know our innermost selves!<br>

(End of Commercial)<br>
<br>
SEGMENT 2 OF "DISAPPEARING ACT"<br>
<br>
(SCENE - Stacy and Upchuck walking through the hall of Lawndale High.)<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Oh, how I wish I could quench your curiousity, my pet! But I cannot reveal my secrets! It's the magician's code!<br>
<br>
Stacy: But I have to know how you did it. I can't get it out of my mind!<br>
<br>
Upchuck: I know the feeling! There are so many things I can't get out of my mind. That dream about the mermaids and the fudge sauce, for example ...<br>
<br>
(They walk past Sandi, Quinn and Tiffany.)<br>
<br>
Sandi: Was that Stacy with Upchuck?<br>
<br>
Quinn: No way! It must be that girl who looks like Stacy except when she turns around.<br>
<br>
Tiffany: Or that girrrl who looks like that girrrrl ...<br>
<br>
(SCENE - Upchuck and Stacy in Upchuck's car.)<br>
<br>
Stacy: Uh, thanks for the ride home, Upchu --- , uh, I guess you'd rather be called "Charles".<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Just "Chuck" will be fine, my sweet.<br>
<br>
Stacy: Look, Chuck, is there any way you can let me in on the secret of your magic tricks?<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Hmmm. There IS a way!<br>
<br>
Stacy: What?<br>
<br>
Upchuck: I'm doing a magic show in a few weeks to benefit something-or-other Ms. Li is doing. And I need a lovely and gracious assistant on stage!<br>
<br>
Stacy: An assistant? What would I have to do?<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Mostly hold some props --<br>
<br>
Stacy: Props?<br>
<br>
Upchuck: ... implements of magical legendermain. The biggest thing you'd have to do would be to lock me in a trunk, from which I shall escape.<br>
<br>
Stacy: Uh, I guess I could do that.<br>
<br>
Upchuck: You'll have to know how the various tricks are done in order to assist.<br>
<br>
Stacy: Oh, that would be perfect! But ...<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Yes?<br>
<br>
Stacy: I don't know what to tell my friends. Uh, you're not really considered, you know, popular with the Fashion Club ...<br>
<br>
Upchuck: I understand, my lovely. Actually, I'd rather keep the identity of my assistant a secret until the show. But they'll have to find out when the show takes place ...<br>
<br>
Stacy (takes a big breath): OK, Chuck, the hell with what they think! I'll do it!<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Grrr!! Feisty!! (Stacy grimaces slightly at this.)<br>
<br>
(SCENE - Ruttheimer garage, the one we saw in "The Lab Brat". Stacy approaches the door, looking back over her shoulder, then enters. The light is on, but Upchuck is not in the room. There is a table set up with some magic implements, and a large trunk on the floor.)<br>
<br>
Stacy: Chuck?<br>
<br>
(Upchuck comes out of the door to the house, carrying drinking glasses.)<br>
<br>
Upchuck: I believe you prefer diet soda? Lemon-lime?<br>
<br>
Stacy (a little nervous): Yeah. That's great. Thanks.<br>
<br>
(She takes the glass and takes a sip.)<br>
<br>
Upchuck: OK, now, my lovely ...<br>
<br>
Stacy: Uh, Chuck?<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Yes?<br>
<br>
Stacy: How about if you just call me "Stacy"? Y'know, instead of "my lovely" and things like that. And I'll call you Chuck.<br>
<br>
Upchuck (losing a bit of his Hefner act): OK, uh, Stacy. Now, let's get started...<br>
<br>
(Upchuck's mother, the red-headed woman we saw in "Legends of the Mall", opens the door.)<br>
<br>
Mrs Ruttheimer: Charles, are you ... (stops, surprised, when she sees Stacy.) Oh, hello there!<br>
<br>
Stacy: Hi.<br>
<br>
Mrs Ruttheimer: I didn't know you had a gir- ... friend out here.<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Uh, Mom, this is Stacy Rowe, from school. She's going to be helping in my magic act.<br>
<br>
Mrs Ruttheimer (reaching out to shake hands): Pleased to meet you, Stacy.<br>
<br>
Stacy: Uh, pleased to meet you, Mrs. Ruttheimer.<br>
<br>
Mrs Ruttheimer: I'll let you two get back to your, uh, magic.<br>
<br>
(She leaves.)<br>
<br>
Upchuck: And now, my sw --- , uh, Stacy, let's get started ...<br>
<br>
(SCENE - Lawndale Mall. Sandi, Quinn and Tiffany walking through the mall.)<br>
<br>
Sandi: So what did Stacy say when she called you, Quinn?<br>
<br>
Quinn: She said her father was going to ground her if she didn't study more. So she couldn't come with us tonight.<br>
<br>
Sandi: Some parents have no sense of priorities.<br>
<br>
Tiffany: Yahhh, reallyy.<br>
<br>
(SCENE - Ruttheimer garage. Upchuck gets into the trunk. Stacy closes and locks it. Several seconds pass, then Upchuck enters by the outside door.)<br>
<br>
Stacy: That's *such* a cool trick! And so easy when you know how it's done!<br>
<br>
Upchuck: As are they all, my --, Stacy. Well, I think we're done for tonight. Unless you'd like another diet soda?<br>
<br>
Stacy (smiling): No, thanks, I've had quite a few tonight. It's been ..., uh, fun. Really, Chuck.<br>
<br>
(There's an awkward silence as they look at each other for a second.)<br>
<br>
Upchuck: But we have a lot more practice before we go on stage.<br>
<br>
Stacy: I know.<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Next time I'll have your costume for you, now that I know your size.<br>
<br>
(SCENE - Morgendorffer living room. Quinn is sitting on the sofa, talking on the cellphone.)<br>
<br>
Quinn: Yeah, Stacy, you should have seen the new jeans Cashman's just got in! Yeah, I know, you have to study or be grounded. Well, to me it seems like you've been grounded already!<br>
<br>
(Daria walks in, looking tired and disheveled.)<br>
<br>
Quinn (to Stacy): Hold it a minute, Stacy.<br>
<br>
(to Daria) What happened to you!!??<br>
<br>
Daria: A night at the drive-in movies.<br>
<br>
Quinn: There aren't any drive-in movies around here!<br>
<br>
Daria: None that are open. Jane's new boyfriend, Nathan, thinks abandoned drive-ins are the swingingest thing ...<br>
<br>
Quinn: What-EVer!! I mean, "retro" is fine, but some people! ...<br>
<br>
(Daria continues walking toward the stairway.)<br>
<br>
(to Stacy) Are you still there, Stacy? (pause) Yeah, anyway, these jeans I was telling you about ...<br>
<br>
(SCENE - Daria's bedroom. Daria walks in, turns on the TV, and sits on the bed to watch.)<br>
<br>
TV (Sick Sad World Theme and announcer): Mayhem on ice? No, it's not hockey, it's ... Zamboni demolition derby! Next! On Sick Sad World!<br>
<br>
(Daria falls onto the bed asleep.)<br>
<br>
(SCENE - Ruttheimer garage. Stacy enters to find Upchuck hunched over the table, working on some magic implements. Upchuck turns around.)<br>
<br>
Upchuck: There you are!<br>
<br>
Stacy: Hi, Chuck.<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Your costume arrived in the mail today. Let's see you try it on.<br>
<br>
(He opens the door to the house.)<br>
<br>
Mom! Stacy needs to come in to change into her costume!<br>
<br>
(SCENE - Inside the Ruttheimer house. Stacy is in her costume. Mrs Ruttheimer is showing her to the door to the garage.)<br>
<br>
Mrs Ruttheimer: Has Charles been ... behaving himself?<br>
<br>
Stacy: Uh, sure.<br>
<br>
Mrs Ruttheimer: You know what I mean, don't you?<br>
<br>
Stacy: He's been ... fine, Mrs Ruttheimer.<br>
<br>
Mrs Ruttheimer: I don't know what his reaction will be when he sees you in this costume. At least Charlie, that is, Charles's father isn't here. He's on business trips most of the time - (wistfully) I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing.<br>
<br>
Stacy: I've never met Mr Ruttheimer.<br>
<br>
Mrs Ruttheimer: Be thankful. If Charles has been minding his manners around a pretty girl like you, there's hope for the Ruttheimer bloodline yet.<br>
<br>
(She opens the door. Stacy walks in, and Upchuck sees her.)<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Grrr...!<br>
<br>
Mrs Ruttheimer: Ahem! Charles!<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Um, it's a good fit, Stacy.<br>
<br>
Stacy: Yeah. It is. It's ... a really cool costume, Chuck.<br>
<br>
Mrs Ruttheimer: I think you'd better change back now that we know it fits. Then you can continue practicing ...<br>
<br>
Stacy: Really, it's OK, Mrs Ruttheimer. I need to practice in the costume.<br>
<br>
(Mrs Ruttheimer raises her eyebrows, looks at Upchuck, then back at Stacy.)<br>
<br>
Stacy: Really, it's OK.<br>
<br>
(Mrs Ruttheimer glances hard at Upchuck and mouths the word "manners!")<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Let me show you something, Stacy.<br>
<br>
(He pulls out a dollar bill. He tears it up, closes his hand, and reveals an intact bill.)<br>
<br>
Stacy: How do you do that? That's what I was wondering about before!<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Watch now.<br>
<br>
(He does it very slowly. We can see he's hidden an intact bill in his palm and switches them during the trick.)<br>
<br>
Stacy: I see! I sort of figured it was something like that! So I'm naive, am I? Show me how to do this well enough that I can pull it on Sandi!<br>
<br>
Upchuck: But, Stacy, we don't want anyone to know you're doing magic until the show, remember?<br>
<br>
Stacy: Damn! You're right! I still want to learn how to do it!<br>
<br>
Upchuck: OK, first you need to be able to palm the bill without being noticed ...<br>
<br>
(Again there's an awkward silence as he holds her hand to fold it around the bill.)<br>
<br>
Stacy: Uh, .... like this?<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Uh, yeah, like that ...<br>
<br>
(SCENE - Outside shot of Ruttheimer house with the garage lit up and one light in the living room.)<br>

CUT TO COMMERICAL BREAK WITH SHOT OF STACY IN HER COSTUME<br>
<br>
(Commercial)<br>
<br>
Announcer: You're watching Channel 13 in Lawndale, your Action News station!<br>
<br>
Tonight on Action News, space aliens in Lawndale!<br>
<br>
(reporter interviewing Artie in his pizza-delivery uniform.)<br>
<br>
Artie: He was yay tall, that had these huge bulging eyes, almost like my old high-school history teacher! And he said the pizza I was delivering was cold, demostrating non-human temperature sensitivity! I think he's even immune to cheese burn!<br>
<br>
Announcer: Also tonight, a terrorist cell in Lawndale, and the coming ice storm. Those and other stories, tonight on Action News at 10!<br>
<br>
(End of commercial)<br>
<br>
SEGMENT 3 OF "DISAPPEARING ACT"<br>
<br>
(SCENE - Hallway of Lawndale High. Ms Li and Upchuck are selling tickets to Upchuck's magic show. Daria and Jane approach.)<br>
<br>
Jane: I had a great time the other night.<br>
<br>
Daria: Yeah. Me too.<br>
<br>
Jane: Sorry we woke you guys up when we got back in the car.<br>
<br>
Daria: Hey, no problem, we got in a good three hours first.<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Come see a feat of legerdermain so dangerous I have taken out an insurance policy on my body - and my bodily fluids! This Saturday night I will be handcuffed, straitjacketed and interred within an airtight, steel-reinforced military-grade trunk! Then --- it's escape! Or asphyxiate!<br>
<br>
Daria: Do we get to pick?<br>
<br>
Ms. Li: All proceeds ...<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Ahem!<br>
<br>
Ms. Li: ... *most* proceeds to benefit the special expenditures fund for embedding microchips in the gym equipment!<br>
<br>
Daria: Upchuck, bound and gagged. That *does* sound entertaining.<br>
<br>
Jane: I'll take four tickets.<br>
<br>
Ms. Li: On behalf of pilfered basketballs everywhere, Ms. Lane, I'd like to say that's very school-spirited of you.<br>
<br>
Jane (to Daria): You ask Tom, I'll ask Nathan. My treat.<br>
<br>
Daria: If that's the word for it.<br>
<br>
(Daria and Jane leave. The Fashion Club approaches.)<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Behold! An approaching quartet of lovelies! It appears my magic mojo is working overtime! Hi!! Stacy!<br>
<br>
Stacy (nervously): Hi!<br>
<br>
Sandi: Did you just say "hello" to Upchuck? Or was that a hiccup?<br>
<br>
Stacy (nervously) Must be all the diet soda I've been drinking.<br>
<br>
Sandi: Anyway, I've already gotten us all tickets to that magic show. For some reason, it seems to have become an event not to be missed for the popular. You can all pay me later. I assume you can come, Stacy, unless you have to *study* again?<br>
<br>
Stacy (nervous): Uh, sure. It's a Saturday. I'll ... I'll ... I'll definitely be there.<br>
<br>
Sandi: I think you need a break from all that studying. You haven't been yourself lately at all ...<br>
<br>
(SCENE - Stacy enters Upchuck's garage again.)<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Hi, Stacy, let's ...<br>
<br>
Stacy (angry): God-damn her!<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Who?<br>
<br>
Stacy (angry): Sandi frikkin' Griffin, that's who! (She mocks Sandi's voice) "Have you got the hiccups, Stacy?", "You're not yourself, Stacy!", "You're so naive, Stacy!"<br>
<br>
I'm sick of her put-downs, Chuck! Look, I was thinking of an idea on the way over here ...<br>
<br>
(SCENE - Outside shot of the garage while Stacy explains her idea.)<br>
<br>
(SCENE - Back inside the garage.)<br>
<br>
Upchuck: But, Stacy, what's the point?<br>
<br>
Stacy (amused that Upchuck doesn't get it): Chuck! The point is to embarrass Sandi!<br>
<br>
Upchuck: I don't know, Stacy ... uh, Sandi can be pretty vindictive ...<br>
<br>
Stacy: So can I. Starting now.<br>
<br>
Upchuck: But she might ... (hestitates)<br>
<br>
Stacy: She might what? Embarrass me back? She already does that with her put-downs. At least I'll get a few licks in.<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Uh, throw you out of the Fashion Club?<br>
<br>
Stacy: Quinn and Tiffany wouldn't stand for it. Not any more. And she knows it.<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Uh, maybe she'd beat you up?<br>
<br>
Stacy: C'mon, Chuck!<br>
<br>
Upchuck: So what do you think she'll do?<br>
<br>
Stacy (smugly): She'll do what I've always done: take a big gulp, swallow hard, and put on a brave face.<br>
<br>
(SCENE - The Lawndale High School auditorium. Everyone gathered for the magic show.)<br>
<br>
Sandi: I think Stacy has confused being fashionably late with outright tardiness.<br>
<br>
Tiffany: She's been so weirrd latelyy.<br>
<br>
Quinn: She hardly didn't eat anything at lunch. Did that make sense?<br>
<br>
Tiffany: *I* got it.<br>
<br>
(On stage.)<br>
<br>
Ms. Li: Welcome, one and all! I'd like to thank Mr. Ruttheimer for supporting a most worthy cause! And for giving me some pointers on adapting the intercom system for post-hypnotic suggestion. (Low voice) I will tithe my earnings to Lawndale High, tithe my earnings to Lawndale High.<br>
<br>
(Normal voice) And now! Ruttheimer the Prestidigitator and his lovely assistant, Stacy!<br>
<br>
(Stacy and Upchuck enter in costume.)<br>
<br>
(In the audience.)<br>
<br>
Sandi: Emergency meeting immediately following show!<br>
<br>
Tiffany: Her costumme! It's so sparklyyy!<br>
<br>
(On stage.)<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Greetings, magic aficionados!<br>
<br>
(Stacy chains him for the trunk trick.)<br>
<br>
Be gentle, my sweet! I have a very delicate -- everything.<br>
<br>
Stacy: I hope I'm doing this right.<br>
<br>
Upchuck: No complaints on this end. Grrr.<br>
<br>
As soon as I'm fully bondaged, I will enter this steel-reinforced trunk which the lovely Stacy will close and lock from the outside.<br>
<br>
(He goes into the trunk. Stacy locks it.)<br>
<br>
Stacy (whisper): Oh, no! What do I do next?<br>
<br>
Upchuck (from inside the trunk): MMMumble!!<br>
<br>
(Stacy grins desperately at the audience.)<br>
<br>
Ms. Li: What's taking so long? I rented the auditorium out, and the single Scientologists will be here in less than an hour!<br>
<br>
Stacy (panicking): He was supposed to signal me! Something's wrong! (cries)<br>
<br>
Ms Li: Panic! Panic! I foresee a massive hike in insurance premiums!<br>
<br>
(DeMartino arrives with crowbar.)<br>
<br>
DeMartino: Why do I ALWAYS end up bailing OUT the naive and/or inCOMPetent when their ill-conceived plans go awRY?<br>
<br>
(DeMartino begins trying to open truck with the crowbar. Ms Barch arrives on stage.)<br>
<br>
Barch: It's just like a man to be there one minute and gone the next!<br>
<br>
(She begins kicking the lock.)<br>
<br>
(SCENE - Stacy standing in the aisleway next to Sandi, crying.)<br>
<br>
DeMartino: C'mon, rigid, stubborn box of death! Yield, I say! Yield!<br>
<br>
(He continues prying with the crowbar.)<br>
<br>
Barch: No goodbye, not even a note after I gave you the best years of my life!<br>
<br>
(She continues kicking the lock.)<br>
<br>
Sandi: Stacy, it's just tragic how you so completely *embarrassed* yourself!<br>
<br>
Tiffany: Yahhh, and freaked ouuut!<br>
<br>
Quinn: And your mascara! It's not even waterproof! Oh, I can't look!<br>
<br>
Sandi: Good thing Upchuck's buried alive in there so you won't have to spend the rest of your life seeking revenge for the way he's humiliated you in front of the whole school!<br>
<br>
Stacy (suddenly stops crying): Oh, Sandi, you are *so* naive!<br>
<br>
Sandi (suspiciously): Huh?<br>
<br>
(DeMartino breaks the box open. Upchuck is gone.)<br>
<br>
DeMartino: Where IS he?<br>
<br>
Barch: Probably chatting up some tootsie in a sleazy roadside tavern, complaining how he and his wife haven't slept in the same bed since ...<br>
<br>
DeMartino (points to the back of the auditorium): He's back THERE!<br>
<br>
Upchuck: ShaZAMMM!!<br>
<br>
(SCENE - Ted DeWitt-Clinton, near the front of the auditorium, snapping pictures.)<br>
<br>
(SCENE - Upchuck back on stage.)<br>
<br>
Upchuck: Let's hear it for my lovely and very talented assistant, Stacy, and her Oscar-worthy acting job! Your crocodile tears bring out the tiger in me! Grrr!<br>
<br>
(In the audience.)<br>
<br>
Tiffany: Maybeee Stacyyy can teach meee to cryyy!<br>
<br>
Quinn: It *would* be useful at home *and* in a variety of social situations.<br>
<br>
(Quinn smirks at Sandi. Sandi rolls her eyes and stares at the ceiling.)<br>
<br>
(SCENE - Stacy and Upchuck in Upchuck's car. Both are in street clothes.)<br>
<br>
Upchuck: A success all around, wouldn't you say, my --, uh, Stacy!<br>
<br>
Stacy (closes her eyes, leans her head back and smiles): Absolutely!<br>
<br>
(Suddenly she opens her eyes) Oh, I almost forgot!<br>
<br>
Upchuck: What?<br>
<br>
(Stacy pulls two photographs from her pocket.)<br>
<br>
Stacy: Ted DeWitt-Clinton was taking some instant pictures during the show and gave me these two afterwards. He said he'd decided to use other ones in the yearbook. There's one here for each of us.<br>
<br>
(She hands them to Upchuck. Upchuck takes a quick look while continuing to drive.)<br>
<br>
Upchuck: You choose.<br>
<br>
Stacy: Uh, thanks, I'd like this one.<br>
<br>
(She hands the other to Upchuck. Again their hands touch, and there's an awkward silence.)<br>
<br>
(SCENE - Sandi is driving, and has a distinct scowl on her face. Quinn and Tiffany are in the back seat. Quinn and Tiffany laugh silently, then Tiffany ducks down behind the seat.)<br>
<br>
Quinn (teasing): Oh, no, Sandi! Tiffany has disappeared! Maybe she's going to suffocate!<br>
<br>
(Quinn and Tiffany both giggle.)<br>
<br>
Sandi (glowering): *Really* funny, guys! So funny I forgot to laugh!<br>
<br>
(Quinn and Tiffany giggle again.)<br>
<br>
(SCENE - Stacy in her bedroom, carrying the photoghaph she got from Ted. She opens the closet door. We see the caricatures from "Art Burn." Stacy puts up the photo next to the caricatures, allowing us to see it for the first time. It shows Stacy and Upchuck in their magic costumes, holding hands, waving at the audience with their free hands. Stacy smiles at the photo.)<br>

"MAGIC" BY PILOT<br>
<br>
Oh, ho, ho it's magic, you know<br>
Never believe it's not so<br>
It's magic, you know<br>
Never believe it's not so.<br>
<br>
Never been awake<br>
Never seen a day break<br>
Leaning on my pillow in the morning<br>
Lazy day in bed<br>
Music in my head<br>
Crazy music playing in the morning light.<br>
<br>
Oh, ho, ho it's magic, you know<br>
Never believe it's not so<br>
It's magic, you know<br>
Never believe it's not so.<br>
