a <I>Daria</I> ficlet
<P>
by wyvern337
<P>
&quot;<I>Hey, Dad!...Dad?&quot; </I>called Daria.
<P>
&quot;<I>Mom?&quot;, </I>a little more doubtfully.
<P>
<I>&quot;Quinn?&quot;</I> well no, probably not.  Daria was pretty
sure her younger sister was at a Fashion Club meeting at one of
the other members' houses, though she wasn't quite sure which
one.  Not that Quinn would be of much help with what she needed,
anyway.
<P>
One last try.  <I>&quot;Anybody home?&quot;</I>
<P>
When Daria had arrived home, she'd noticed her mother's red SUV
was missing from the driveway.  Jake's Lexus was still there,
but it now seemed obvious he and Helen had gone somewhere together.
<P>
&quot;Ah, crap,&quot; said Daria, staring bleakly at the calendar.
 They'd all forgotten except her.  Not that she could entirely
blame them.  This had been going on for so long now that it must
have become background noise to the rest of her family.  And now
that very fact had just assured that it would continue to go on
for...well, who knew <I>how</I> much longer? She trudged wearily
up the stairs to her room, shrugged out of her backpack and tossed
it into a corner, then herself onto the bed, lying on her back,
her head hanging off the edge, arms spread wide.
<P>
As she stared at a loose button in the padding of the opposite
wall, Daria found herself slowly becoming first irritated, then
<I>angry.</I>  Dammit all, maybe she <I>should </I>blame them!
Both her parents, hell even <I>Quinn</I> had known about this
afternoon <I>weeks</I> in advance...and it wasn't as if it didn't
affect them too! And they'd <I><B>forgotten!</B></I> They'd forgotten.
 The part that made Daria seethe, though, was the realization
of how helpless she was to solve this on her own.
<P>
After a little while, Daria got up off her bed and began pacing
the room, frequently looking at the clock, getting more agitated
every time she did.
<P>
<I>And I made sure I got home in plenty of time, </I>she thought
bitterly, <I>just so I'd have that much longer to torture myself
as I watched the appointed hour come and go.</I>
<P>
And then another thought hit her...<I>Jane!</I>  Daria had picked
up the cordless phone and started to dial when she remembered
her best friend was still at school, helping Ms. Defoe inventory
art supplies.  In fact, Daria had left her there to go home, to
keep this appointment...Jane would be home later this afternoon,
of course, but there was no way of telling exactly when, and there
was already only about a half-hour left before she needed to be
there.
<P>
Then, suddenly, another thought spun off on a tangent from the
first:  <I>Jane.  What would <B>Jane</B> do if something like
this was happening to <B>her?</B></I>
<P>
Moments later, Daria was rummaging through the drawer where she
knew the spare keys to the Lexus were.  When she had them, she
walked out to the driveway, unlocked and opened the driver's side
door, slid into the driver's seat, clicked the seatbelt on, closed
the door, squeezed the steering wheel hard in a futile attempt
to stop her hands from shaking, took a deep breath, reached down
and turned the key in the ignition.
<P>
She accelerated unsteadily down the street, trying to pay attention
to where the needle was on the speedometer, suddenly realizing
she was paying too little attention to the road and looking back
up, remembering she hadn't checked the rear view mirror in...how
many seconds?..and glancing up at it <I>(damn -- forgot to adjust
it before I started)</I>  her hand crept up towards the mirror,
then jerked away as she caught a blurry flash of movement out
of the corner of her eye and her head whipped around as she tried
to catch what it was.
<P>
<I>You'd better <B>keep</B> looking around, Daria...remember what
almost happened with that dog?</I>
<P>
Daria became so absorbed in checking the periphery of her field
of view and the (imperfectly adjusted) rear view mirror that she
almost missed the stop sign, and had to stomp hard on the brakes
to get stopped in time.
<P>
&quot;<I>Gaaah!&quot;</I> cried Daria as the Lexus screeched to
a halt.  She checked the mirror.  No cars behind her.  Good.
She sat there for several seconds, breathing deeply, trying to
will herself calm.
<P>
Finally, Daria looked both ways, saw that there was no other traffic
at the intersection, suddenly remembered to flip the turn indicator
on and started to turn right...oversteering and swerving into
the wrong lane as she did.
<P>
And so it went.  Finally, Daria was just around the block from
where she needed to be.  She pulled over to the curb and stopped.
 Put the car into park and tried to collect her thoughts.  This
was hopeless.  There was no <I>way </I>she was going to pull this
off.  She should just turn around and go home.  Maybe if she was
lucky no one would ever notice or figure out that even this much
had happened.  There'd be other days...eventually...maybe....
<P>
Daria put the Lexus in gear, checked over her shoulder, prepared
to make a U-turn and head for home
<P>
<I>Like Jane would do?</I>
<P>
Daria clenched her teeth, pulled away from the curb and turned
the final corner to her destination -- not even noticing that
she did so flawlessly.
<P>
The thin, balding, bespectacled man looked up from his clipboard.
 His four-thirty should be here by...ah, that must be her now.
 <I><B>Again.</B></I>  As he approached the car, he noticed something
unusual...there was only <I>one</I> occupant in the vehicle this
time.  He bent down and looked questioningly in the window.
<P>
Daria felt herself edging towards panic.
<P>
<I>Girl, you are just<B> not</B> cut out for this.</I>
<P>
Frustrated, desperate, she'd tried being reckless and impulsive...and
had only succeeded in painting herself into a monumental corner.
 She didn't even want to <I>think</I> about how much trouble she
was in.  Daria's face reddened.  She opened her mouth to say something
-- anything -- but no sound came out.  She gulped, started to
try again...
<P>
&quot;We've, uh, gotta stop meeting like this?&quot; she offered
weakly.
<P>
The man heaved a deep, exhausted-sounding sigh.
<P>
&quot;Look, I'll tell you what,&quot; he said, &quot;if you can
parallel-park this time, I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary
when you arrived here.&quot;

her for a little while now and then, for strictly non-profit purposes.
 As for what Daria did in this story, the obligatory &quot;kids,
don't try this at home&quot; applies; what Daria did <I>is</I>
illegal in Real Life(tm).

idea to expand my post there into a ficlet.
