<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Big thanks to T.A.G. for his idea of a
Karaoke Bar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Where to begin, at the beginning of time?
No, that is far to far back. At the other end then, thirty minutes before the
universe ceases to be? Equally the answer is No. No Today we are to look five
years previously from the ever moving now, on a Friday in mid winter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>On this Friday we find Daria and Jane back
together in Daria’s old room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria has spent the last two months in Boston at Raft, whilst Jane has been stuck in Lawndale eagerly awaiting the start of her own
course at B-FAC.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane has spent her time pulling up her
maths grade in between painting for herself and painting on commission. This
time working for Ms Li, at Lawndale High. She got persuaded to help refurbish
the school with some huge graphic murals in the corridors.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria meanwhile has spent her days in long
lectures, looking at writing styles and a selection of authors and writers. Her
evenings have been spent in writing up essays and finishing projects. She soon
realises why Heather used to pay her to do her essays, it is because with the
length of the lectures and the number per week there simply is not enough time
to both study and learn. Her personal writing has nearly dwindled to an end,
she barely has time to check her e-mails and write her journal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Partying had so far not been a big event,
on the student calendar in her dorm, neither Daria nor her Roommate Lynn were
big fans of hanging with people they didn’t know instead they spent most of
their free spare time eating oven ready pizza and watching re-runs of Sick Sad
World on the TV.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>However Daria’s Aunt Amy did come up to
visit during her second week for a few days to help with her education into
college life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria had always stayed in close contact
with her Aunt Amy, although she tried to keep it quiet from her mother, as the
two sisters never really got on. Amy liked Daria a lot and always kept her
confidences, which was why it came as a shock when she got a letter from Helen
asking if she could help keep an eye on Daria, now that Daria was living nearer
Amy. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amy took it on herself to make sure that
Daria and her roommate not only had a good time at college, but also that they
were safe whilst doing it. She took both Daria and Lynn out to one of her
favourite Italian Restaurants where she explained, not the facts of life, but
the facts of alcohol.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They placed their orders and with each
course Amy had ordered a different glass of wine for them all as well as a few
bottles of water. That night they all had a good time, whilst Amy explained why
certain things tasted better together than others. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The next night Amy took the girls to a jazz
club where they were drinking meaningfully but with little food, again they all
had a good night but the next morning was a sorry tale.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amy helped them both recover in the
morning, and spent the afternoon making sure they both knew what signs to look
for and how to stay safe, before she left she also went into details as to how
drinks were spiked and reminded both girls to never leave any glass unattended.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria and Lynn had been to see Amy a few
times since that first visit during freshman week, for her master class to make
sure that they were fully educated in all aspects of life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane helped Daria to unpack and they headed
to Dega Street to the Zon. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The Zon was a strange club, created by a PR
genius the building had three entrances one on each side of the building and
three names to match, For the Trendy metrosexuals the flashy entrance to “Club
Ozone” off Highland Drive led upstairs to the first floor, with all disco
lights and plastic dance tunes. For the Metal heads the entrance was on Dega Street where the name had been subtly changed to “The Zon” and this floor had live
bands playing every night. The third door was in the back alley off Dega Street and this led to “The Zen” which was a bar that often ran an open mike show. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria and Jane got settled in and Daria
ordered them both a beer, whilst the band were setting up onstage. Daria had
been coming here for so long that whilst strictly speaking she was underage,
she was not expecting any hassle nor did she get any from the barman. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane could not believe that Daria had got
them both a beer, and that she had got served just like that. Everyone round
here new of Trent’s sister Little Janey and she was pretty sure she would still
be questioned at Thirty as to her age because of being Little Janey. Jane
obviously wanted to know what the knack was and just how long Daria had been
drinking, so Daria told her all about Lynn and her Aunt Amy’s visit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They watched a few bands and Daria went
back to the bar for a few more beers, it was on the third trip to the bar that
the barman told Daria about the Zen being open and that it was open mike night.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria went back to Jane with the beer and suggested
they go down to the Zen and watch a few acts, Jane agreed and they made their
way down stairs, the Zen having an entrance in the Zon as well as from the
street. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They go down and after half an hour they
have seen a few different people, most are trying to do comedy sketches, these
are getting a relatively good appreciation from the audience but both Daria and
Jane’s attention was waning as the jokes were either inane or puerile. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>After the last act had left the mike
unattended, Daria walked up to the Mike and started to speak. She recited the
poem Howl by Allen Ginsberg almost word for word, “I saw the best minds of my
generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked, dragging themselves
through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix…”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>At the end she quietly went back and sat
down again with Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They had a few more beers and eventually
went home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>That night in her bed through her pounding
headache Jane had already noticed a change in her friend. Her Friend who she
had known for nearly five long years to be timid and shy, getting up without
being persuaded to do a stand up act, yes their had certainly been some
changes, Jane was just not sure that she liked them. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Thanks again to:-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>T.A.G. for the idea of Karaoke.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Canadibrit, for the character Lynn Cullen,
who I used as Daria’s Roommate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=gen1><span lang=EN-GB style='color:windowtext'>Scissors
MacGillicutty</span></span><span lang=EN-GB> for setting the Iron Chef: Daria
Drinks &amp; Goes Home.</span></p>
