<p>Darkness. Slowly, a seam appears, and white spreads across the field of view.
As the whiteness consumes the entire field of view, the camera slowly pans to
reveal Jane sprawled in her bed, face down and fully dressed. After emitting a
brief moan, she slowly rolls over and rubs her face.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane :</b> (thought VO) Morning already? (moving slightly) Ouch.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jane looks down for a second, then begins searching her room.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane :</b> (thought VO) Now where did I put that bottle? (in Amanda’s
voice) Oh Jane, you should treasure it. It’s a beautiful part of your
woman-hood that should be cherished. (Back in Jane’s voice) Bullshit Mom, it
hurts like hell.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jane rummages through a drawer and removes a bottle of Advil. Opening the
bottle, she takes two pills and swallows them. Closing the bottle, she throws it
onto her bed. Searching the closet, Jane removes a towel and heads off to the
shower.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cut to the Lane kitchen. Jane walks into the kitchen, turning to see Jesse
slumped forward in his chair, fast asleep on the table. As Jane begins to search
for breakfast, she sniffs the air, and her face wrinkles in disgust.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane :</b> (thought VO) God Jesse. Take a bath.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Opening the cupboard beneath the sink, Jane rummages around briefly, emerging
with a can of Lysol. Walking over to Jesse, she sprays him liberally, avoiding
only the hair and face. Satisfied, she replaces the can and returns to her
search for food.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane :</b> Well, that should hold him, for a while at least. Now where would
I hide if I were breakfast?</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jane opens the refrigerator, and is surprised to find an egg sitting there.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane :</b> (thought VO) An egg? (hopeful) Real food?</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Jane watches, the egg cracks open, revealing a young chicken escaping from
the shell.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane :</b> Figures.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jane moves down and opens a large drawer near the floor. Reaching in, she
removes a bag for Wunderbread. Looking at the bag, we notice that the bread
inside is quite moldy.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane :</b> (thought VO) Penicillin. Yum.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jane drops the bread into the trash, and opens the overhead cupboards.
Rummaging around a bit, she removes a can of peaches.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane :</b> I guess these will have to do. Now where’s that can opener?</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fade to the front door. Jane picks up her backpack and opens the door to
reveal the entire landscape covered in snow. Dropping her pack, she unzips it to
remove a sketchbook.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane :</b> (thought VO) I’ve got to have this. It just looks so cool.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The camera pans to show Jane’s sketchbook. Jane is drawing quickly in
pencil, sketching out the landscape in front of her. Finally, Jane takes her
thumb to smear a few select lines. Jane looks from the sketch to the landscape,
apparently satisfied with the result. Putting the sketchbook back in her bag,
she zips it up and looks at her watch.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane :</b> (thought VO) Shit! I’m late!</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jane runs out the front door, closing it loudly as she leaves.</p>
</i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i>
<p>Dissolve to the exterior of Lawndale High. Jane comes running up to the front
door, stopping for a second to catch her breath. Renewed, she pushes the door
open and heads for her locker. In the distance, we see Daria closing her locker
and starting to head to class.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane :</b> (thought VO) Go on Daria. You wouldn’t want to be late…</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Jane walks up to her locker, Daria is standing nearby, waiting for Jane to
arrive. As Jane begins to open her locker, Daria addresses her friend.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Daria :</b> Mix up those time zones again?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Laugh it up funny girl. I had an … um … snow related incident.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Anything broken?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Trent’s car.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Accident?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>No, but it’s broken.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Any bodily injury?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane :</b> (thought VO) Wrong kind of ‘incident’ amiga …</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Don’t worry, I’m fine. We’d better get to class, or we could
miss the beginning of econ!</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Money good, taxes bad. That’s about all you need to know.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Are you saying that you can embody all of humanity with those two
statements?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Economically. For the general case, you need to add ‘sex good’
to the list.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>And how would you know?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> I’ve heard rumors …</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Sure you have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i>
<p>Cut to Mrs. Bennett’s class. Daria is seated next to Jane towards the front
of the classroom. Rather than the usual X’s and O’s, there are actual
economic terms on the blackboard.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Daria :</b> Wait, are we actually learning something real about economics?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>It must be something in the water.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Wild Turkey?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>But doesn’t that require actual knowledge of the subject?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Not really. Just a good teacher’s edition.</p>
<b>
<p>Bennett :</b> Class? As you should know, we’re starting are unit on
monetary policies and their effect on the overall economy. Can anyone give me a
concise definition of the available money supply?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i>
<p>As Mrs. Bennett asks, Kevin raises his hand.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane :</b> (thought VO) Once again, Lawndale’s finest rear their ugly
heads.</p>
<b>
<p>Kevin : </b>Isn’t that, like the money in your pocket?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane :</b> (thought VO) Gee, money would be nice …</p>
<b>
<p>Bennett :</b> Not quite Kevin. Let’s put it another way. If the government
were to print an extra $100 and give it to you, how much would the money supply
increase by?</p>
<b>
<p>Kevin : </b>I don’t get it.</p>
<b>
<p>Bennett :</b> How much extra money would be in circulation?</p>
<b>
<p>Kevin : </b>Like, none. It’s all mine, isn’t it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i>
<p>Mrs. Bennett sighs and turns to Daria.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Bennett :</b> Daria? If the government were to print and distribute an extra
$100, how much would the money supply increase by?</p>
<b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</b><i>
<p>Jane looks at Daria, noticing a look of assurance on her face.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane :</b> (thought VO) Game, set, and match.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria : </b>Well, let’s see. If we assume a net tax rate of twenty-five
percent, a marginal propensity to spend of ninety percent, and consider a
balanced rate of imports and exports, the original one hundred should result in,
oh (thinking for a moment) one hundred fifty five and, um, seventy seven cents?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i>
<p>Mrs. Bennett looks at Daria with a surprised expression for a moment, then
turns back to her notes.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Bennett : </b>Um, yes, I think that’s about right …</p>
<b>
<p>Jane :</b> (thought VO) Of course it is. That’s why you called on her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i>
<p>Mrs. Bennett walks back behind her desk, and begins looking through her
bottom desk drawer.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennett stands up with a notebook and a box from her desk. Placing the
box on her desk, she opens up the notebook and begins reading.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Bennett : </b>Class? Today and tomorrow we’re going to be playing a game.
The purpose of the game is to help you to understand monetary systems and
security and commodity exchanges by simulating these systems in the classroom.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> (to Jane) Do you think that they use real gas in the ovens for
when we fail?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane :</b> (thought VO) With current prices?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(imitating Ms. Li) Ms. Morgendorffer! Do you have any idea how
much gas costs? There are far more economical ways of suicide that are much
cheaper for this administration …</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Daria laughs softly.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Daria : </b>Unfortunately, its not all that far-fetched. (to Mrs. Bennett)
Why exactly are we playing this game now? Shouldn’t we cover the stock
exchange in class first?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane :</b> (thought VO) What was that from the paper? Something about …</p>
<b>
<p>Bennett : </b>Well, Ms. Li has declared this to be game week, for examining
the potential of games to effectively teach scholastic concepts.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Now this wouldn’t have anything to do with the big conference on
new and innovative educational initiatives announced this weekend, would it?</p>
<b>
<p>Bennett : </b>You would have to ask Ms. Li about that …</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennett looks at the class, noticing that Daria seems to be staring
blankly into space. Jane looks over, following Mrs. Bennett’s stare, and spies
Daria.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane :</b> (thought VO) Lost in thought. I hope she left a trail of
breadcrumbs.</p>
<b>
<p>Bennett :</b> Daria? Is something wrong?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i>
<p>As Mrs. Bennett looks on in concern, Daria slowly raises her head to look her
in the eye.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Daria : </b>How much is the grant?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane :</b> (thought VO) Grant?</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jane watches Mrs. Bennett, noticing a slight expression of concern forming on
her face.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane :</b> (thought VO) Now how did she know that?</p>
<b>
<p>Bennett : </b>That’s none of your business …</p>
<b>
<p>Daria : </b>(to Jane) And once again, the great Ms. Li demonstrates the
principles on which a free market economy is based.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane :</b> Oh, I’m sure that there’s a point to all this.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Metal detectors for the door?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Does that mean I can’t bring my art knives without being
harassed?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria : </b>Jane, I don’t think that an 8&quot; fixed blade knife counts as
an art supply.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane :</b> Depends how you use it … You know, I don’t think that I like
all this security stuff after all.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> (shaking head) Jane, Jane. I think you mean to say that security
is double-plus ungood, right?</p>
<b>
<p>Bennett :</b> (turning around) OK class, here’s the game. Each of you will
receive a fixed sum of money and a selection of securities. The goal is to end
the game at the conclusion of tomorrow’s class with the greatest amount of
money. Information about the performance of the individual securities will be
given at sporadic intervals through selected persons, and a computer will
generate book prices at the end of class.</p>
<b>
<p>Bennett :</b> At the finish of class, any securities held will be valued at
their book prices. Any questions?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane :</b> (thought VO) Is this mandatory?</p>
<b>
<p>Brittany : </b>Um, what’s a security?</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cut to the hallways of Lawndale High. Daria and Jane are heading towards
their next class as they discuss Mrs. Bennett’s class.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane : </b>So it looks like we’re in for a full day of games?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> So much for catching up on my sleep.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane :</b> Oh, you never know. We have O’Neil next. Maybe we’ll play the
silence game!</p>
<b>
<p>Daria : </b>If you’ll remember, that didn’t go over very well with Ms. Li
…</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>That’s only because you refused to talk to her.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> What, you want me to become a loser?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Become?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria : </b>Thanks for the friendly support.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>You want support, get a wonderbra.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Like anyone would notice.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>I’m sure Tom would be appreciative …</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Is this the voice of experience?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane :</b> (thought VO) Like Tom would have noticed one on me …</p>
<b>
<p>Jane :</b> (shooting Daria a glare) The depths of my experience go far beyond
your limited comprehension, mere mortal …</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Well, now that the insanity has set in, it’s time for class.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fade to Mr. O’Neil’s classroom. Daria, Jodie, and Brittany are sitting in
three seats located in front of the usual front row. On the blackboard behind
them are a number of papers taped to the board with ascending numerical values.
Mr. O’Neil stands behind the desk, preparing to address the class.</p>
</i><b>
<p>O’Neil : </b>Ok class, now that you’re all here</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>I’m not!</p>
<b>
<p>Jane :</b> (thought VO) Since I don’t think here, I must not exist here. I
wonder if that’ll get me out of this stupid class?</p>
<b>
<p>O’Neil :</b> What?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>I’m not here.</p>
<b>
<p>O’Neil :</b> Then where are you?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Whoa. That’s way too deep for your classroom …</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(thought VO) And anyway, I don’t feel like seeing Ms. Manson
today.</p>
<b>
<p>O’Neil :</b> (warily) Um, Ok … Well, getting back to class … Today we’re
playing literary jeopardy. Can anyone imagine anything more exciting?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(thought VO) A good game of quarters?</p>
<b>
<p>O’Neil : </b>Anyway, each student will be in a group of three for a ten
minute session, or until the questions run out. The winner will get a free
Snickers bar.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>King size?</p>
<b>
<p>O’Neil : </b>Um, no. The school can’t afford it.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Too bad. I’m just not motivated by a mere regular Snickers …</p>
<b>
<p>O’Neil : </b>Actually, they’re snack size.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> In that case, bring on the questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i>
<p>Mr. O’Neil looks concerned, but reaches into his desk to remove a few
bundles from his desk.</p>
</i><b>
<p>O’Neil : </b>OK, who would like to start. Brittany?</p>
<b>
<p>Brittany : </b>Um, OK?</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. O’Neil looks at Brittany expectantly for a long moment.</p>
</i><b>
<p>O’Neil : </b>Um, Brittany? You have to choose a category first.</p>
<b>
<p>Brittany : </b>Oh. Um, I’ll take Hysterical Geeks for, um, 100?</p>
<b>
<p>O’Neil : </b>Uh, Brittany? That’s Historical Greeks.</p>
<b>
<p>Brittany : </b>Oh, (twirling hair) Ok.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(thought VO) This is gonna be a long game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i>
<p>Mr. O’Neil removes a card and reads the answer.</p>
</i><b>
<p>O’Neil : </b>This Greek hero made war in Troy, where he was killed by an
arrow to the heel.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(thought VO) Lucky him …</p>
<b>
<p>Brittany : </b>(ringing in) True!</p>
<b>
<p>O’Neil :</b> Um, Brittany, this isn’t a true/false question.</p>
<b>
<p>Brittany : </b>False?</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. O’Neil sighs as Brittany’s time runs out, and Daria chimes in.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Daria :</b> Who was Achilles?</p>
<b>
<p>O’Neil : </b>Very good Daria. Would you like to choose the next category?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> How about Dystopian Worldviews for 100?</p>
<b>
<p>O’Neil : </b>Oh. Um, this author portrayed a dim, authoritarian future in
his book named for the temperature at which paper burns.</p>
<b>
<p>Jodie : </b>(chiming in) Who is Ray Bradbury?</p>
<b>
<p>O’Neil : </b>Very good Jodie!</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cut to a few minutes later. Jodie, Daria, and Brittany are still in the front
of the room. We see that Daria and Jodie are tied at 1500, with Brittany
scoreless.</p>
</i><b>
<p>O’Neil : </b>Daria, would you like to choose the final question?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> I’ll take Historical Greeks for 500.</p>
<b>
<p>O’Neil : </b>What famous Greek was the son of Zeus, and later went on to
become a god himself?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> (ringing in) Heracles.</p>
<b>
<p>O’Neil : </b>Oh, I’m sorry Daria, that isn’t correct. Jodie?</p>
<b>
<p>Jodie : </b>Hercules.</p>
<b>
<p>O’Neil : </b>Well, that concludes the first game …</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> (interrupting) Excuse me, but I think you’ll find that Hercules
is the Roman name for the son of Jupiter. The Greek name is Heracles, or ‘glory
of Hera’.</p>
<b>
<p>O’Neil : </b>Um, well, we don’t actually have a book here …</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Tell you what. Let me go to the library to check on it.</p>
<b>
<p>O’Neil : </b>Well, I guess that’s OK …</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Do you really want the candy that badly?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> (to Jane) Hell no. I just saw a chance to get the hell out of
here for a while. Ciao.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Daria leaves the room, leaving Jane slightly bemused and slightly annoyed.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane : </b>(thought VO) Sure, leave me here all alone.</p>
<b>
<p>O’Neil :</b> OK class, the next game will be between Kevin Taylor, Jane
Lane, and Michael Mackenzie.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Great. Couldn’t he just leave me out of this?</p>
<b>
<p>O’Neil :</b> Come up and have a seat. I’ll just track down the next set
of questions.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. O’Neil reaches into his desk and removes another set of cards.</p>
</i><b>
<p>O’Neil :</b> Hmmm. These seem to be a different color … Well, is
everybody ready?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(thought VO) Would it make a difference?</p>
<b>
<p>O’Neil :</b> Mack? Would you like to choose first?</p>
<b>
<p>Mack :</b> Um, how about Historical Greeks for $200?</p>
<b>
<p>O’Neil : </b>(reading the card) Ok … Between which two cities did Oedipus
encounter his father Laius?</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jane and Mack exchange a look of concern, both clearly having no idea as to
the answer. As they do, Kevin rings in.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Kevin : </b>Um, Boston?</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. O’Neil looks at Kevin disdainfully, and shakes his head.</p>
</i><b>
<p>O’Neil : </b>That is not correct Kevin. I’m sorry. Jane? Would you like
to choose?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>How about Planes, Trains, and Automobiles for $100?</p>
<b>
<p>O’Neil : </b>Let’s see. What was the name of the radio-gunner killed in
Yossarian’s plane over Avingon?</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
</i><b>
<p>O’Neil : </b>Well, moving on …</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(thought VO) I doubt that even Daria and Jodie would know these
…</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fade to later in the class. Jane and Mack are both scoreless, and Kevin has a
score of -$2400. Mr. O’Neil looks dissatisfied at the results, but doesn’t
seem to realize why people are having difficulty with his questions.</p>
</i><b>
<p>O’Neil :</b> For the final answer, this is the first name of the Chief’s
father in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s nest.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one answers.</p>
</i><b>
<p>O’Neil :</b> Come on, take a guess.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>I can’t guess, I have no idea.</p>
<b>
<p>O’Neil :</b> Mack?</p>
<b>
<p>Mack :</b> Sorry Mr. O’Neil. These questions are just hard.</p>
<b>
<p>O’Neil : </b>I wonder if that’s why I color coded them …</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(thought VO) You mean this twerp can’t even remember how he
coded the cards? How … expected.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cut to Mr. DeMartino’s classroom. Mr. DeMartino is at the front of the
classroom, corralling the students into a confused group rather than allowing
them to take their usual seats. Daria and Jane walk into the classroom, and both
turn and look at the group with a little confusion. Seeing this, Mr. DeMartino
walks over to the two.</p>
</i><b>
<p>DeMartino : </b>Daria, Jane. If you would care to join us, the ENTIRE class
will be LEAVING for the COMPUTER lab.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(to Daria) And if we don’t?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> (to Jane) Room 101. (to DeMartino) Excuse me, but what are we
going to be doing at the computer lab?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(thought VO) Same thing we do anywhere, sit around and pretend to
learn?</p>
<b>
<p>DeMartino :</b> As you are no doubt AWARE, Ms. Li has DECIDED to replace the
usual CLASSROOM ACTIVITIES with GAMES. Given that this IS HISTORY, and that WAR,
conflict, and ambition are such MAJOR motivators, we are going to give you
STUdents the opportunity to ATTEMPT to follow in the footsteps of OTHERS and
LEARN something about creating an EMPIRE.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> We’re planning an invasion of France?</p>
<b>
<p>DeMartino : </b>(laughing slightly) An AMUSING concept Ms. Morgendorffer, but
regrettably, Ms. Li wouldn’t release sufficient funds from the school budget.
So instead, you get to TEST yourself against a COMPUTER.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>A computer?</p>
<b>
<p>DeMartino :</b> You will be testing yourself against the abilities of
Civilization II.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> The triumph of artificial intelligence over natural stupidity?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>I’ll start the betting pool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i>
<p>Cut to the computer lab. It is a predominantly off-white color, with flimsy
looking tables arranged along the outside walls. On each table are two somewhat
dated computers, and a random distribution of free mouse pads alongside.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Daria :</b> Another archaeological expedition?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Nope. Same old lab.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Like I said …</p>
<b>
<p>DeMartino : </b>Ok class, for the next two days we will be meeting down here.
You will be divided into groups, so that you will not only be working against
the computer, but your classmates as well.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> (to Jane) Why am I not concerned?</p>
<b>
<p>DeMartino : </b>We will be playing a game called Civilization II. I know that
the CONCEPT of civilization may be BEYOND you, but REST assured that this will
not PREVENT you from PARTICIPATING.</p>
<b>
<p>DeMartino : </b>Each group will have three students, and the remainder will
be comprised of computer players. Your goal is to win. Any victory is
acceptable. You will be graded both on your overall performance as well as the
performance relative to your classmates.</p>
<b>
<p>DeMartino : </b>Ok, I have divided the class into teams. The first team is
comprised of Daria Morgendorffer, Jodie Landon, and Brittany Taylor.</p>
<b>
<p>Brittany : </b>But how can I be on the team? I’m a cheerleader!</p>
<b>
<p>DeMartino : </b>(frustrated) Just take a seat Brittany. (Bt) The second team
is comprised of Jane Lane, Kevin Thompson, and Charles Ruttheimer.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(thought VO) Life sucks.</p>
<b>
<p>Upchuck : </b>Ms. Lane, if I may be so bold …</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i>
<p>Jane turns and stares at Charles with an icy glare. Charles stops in mid
sentence, and turns back to find a computer.</p>
<p>As Mr. DeMartino continues to distribute the rest of the class into teams,
the students spread out and choose a computer. Jane pulls up a seat next to
Daria, and logs into the system.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane : </b>Well this is a royal waste of time …</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Actually, the game itself isn’t half bad. And you get the
chance to utterly annihilate Upchuck.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>After he tried so hard to get us together?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i>
<p>Daria simply turns to Jane, remaining absolutely silent.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane : </b>(thought VO) Come on Daria, relax a little!</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Hey, take a joke Daria! (Bt) So, any suggestions for the game?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Why Jane, is that a plea for help?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Well, my grade could use a little help, now that you mention it
…</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> (thinking) Um … expand quickly, keep a good defense, and don’t
listen to anything Kevin says.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>That last one goes without saying.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> You’ll get the hang of it.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>So, would you be up for some pizza after school?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Um, Jane? I’m meeting Tom after school today.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(thought VO) Of course. Leaving me alone once again. Although …
I did the exact same thing when I was in her place.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(warily) Isn’t it awfully early for your usual date?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Well, uh, he’s taking me to dinner, then we’re meeting his
friends at the bowling alley.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i>
<p>Jane turns and stifles a laugh. Daria looks at Jane in surprise.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Daria :</b> Ok, out with it. What’s so funny.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Oh, nothing.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(thought VO) Someone’s in for a surprise …</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Is there something wrong with Tom’s friends?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>There’s nothing … bad per se. They’re an … interesting
bunch.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria : </b>(warily) OK …</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Come on now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i>
<p>Jane looks at Daria, pondering the situation for a moment.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane : </b>Daria! Are you worried?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Um, no. I’m fine.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Oh, you are! That’s so cute!</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Go to hell Jane.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Come on Daria! There’s nothing wrong with being cute …</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> And if I said that you looked cute right now?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(smirking) I’d deck you.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Women.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fade to Casa Lane, living room. Jane enters the front door, placing her bag
on the ground. As the camera pans, we see Trent sitting on the living room couch
asleep, with an acoustic guitar tightly gripped in his hands. Jane closes the
door, which rouses Trent from his sleep.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Trent :</b> Janey?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>That’s me. Sorry I woke you.</p>
<b>
<p>Trent :</b> You didn’t wake me. I was practicing my fingering.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(thought VO) Musicians are not to be taken out of context.
Remember that …</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Trent, you were snoring.</p>
<b>
<p>Trent :</b> Well …</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Why were you practicing anyway?</p>
<b>
<p>Trent :</b> Oh, um, we’ve got a gig tonight. I thought I should be ready.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Why?</p>
<b>
<p>Trent :</b> Uh, you know, I don’t know. But it seemed like a really good
idea this morning.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Maybe you should get some of those memory enhancing pills …</p>
<b>
<p>Trent :</b> Um, OK.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(shaking her head) Never mind.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jane starts to walk out of the living room when Trent shouts a question to
her.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Trent :</b> Um, Jane? Do you know why Jesse smelled like lemon this morning?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(continuing to walk) I have no idea …</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fade to the interior of an art store. Jane is looking through the store
carefully.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane : </b>Let’s see. Paints. (scanning the shelves) Ah, snow white.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jane picks up two tubes of white paint and a single tube of red paint,
placing them in her basket.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane : </b>Sparkles. What would sparkle? Glitter?</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jane walks over to the adjacent aisle, and checks through a number of
packages before finally selecting a shimmering opalescent glitter.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane : </b>(thought VO) This just might work.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Jane moves towards the checkout, something catches her eye. Stopping, she
looks down to see a package of play money. Picking up the package, she studies
it carefully.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane : </b>(thought VO) You know, I think this is the same money Mrs. Bennett
was using in econ.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jane ponders this for a second, and then begins to remove a number of
packages from the shelves.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane : </b>Hello good grades …</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cut to Jane’s room. Jane is at her easel, painting on a canvas. We see that
Jane is attempting to re-create the landscape from that morning, but the
painting seems flat. Jane picks up her palette, mixing the white paint with the
glitter, and applying it to the snow-covered landscape. While the painting is
significantly improved, it’s still not quite right.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane : </b>It’s missing something …</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jane studies the painting for a while, looking at it from a variety of
different angles. Sighing, she drops her brush and sits down on her bed.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane : </b>(thought VO) It’s no use. I’m just … bored.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jane picks up the TV remote and turns on the television.</p>
</i><b>
<p>SSW announcer :</b> What happens when a group of psychiatrists decides to
make a career in music? The vocal stylings of Pink Freud, next on Sick Sad
World.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jane lays back in her bed, the remote still in her hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fade to later, still in Jane’s room. Jane is asleep in her bed when the
front door is heard closing loudly. Jane stirs slightly, rolling over on top of
the remote.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Nick : </b>(VO) Ouch! Watch it! I told you not to drop the amp on my foot!</p>
<b>
<p>Max : </b>(VO) Well, anyone could see where I was putting it down. How can I
work around those huge feet anyway?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(slowly waking up) And I thought their music was loud. Well, time
to make an appearance.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jane gets out of her bed, turning the television off as she does.
Straightening her clothes, she heads downstairs. Reaching the living room, we
see audio equipment scattered about the floor, with Nick and Max arguing about
who should be moving what.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane : </b>Guys?</p>
<b>
<p>Nick : </b>(turning) Oh, hey Jane.</p>
<b>
<p>Max : </b>Um, hi.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Is Trent around?</p>
<b>
<p>Nick : </b>He and Jesse took a load out to the tank. They should be back
soon.</p>
<b>
<p>Max : </b>Unless they’re waiting for us …</p>
<b>
<p>Nick :</b> Well, if you would just take the amp like I told you …</p>
<b>
<p>Max : </b>But you’re supposed to take the amp!</p>
<b>
<p>Trent : </b>(entering through the front door) Are you two still arguing about
that?</p>
<b>
<p>Jesse :</b> (following closely behind Trent) We’re gonna be late.</p>
<b>
<p>Trent : </b>Here, give me the amp.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trent walks over and picks up the amp, as Nick and Max guiltily pick up some
of the smaller equipment.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane : </b>Say, you guys got room for one more in the Tank?</p>
<b>
<p>Trent : </b>As long as you aren’t too picky about seats.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Anything to get me away from here …</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fade to the Zon. Jane is standing alone, watching Mystik Spiral on stage.
From her left, a young man approaches her.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Man :</b> Hey, come here often? Because I’d think I’d remember you.
(looking at Jane) Wait, I’ve met you before. Um, Jane, right?</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jane looks at the man for a second, then turns her head away.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane : </b>Oh, its you.</p>
<b>
<p>Man : </b>Actually, I go by Paul.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Yes, I know.</p>
<b>
<p>Paul :</b> Look, I’m sorry about Mike. He can be a real ass when he’s
drunk. Actually, he can be a real ass sober as well.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>So why do you hang around with him?</p>
<b>
<p>Paul :</b> Well, um, he’s my friend.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>I suppose its easier for you. After all, he’s not likely to hit
on you.</p>
<b>
<p>Paul :</b> Well …</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>You’re kidding!</p>
<b>
<p>Paul : </b>(apologetic) He was REALLY drunk that night …</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>So, did you …</p>
<b>
<p>Paul : </b>Yech, no. (matter of fact) Actually, I spent most of the night
making sure he didn’t choke on his own vomit.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>What a pleasant picture.</p>
<b>
<p>Paul : </b>I’d hate to know someone died if I could have prevented it. Even
obnoxious self-involved bastards like Mike.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Well, I’ll admit that you’re much more pleasant without him
around. (Bt) He’s not here, is he?</p>
<b>
<p>Paul : </b>Not anymore. He left with some blonde bimbo about an hour ago …</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Um, this bimbo. Did she have a high, squeaky voice, and the
intelligence of wallpaper?</p>
<b>
<p>Paul :</b> That sounds about right.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Most interesting …</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(thought VO) I wonder what Kevin’s up to tonight?</p>
<b>
<p>Paul :</b> Hey, can I get you a beer?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Um, no thanks.</p>
<b>
<p>Paul :</b> Are you still annoyed at me for that whole Mike thing?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>No, I’m annoyed at him, not you. I just don’t really like
beer. Its just, um, disgusting …</p>
<b>
<p>Paul :</b> Stay here. I’ll be right back.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(thought VO) I’ve heard that one before.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paul walks over to the bar, and after a brief conversation with the
bartender, he returns with a mug of beer and a large glass filled with a colored
liquid. He hands the glass to Jane and takes a sip of his beer.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Paul : </b>Try that. I think it’ll go down a little better.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jane takes a tentative sip of the drink, then immediately takes a
significantly larger gulp.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane : </b>This is pretty good. What is it?</p>
<b>
<p>Paul :</b> Uh, its called Sex on the Beach.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Sex on the Beach?</p>
<b>
<p>Paul :</b> Hey, I didn’t name it. Vodka, peach schnapps, cranberry juice,
and pineapple juice.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Whatever its called, its better than beer …</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i>
<p>Fade to later in the night. Jane and Paul are sitting at a table, talking.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Paul : </b>So I came home from the library, only to find Mike naked and
handcuffed to his bed. Apparently, one of his girlfriends didn’t take kindly
to his ‘date early, date often’ policy.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>That must have been traumatic.</p>
<b>
<p>Paul :</b> Yeah. I almost died laughing. Thank God for digital cameras.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>You DIDN’T!</p>
<b>
<p>Paul : </b>Hey, as long as he meets my terms, they won’t ‘accidentally’
find their way onto a particularly nasty newsgroup.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>And how would you know about those newsgroups?</p>
<b>
<p>Paul :</b> Hey, a single guy’s got to do something for fun …</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>OK, more information than I needed to know.</p>
<b>
<p>Paul :</b> Hey, its nothing unusual. Are you saying that you’ve never
looked around?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Um … I plead the fifth?</p>
<b>
<p>Paul :</b> Typical. Well, looks like the last set is almost over.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Well, I should get going then. The band’s kind of my ride.</p>
<b>
<p>Paul :</b> My condolences.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Hey, they’re not too bad. Just water them and turn them towards
the light periodically.</p>
<b>
<p>Paul :</b> As long as you have a plan.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Hey, much to my surprise, it was actually nice talking to you
tonight …</p>
<b>
<p>Paul :</b> Thanks, I think.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jane reaches into her pocket and removes a slip of paper and a pen.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane : </b>Here, let me give you my phone number.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jane scribbles a number on the slip of paper, handing it to Paul. Paul takes
the slip and folds it, placing it in his wallet.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Paul : </b>Thanks. I’ll, uh, let you get going then.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Um, OK …</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a moment of awkward silence, Jane turns and heads backstage to meet up
with the band.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane : </b>(thought VO) Wow, that actually went pretty well. You’ve still
got it Jane.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cut to Jane’s room. Jane has changed into a pair of shorts and a t-shirt.
She looks down at the clock, which is displaying 3:24.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane : </b>(thought VO) Three twenty-four? And I have to be up for classes
tomorrow? (Bt) You know what? It was worth it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i>
<p>Cut to the next day at Daria’s locker at Lawndale High. Daria and Jane walk
up to the lockers together.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane : </b>(thought VO) Well, no bruises, scratches, or lacerations …</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>So how was the big date last night?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Oh, it went pretty well.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(surprised) It did?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Yup. We caught up with his friends and bowled a few games. They’re
an interesting bunch.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>So, it all went fine with them? No problems?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Why Jane, is there something you’d like to ask?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(conciliatory) Was Chris there?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Yup.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>And?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> She said she liked me.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Liar.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Ask Tom yourself. (Bt) How did you two hit it off?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Tom had to restrain me, and Chris was laughing the whole time.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> And why didn’t I hear about this earlier?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(thought VO) Because you were off with your Dad, and sick of
hearing about Tom?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>No desire to be teased?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> I guess I can accept that.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>So, after bowling did you two explore bold new frontiers?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Jane, we watched movies. On the couch.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>You wild woman you.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(thought VO) I wonder if Daria would even know what to do if she
wanted to …</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Hey, you know me. So how was your night?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Not bad. I went out with Trent to the Zon, sat around, the usual.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Is that it?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Well, no. But that’s all you’re going to get now.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Jane!</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(playful) Nope.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(thought VO) At least not until I find out if he’s going to call
me …</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cut to Mrs. Bennett’s room. The students are milling about, buying and
selling the ‘securities’. Jane seems to be participating reluctantly,
whereas Daria has a huge group of students around her desk.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Daria :</b> Now who would like to buy some (looking at the certificate)
publishing limited? Moving it out at a low price.</p>
<b>
<p>Jodie : </b>And why is that?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> I would like to re-balance my portfolio, and need some cash.</p>
<b>
<p>Upchuck : </b>Fairest Daria, I would love the opportunity to purchase some of
your stock.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Sure thing, Upchuck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Daria completes the transaction with Upchuck, and continues to work through
the line until she is out of stock.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Daria :</b> OK, I’m all out. Find someone else to buy from.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the crowd spreads out, Daria heads over to an unidentified male student.</p>
<p>Daria returns to her desk, and begins to look through her holdings. As she
does, Mrs. Bennett can be heard in the background.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Bennett : </b>OK class, five more minutes.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The announcement sends the class into a bit of a frenzy, and Daria can be
seen talking with a few students about the class. Jane watches in amusement,
making a scant few transactions. Finally, Mrs. Bennett calls an end to the game.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Bennett : </b>Class, that concludes the game. Now let’s all count our
equities to see how everyone did.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The class sits down and counts for a few minutes, and finally everyone looks
up, finished with the tally.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Bennett : </b>So how did people do? Kevin?</p>
<b>
<p>Kevin : </b>Um, I have, like $500.</p>
<b>
<p>Bennett :</b> Kevin, you started with $50,000.</p>
<b>
<p>Kevin : </b>Oh.</p>
<b>
<p>Bennett :</b> Brittany?</p>
<b>
<p>Brittany :</b> Um, like, $2500, I think?</p>
<b>
<p>Bennett : </b>(shaking her head) Jodie?</p>
<b>
<p>Jodie : </b>(disappointed) $10,000</p>
<b>
<p>Bennett : </b>Um, does anyone have MORE than $50,000?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>I’ve got $750,000.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria : </b>I’ve got $1.1 million.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet looks between Daria and Jane with surprise.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Bennett : </b>And how exactly did you manage that?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria : </b>No SEC.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>And no Secret Service either.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cut to the hallway. Daria and Jane are heading towards Mr. DeMartino’s
classroom as they discuss the game.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane : </b>So, how did you manage to get so much money?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(thought VO) Or more correctly, how did you get more than me even
though I cheated?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Oh, once you realize it, its quite simple. For one, I found
someone with a large pool of stock, and bought up some of the same stock. I then
sold theirs short, and dumped mine to drive down the price. And once I managed
to corner the money supply, I was all set.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Did you get all that from our econ text?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria : </b>Nope. Basic mob psychology. Lead and they will follow.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane :</b> Impressive.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria : </b>Now, how did you manage to do so well? I mean, we ended up with
more money than we started with. Significantly more.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>I paid a visit to the store where she got the money.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Daria turns to look at Jane.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Daria : </b>Securities fraud, profiteering, and counterfeiting all in one
day. Not bad …</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>For once, school teaches us skills applicable to the real world.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cut to Mr. DeMartino’s classroom, towards the end of class. Daria and Jane
are sitting next to each other, playing their games. Daria looks like she’s
concentration intensely, whereas Jane merely looks resigned. Shrugging, Jane
pulls her chair up to Daria’s computer.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane : </b>Well, thanks to Kevin, we all managed to lose.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Kevin?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>The AI destroyed him before we had a chance to, and then just
rolled over Upchuck and me.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> As long as Kevin went first and pathetically, I don’t think you
have a problem.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>So, how’s your game going?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Not bad. Brittany beat Jodie, which I doubt she was happy with.
Now she’s bothering me up here (pointing at the screen)</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Wow, you’re huge!</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> You’d better be referring to the game …</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Touchy, touchy.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria : </b>Brittany is just obnoxious. She can’t figure out the game very
well, but she’s got a nasty tactical sense.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Huh?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria : </b>Well, I think she’s attacking up here. (points to a small
island)</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>So, you’re defending?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria : </b>Actually, I can’t possibly defend those cities well.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>So …</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Actually, I’m attacking her capital. I’m ready to be done
with this game soon, and Brittany hasn’t realized that she can see my moves
…</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cut to the cafeteria. Daria and Jane are sitting at their table, eating their
lunches.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Daria :</b> How can the cafeteria manage to screw up dry toast?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>They hire only Lawndale graduates as cooks?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Remind me again why we eat here …</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>I’ve got no food in my house, and you’ve got Jake’s cooking.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Thanks. (looking at her tray) Starvation is looking better and
better.</p>
<b>
<p>Jamie :</b> (VO) Are you two complaining about the food again?</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The camera pans around to reveal Jamie standing behind Daria.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Daria :</b> Well, what would you suggest doing with it?</p>
<b>
<p>Jamie :</b> Well, you could eat it, you know.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Not a very pleasant course of action.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> We have our health to think about here.</p>
<b>
<p>Jamie :</b> Well, it can’t actually be dangerous, can it?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> (looking at her food) Can you prove it?</p>
<b>
<p>Jamie :</b> Well, I’m not dead yet …</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Give it time.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Just don’t die in front of the cafeteria. People have a tendency
to disappear.</p>
<b>
<p>Jamie :</b> Um, OK …</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Jane, that’s never been proven.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Doesn’t mean it isn’t true.</p>
<b>
<p>Jamie :</b> (shaking his head) Um, I’m gonna go eat while I can still
stomach food.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(thought VO) I wonder if Daria realizes that he’s got a little
crush on her. I swear, that girl can be so oblivious sometimes.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jamie heads off, leaving Daria and Jane alone at the table.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane : </b>Yet another victim.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Shall we cut a notch in the table?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Sounds a bit trite…</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Spoilsport.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>That’s why I’m here.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Daria and Jane turn to their plates and begin to eat, Jodie and Mack sit
down next to Daria and Jane.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Mack :</b> Daria? Jane? Did something happen in economics? Jodie’s, um,
been in a bit of a funk since then.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jodie looks at Mack with an annoyed glare, but says nothing.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Daria :</b> Jodie? Are you OK?</p>
<b>
<p>Jodie : </b>Fine.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Are you mad about something?</p>
<b>
<p>Jodie : </b>How did you two do so well in that stock market game?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Do you promise not to tell?</p>
<b>
<p>Jodie : </b>(warily) I suppose …</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> For me, securities fraud and blatant price manipulation.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>And for me, counterfeiting.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jodie looks between Daria and Jane in amazement.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jodie :</b> You cheated?</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Yup.</p>
<b>
<p>Jodie : </b>But that’s not fair!</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Jodie, didn’t you tell when we were looking for a loan that you
were right to use all methods at your disposal?</p>
<b>
<p>Jodie : </b>Yes …</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Even if they’re not fair?</p>
<b>
<p>Jodie : </b>Um, I suppose …</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> There were no rules against it, were there?</p>
<b>
<p>Jodie : </b>No …</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Then what’s the problem?</p>
<b>
<p>Jodie : </b>Well …</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Just cheer up Jodie. It’s just a stupid assignment.</p>
<b>
<p>Jodie :</b> But we’re being graded on it.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Jodie, you probably did better than anyone but the two of us. You’ll
be fine.</p>
<b>
<p>Jodie :</b> I suppose …</p>
<b>
<p>Mack :</b> Come on Jodie. It’s not the end of the world …</p>
<b>
<p>Jodie :</b> It just seems wrong, that’s all.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Get used to it. Life’s a bitch.</p>
<b>
<p>Jodie : </b>(sardonically) You’re in a good mood today.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Actually, I am.</p>
<b>
<p>Mack : </b>That’s a bit frightening.</p>
<b>
<p>Daria :</b> Thanks. I try.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cut to Jane’s room, later that night. Jane is standing, studying her
painting.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane : </b>(to painting) You’re mocking me. I just know it.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the painting does not respond.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane : </b>You can be so difficult sometimes.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Jane says this, Trent walks by the door. Hearing her, he stops and looks
into the room.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Trent :</b> Um, Janey?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Huh? (looking towards the door) Oh, hey Trent.</p>
<b>
<p>Trent :</b> Um, who were you talking to?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>The painting. It’s not being cooperative.</p>
<b>
<p>Trent :</b> Oh yeah, I know what that’s like. My guitar’s like that
sometimes …</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(thought VO) For instance, whenever you’re on stage?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>So how do you deal with it?</p>
<b>
<p>Trent :</b> Um, I don’t …</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Huh?</p>
<b>
<p>Trent :</b> Eventually, it’ll reach out to you.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>The painting?</p>
<b>
<p>Trent :</b> Sure.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Do you know how weird that sounds?</p>
<b>
<p>Trent :</b> Hey man, I’m a musician. I don’t have to worry about that …</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Actually, I would think that a musician would be very concerned
with how they sound …</p>
<b>
<p>Trent :</b> That’s a really good point. (heading away) I should probably
work on that …</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Thank you, O Brother of Mine.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jane is just about to return to her painting when the phone rings. Shrugging,
she drops her brush and picks up the phone.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane : </b>Yes?</p>
<b>
<p>Male Voice :</b> Is this Jane?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane :</b> And who might you be?</p>
<b>
<p>Male Voice :</b> It’s Paul.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Split screen between Jane and Paul.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane :</b> Oh, Hi!</p>
<b>
<p>Jane :</b> (thought VO) He actually called?</p>
<b>
<p>Paul :</b> Um, Hi. (nervously) How are you?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(bemused) You’re not very good at this, are you?</p>
<b>
<p>Paul : </b>(resigned) No. But I thought you weren’t supposed to admit that
you noticed?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>I’ve never been one to stand on tradition …</p>
<b>
<p>Paul :</b> Oh. Uh, would you be interested in dinner later this week?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>I’m always interested in dinner.</p>
<b>
<p>Paul :</b> You’re not going to make this easy, are you?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>(playfully) Now where would the fun be in that?</p>
<b>
<p>Paul :</b> Would you like to go out to dinner with me sometime this week?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Sure. I’d love to. Now was that so hard?</p>
<b>
<p>Paul :</b> Yes.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Builds character.</p>
<b>
<p>Paul :</b> Now you sound like my mother.</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>You’re name’s not Oedipus, is it?</p>
<b>
<p>Paul :</b> Oedipus? No. (Bt) He was one mean mother-fucker …</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>That’s horrible.</p>
<b>
<p>Paul :</b> Thanks. So, how about Thursday? Around eight?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>Sounds good to me. Meet you at the Zon?</p>
<b>
<p>Paul :</b> Sure. I’ll, um, see you then?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane : </b>It’s a date!</p>
<b>
<p>Paul :</b> Well, um, goodnight?</p>
<b>
<p>Jane :</b> Goodnight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<i>
<p>Collapse back to Jane’s room. Jane hangs up the phone with a smile on her
face. Standing up, she looks over at the painting. Grabbing a brush, she
hurriedly makes a few changes to the painting. Standing back, she looks it over
with a smile on her face.</p>
</i><b>
<p>Jane :</b> Perfect!</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fade out and roll credits.</p>
