<P><TT>Title: "Egg-cept Responsability" Fic #102</TT></P>

<P><TT>Previous Fics: #101. "Just Add Connor"</TT></P>

<P><TT>Summary: As a human development exercise for Ms. Barch's science
class, Daria and Connor are forced to experience what it's like to be married
for a week. But what they end up learning might not have anything to do
with the assignment. And what was that about an egg?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Quick note from "Hash": Okay, doing my own series and
all, I decided I would just copy all the other authors and make my own
little theme song sequence. By the way, the new clothing thing still stands,
as it will for the entire series k?And don't forget, it's the holiday season.
Okay then. Happy reading.</TT></P>

My Neck", ]</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Kevin and Brittany making out on Daria's locker, Daria has a pair
of cymbals. She bangs them together, Kevin runs.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Jodie, Mack, Daria, Jane, Tom, and Connor are all in some toy store
at the mall. Connor ducks as a stuffed bunny flies past his head hitting
Jane in the face, knocking her into a pile of Pokemon ripoff stuff.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Daria, Jane, and Connor standing in the hall, Connor trying to
open his locker. Doesn't work, he bangs his head into the locker, it flies
open.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Mr. O'Neil running out of his room, sobbing, Daria standing at
the front of the room with a piece of paper, with an evil grin. Connor
and Jane smirk approvingly.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Daria and Connor at his locker, which is again refusing to open,
he bangs his head again, it flies open.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Jane, Daria, and Connor working on a mural on the outside of the
school's library. Ms. Li passes by, a can of blue paint falls on her head.
Daria and Connor are trying not to laugh, Jane is smirking, she has blue
paint on her hands.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Connor sitting in the nurse's office holding an ice pack on his
head.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Daria, Connor, Tom, and Jane are in a booth at the Pizza King.
Mack and Jodie walk in, Jodie's pushing a stroller with an egg 'baby'.
The others look at each other for a second then start laughing hysterically.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Daria, Jane, and Connor at his locker, which once again will not
open. Connor gets ready to bang his head into it, but Daria stops him,
spins the lock once, and easily opens the locker. Connor looks amazed,
Daria and Jane are smirking. Zoom in on Daria in that little circle thing
that the show does, with black background...]</TT></P>

to their right, and Mack and Jodie behind them. Ms. Barch is standing at
the front of the room with a pile of large envelopes in front of her.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Ms. Barch: And so, as an assignment in human development (mumbles)
lousy subject guidelines...(aloud) you will all pair up as married couples
for a week. Of course, girls, this means you'll have to be paired with
those scum you call your classmates since the school would consider it (mockingly)
uncivil if I let you do otherwise.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Damn civil rights amendment. (Connor smirks)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Ms. Barch: So, everyone pair up and girls come get your marriage
packet with your name on it. (casually) Oh yeah, and don't forget to sign
your husband up on that sheet. (points to a post it note on the corner
of her desk.)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (to Daria) What do you say? Wanna be my wife for a week?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Depends. Will I get to keep the house? (Connor smirks)</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Mack just smirks and shakes his head. Jodie sees him and senses
something's up. She looks at him and he quickly collects himself and pretends
he didn't see anything.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Hey, at least you get to see all the weird stuff people hang
from their mirrors.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (raises eyebrow) Were you dropped on your head as a child?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: (looks considering) You know...I can't really remember. (perks
up) So what are you Daria?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: (looks at the sheet in Connor's hand, heavy sarcasm) Joy,
I'm a highly paid corporate executive with a handsome young male secretary
and no time for my husband. </TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: (raises an eyebrow) That's interesting.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: You're not gonna run off with your secretary, are you?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Depends on if I like his house better. (Connor smirks)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (reading from one of the papers) Woah. Did you know we lived
in a Victorian house in the Hamptons?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Flashy. Are you sure Daria doesn't just keep you in the basement?
(Connor glares at her) What? This is Ms. Barch that we're talking about
here.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: If my science grade didn't depend on it, I'd toss these
through a paper shredder and make you a paper mache muzzle.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: (raises an eyebrow) That's creative.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Unfortunately, you would fail.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Actually, you'll probably fail anyway. </TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Right. Because Ms. Barch is the anti-christ. (Daria smirks)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: But Daria would fail.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: I could just say he went into a jealous rage and beat me.
(Connor smirks)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: And then in court he pleaded insanity.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Unfortunately Helen was prosecuting attorney.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Causing him to receive life without parole. (Daria smirks.)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Wonder if we could pull that off...</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Don't even think about it.</TT></P>

What's with that stuff?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Human development assignment for Barch.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Trent: I had to do that. I think. Got paired up with some nerd.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: (not looking up from the painting) Who you later dated for
two weeks.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Trent: I did?</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Jane rolls her eyes. Daria and Connor exchange glances.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Trent: So, you two a couple?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Just for the assignment.</TT></P>

no one notices.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Tom: Hey. Your door was unlocked and no one was answering so I let
my self in.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Tom: Later. (sees the papers and stuff) Human development?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: (sarcastic) How did you guess?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Tom: Had the same assignment at my school. </TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: (raises an eyebrow) Oh really?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Tom: Yeah. Of course, I wasn't there the first day so I didn't have
to do it.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: I hate you.</TT></P>

of papers) We need to fill out all of these.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Might as well do it here. Quinn's having the Fashion Club
over for a meeting. I'll be stuck in my room all night anyway.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (confused) Why?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Fashion Club. Inside the house. I'm not Quinn's immediate
family, remember.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (rolls his eyes) How does your sister look at herself in
the mirror?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: She can't. She has no reflection. (Connor smirks)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: I still don't understand how she can do that.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: It's a sibling thing. I stay out of her way, she gives me
twenty bucks.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Well when you put it that way.</TT></P>

<P><TT>[They approach Daria's house. Jake's been working on the decorations
and there is now a row of plastic candy canes up each side of the driveway.
Lights lining the roof and gutter. Not to mention the door, windows, etc.
There is a plastic snowman in the front yard, and wreaths galore.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: (slightly irritated) For the last time Quinn, it was not
a date!</TT></P>

<P><TT>Quinn: Whatever.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: It was a ploy for your humiliation.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Quinn: Uh huh, sure Daria.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Helen: Why hello...Connor was it?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jake: (actually looks up from the paper and notice something's going
on, and knows what it is!) Connor! Hey my man.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (slightly rolls his eyes) Hey, Mr. Morgandorffor.</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Daria is in a bit of shock that Jake actually remembered someone's
name.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Helen: Daria, you're little boyfriend can stay for dinner if he'd
like.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: (very irritated) For the last time, it was not a date, and
we are not going out. Okay? Good. (goes upstairs)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (now standing at the window) You know, you shouldn't have
filed the bars.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: (still looking at computer screen) I didn't. The old owners
did before they left.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Well in that case...(notices how fixated on the computer
Daria is and walks over) What are you doing on there anyway?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Just looking for anything new at Amazon.com.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Don't they have just about every book in print?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Not even close. That's a near impossibility.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (notices the book she has up on the screen) Cool. Poe.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Limited edition. Completely unabridged. Hardback version,
leather bound. Complete with biography.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: A real treasure.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: And it would take one to buy it. (shows him the price)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Woah. What is it, hand written?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: No. Just one of only five hundred in print.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: No one on earth could afford that.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: I'm almost there. Another two years maybe. (beat) If I dip
into my collage fund.(Connor smirks)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: You'd pay that much for a book?</TT></P>

in the sense. You know what I mean. Daria stops.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (notices Daria stopped) What?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: You go ahead. I think I'll keep my distance from the snake
pit.</TT></P>

Get away from them?</TT></P>

you come over tomorrow after school? Change of scene.</TT></P>

can't get into it like that?</TT></P>

Jake for the money? They give Quinn their gold card on a weekly basis.</TT></P>

in my room all night. Doesn't like me doing stuff that interferes with
her job. Like breathe.</TT></P>

a date on a school night. Yes, yes I know. I'll get started on the briefs
right away. Of course I have the time, Eric. Yes, I'm sure no one will
be getting in the way. Everyone has other plans, anyway.</TT></P>

could...</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (already knows what she's going to say) Stay in my room
this evening? You're discussing business and can't have any interruptions.
Sure mom.</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Connor's sitting on his bed, looking a little upset, but not much.
Daria's sitting in the computer chair, but it's over beside the bed. She
looks like she knows the feeling.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Is your mother ever like that?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Only when she's awake. But she's either at the office or
on her phone. Never actually brings anyone over.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Yeah. My mom doesn't usually. Unless it's to try to find
a way to get out of town.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Why's that?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: I guess she doesn't like the responsibility of raising a
kid.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: (shrugs) Maybe she just wants the best for you. That's the
excuse Helen always uses.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (starting to get a bit bitter) If she wanted the best for
me she would be around when I needed her to be instead of always working.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: (that hit close to home, so naturally she changes the subject)
What about your father?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Mom got full custody. He has visitation but he never comes
for it. </TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: I thought you said he had the best team in the city?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (bitter) He did. He didn't need the responsibility. At least
that's what they said. He just didn't want me around because I'm a disappointment
to him.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: You?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: I don't play sports, I don't date cheerleaders, and I don't
want to be like him.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Oh.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (looks over at her) Do your parents ever think you're a
disappointment?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: (shrugs) Maybe. If they thought about me at all.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Why would they think that?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Seeing how Quinn's probably going to be the homecoming queen
someday. That, and whenever she makes a C she gets the credit cards.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: But you have a perfect grade point average.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: (shrugs) Does that matter?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (sighs) Apparently not.</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Daria goes through some papers from the envelope.]</TT></P>

garage.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: It's weird.</TT></P>

finally found someone else she can relate to, so you don't have to feel
guilty whenever we're out. But yet, they're all you can manage to talk
about.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Mack: My money lies on Daria.</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Mr. O'Neil is in front of the class discussing something. Jane
is sketching, Daria and Connor are just sitting there.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Mr. O'Neil: So, you see class, what Poe meant was that the beating
of the heart really signified love and friendship.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (to Daria) Was this before or after it was torn out of the
victim's body and buried in the floorboard?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Mr. O'Neil: Perhaps you got a different impression, umm (checks
chart) Connor. Why don't you share with the rest of the class?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Alright. It's simple; what Poe really wanted the heart to
symbolize was the ironic conclusion. The heartless murderer was forced
into confession by the throbbing of a heart. He wanted to show that a person
can be persuaded by their own madness, so he buried a throbbing human heart
under the floorboard.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Mr. O'Neil: Very....interesting perspective.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (continuing) That also provides for a very entertaining
party game. (Daria and Jane smirk, Mr. O'Neil sits at his desk with his
head in his hands)</TT></P>

experience. It's been an inconvenience.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: I think that was the point.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: At least we don't have to take care of an egg. (beat) Yet.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Yeah, that would be a pain.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: That would be the purpose of it. To be like a real newborn.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Oh no. Real babies are at least entertaining. (beat) Look
at Jane. (Daria smirks)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: (muffled by her head being inside the locker) I heard that.</TT></P>

Does this even have a punchline?</TT></P>

Got to go. Huge offer. Don't know when I'll be back. (leaves)</TT></P>

a kid.</TT></P>

nonexistent plotline.</TT></P>

electronic dolls.</TT></P>

to piece it together.</TT></P>

someone else does?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (evil grin) When he wrote Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare
was sending a message to all youth that if you fall in love, you die. Or
you know, at least get permanently paralyzed or something. This point was
based on his own experiences, which are very well documented in the 1998
film "Shakespeare in Love."</TT></P>

<P><TT>Sandi: I am assuming you have all of the affirmentioned essentials
Quinn?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Quinn: Of course Sandi. It's not like we're poor or anything.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Sandi: Good. Now, come Tiffany, there is still the matter of that
unsightly disorder we must take care of.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Tiffany: (has her hand over her nose) Yeah....unsightly....</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Sandi and Tiffany leave. After they are out of eye and earshot,
Daria, Jane, and Connor walk up to Quinn and Stacy. Jane still has her
paint.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Now, Quinn. About that little mishap yesterday.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Quinn: What? Did you uhh...forget umm..to put down the amount I
pledged?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Stacy: (rolls her eyes) Give it up Quinn. I know what's going on.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: There's a shocker.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Quinn: (oblivious to Jane's remark) You do?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Stacy: (motioning to Daria and Connor) You wrecked their project.
Now she's threatening to show your birth certificates to the only morons
who haven't figured out the truth by now unless you fess up. (everyone
stares at her in awe) What?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: You're observant for a follower.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Stacy: (evil grin similar to Jane's) More than you'd think.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Quinn: Daria I told you, I can't get detention!</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: (takes the certificates out of her pocket) Then you can't
get a date.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Quinn: (looks nervous) Can't we just...work out an agreement? How's
twenty?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Are you trying to buy me off again Quinn?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Quinn: How's fifty sound?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: We're talking about my grade point average.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Quinn: Okay, okay! Seventy five! But that's it!</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: You don't get it, do you? She had a 4.0 before this.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Quinn: So she'll have like a three point nine or something. Next
best thing.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (losing his patience) Look, Quinn! I know you don't care
about grades, but your sister does.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Quinn: Not so loud!</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (ignoring Quinn) You either fess up to Barch, or you'll
have more than your popularity to worry about. (leaves)</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Quinn looks extremely worried and frightened. Everyone else looks
a bit worried themselves, except Stacy, who knows why Connor acted like
that.]</TT></P>

I'm fine.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jodie: (though VO) Works every time. (out loud) Why would you do
that?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: I have no idea. She was going on and on about how she couldn't
get detention for telling Barch what she did, and it would ruin Daria's
average and she doesn't deserve to have that happen.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jodie: But why would you get angry at Quinn?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Because she's a shallow self centered brat. And I don't
want to see all of Daria's work shot to hell because of something she did.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jodie: (smirks) Why is that?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Because I...(catches himself) uhh...she's worked hard for
it.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jodie. (still smirking) Uh huh.</TT></P>

me of someone I used to know. Only, y'know, cooler I guess.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jodie: So that's why you like her?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: No, that's just the reason why I went to her and Jane's
table my first day. I like her because she's, I don't know, smart, funny,
fun to hang around with.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jodie: (shocked at the fun to hang around with part) Are you sure
we're talking about the same Daria here?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Yeah, why?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jodie: It's just that I never really pictured her the having fun
type. </TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Really?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jodie: Yes really. In fact, before you got here she just used this...dark,
morbid humor. It's lightened up considerably since you got here.</TT></P>

a brain cell in Kevin after all? (Connor smirks)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Ms. Barch: And so, resulting from this letter (holds up the folded
piece of paper) given to me by an anonymous source, this week's human development
assignment is to be completely discarded as if it never even happened.
(going into a Jake-like rant) Much like my own marriage. I work and slave
for twenty years and he just waltz's right off with his bimbo secretary
as if nothing ever happened.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (to Daria) Sounds like my dad.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Ms. Barch: As a make-up for this assignment, you are all to write

<P><TT>Jane: (anxious grin) So you gonna show off those certificates then?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: (sighs) For all I know, it was Quinn. Even though I seriously
doubt it, there's not enough evidence to back anything up. </TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: So why not do it anyway?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Damn conscience.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (shrugs) Maybe it was her. (Daria and Jane look at with
disbelief) She said she couldn't get detention right? Well, if that letter
was given by an anonymous person, then there's no way someone could get
the blame placed on them.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Amigo, you have a lot to learn about Princess Grace.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Are sure it's me that has something to learn?</TT></P>

might be behind that letter.</TT></P>

wrote that letter?</TT></P>

towards Quinn and Stacy who are walking by. They overhear their conversation.)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Stacy: That was a really nice thing for you to do Quinn.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Quinn: Well, like I say, do unto others as you might need them to
loan you money someday.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (victorious grin) Well what about that.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: (in awe) Wha...how...why...but...</TT></P>

Quinn wouldn't do something nice, but still, it's hidden to the point of

<P><TT>End Notes:</TT></P>

<P><TT>1) For starters, this whole Edgar Allen Poe book, and well, the
whole Edgar Allen Poe thing in general, is definitely going to continue
into later fics. Mainly because I'm such a big Poe fan.</TT></P>

<P><TT>2) Let's not forget Vikki, Connor's mother, and Helen's new arch
enemy. I imagine her a fairly conservative person, but yet still able to
have a good time, well, job permitting and all. I don't intend on having
Helen and Vikki find out their kids are friends just yet, but when they
do, well...you'll see.</TT></P>

<P><TT>3) Of course, you hardcore fans that don't realize this is a fanfic
from a cartoon (on MTV) will probably load my inbox with hatemale at the
fact that Daria seems fairly comfortable talking to Connor about family.
At least, that's how it seems to me. And as for the hatemale I'll be receiving
from the shippers sometime soon...well...anyone wanna see a good maiming?</TT></P>

<P><TT>4) In case you couldn't tell, Jane is still a bit uncomfortable
with Daria and Connor spending so much time together, but hey, turn about
fair play right?</TT></P>

<P><TT>5) The running gag with Jane and her jokes, well, to be honest this
actually came from a friend of mine. No, not the idea, the telling really
bad, really long jokes. Of course, I was just looking for something to
take up space, so I probably won't pay any attention to this in later fics.</TT></P>

<P><TT>6) The painting Daria was helping Jane with practically every afternoon
is actually a forshadow-ish thing to a future fic of mine. No, I will not
give away the plot, but I can assure that it'll probably just be a filler
fic.</TT></P>

<P><TT>7) The friend that Connor mentions in ACT II - Scene 8 will definitely
be mentioned later. In fact, I'm planning on dedicating an entire Fic in
which Connor explains this person to Daria and perhaps Jane. But, like
many things, that may change.</TT></P>

<P><TT>8) Of course, now my plan to have only Mack know how Connor feels
towards Daria has been shot to hell, but at least to fairly interesting
characters know. Well, Quinn too, but she doesn't believe it.</TT></P>

<P><TT>9) Connor's guitar chord knowledge, we'll be seeing much, much more
of that in the future. Especially in my next fic, which has the current
working title, "How to Work a G-String." A bit misleading, but
still good.</TT></P>

<P><TT>10) I think there was something else I wanted to comment on, but
I forget. Ah well, any questions, they're always welcome, as well as any
comments and suggestions you may have. Well there it is, my second fic.
Personally, I'm not as satisfied with it as I would like to be, but then
again, a lot of authors never like their stuff. Any questions, comments,
suggestion, e-mail me. I'd love (well maybe not love exactly, but I'd like)
to receive some feedback. </TT></P>

<P><TT>Oh yeah, and any plot ideas for future fics are also welcome. Thanks
for reading, have a nice day/afternoon/evening/night.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Thanks again,</TT></P>
