"Sealed With a Kick"</h1>

<p align=center>
A novelization by CF<br>
Based on a screenplay by Sam Johnson and Chris Marcil<br>
January 2004
</p>

<hr>

<p>
<strong>Synopsis:</strong> Daria Morgendorffer, a cynical, brainy
newcomer to Lawndale High School, exacts revenge on a football 
player who insults her. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Author's note:</strong> This novelization is based on the
1995 <em>Daria</em> pilot, <em>Sealed With a Kick</em>.
Between the pilot and the series' debut in 1997 several minor
changes were made to the show's premise.  Therefore, some
compromises have been introduced below to accommodate <em>Sealed With
a Kick</em> in <em>Daria</em>'s "official" storyline.  Notes at the
end justify these decisions and are cross referenced 
by numbers such as the one at the end of this 
sentence.<sup><a href="#disclaimer">(1)</a></sup>
</p> 

<hr>

<p>
The sun smiled down on Lawndale High School's modern day 
campus from a
cloudless sky.<sup><a href="#modernday">(2)</a></sup>
Inside, however, the mood was distinctly overcast.  Daria Morgendorffer
was writing furiously, trying to complete 
her science homework despite the distractions caused by her 
classmates.
</p>

<p>
Daria's family had just moved to Lawndale and she was finding 
the transition difficult.<sup><a href="#when">(3)</a></sup>
Her immediate problem, though, was how to block out the tinny
sounds coming from the headphones worn by Kevin Thompson, who was sitting
next to her, listening to a CD and reading a magazine.
Kevin was one of the many annoying new classmates Daria had
encountered in the past couple of days.  She glanced to her left and noted
that the magazine holding his attention was titled <em>Dangerous 
Muscle Enhancers</em>.  That makes sense, she thought.  
This guy was so into
sports that he wore his football uniform all the time, and he
was no doubt keen to 
build up his muscles.<sup><a href="#muscles">(4)</a></sup>  
But not his brain, mused Daria, sourly.
</p>

<p>
Sitting to Daria's right was the only good thing that had happened to her
since her arrival in Lawndale.  Jane Lane shared Daria's dislike of sports,
fashion, shopping malls and other supposedly "normal" teenage interests.
Although they only met yesterday, the pair were already inseparable.
</p>

<p>
Daria resumed writing, trying to finish off the homework and
escape her classmates as quickly as possible.   For her the science
assignment was child's play and the pace of her writing caused her pencil
to give up with a loud snap.  Spying Kevin's pencil lying
idle on the desk she reached over for it.  "Hey, Kevin.  Can I 
borrow your pencil?" she asked.  "Sure," said Kevin, flashing his best
"babe magnet" smile.
Daria took the pencil, muttered "Thanks," and went back to work.
</p>

<p align=center>
-oOo-
</p>

<p>
The school bell rang and students poured into the 
corridors from all directions, Daria and Jane among them.  As they walked 
past the rows of lockers, Kevin shouted
at them from behind, "Hey, Daria.  Wait up!"  Daria and Jane stopped and 
turned as Kevin came running up, his cleats clattering on the
polished floor.  
What does this jerk want, thought Daria, before remembering
their recent interaction.  "Oh, yeah," she said, "Sorry, Kevin!"  She
took the pencil from behind her ear and offered it to him.
</p>

<p>
Kevin, however, didn't seem interested in the pencil at all.
Daria has a wide zone of personal space - as a rule she doesn't like
anyone to be within a hundred miles - and Kevin was definitely 
getting too close. 
Daria instinctively retreated, but Kevin kept coming forward
until her back was against the lockers.  Then, in a well-rehearsed 
move, Kevin "casually" stretched out his arm to lean against the lockers,
effectively pinning Daria in place.
</p>

<p>
"Look, I know what you're after," said Kevin, "but it won't work."
Daria felt very uncomfortable and started glancing around
for an escape route.
"I don't want the pencil," she said, "I just forgot to give it back."
In reply Kevin made another carefully chosen move, switching
so that he was leaning on his other arm and his face was only
inches from Daria's.  "Let's not play games, Daria," he said 
smoothly, "You desire me, don't you?"
Jane stood by, watching the unfolding drama with interest.
</p>

<p>
Daria couldn't believe what was happening.  Was this idiot trying to hit
on her, despite everything she did to make herself look disinterested in
teenage mating rituals?  All she could say in response to Kevin's
illogical comment was, "Aah, excuse me?"
Kevin stepped back a bit, to Daria's relief, and
explained, "I can tell.  It's like a fifth sense I got."
He didn't seem to be deaf or blind, so Daria guessed that he couldn't 
count.  "But, unfortunately or whatever, I already got a
chick," continued Kevin.
This much Daria knew to be true.  Normally he was accompanied by
Brittany Taylor, a cheerleader who appeared to be his mental equal.
"We can still be friends, though," concluded Kevin.
"Thanks, Kevin.  That helps," said Daria flatly,
but her sarcasm was lost on her dim-witted antagonist.
</p>

<p>
Kevin didn't seem to be too concerned by the futility of their potential
relationship, however.  Suddenly his reflective demeanor brightened as he
revealed his real reason for chasing Daria.
"Great!" he said and then, without missing a beat,
"Can I borrow your science homework?"
Daria and Jane exchanged dour looks.  Without a word Daria held
out the page of homework she'd just completed.
Kevin snatched it from her hand saying, "Hey, thanks a lot," as he turned
to run off down the corridor.
"Sorry if you were hurt," he yelled back before disappearing from sight.
</p>

<p>
Daria and Jane stared after him, amazed by his brazeness.  "I just got
blown off by a guy I didn't even go after," said Daria, more stunned than
angry.  Jane was unflappable as usual and sensibly put things into
perspective.  "You should find a safe, legal alternative to killing him,"
she said.  "I already have," said Daria, her brow furrowed in concentration
as she devised her scheme for revenge.  "When I get through with him,
there'll be nothing left but jelly," she said ominously.
"Well, you won't have to do anything to his brain," added Jane helpfully.
</p>

<p align=center>
-oOo-
</p>

<p>
That evening Lawndale's quiet suburban streets were disturbed
by the steady tread of Daria's combat boots as 
she put her plan into effect.
It proved easy to recognize the Thompson's residence; Kevin
could be clearly seen in the front window, working out with
weights.  A dumb-bell with a dumb-bell, thought Daria as she
pushed the button for the door chime.
</p>
  
<p>
As Kevin opened the door Daria immediately went into the act
she'd rehearsed in her mind that afternoon.
Before Kevin even had a chance to speak she thrust a plateful
of cookies she had bought on the way home from school
into his hands.  "I baked these
cookies for you!" she exclaimed, trying her hardest to fake a cheerful
smile, but which came out more like a sickly grin.  "They're shaped like
hearts!" she observed, even though the cookies were only vaguely 
heart-like, while encouraging Kevin to put one in his mouth.
</p>

<p>
Baffled by the whole encounter, Kevin tried to say something,  
"Um, but ..."
Before he could get any further, however, Daria cut him off.
"You don't have to use words around me, Kevin," she said breathily, in 
what she hoped was a sexy voice,
"We don't need them."  As she spoke Daria leaned forward and
put her hand on the door frame, trapping Kevin in the doorway just
as he'd done to her earlier in the day.
Indicating the plate of cookies in Kevin's hand, she said,
"This is just to say, no hard feelings!"  
She then turned on her heel and walked quickly away, shouting "Bye!" over
her shoulder, and 
leaving the dumbfounded Kevin with a half-eaten cookie in his mouth.
"Good cookies," he mumbled, confused.
</p>

<p align=center>
-oOo-
</p>

<p>
The next day found the usual crowd of Lawndale High students in the
pizza place nearby the campus.<sup><a href="#pizza">(5)</a></sup>
Kevin and Brittany were sitting in a booth
and Kevin was impressing his girlfriend with a tale of the football team's
exploits.  Laughing at his own wit, he concluded the story,
"... and then Scully, he grabs the kid, and gives
him a tenth degree wedgie."
Brittany responded with a giggle so high-pitched that every
dog in the neighborhood winced.  "He's funny," she said, gazing admiringly
at her quarterback boyfriend.
</p>

<p>
At this moment the sound of combat boots on cheap linoleum announced
Daria's arrival.  Jane had told her that most of the local kids hang out at
the pizza place, so she knew it would be the ideal venue for stage two
of her plan.  "Hi, Kevin!" she said, again trying to smile convincingly.
"Uh, oh, ... Hi, Daria," stuttered Kevin, knowing that there was likely to
be trouble whenever any female approached him while he was with
Brittany.  Brittany gave Kevin an icy stare.
"Who's she?" she demanded.<sup><a href="#whosshe">(6)</a></sup>
Of course, Brittany knew full well who Daria was.  Her radar
alerted her immediately to the arrival of any new females on campus.
But one look at Daria's thick glasses and dowdy outfit had convinced her
that Daria posed no threat ... until now!
</p>

<p>
Before Kevin had a chance to come up with an explanation, Daria
made the situation even worse by sitting beside him, leaning over and
clinging to his arm.  
Without taking her gaze off Kevin she answered Brittany's
question by saying, "I'm Kevin's good friend!"  Then, ignoring Brittany
entirely, she asked Kevin, "Which do you like better, the beach
or the mountains?"  Surprised by the question, Kevin answered it as
best he could.  "Er, I guess the beach."
Then as an afterthought, "Cause of, like, the bikinis."
Faking enthusiasm, Daria replied, "Me too!  Just
checking."   Then, as she stood up to leave, she tore a sheet of paper
off the notepad she was carrying and handed it to Kevin, saying, 
"Oh, and here's some extra homework of mine you can use."
By now Brittany looked ready to explode,
and Daria strode away, shouting back to Kevin,
"See you later ... friend!"
</p>

<p>
Daria's strategy had exactly the desired effect.
Inarticulate with rage, Brittany screamed, "Ooooh!" as she stood up.
Grabbing her drink, which unfortunately for Kevin was almost
full, she threw it in his face, shouting, 
"Manipulator! Pinhead! Weasel!"  Dripping wet,
Kevin attempted to regain control of the situation as Brittany paused for
breath.  "Hey, hey, hey!  Slow down!" he ordered as forcefully
as he could.  Sadly for him, however, he was unable to maintain the
momentum.  "What was the first one you said?" he finished, lamely.
</p>

<p align=center>
-oOo-
</p>

<p>
Daria's mental onslaught continued the next morning as she
took advantage of Kevin's obvious conceit.  He opened his locker
to find it full of flowers and a note reading, 
"Thank you for letting me give you homework."  It was signed with
two kisses and a hug, and little hearts were drawn in the margin.
"Really!" said Kevin to himself.  He knew the babes all loved him
but this was ridiculous!  Of course, this new girl wasn't popular
enough to go out with him - he normally dated only cheerleaders.
On the other hand, he mused, he was currently
in the doghouse with Brittany, so maybe
he should give the new kid a break and let her go on a date with Lawndale
High's QB!<sup><a href="#kevinlikesdaria">(7)</a></sup>
</p>

<p align=center>
-oOo-
</p>

<p>
The final act of Daria's master 
plan took place that afternoon, and exceeded
even her expectations.  Daria and Jane were in arts and crafts class.
The noise was deafening as students hammered, sawed and sanded their
various projects.  Daria herself was wearing safety goggles and cutting
a board with a circular saw, while Jane supervised.
Kevin appeared in the doorway and started shouting to Daria
above the noise, "Hey, Daria!  
Me and Brittany decided to see other people."  (In fact, it
was more Brittany's decision than his!)  Daria didn't react, so
he raised his voice even louder,
"So, since you're sort of next on the list or whatever ..."
</p>

<p>
Daria could see that Kevin had fallen into her trap, and his timing was
perfect.
"What?" she yelled back, pretending she couldn't hear him above the
sound of the saw.
Kevin entered the classroom, and started shouting even louder.
"I said," he screamed with both hands held up around his mouth,
"I was wondering if you and me could get together?"
Unfortunately for Kevin, however,
Daria switched off the saw just as he said this, so that
everyone in the room could hear him clearly.
</p>

<p>
Kevin suddenly realized that the room was silent and everyone
had turned to stare at him.
Daria let him sweat for a moment and then applied the <em>coup de 
grace</em>.
"Mmmm, I don't think so, Kevin," she said,
"It might ruin our friendship."
She then walked calmly away, her mission complete.  Jane followed,
giving Kevin a cheesy grin on the way past.  Not only had Daria dumped
Kevin like he'd done to her, but she even managed
to do so in front of the whole class!
</p>

<p>
Kevin was left standing dumbfounded.  A girl sporting a Veronica Lake
hairdo summed up the attitude of the whole class in one word, "Geek!"
Kevin responded weakly, "Hey, it's cool.  We're good friends," but by 
this time the students had returned to their projects and the
room was once again filled with noise.
</p>

<p align=center>
-oOo-
</p>

<p>
The Morgendorffer's new home in Lawndale was an impressive, two-storey
brick house.<sup><a href="#house">(8)</a></sup>
Inside, however, things were still in disarray following the 
move.  Unpacked boxes were stacked everywhere, and the family ate
dinner that evening at a small table Jake had set up temporarily in
the living room, until the kitchen and dining room could be made 
serviceable.<sup><a href="#table">(9)</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
As Helen brought her plate in from the kitchen and sat down she
addressed her younger daughter,
"Quinn, there were four calls on the machine from a 
Kevin."
Jake Morgendorffer sighed - they'd only been in town a few days
and Quinn's new boyfriends were already tying up the phone.
Without looking up he said, "Doesn't he have your beeper number?"  
However, Quinn just continued methodically shoving carrot sticks 
into her mouth and replied disinterestedly, "They aren't for me,
they're for Daria."<sup><a href="#fashion">(10)</a></sup>
</p>

</p>
Jake and Helen turned to stare at their first born.
"Daria!?" exclaimed Helen.
Missing the point as usual, Jake said, "Do you need a beeper, Daria?"
Helen ignored him and seized the rare opportunity
to extract some information from
her much-loved, but uncommunicative, teenage daughter.  
"Do you want to talk to us about anything, honey?"
Throughout this short barrage of questions Daria remained 
stubbornly poker-faced,
her eyes furtively darting between her mother and father.  Then,
just as she felt compelled to say something, the doorbell rang,
and she made good use of the distraction.
She stood up and said flatly, "I was just about to open up, too."
Then she walked out of the room as Helen leant over and whispered to 
her husband, "Do you think she meant it?"
</p>

<p align=center>
-oOo-
</p>

<p>
Opening the front door, Daria was surprised to see Kevin Thompson.
After what happened in class today she didn't expect to see him again
anytime
soon.  Even stranger, he was clumsily holding a bunch of flowers!
"I'm not giving up, Daria," he announced, "I know there's a chemistry
or whatever."  At this point the full horror of what was happening
struck Daria.  Her plan to humiliate Kevin was backfiring!  The dope 
actually believed she was interested in him!
</p>

<p>
Daria decided this farce had gone far enough.  Her only option was to 
tell him the truth.  She began, "I hate to say this, Kevin ..." but
before she got any further Quinn stuck her head around the door.
"Kevin?" she exclaimed.  The two had already met - in the "popular"
part of the school cafeteria - and Quinn rated the Lawndale
Lion's quarterback highly on her list of "targets."  
</p>

<p>
Kevin's attention immediately switched from Daria to her 
unbelievably cute sister.
"Quinn? What are you doing here?" he asked.
"I live here," said Quinn, edging her way past Daria.
"You're not here to see my sister, are you?"
Kevin was shocked.  "Whoa!" he exclaimed, "You're sisters 
with a brain?"<sup><a href="#sisters">(11)</a></sup>
By this stage Daria seemed to be invisible.
"I know!" said Quinn, "Doesn't it suck?"
Kevin agreed, "Really!" and then said, "Well, 
you wanna go for a ride or something?"
Quinn didn't need to be asked twice.  She ran off, saying, 
"Let me get my stuff."
</p>

<p>
In the silence that followed Quinn's departure Kevin suddenly
remembered that Daria was still standing right in front of him.
"So," he said awkwardly, casually throwing the flowers he'd brought
for her over his shoulder, "anyways, you're probably right about us
being friends and stuff, 'cause we care about each others' feelings
and whatnot."
Deeply unimpressed, Daria said, "Yeah, and I care even more about
your feelings than my own."  Once again, her sarcasm was wasted on
Kevin.  "Really!" he said, "Man, I never would have thought that you'd be
sisters with somebody hot!"
Daria didn't answer but
stared at him through her oversized glasses as she realized
that he'd just dumped her for the second time that week!
</p>

<p align=center>
-oOo-
</p>

<p>
It was still early, so Daria gave her new friend Jane a call and arranged
to meet her at the pizza place.  When Daria had finished telling 
her the whole sordid tale,
Jane said, "I don't understand why you're not trying to get revenge."
Daria, however, seemed content with the way things had turned out.
"I'm letting Quinn take care of that," she replied mysteriously.
</p>

<p align=center>
-oOo-
</p>

<p>
In a car parked overlooking the abandoned quarry, Kevin was discovering
the meaning of Daria's cryptic comment.  Quinn may be sensational
to look at,
but so far this date wasn't going the way he planned.  First of all,
she made him take her to an expensive French restaurant with some
fancy name he couldn't pronounce.  Then, after he'd parked the car,
she screamed when he came near
her.<sup><a href="#letsgetphysical">(12)</a></sup>  (Brittany never did
that!)  And, worst of all, there was the beeper!
</p>

<p>
BEEP! "Damnit!" yelled Kevin, "How many times is that thing 
going to go off?"
Quinn gave him a withering look, "I'm beginning to think 
that you don't like being with someone attractive and popular!"
"Sorry," apologized Kevin.
"That's better," said Quinn soothingly, but then barked,
"Now get me to a pay phone!"
Kevin sighed as he started the engine.  Tomorrow morning he'd beg
Brittany's forgiveness - if only he could remember what it was he'd
done wrong!

In the initial, establishing shot of <em>Sealed With
a Kick</em> we see a school building bearing the legend "Modern
Day High" - evidently the name "Lawndale" had not yet been
devised.  We assume here that the unlikely name "Modern Day" 
was meant to be taken figuratively, not literally.
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="when">
We assume that the events shown in <em>Sealed
With a Kick</em> occur during Daria's first two weeks at Lawndale High,
concurrently with the first regular <em>Daria</em>
episode, <em>Esteemsters</em>.  Daria already knows Jane
in <em>Sealed With a Kick</em>, and according to <em>Esteemsters</em> the
two met at Daria's first self-esteem class, which seems to take place
on Daria's second day at Lawndale High.  
More importantly, Kevin does <em>not</em> know that Daria and Quinn are
sisters in <em>Sealed With a Kick</em>, yet in <em>Esteemsters</em>
he is shown attending the school assembly at which Daria 
publicly announces 
her relationship to Quinn.  This assembly takes place shortly 
after Daria has been in Mr. O'Neill's self-esteem class for one week.
Assuming that school assemblies are held weekly, and that Mr. O'Neill
schedules Daria's appearance as soon as possible after her "graduation"
from self-esteem class, then no more than two weeks can have elapsed from
the day that Daria started at Lawndale High and Kevin attends the assembly
in question.  <em>Sealed With a Kick</em> must occur during this
interval.
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="muscles">
The character of 
Kevin Thompson changed significantly between <em>Sealed With a Kick</em>
and the <em>Daria</em> series itself.  In <em>Sealed With a Kick</em> he
is shown to be much more muscular than
in <em>Daria</em> episodes such as <em>This Year's Model</em>.
His voice hasn't fully acquired its "clueless" quality either, 
and he sounds disturbingly threatening when he objects to Brittany's
outburst in <em>Sealed With a Kick</em>'s "pizza place" scene.  
<em>Daria</em>'s developers wisely toned down his aggressive
physique and personality for the series proper and we assume here
that <em>Sealed With a Kick</em>'s Kevin is the familiar character we know
and "love."
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="pizza">
As in the series itself, <em>Sealed With a Kick</em> avoids giving the
pizza place a formal name.  However, it features the familiar, 
crudely-painted picture on the front window
of a crowned figure holding a pizza aloft, 
so "Pizza King" is a strong possibility.
(Tor Johnson, the swedish wrestler and B-grade horror
movie actor, said in the 1950s that he
wanted to open a pizza restaurant called "King of Pizzas"!)
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="whosshe">
Brittany's "Who's she?" must be a rhetorical question.
Brittany must know who Daria is because in <em>Esteemsters</em> she
is shown to be in attendance when Mr. DeMartino 
introduces Daria to the class, during Daria's first day at
Lawndale High.
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="kevinlikesdaria">
It's hinted in <em>Daria</em> that Kevin has a genuine fondness
for Daria.  Despite Daria's supposed lack of popularity, big-man-on-campus
Kevin finds an excuse to talk to her in almost every episode,
and he often asks for
her advice.  In particular, in <em>The Big House</em> (also written
by Johnson and Marcil) Kevin becomes 
greatly agitated when he thinks Daria's parents are being cruel to her.
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="house">
The house exterior used to represent the 
Morgendorffer residence in <em>Sealed With a Kick</em> bears only a passing
resemblance to the one in the series proper - it looks much smaller.
The interior is not shown in any detail at all, with just
a doorway and a couple of windows visible, none of which match the
decor seen in <em>Daria</em>.
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="table">
In <em>Sealed With a Kick</em> the Morgendorffers are shown eating at
a small, square table.  It is clearly not the round kitchen table
frequently seen in <em>Daria</em>, nor is it the large, rectangular dining
table shown in the episodes <em>The Lost Girls</em> and
<em>One J at a Time</em>.
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="fashion">
Quinn's outfit in <em>Sealed With a Kick</em> differs considerably
from the one she wears in <em>Daria</em>.  It features a shirt with
a collar, short shorts, knee-high socks, and no cute smiley faces
or butterflies.
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="sisters">
Since Quinn is not in Kevin's class at school, it's entirely
feasible that he does not yet know that she and Daria
are sisters.  Like the rest of
Lawndale High's male population he would no doubt have immediately noticed 
Quinn's arrival on campus, but there is no reason to assume that he knows
her full name.  (In <em>Esteemsters</em> he was <em>not</em> among the
group of students who greeted Quinn on her arrival at Lawndale High and
learned her "cool name.")
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a name="letsgetphysical">
Quinn's fear of physical intimacy is noted in many <em>Daria</em> episodes,
especially <em>This Year's Model</em> and <em>Daria Dance Party</em>.  
Since she goes out with a different boy each night, 
<em>Daria</em>'s developers undoubtedly introduced this prudish streak
to her personality to avoid giving the wrong impression about
the fourteen-and-a-half year old.  She certainly
seems out of character in <em>Sealed With a Kick</em> when she
runs off for a back seat rendezvous with Kevin 
at a moment's notice!
