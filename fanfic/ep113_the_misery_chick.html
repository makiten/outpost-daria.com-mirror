  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Why
  Quinn, this is darling!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Helen
  Morgendorffer’s voice broke through a feigned suspenseful silence as only an
  obnoxiously loud alarm clock could do. In her hands, she held her daughter’s
  new eight-by-ten school photograph, and the cheery image of Quinn against a waterfall
  background <i>was</i> pleasant enough to look at, if not extremely phony. The
  face of faux reflection Quinn wore made the photo all the more
  two-dimensional.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Jake
  Morgendorffer, who’d moved his chair close to Helen’s around the kitchen
  table, was equally pleased with what he saw. “You look so happy, sweetie!” he
  said to Quinn. Quinn stood behind them soaking up the complements like a dry
  sponge in a full sink of water. Her lips were nearly parallel in their
  upright position. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“I
  <i>felt</i> happy! I always feel happy on picture day!” Quinn said, the
  bubbliness overflowing from the corners of her mouth. She then attempted a
  rare digression into her ‘serious’ mode, which was about as deep as a
  driveway puddle. “Do you think that ‘Nature’s Precious Wonders’ was a good
  choice for background? Because I almost went with ‘Starlight Over Yosemite.’”
  <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>As
  Quinn spoke, Daria, who sat across from Helen and Jake at the table, stifled
  an internal vomiting. She had been silently waiting to hand over her picture
  and then naturally go as far away as she could, but with the way things
  looked now, she didn’t expect to leave anytime soon. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“I
  think it was a <i>fine</i> choice,” Helen concluded. She handed the picture
  back to Quinn, who’d taken a seat next to her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Suddenly,
  Quinn’s face lit up with even greater excitement. “Oh, and you want to know
  what’s more?” she said, waving her hands ecstatically and speaking quickly so
  as to not allow reply. “Sandi says that like, some photographer guy or
  whatever saw her school picture, and he offered her a photo shoot for the
  cover of <i>Awake!</i> Magazine--” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“How
  exciting,” Daria quipped. “And I’m sure that every trash can and garbage bin
  in the business will take close notice of her and keep her in mind for future
  projects.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“--but
  <i>she</i> said that there’s like, no way she would ever be caught <i>dead</i>
  on a magazine that doesn’t have perfume samples,” Quinn rambled on. “So then <i>I</i>
  said--” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“That
  <i>is</i> very exciting,” Helen interrupted, lying through her teeth. <span
  style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>“What did <i>you</i> pick for background,
  Daria?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“
  ‘Black Clouds Swallowing Chernobyl,’ ” Daria replied without hesitation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Helen
  extended her hand in Daria’s direction. “Come on Daria, where’s your school
  picture?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Daria
  sighed, knowing one thing right off the bat: Helen would not be very pleased
  with what she saw. Not that it bothered her very much, of course; in fact,
  she expected a chance to perhaps amuse herself in the process. She reached
  down beside her chair into her backpack and retrieved the photo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Daria’s
  prediction was no less than precise. Helen’s smile had faded into a look of
  anticipated disappointment as she gazed down at the photograph. In the
  picture stood a girl that may as well have been a mannequin, it was so devoid
  of emotion. The background behind her was a dull gray color. Helen exhaled
  wearily, the disappointment still etched into the lines of her face. Jake
  however kept his teethy, artificial smile tacked on. “Wow! That’s sharp
  focus.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Helen
  dropped the picture to the tabletop. “Daria, just once why can’t you smile
  when somebody takes your picture?” she asked, a hint of what seemed to be
  pleading in her voice. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“I
  don’t like to smile unless I have a reason,” said Daria. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Daria,”
  Helen cooed, “people judge you by your expressions.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
  Tahoma'>Gee, where have </span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
  Tahoma'>I<i> been?</i> Daria thought. Aloud, she said dryly, “Yes. And I
  believe there is something intrinsically wrong with that system. I have
  dedicated myself to changing it.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Quinn,
  in an attempt to regain focal point, suddenly held up several sheets of various-sized
  photos. Her voice was still filled with undying excitement, a direct
  contradiction of the other photo subject. “Hey, did you guys see <i>these</i>?”
  <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Rolling
  her eyes, Daria dropped her elbow to the table and rested her chin in her
  hand, letting out a long, hopeless sigh. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>
  <hr size=2 width="30%" align=center>
  </span></div>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>The
  next day, a Wednesday, saw Lawndale High abuzz with an excitement even more
  profound than that of school pictures. A gigantic yellow banner had been hung
  across the front of the building above the main entrance by the student
  council, reading ‘Lawndale High Welcomes Back Tommy Sherman’ in giant
  colorful letters. The banner (appropriately illustrated by tacky graphics of
  a football and a pennant) automatically set everyone in school to talking,
  particularly those on the football team and cheerleading squad. Not <i>all</i>
  of the football players were beside themselves about the return of this Tommy
  Sherman guy, however. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Daria
  watched Mack Mackenzie stride down the hallway to his locker from her own. He
  seemed to be taking little note of the many seniors in reminisce mode,
  bragging to underclassmen how they’d formerly sat two tables away from Tommy
  Sherman’s at lunchtime, or how they’d once actually brushed against his arm
  in the hallway. Pitiful underclassmen were listening with astonished,
  attentive ears. It was refreshing to see at least one football player acting
  like whoever this Tommy Sherman guy was wasn’t some sort of god. Daria found
  herself shaking her head as she spotted Mack’s fellow teammate Kevin Thompson
  running up to him in a wild frenzy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“This
  is it, Mack Daddy!” exclaimed Kevin as he joined Mack, a tight grip on his
  security football. “The week of weeks!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Too
  much hero worship isn’t healthy, you know,” Mack said, before adding, “Don’t
  call me that.” Kevin just couldn’t seem to get it through his thick head that
  Mack <i>hated</i> to be called ‘Mack Daddy.’ <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“But
  the <i>man</i> is coming! The <i>man</i>!” said Kevin with great fervor in
  his voice. “Tommy Sherman brought it home, bro! The state--championship!”
  With each word there was a tap of his football against his head. “And now,
  he’s coming back to Lawndale.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“I
  know all about it,” said Mack, ever unimpressed. “Jodie’s giving the speech
  about the new goal post, remember?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Oh
  yeah!” Kevin said. “Does she need any help with ideas for that? Like, from a
  quarterback’s point of view.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Gee.
  I’ll ask her,” said Mack, a sarcastic edge to his voice. “When there aren’t
  any sharp objects around.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Mack’s
  comment flew completely over Kevin’s head. “Cool!” he said, his trademark
  dopey grin unfaltering. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Daria slammed
  her locker shut as the two turned a corner, her head still shaking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>
  <hr size=2 width="30%" align=center>
  </span></div>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Early
  morning sunlight beat down across Daria’s shoulders from a cloudless sky and
  she could feel the heat of it being attracted by the dark green jacket on her
  back. For a late autumn day, it felt unusually warm. As she sat in the
  student courtyard waiting for homeroom bell to ring, Daria picked at the
  corner of her eyes with weak fingers, knuckles briefly meeting, and knocked
  away the remnants of an inadequate sleep. She then cracked her neck with one
  hand and glanced around the courtyard at the numerous unoccupied trees. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Remind
  me again why we’re not sitting in the shade?” Daria said to her friend Jane,
  who sat across from her on the grass. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“I
  don’t care what they say,” Jane replied. “Ultraviolet rays are our friends.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Daria
  shifted her position to Indian-style, her legs brushing against the sharp,
  dry grass. Across the courtyar were Brittany Taylor and some of the other
  Lawndale High cheerleaders, all toting signs that among other things read
  ‘Welcome Tommy Sherman’ and ‘Tommy Sherman: Athletic Hero.’ Daria had heard a
  lot of fuss about this Tommy Sherman the past few days, but as she had only
  arrived at Lawndale High School a few months previous, the legend of the
  great Tommy Sherman was unbeknownst to her. All she knew was that this guy
  was quite respected at Lawndale High, and to show their respect, the school
  was erecting new goalposts on the football field in his name. The actual <i>reason</i>
  he was so respected hadn’t yet been picked up by Daria’s radar, and she admittedly
  was mildly curious. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“What’s
  the big deal about this football guy anyway?” she asked Jane. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Tommy
  Sherman? He was quarterback three years ago when the school won the state
  championship,” said Jane. “My brother knew him.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Well,
  why name the goal posts after him?” Daria said. “Why not the whole stadium?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Goal
  <i>post</i>,” Jane corrected. “See, his trademark was he always wanted to run
  the touchdown in himself.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“A
  real team player,” quipped Daria. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“But
  he couldn’t keep himself from waving to the crowd when he did it. They’d
  cheer--” --as Jane spoke, she lifted her right hand in the air, balled into a
  tight fist-- “--he’d wave--” --she raised her left hand, waving it about--
  “--and <i>wham</i>!” Jane’s right fist smashed into her open left hand as she
  spoke. “He’d run right into the goal post.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“What
  an intelligent young man,” said Daria, slightly amused at the picture that
  had formed in her mind. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“He
  broke his own nose twice,” said Jane, cracking her knuckles. “Then in the
  playoffs a week before the state championship, he scored the winning
  touchdown, and hit the goal post <i>so</i> hard, he cracked his helmet. He
  was unconscious for six days. Miraculously, he woke up the night before the
  big game feeling <i>great</i>.” Jane paused in mock-suspense. “The next day,
  he led the team to victory.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Stirring.”
  <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Isn’t
  it?” Jane leaned back and let her weight rest on her hands, her arms
  stiffening. “So now the school’s bought one of those new goal posts designed
  to break apart rather than split your skull.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
  Tahoma'>How noble of them</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
  Tahoma'>, Daria thought to herself. <i>But…</i> “Why only one?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Budget
  cuts,” said Jane. “<i>And</i> they’re naming it after good old Tommy
  Sherman.” Brisk footsteps on the freshly-cut grass told Daria someone was
  coming from behind. Jane smirked at the mystery guest, adding, “And here
  comes the lucky student council member who will do the honors.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Give
  me a break.” Jodie Landon, super-student extraordinaire, stopped between the
  two girls. She hugged a clipboard close to her person. “Hey Daria, I can’t
  get past the introduction to this speech,” Jodie said. “Can I read it to
  you?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Daria
  lifted her head to look at Jodie, her eyes squinting to protect them from the
  bright yellow sunlight. “Does that mean I don’t have to listen to it later?”
  she asked, deadpan. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Jodie
  ignored her remark and seated herself on the grass. She held out her
  clipboard and read aloud, “ ‘Good afternoon students, faculty, and distinguished
  alumni of Lawndale High. As a representative of your student council’...” Her
  clipboard fell to her lap. “Any ideas?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>After
  a short pause, Daria decided upon, “...‘it is my privilege today to once
  again send the message that learning is no substitute for winning.’ ” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“
  ‘And that it’s not how hard you study,’ ” added Jane. “ ‘It’s how hard you
  play <i>foo’ball</i>!’ ” Jane displayed her best macho face, holding her
  fists tight. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Gosh,
  thanks so much,” said Jodie sarcastically. Her face suddenly contorted in an
  exasperation that she’d been struggling to hold back. “You think I <i>like</i>
  this?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“If
  you don’t believe any of it, why give the speech?” asked Daria. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Because
  I’m on the student council,” Jodie replied importantly, the exasperation in
  her face warping into some kind of pathetic pride. “It’s a job with many
  responsibilities, and today it’s my responsibility to kiss the butt of some
  jock getting a goal post named after him.” Jodie took a breath. “But at least
  now I feel really good about it.” She removed a pencil from the clipboard and
  quickly jotted down the perspectives of Daria and Jane. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Hey.”
  A male voice made the three of them turn. Mack had made his way behind the
  girls and was now smiling down at Jodie. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Jodie
  looked up at him, unfazed. “Leave me alone!” she exclaimed quite
  unexpectedly, rising to her feet and stomping off with her clipboard in tow. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Mack’s
  now-bewildered glance fell back down to Daria and Jane. A few rather
  uncomfortable moments passed before Daria broke the silence. “Chicks.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Jane
  nodded. “Yeah, chicks.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Brittany
  Taylor was beside herself with excitement as she walked with her usual air of
  perkiness down the school corridor. Today was the big day. In just hours, she
  would come face to face with Lawndale’s own celebrity. As captain of the
  cheerleading squad, it was her esteemed responsibility to present to the one
  and only Tommy Sherman his very own namesake goalpost. How exhilarating it
  all was! Brittany attempted to slow her breathing, coming to a halt and
  smoothing the wrinkles in her cheerleading skirt. As her breathing slowed,
  she bent down to tie a shoestring that had come undone. A graceful motion of
  her hands brought the strings into a neat double-knot, and as she shifted to
  stand up, Brittany sensed someone facing her. Her breathing quickened again
  as her eyes lifted higher. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Keep
  going,” a deep male voice said. “It gets better.” Slowly, her eyes followed
  the height of a tall, brawny young man. “Hello, beautiful! I see one thing
  about Lawndale football has improved a lot since I was unanimously voted most
  valuable player... the cheerleaders!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>The
  stranger wore a cocky smile that was accented by a strong jaw line. Brittany’s
  heart nearly jumped from her chest as her eyes met his. There could be no
  mistaking it. “You’re Tommy Sherman!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“You
  know your sports.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Brittany
  clapped her hands together. “My boyfriend’s Kevin Thompson! He’s quarterback
  of the team, he worships you!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“That’s
  great,” Tommy replied, most insincere. He eyed her up and down, obviously
  pleased with what he’d found. Casually, Tommy said, “Listen, they’re putting me
  up at the Lawndale Manor. Why don’t you and I head back there, order some
  champagne, get horizontal, and you can find out just how big a hero I am?” He
  crossed his arms, his arrogant grin growing wider. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Brittany’s
  eyes widened, but a curled upper lip suggested that she was not so delighted
  anymore. Could this revolting pig be the amazing Tommy Sherman? “Didn’t you
  hear what I <i>said</i>?” Brittany said huffily, making no attempt to hide
  her disgust. “My <i>boyfriend</i> is your biggest <i>fan</i>?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“What
  are you telling me, he wants to watch?” Tommy asked.<span
  style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He paused, stroking his chin in
  consideration. “I don’t know...” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Scowling,
  Brittany drew back her hand and slapped him across the face. Then she turned
  on her heel and stomped down the hall, fists shaking with rage. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Calling
  after her, Tommy said, “All right, all right, he can watch!” Brittany did not
  stop, but her face did turn very red. Tommy called again. “Hey, where are you
  going?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Brittany
  stomped on past Daria, who’d been half-watching the scene as she exchanged
  books at her locker. Tommy’s deep voice sailed on down the hallway, now enraged:
  “<i>Hey, did someone flash the bimbo signal</i>?!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>An
  expression of disgusted vexation twisted its way onto Daria’s face as
  Brittany, thoroughly sickened, turned a corner and disappeared. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

  followed Mack around most of the morning, ranting about the glorious Tommy
  Sherman between spouts of ‘Mack Daddy.’ Facts, stories, his own thoughts...
  all these were pounded into Mack’s head by eleven a.m. This Tommy Sherman
  situation was getting blown more and more out of proportion. The news that
  Tommy Sherman had already arrived at the school had fanned the flames, and
  Mack felt ready to smash his head repeatedly into a brick wall when suddenly
  Kevin pointed down the hall. Strutting proudly towards them was none other
  than-- <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Tommy
  Sherman!” Kevin looked as if his knees were about to give out on him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Tommy
  came to a halt in front of them and said with his hands on his hips, “That’s
  the name. Don’t wear it out.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Kevin
  managed to regain some sort of composure. “I’m your biggest fan!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“I
  doubt that,” Tommy said. “Unless the rest of them are pygmies!” He coughed
  out a callous chuckle. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Kevin
  apparently had no idea what Tommy was talking about. “I’m Kevin Thompson.
  This is Michael Jordan Mackenzie.” Kevin clapped Mack on the back. “We call
  him Mack.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Tommy’s
  grin contorted into a frown of incredulity. “Michael <i>Jordan</i> Mackenzie?
  You’re kidding, right?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Mack’s
  eyes fell to the floor. “It was Michael James Mackenzie, but Dad went to a
  Bulls playoff game when I was twelve and then he... changed it.” Mack trailed
  off in embarrassment, keeping his eyes as far away from Tommy as possible. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“That’s
  sick, man,” said Tommy, still frowning. “So, what are you guys, on the
  intramural squad or something?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Varsity,
  dude!” exclaimed Kevin. “I’m the QB!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>A
  violent laugh suddenly shot from Tommy’s pipes. After a few moments of uncertainty,
  Kevin laughed along with him. Mack’s nostrils flared. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>The
  laughing stopped short and Tommy scowled at Kevin, a thick eyebrow raised.
  “Why are <i>you</i> laughing?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Um,
  why are <i>you</i>?” asked Kevin uncertainly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Tommy’s
  arrogant smirk reappeared. “I’m just picturing a scrawny little guy like you
  trying to play for some third-rate junior college somewhere and getting your
  butt kicked every week!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Oh,
  yeah. That’s funny,” Kevin said, laughing hesitantly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“No
  it isn’t,” Mack said quietly, staring bitterly at the great Tommy Sherman. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>The
  confusion on Kevin’s face suddenly vanished as Brittany walked into the hall
  from a nearby classroom, clutching her books tightly. Again exhilarated, he
  cried, “Hey Britt! Did you meet Tommy Sherman?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Brittany
  took one revolted look at Tommy and shrieked, “Yes!” She drove her fingers
  further into her books as she dashed off down the hallway. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Kevin
  scratched the back of his head and then hurried on after her, as did
  disconcerted shouts of “Hey babe, what’s the matter?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Taking
  his leave, Mack said coldly to Tommy, “Pleased to make your acquaintance.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Yeah!”
  said Tommy. “Make sure your father doesn’t go to any Whoopi Goldberg movies!”
  <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Another
  obnoxious guffaw escaped him as he watched Mack go. Behind him, a pair of
  bespectacled eyes shot him a fiery glare. Tommy Sherman was completely oblivious.

  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>By
  the time the lunch bell sounded that day, Daria had for the most part
  disregarded what she’d witnessed with Tommy Sherman. She <i>had</i> mentioned
  what she’d seen to Jane however, hoping to gain her perspective. There wasn’t
  a whole lot Jane had to say except for “it figures.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
  Tahoma'>Well</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>,
  thought Daria as she headed to her locker with Jane, <i>as long as I don’t
  have to deal with him directly, things won’t have to suck any more than
  usual. Of course, with my luck--</i> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Daria
  came to an abrupt halt. So did Jane. Her locker was now in plain view, and
  leaning right against it was Tommy Sherman. His arms were crossed, and he was
  swooning at some various female walking by. Daria swallowed her revulsion and
  said loudly, “Excuse me.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Tommy
  turned to look at her. Immediately his lip sunk. “You’re kidding, right? You
  think I’m going to talk to <i>you</i>?” He turned to Jane. “You, <i>maybe</i>,”
  he said, looking her over. “Like, four hours into a kegger!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Jane
  kept her cool. “Perhaps after I vomit on your shoes...” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“I
  don’t want to talk to you,” Daria said sharply. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Yeah
  right,” said Tommy. “You said, ‘excuse me.’ ” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“You’re
  on my locker.” Impatience graced Daria’s voice. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Apparently
  Tommy could not believe what he was hearing. He straightened up, his nostrils
  huge, and shouted, “Do you know who I am?” He didn’t give her time to reply.
  “Tommy Sherman?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Managing
  to keep an equilibrium between poise and truculence, Daria said nonchalantly,
  “I know the whole school’s turning itself inside out because of some
  egotistical football player, and I’ve seen you insult or proposition just
  about everyone you’ve come across, so my <i>guess</i> is that you’re the
  football player guy. Congratulations, you must have worked very hard to
  become a colossal jerk so quickly.” Daria could hear Jane stifling a low
  snicker beside her, but she kept her eyes on Tommy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>It
  seemed at first that Tommy didn’t know quite what to say. Finally he spat
  out, “You know what Tommy Sherman’s going to do now? He’s going to go out
  onto the football field and check out his new goal post. He’s going to read
  the plaque and think about all the people who admire him.” Daria stared dispassionately
  into Tommy’s hostile red face. His own eyes had become acute little slits. He
  waved a bulky finger at her, his scraggly shoulder-length hair flapping along
  in near-unison. “But <i>you</i> wouldn’t know anything about that. You’re one
  of those <i>misery chicks</i>, always moping about what a cruel world it is,
  making a big deal about it so people won’t notice you’re a <i>loser</i>.” He
  spun around and marched off towards the football field. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
  Tahoma'>Well, well, well,</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

  though me.</i> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“I
  don’t think he likes you.” The sound of Jane’s voice jerked Daria from her
  brief reverie. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“That
  doesn’t bother me,” Daria replied truthfully. “What bothers me is that jerk
  is going to be treated like a hero for the rest of his life.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Jane
  shrugged. “Well, maybe he won’t live that long,” she offered. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Come
  on, you know wishes don’t come true.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Daria
  had barely finished speaking when a sickening crash caused her to wince. As
  it thundered off the walls, she turned her head to Jane, whose own eyes had
  gone very wide. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>In
  moments, a surge of students was rushing past them toward the source of the
  sound. Suddenly a horrible premonition flashed through Daria’s mind. A voice
  that had risen above chaotic murmurs did nothing to reassure her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Oh
  my God! The goal post fell!” Kevin was shouting in a panicked voice. And then
  a sickly gasp, and finally: “Tommy Sherman’s dead! He’s <i>dead</i>!” Kevin’s
  voice trailed off into a long sob. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Jane
  could very well have been Daria’s doppelganger at that moment, for when Daria
  looked at Jane once more, the chasm of a mouth and softball-sized eyes she
  saw matched her own perfectly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

  </span></div>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>The
  Lawndale Sun-Herald naturally made a big deal over the death of Tommy
  Sherman. For the next few days, Daria could hardly stand to look at the
  newspaper. It was all too predictable the way the media blew the incident up.
  The irony of it all greatly appealed to the journalists’ sense of conspiracy,
  and it made Daria want to puke-- that, and the fact that everyone at school
  was bawling like a bus had flattened their pet dog. It didn’t add up to
  Daria. Sure, it was an awful thing that had happened, but Tommy Sherman
  hadn’t exactly been a martyr or anything. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
  Tahoma'>Of course</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>,
  thought Daria, <i>he </i>was<i> a football player...</i> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>In
  one of the bits that caught Daria’s eye, the Sun-Herald made a note that it
  was the very least Principal Angela Li could do to hold a student memorial
  service at Lawndale High for poor Tommy Sherman. By some extremely amazing
  chance, Tommy had no family that cared enough to engender a lawsuit. His
  mother had walked out years ago and no one knew where she had gone, and since
  his son had graduated high school, Bill Sherman had left Lawndale and moved
  to Las Vegas with a new wife twenty years his junior. Mr. Sherman was not
  available for comment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Under
  the article was a small ad that encouraged all to send flowers and donations
  to such and such address, downtown Lawndale. Daria frowned as she flipped
  past it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>With
  Friday afternoon came the memorial for Tommy Sherman in the auditorium, and
  all students were required to attend. Daria had contemplated over whether or
  not to bring a book in with her, but a strange, annoyed reaction from Jane
  had made the decision for her. Now, as she glanced at Jane in the seat beside
  hers, Daria sensed something was off. However, there was not much she could
  do about it at the moment, so with nothing else to do, she turned her
  attention toward Ms. Li onstage. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>The
  stage itself had been done up in a gaudy display of potted flowers and
  ribboned blossom wreaths. Behind the podium where Ms. Li stood hung two huge
  photographs of Tommy, one of him in football garb and one a shot of his
  arrogant mug. They seemed to weigh down the maroon velour travelers considerably.
  Daria wondered how everyone would react if they were to fall down on their
  esteemed educator, more irony to be thrown into the kitty. She didn’t know
  whether she’d cry or laugh. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Ms.
  Li addressed the student body. “How does one make sense of a tragedy so...
  tragic?” Her melodramatic voice was festooned with noisy sobs coming from
  Kevin’s way. “A young man... a <i>hero</i>!... struck down in a freakish
  accident by the very goal post that was to have been dedicated in his honor.”
  <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Daria
  stared blankly up at Ms. Li from her squeaky seat. It was almost amusing,
  hearing her praise the jerk. What was even more amusing was that the students
  were actually buying it. To Daria’s right were Mack and Jodie, both looking
  uncharacteristically down. What was the big deal? Hadn’t both Mack and Jodie
  witnessed firsthand the vulgarity of Tommy Sherman? Kevin sat a couple seats
  to her left, nearly hysterical, with Brittany offering an arm of comfort.
  Daria couldn’t help but notice Brittany’s eyes roll as Kevin let out a
  particularly loud cry. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>The
  preachy oration dragged on. “What lesson can we take from all of this?” Ms.
  Li lectured with a stern, beseeching stare that suddenly veered off to the
  right of the auditorium. The students all turned their heads to see a few of
  the maintenance staff looking very uncomfortable. “Other than not to leave
  heavy goal posts in sharp edged wooden crates leaning precariously against
  the bleachers,” she added. It took an effort for Daria to hide her smirk. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“The
  lesson is to spread joy, spread light!” continued Ms. Li, her voice fake and
  light once more. “Make it your <i>goal</i> to make others feel <i>good</i>. And
  when you reach that goal, you keep running... until you reach the goal <i>post</i>!
  You hit that goal post, hard!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Daria
  couldn’t believe she was hearing this. She shook her head with an air of
  disapproval. The seat beside her squeaked lightly and Daria saw that Jane was
  now looking in the opposite direction. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>And
  yet still, the bogus voice: “That is what this young man did. And that is the
  legacy he left to you... to me. To <i>Lawndale High</i>.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Ms.
  Li’s usual drawn-out proclamation of the school’s name was suddenly
  obstructed by a piercing wail that made Daria’s brow wrinkle. Finally, Ms. Li
  gave up. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Would
  someone get him <i>out</i> of here so we can all sing ‘One Sweet Day?’ ” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Instead
  of the usual Friday afternoon hooplah, a strange, quiet calm lingered over the
  halls of Lawndale High as the students exited the auditorium. The excitement
  of the weekend had been subsided by the gloominess that came with the
  memorial assembly. The weekend football game had been postponed, but it
  didn’t seem to matter to anyone, not even the players or cheerleaders. No one
  felt like holding any parties, or going to any for that matter. It was a very
  different mood, even to Daria, who was now feeling perhaps the <i>slightest</i>
  bit of remorse as she walked down the hallway with Jane. Jane was keeping
  very quiet, and it suddenly occurred to Daria that she had been that way not
  just today, but all week. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“It’s
  weird,” said Daria, breaking a silence. “One minute he’s standing there
  calling me a loser, the next minute he’s <i>dead</i>.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Jane
  kept looking straight ahead. “Yeah.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>A
  one-word answer was a little less than what Daria was hoping for. “I mean,
  the guy Ms. Li was talking about didn’t bear any resemblance to the guy we
  met. But still--” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Listen,
  I’m going home to change,” Jane interrupted. “I think I’m going to go for a
  run.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“I’ll
  walk you,” offered Daria. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Actually,
  I think I want to walk by myself for a little while,” said Jane quickly.
  Daria stopped walking, a bit surprised, but Jane kept going. “See you later.”
  <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>The
  corners of Daria’s mouth drooped into a frown. <i>Did I just get blown off?</i>
  she asked herself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>There
  really wasn’t time to think about this, however, because for some bizarre
  reason, Kevin was now walking in her direction. For now, at least, the tears
  seemed to have stopped flowing. Still, his face had kept twisted in a frown,
  quite the contrast of his usual foolish smile. Judging from the quivering in
  his jaw, it looked as though he might erupt into hysterics at any time. At
  first, Daria thought (and hoped) that Kevin might just pass her, but when he
  was a few feet away, he stopped and said, “Hey Daria, can I talk to you?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>An
  eyebrow lifted high on Daria’s forehead. “Why?” she asked. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“About,
  well you know, <i>Tommy</i>,” Kevin stammered. “I’m really bummed out.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Yeah,
  I’m sorry about that Kevin,” said Daria, shrugging her shoulders and starting
  up her stride once more, “but I don’t know what to tell you. I only met him
  right before the accident.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Me
  too!” Kevin said, following her to a side exit. “But I mean, it really makes
  you think. Got any like, words of wisdom or whatever?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Like
  what?” Daria said skeptically as she pushed through the double doors.
  Overcast sky greeted them, reflecting the mood of the day. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“I
  don’t know. I figure you think about depressing stuff a lot,” said Kevin as
  they continued on toward the parking lot. “You’re that type, you know?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Daria
  frowned herself and said, “No, I <i>don’t</i> know.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Possibly
  Kevin, through some amazing display of awareness, realized he had stepped on
  unpleasant territory, because he went back to praising Tommy without further
  discussion. “I mean, the guy <i>was</i> a hero. A really good quarterback,
  everybody liked him, kinda hunky, you know.” Kevin was quick to clear
  himself. “Not that I would notice something like that.” He paused. “And now
  he’s just like, the dead guy.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Something
  suddenly occurred to Daria and she stopped walking. “Tell me Kevin, did he remind
  you of anyone?” she asked. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“What
  do you mean?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Daria
  elaborated. “Maybe his death hit a little too close to home?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Kevin
  considered this. “Hmm... I get what you’re saying,” he said. “But I don’t
  believe in ghosts, Daria.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
  Tahoma'>What the hell...?</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
  Tahoma'> was what Daria was thinking, but she said aloud only, “What?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Kevin
  drew back to explain himself. “You’re saying he got <i>hit</i> on the head
  out there on the football field,” he said, “the team’s <i>home</i>. And now it’s
  going to be cursed or something and we’re going to lose all our games.” Kevin
  tutted. “I’m a little surprised, Daria.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“That
  makes two of us,” said Daria. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Wiggling
  his fingers eerily, Kevin added, “I didn’t figure you to believe in all that <i>mumbo-gumbo</i>.”
  <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Gee,
  I hope this won’t lower your opinion of me,” Daria quipped. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Come
  on!” said Kevin, laughing the first laugh Daria had heard all week. He gave
  her a forceful pat on the back, knocking her forward, and said, “How much
  lower could it get?” Satisfied, Kevin started off to the parking lot, leaving
  Daria somewhat winded and suddenly feeling stupider than she had five minutes
  before. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>No
  sooner had Kevin drifted into the parking lot than an unmistakable voice had
  squeaked out Daria’s name, and long, thin fingers had wrapped themselves
  around Daria’s arm and pulled her about to face their person. Daria blinked.
  The squeak of a voice had indeed belonged to just who she thought.
  “Brittany?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Daria,
  I’ve got to talk to you.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Brittany
  stood in a pitiful fashion on the grass. Daria immediately noticed how oddly
  tense and square Brittany’s blue-clad shoulders seemed to be. Her lips were droopy
  as she spoke, and the distinctive squeakiness in her voice was unusually
  subdued. Brittany’s usually perky face looked pale and gloomy. This princess
  of the pep squad was not in any way cheerful today. She looked a great deal
  more collected than Kevin, but Brittany’s thickly made-up eyelashes hung low,
  and under them, her eyes stared back at Daria with pleading.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
  Tahoma'>Dare I ask?</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>
  Daria asked herself. “About...?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Tommy
  Sherman!” exclaimed Brittany. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Daria
  didn’t exactly have the will to talk about this, especially with another
  half-witted specimen of all that went wrong with chromosomes. “Maybe you
  should talk to Kevin,” she proposed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“I
  <i>can’t</i> talk to Kevin!” said Brittany, clenching her fists nervously.
  Then she lowered her voice, adding, “Tommy Sherman was a <i>jerk</i>!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Daria
  sighed. “You know, no one else seems to realize--” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“I
  can’t believe I said that!” cried Brittany, slapping her palms against her
  cheeks. “I called a dead guy a jerk!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“So
  you <i>are</i> upset about what happened?” Daria asked hesitantly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“That’s
  just it, I feel <i>terrible</i>,” said Brittany. “Why did that jerk make me
  hate him? Now he’s dead and I feel bad that I don’t feel <i>that</i> bad so I
  feel terrible!” She placed her hands on her hips and frowned. “It really
  makes you think.” Brittany’s hands moved to her double ponytails and she
  yanked at them habitually, her eyes glazing over with sadness once more. “I
  mean, you’re <i>used</i> to being all gloomy and depressed and thinking about
  bad stuff--” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Why
  does everyone keep saying that?” said Daria. This was getting more than a
  little irritating. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“--so
  I thought that maybe you can give me some tips.” Brittany twirled the end of
  one of the blonde ponytails around an index finger hopefully. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Perhaps
  it was because of her own uncertainty over the situation, or perhaps it was
  because the anguish of death had affected her some as well, but for whatever
  reason, Daria sighed and considered. “Well, I guess what I’d say, Brittany,
  is that here’s this guy who really wasn’t very nice, and you didn’t like him
  at all. You’re sorry that he died--” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“I
  am!” Brittany reassured her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“--but
  you don’t think you feel sorry enough,” continued Daria. “And you’re worried
  that you’re not as nice a person as you thought.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Brittany
  considered this. Then she said, “Yeah! It’s like, I feel bad but I think I
  should feel worse and not feeling worse makes me feel bad all over again!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“The
  truth is, Brittany,” Daria said sincerely, “that you are nice, or you
  wouldn’t be feeling bad at all right now.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Another
  pause, and then very carefully, Brittany said, “So, you’re saying that
  feeling bad about not feeling worse is <i>good</i>.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Daria
  hesitated, trying to make some sense of Brittany’s warped logic. “Yes,” she
  decided, though she wasn’t really sure if she meant it or not. “Yes, that’s
  exactly what I’m saying.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Brittany
  smiled and tugged a ponytail. “Thanks, Daria!” she squeaked, sprinting off. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>On
  a whim, Daria reached around and plucked a small spiral notepad from a pocket
  on her backpack. She took a pencil from the spiral ring and scribbled: <i>Feeling
  bad + not feeling worse = good</i>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Another
  voice suddenly called out Daria’s name, this one soft and wimpy, and Daria
  again knew who it was immediately. She turned around to see her English
  teacher, Mr. O’Neill, standing behind her. His wimpy-ness was radiating most
  glaringly today; as had everyone else that had come up to her, Mr. O’Neill
  looked very troubled. “Uh... hi, Mr. O’Neill,” Daria said. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>O’Neill
  smiled weakly and looked down at her notepad. “May I ask what you’re jotting
  down? A reflection about poor Tommy Sherman, no doubt.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Not
  really.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“It
  must have been a terrible shock for someone as sensitive as you,” Mr. O’Neill
  decided. “Yes, yes. It really makes you think.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Um,
  yeah, but I’m dealing with it,” Daria said, wondering how many times she was
  going to hear that particular phrase in one day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Mr.
  O’Neill chuckled uneasily. “I figured <i>you’d</i> be dealing with it,” he
  declared. “You probably think about the dark side all the time.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Daria’s
  brow curled. “The... dark side? Are we talking about ‘The Force?’ ” she asked
  dryly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“The
  dark side of life,” O’Neill said. “The thoughts other people try not to have.
  That’s your thing, right? Facing the void?” Daria frankly didn’t know what
  the hell he was talking about, and figured it unwise to tell off a teacher,
  so she let him ramble. He laughed another anxious laugh. “No, I’m sure <i>you’re</i>
  dealing with it.” O’Neill faltered for a few moments, rubbing his hands
  together nervously. Then came the quivering lip. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
  Tahoma'>Uh oh. Here it comes</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  font-family:Tahoma'>, Daria said to herself. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Like
  clockwork, Mr. O’Neill covered his face with his hands and burst into tears.
  “<i>I’m</i> not dealing with it!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Daria
  glanced the other way uncomfortably. She sighed. “There, there,” she said
  unenthusiastically, patting him on the back in a manner much the same. “Do
  you want to... talk about it?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span

  <hr size=2 width="30%" align=center>
  </span></div>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Dialing
  Jane’s number and getting no answer occupied most of Daria’s free time for
  the remainder of the evening. Daria had a terrible urge to tell someone about
  what had happened, and there weren’t exactly a lot of people she felt she
  could genuinely talk to. As she paced in circles around her bedroom that
  evening, Daria found a lot of time to just think. Daria didn’t get why
  everyone was having such a hard time dealing with this Tommy Sherman matter.
  Maybe it was a harsh reminder of the mortality that affected all of them? Or
  maybe everyone really <i>was</i> blind to the fact that Tommy Sherman was,
  until the moment he died, a total jerk. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>The
  next morning, the thoughts were still bouncing about in Daria’s head and she
  still hadn’t gotten ahold of Jane. It was Saturday, and there was very little
  chance Jane would be up anytime before eleven, so Daria went through the
  usual motions of the morning to pass the time. Then she sat on her bed
  staring mindlessly at the TV until she was sure Jane would be awake (a bit
  before noon) and dialed her number. On the fourth ring, Jane picked up.
  “Yeah?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Where
  have <i>you</i> been?” Daria asked. “I’ve been trying to get a hold of you
  since four o’clock yesterday afternoon.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Hello
  to you too. I went running, like I said,” replied Jane. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Uh-huh.
  To where, Canada?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Why
  have you been calling?” asked Jane, ignoring the sarcasm. “What’d you want to
  tell me?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Daria
  wasted no time in telling Jane everything that had happened, from the time
  Jane had left her in the hallway onward. Jane kept quiet as Daria went
  through the events.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“So
  then as soon as I get Brittany squared away,” said Daria, drawing a close to
  her recap, “<i>Mr. O’Neill</i> comes over wanting to talk. And they all say
  the same thing: ‘It really makes you think.’ ” She exhaled deeply. “I feel
  like getting a couch.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“You’re
  the girl of the hour,” said Jane with a tiny laugh. Then a bit lower: “Maybe <i>I</i>
  should talk to you.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Yeah,
  right,” said Daria. “You know, I can’t believe the way people are reacting. I
  mean, yeah, it’s terrible what happened, but it’s not as if he was <i>nice</i>
  to anyone.” Daria slumped down on the edge of her bed, feeling frustrated and
  irate all at once. “They’re acting like they lost a friend.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Boy
  Daria, nothing gets through to you, does it?” Jane said flatly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>This
  wasn’t what Daria expected to hear. “What’s that supposed to mean?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“The
  guy <i>died</i>,” Jane snapped. “And you’re talking about what a jerk he
  was.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“I
  just said...” Daria trailed off. For once, she was at a complete loss for
  words. She sighed. Rather than continue to argue, she changed the subject.
  “Look, you wanna get some pizza?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“I’m
  going running.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“After?”
  The question was hopeful. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“I
  don’t know,” said Jane, “it’s going to be a long run. See you later.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Daria
  listened to the click and then to the blank nothingness. She pressed the off
  button on the cordless phone and idly tossed it across the bed. What was the
  deal here? Why was Jane, the only person Daria felt really understood her,
  criticizing her for the way she felt? What exactly was Jane’s problem anyway?
  And why was everyone suddenly thinking that Daria was the queen of all
  despair? Daria had had enough: she’d been thinking way too much about this
  whole ordeal lately. She picked up the remote to her television and pressed
  the power button with an eager thumb. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>The
  <i>Sick, Sad World</i> theme filled the quiet room, along with the
  announcer’s over-the-top voice: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>“
  ‘Monaco’s Mopiest Millionaires,’ next on--” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>A
  sudden knock at the door prompted Daria to hit the power button again. “Come
  in.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>The
  door opened and Quinn peaked in. She walked into the room skittishly, as if on
  foreign ground. “Daria?” Quinn stopped short and glanced about her. “Wow,
  your room still looks like this?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Quinn’s
  timing was horrible; this was probably the worst time she could’ve chosen to
  ask some stupid favor of her older sister. “Need help filling out your
  picture re-order form?” a snide Daria asked. “It’s Q-U-I--” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Daria?”
  Quinn interrupted, looking strangely somber. She hesitated some, and Daria
  feared the worst. “Can I talk to you? About the dead guy?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>If
  one could instinctively will pianos and safes to fall from the sky onto
  oneself, it was no question at all as to when Daria would have chosen to do
  so. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

  overcast sky. Jane obviously didn’t want to hang out, so Daria spent a good
  deal of the time alternating between watching bad TV and reading a book of
  Tennyson poetry for Mr. O’Neill’s class. She didn’t think about Tommy
  anymore; it was tormenting to keep mulling it over and have no one to talk to
  about it. The situation was a lousy one, and feeling alone at a time like
  this made things ten times worse. The thought of eating was terribly
  unappealing to Daria, and other than a handful of potato chips on Saturday
  afternoon she ate nothing. She relented, however, when Helen knocked at
  Daria’s door Sunday afternoon to tell her that she had reheated some leftover
  freezer lasagna for lunch; Daria hadn’t really eaten in two days and was
  starting to get hunger pains. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Jake
  was out at his office working with some important client or other, so it was
  only Daria, Helen, and Quinn at the kitchen table. This wasn’t unusual: both
  Jake and Helen often went in to work on the weekends, two ball-busting career
  people who felt more relaxed at work than at their own home. It was like
  watching a string of bad network television sitcoms the way meals at the
  Morgendorffer’s went, in that it was the same thing time after time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Today,
  alas, was no exception: Daria sat quietly, hoping the meal would be over
  quickly so she could go anywhere else. Helen pretended to be interested in
  anything that came up, even when she clearly was not. And, as at any other
  meal, Quinn used the time to chatter on aimlessly about herself... how this
  weekend’s dates went, where it was she saw this really cute miniskirt, what
  her “friends” in the Fashion Club were up to... and of course, the way she
  felt about the hot topic of the week, Tommy Sherman. She rattled on about how
  she felt “really, really bad about that guy that died,” and how she also felt
  that it was her duty as vice president of the Fashion Club to do something
  about it. Only half-listening, Daria stared down at her plate, carelessly
  cutting little squares off the edge of her lasagna and not eating them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“So
  I called up Sandi and Stacy and Tiffany,” Quinn was saying, “and the Fashion
  Club is going to take up a collection to get safe new goal posts. Like to
  honor the dead guy’s memory.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Quinn,
  what a wonderful impulse!” exclaimed Helen approvingly; whether she was sincere
  could not be told. “To make something positive come out of this <i>devastating</i>
  event.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Quinn
  beamed at this. “Daria gave me <i>that</i> idea,” she confessed. “She’s
  really good at this tragic stuff!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>The
  repetition of this suggestion only sprinkled more salt on an ever-deepening
  wound. “Thanks,” Daria said, a sour expression crossing her face. “But it was
  one of the safe new goal posts that fell on him.” There was no way she was
  going to let Quinn get away with her self-bestowed glory intact now, whether
  she meant to annoy Daria or not. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>There
  was a short silence, and then an “Oh!” from Quinn. Suddenly it seemed that
  all her pride had evaporated like the condensation on her now-empty glass.
  She set down her fork and managed to mumble, “Well, it’s the thought that
  counts,” before getting up and hurrying away from her half-eaten plate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Helen
  turned her attentions to Daria, who was still picking half-heartedly at her
  lasagna. With a quasi-maternal edge to her voice, she asked her remaining
  daughter, “And how do you feel, Daria?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>What
  happened next baffled even Daria herself; alienated Daria, who had just
  wanted someone to listen to her. Her irritation meter seemed to quite
  suddenly (and unexpectedly) soar off the charts; the sauce-doused fork she’d
  been poking about her plate hit the tabletop with a tinny clink. “I feel
  great!” Daria bellowed, not feeling one single ounce of regret. “How else <i>could</i>
  I feel? I’m the misery chick!” Daria’s chair slid back along the linoleum
  floor with a dull scrape and Daria shot out of it. She hovered over the table
  for a second or two and decided, “I’m going to Jane’s.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Her
  mother watched her go, though her expression had slightly changed: wide eyes
  and O-shaped lips set off the familiar indifferent stare. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>The
  front door to the Lane residence opened after three rings of the doorbell.
  Daria, who had more or less collected herself by the time she’d arrived, knew
  to wait: it wasn’t unusual for Jane and her brother Trent to sleep well into
  the afternoon, and they often took some time to get to the door. It was Trent
  who answered the door this time, and normally a confrontation with him made
  Daria feel tremendously awkward. The two had met when Daria had paid her
  first visit to Jane’s house after a self-esteem class a couple of months
  before, and Daria was immediately taken with Trent’s dark, rugged looks and
  deep, pacified voice. While it was only a crush, Daria typically succeeded in
  losing her composure and feeling like a complete jackass whenever he was
  around. Now, however, she was too distressed and too keen on talking to Jane
  to give in to her self-consciousness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Oh,”
  said Trent after a surprised pause. “Hey, Daria.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Hi
  Trent,” Daria said. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Trent
  appeared to know why she had come and said to her, “Janey went running.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>A
  good number of Daria’s insides plummeted, particularly her stomach, which
  seemed to hit the floor with a gooshy thud. “Oh.” Daria couldn’t muster the
  strength to even attempt to hide her disappointment. “Well, I’ll see her
  another time.” She turned to go, but before she could mutter a thanks, Trent
  spoke again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Scary
  about Tommy Sherman.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Daria
  stopped, remembering Jane’s remark about Trent and Tommy going to school
  together. “Yeah,” she replied feebly, “you knew him, right?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“We
  had a couple classes together,” Trent said. “I mean, we didn’t see him much.
  You know, he didn’t show up too often.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Had
  Daria been in a better mood, the irony of Trent’s saying this might have
  brought a smile to her blank face. “Not like you, huh?” she halfheartedly
  teased. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Trent
  laughed at this, a laugh that sputtered into a small coughing fit. He raised
  a closed fist to his mouth, and after a few seconds, the fit died down. “I
  guess I might have missed a few classes, now that you mention it,” he
  answered with a half-grin. Then, more seriously, he said, “Weird though,
  freak accident.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Bracing
  herself for ultimate disappointment, Daria slowly asked him, “Would you say
  it really makes you think?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>After
  a bit of hesitation, Trent finally decided on, “No.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>A
  slight sigh made Daria’s chest deflate with a rush of held breath. It would
  have been a stretch to say that his comment had made her day, but she by all
  means suddenly felt better. “Thank you for that, Trent.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Mmm-hmm.”
  <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“See
  ya.” Daria turned back around and had taken a few steps when Trent stopped
  her again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Hey
  Daria?” he said hastily. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Yeah?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Trent
  shifted his stance in the doorway. “You know, it was a while ago that Janey
  went running. Maybe she came back and I didn’t hear her or something.” He
  shrugged his shoulders, adding, “Anyway, why don’t you check her room? She
  might be there.” He opened the door a bit wider to allow entrance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“I’ll
  yell up the stairs,” proposed Daria, stepping inside. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>A
  surge of innocent agitation seemed to sweep over him. “No, uh, sometimes
  she’s got some music on and she can’t hear you if you yell,” said Trent. “Why
  don’t you just head on up?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Daria
  stopped at the stairs and glanced back at him, one hand resting on the worn
  banister, a skeptical look across her face. Then, with a decisive nod, she
  ascended the staircase. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>As
  Daria stepped onto the landing, she could hear faint, muffled noises coming
  from within Jane’s bedroom. This seemed to be a good sign that Jane was
  actually in there, so she approached the room and rapped steadily on the
  door. There was a short pause and then she heard Jane’s voice, partially
  subdued through the oak door: “Yo! Come on in!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Daria
  pushed the door open. Jane was sitting on her bed in Indian-style with a
  sketchbook on her lap. Her thin, longish hands were pulling a pair of
  headphones off her head, the apparent source of the strains of sound. The
  music blasting from them was quite loud, even from across the room. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Jane
  shifted her eyes toward the doorway and seemed taken aback at the sight of
  Daria. “Oh. Hi.” With a quick flip of her wrist, the headphones set shut off.
  <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
  Tahoma'>Well this is incredibly awkward</span></i><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>, thought Daria as she moved toward the bed. The
  first thing she noticed, other than Jane’s surprised face, was a hideous pea
  green and black kitchen chair situated near the bed, one that looked very old
  and quite out of place. “Hmm. This is new,” Daria commented, coming to a halt
  and briefly looking it over with an expression of distaste. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Oh
  yeah,” said Jane. “I got it at the flea market. Cool, isn’t it? Don’t know
  how long it’ll last, though.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Don’t
  worry,” replied Daria. “There’s no way it could look any worse than it does
  now, even in a hundred pieces.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Yeah,”
  Jane said again. “Then I could take the broken pieces and string them on a
  piece of fishing wire and hang it all around the room. <i>That</i> would be
  cool.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Mmm.”
  The response was neither congenial nor antagonistic. <i>All right, enough
  small talk</i>, Daria said to herself. “Are you avoiding me?” The words fled
  her lips in a serious, direct tone. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Jane
  looked at her with a feeble smile and said, “Uh, not anymore?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>The
  uneasiness that had initially barraged through Daria seemed to have subsided.
  “What’s going on?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Nothing,
  I just haven’t felt like talking to anybody,” Jane said, shrugging. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“I’m
  not <i>anybody</i>,” snapped Daria, rather stunned at how hurt she felt from
  Jane’s comment. “And <i>I’d</i> like to talk to someone.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“But
  you’ve been talking to everyone,” said Jane unsympathetically. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“No.
  Everyone’s been talking to <i>me</i>,” Daria retorted, frowning. “There’s a
  difference.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Jane
  was unmoved. “Well, what do you want to talk for anyway? You don’t care about
  what happened.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“How
  can you say that?” asked Daria, the mere thought offensive to the point of
  nausea. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“You’ve
  been treating it like, ‘Oh well, another stupid day,’ ” Jane said, throwing
  her hands up in the air to illustrate her imitation. “The guy <i>died</i>,
  Daria.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“I
  know he died. I’m <i>sorry</i> he died. But I’m not going to pretend that he
  was some great person when he wasn’t!” Daria exclaimed. It was all too easy
  now to blurt out what was bothering her: “You know, people <i>aren’t</i>
  upset because Tommy Sherman died, they’re upset because <i>they’re</i> going
  to die!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>The
  notion lingered in the air like a morning fog. Jane thought about it and
  admitted slowly, as if thinking aloud, “That’s understandable.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>A
  vast, figurative sigh of relief escaped through Daria’s breathing passages. “Okay.
  But you know what I’ve been hearing?” she asked, not waiting for an answer. “
  ‘You know how I feel Daria, <i>you’re</i> gloomy.’ ‘I knew I could talk to
  you Daria, you’re <i>always</i> miserable.’ Tragedy hits the school and
  everyone thinks of <i>me</i>.” Her usual poker face had twisted into an irate
  scowl. “The popular guy died, and now <i>I’m</i> popular because I’m the
  misery chick. But I’m not miserable!” she insisted. Daria lowered her voice,
  which had risen to a yell, but was every bit as clear as she spoke again,
  enunciating her every syllable: “<i>I’m just not like them</i>.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>For
  a few seconds, they said nothing. Then Jane said, “It really makes you
  think.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Funny.
  Thanks a lot,” said Daria sarcastically. An immense feeling of betrayal kicked
  Daria in the stomach by kicking her from within. She headed for the door. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“No!
  That’s why they want to talk to you!” called Jane, leaning forward. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Daria
  broke off in mid-step and turned, the pain in her stomach vanishing with a
  mistaken pop. Against her better judgment, she slumped down on the ancient
  kitchen chair with a feeling similar to what one feels after jogging five
  miles. “What do you mean?” she asked uncertainly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>In
  two quick hand movements, Jane cracked her knuckles. Then she said, “Well,
  when they say, ‘You’re always unhappy Daria,’ what they mean is, ‘You think,
  Daria; I can tell because you don’t smile. Now this guy died and it’s making <i>me</i>
  think and that hurts my little head and makes <i>me</i> stop smiling.’ ” Jane
  extended one of her long fingers in Daria’s direction and carried on. “When
  they come to you for advice, it’s like they’re saying, ‘Oh Daria, tell me how
  <i>you</i> cope with thinking all the time, until I can get back to my normal
  vegetable state.’ ” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>It
  was remarkable how well Jane could put things in perspective. “Okay,” said
  Daria, feeling a hundred times better. “So then why have you been avoiding
  me?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Because
  I’ve been trying <i>not</i> to think,” said Jane, drawing one leg close to
  her. “About the way we were making jokes about him dying and then boom, it
  happened?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>So,
  too, was this understandable. “We didn’t have anything to do with the guy
  dying. It was a freak accident,” Daria said. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Yeah,
  well I don’t like it when I say people should die and then they do. I don’t
  want that kind of responsibility,” said Jane. “At least not until I’ve got a
  job in middle management.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>A
  small smirk made its way onto Daria’s face. “Hmm. Uh, I’m glad we finally
  talked,” she said, finding it, as usual, difficult to say a personally honest
  word. “You realize that I bit my mother’s head off because of your playing
  deaf ear?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Hey,
  better them than me, I always say,” answered Jane wryly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>There
  was a short, comfortable silence, the only noise coming from Jane’s
  antiquated heater vent. Finally, almost as an afterthought, Daria said, “You
  didn’t make him die.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Jane
  dropped her legs over the side of the bed. “You’re not the misery chick.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Daria
  rose to her feet and said conclusively, “All right, then.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“All
  right, then,” Jane repeated. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Another
  pause. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“He
  shouldn’t have died,” said Daria. She hadn’t yet admitted this, not even to
  herself, but what was true was true.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Jane’s
  head shook regretfully. “No.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“But
  he <i>wasn’t</i> a nice guy.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Yes,
  what was true <i>was</i> true, and Jane knew it as well: “<i>No</i>.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>And
  just like that, the matter was closed. Everything had been said that had
  needed to be. <i>And here were are</i>, thought Daria, <i>both still alive</i>.
  Still, one other thing was bothering her. “Did Trent know you were up here?”
  she asked. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Her
  friend sighed. “Told him to tell anyone who showed up that I was out
  running,” said Jane. “What a surprise. He forgot.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Daria
  shook her head earnestly. “No, he didn’t.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

  High was by no means back to its cheerful, superficial normality when Daria
  returned to school on Monday, but already, things were heading back in that
  direction. It wasn’t as if she had actually expected these people to brood
  over the accident for a long period of time, but even if Tommy Sherman was a
  big jerk, she was almost shocked to see how drastically things were changing
  back so soon. On Wednesday, the one-week anniversary of the accident,
  numerous things had been brought about and subsequently forgotten: the
  newspapers, after draining the juice dry from the Tommy Sherman incident, had
  swung all attentions to some other outrageous scandal involving a naive old
  lady and the laundering of cocaine money; the Fashion Club, after a mere two
  days of bouncing around the collection idea had dropped it in favor of
  something more relevant to the brainless and narcissistic; and the student
  body, after their brief mourning period, had gone back to being entirely
  self-absorbed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

  Tahoma'>I should really consider a career as a psychic buddy</span></i><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>, thought Daria as she reflected
  on how predictable everything seemed to be while sitting in Mr. O’Neill’s
  class, bored perfectly out of her skull. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“
  ‘It is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all,’ ” Mr.
  O’Neill was quoting as he held out a collection of Alfred Lord Tennyson poems
  in his hand in a dramatic gesture. “Just what <i>is</i> Lord Tennyson talking
  about?” He scoped out the class. It had taken him the whole quarter, but for
  the most part, he had finally gotten his students’ names down. “Brittany?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>It
  seemed to take Brittany all the effort she had to say, as she tipped her
  index finger to her chin, “Um... love?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Anyone
  else?” asked O’Neill, his voice breaking in dismay at Brittany’s answer. When
  no one volunteered, he fell back on his default choice. “Daria?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Well,
  he’s acknowledging that if something makes you feel good, like being in love,
  there must be a corresponding painful side, like losing a love,” Daria
  answered. “That’s just a fact of life.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Mr.
  O’Neill’s face drooped, but he nodded in agreement. “Sad, but true.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“And
  what’s intriguing about it is that no one calls Tennyson a big unhappiness
  freak just because he understands that,” said Daria resentfully. <i>Like
  someone I might mention</i>, she thought. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Is
  he a big unhappiness... freak?” The word ‘freak’ seemed difficult for O’Neill
  to say and came out as a squeak. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“No,
  he’s a realist,” she contended, keeping her voice steady. “He says emotional
  involvement can bring pleasure and extraordinary pain. Then he declares that
  it’s still better than never feeling anything at all.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>A
  broad smile crossed Mr. O’Neill’s face as he leaned back against his desk,
  thoroughly satisfied. “That is <i>excellent</i>, Daria!” he exclaimed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Of
  course,” Daria added, her straight face never wavering, “this was written
  before the advent of community property laws.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
  Tahoma'>The misery chick strikes again</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  font-family:Tahoma'>, she said to herself, the biggest of inward smiles spreading
  across her as she watched Mr. O’Neill draw back in confusion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

  </span></div>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>At
  the end of class, with no homework to work on and nothing to read with the
  Tennyson book finished, Daria decided to take a trip to the library. Rather
  than her usual mini-siesta, Jane maintained that it was very important she
  escort Daria to and from the library, should Daria “need to shoulder to fall
  back on during these emotional times.” Mr. O’Neill agreed completely. The
  girls were halfway there when another girl’s deep voice called from behind
  them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Hello?
  Uh, Quinn’s cousin or whatever?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Daria
  stopped and looked behind her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It had
  happened that the first thing Quinn did upon the Morgendorffers’ arrival in
  Lawndale was to make sure that everyone at Lawndale High knew that she and
  Daria were <i>not</i> sisters. It had been aggravating to Daria, but she had
  quickly found the ‘sister’ thing to be the perfect way to embarrass Quinn.
  Still, her little sister always managed to persuade her empty-headed friends
  that Daria was just some weird girl who was nothing more to her than distant
  family, and sometimes even less than that, no matter what Daria did to
  convince them otherwise. Daria had been called many things in relation to
  Quinn in her time at Lawndale, but ‘cousin’ was the most popular. “Yeah?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>The
  girl that had been calling her was Sandi Griffin, Quinn’s sometime friend,
  sometime rival and fellow officer in the Fashion Club. According to Quinn,
  she was a rigid and intimidating president, but as Sandi spoke to Daria, she
  looked timid and uncomfortable, as though Daria might pounce and maul at any
  second. She said uncertainly, “Quinn said you were really good with like,
  bummed out stuff?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Yeah...?”
  Daria wondered where this was going. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Sandi
  got right down to it. “My cat, he like got into my makeup or something and
  like OD-ed on foundation, and he spent the whole day puking,” she explained. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Jane
  smirked. “And experience left him questioning the meaning of life?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“And
  I’ve been feeling really bad about it,” Sandi continued, paying no attention
  to Jane, “and I was wondering if you had like some advice or something.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>A
  golden opportunity seemed to be knocking at Daria’s door. She exchanged glances
  with Jane, who glowed with approval. “I’m afraid that inflation has forced me
  to institute a small fee for my services,” said Daria. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Huh?”
  <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Ten
  dollars,” Daria replied bluntly. “In advance.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Oh,”
  said Sandi. “Uh, sure.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>One
  of Sandi’s bracelet-adorned hands dug into a pocket on her short-alls and
  produced a ten dollar-bill.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“What
  is the animal’s name?” Daria asked, employing a fake voice of expertise. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Uh,
  Fluffy,” said Sandi. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Daria
  tilted her head and stroked her chin, casting her eyes at the strip lighting.
  “I see,” she said. “Fluffy.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>A
  long silence followed. Daria kept her eyes on the ceiling and her hand on her
  chin. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>After
  a minute or so, Sandi asked at last, “So, like what’s your advice?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Find
  some other way to feel,” said Daria decisively. “Then you won’t feel sad.”
  She extended her hand. “Good luck.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Sandi
  clenched her fists tightly. “That’s what I get for ten dollars?!” she barked,
  placing her angry fists on her hips. “Are you kidding?!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“See?”
  Daria said, her voice remaining calm. “It’s working already.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Sandi’s
  brow sagged in bewilderment. She thought this over, a suspicious glaze over
  her eyes. Finally, she mumbled a persuaded “Thanks” and strutted off quickly
  down the hallway, back to the land of the shallow and stupid. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Jane
  and Daria watched her go, absorbing what had just happened. Her voice brimming
  with amusement, Jane remarked, “You just made ten bucks off that poor girl’s
  suffering.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>Daria
  looked down at the crisp ten-spot, then at Jane. “Yeah,” she said, “that was
  wrong.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Really,”
  Jane agreed. With a mischievous grin on her face, she looked over at Daria,
  who had on display one of her own rare smiles. “<i>Next</i> time...” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>“Twenty.”
