<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:53.25pt;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The driving lesson hadn't gotten any
worse.&nbsp; But it was by no means getting better. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:53.25pt;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Daria Morgendorffer tried to
concentrate on the road, the speed, and the fact she was in a 3/4 ton
SUV.&nbsp; Secretly, Daria did look forward to getting her license, but the
thought of driving filled her with more dread than she would have wanted.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thankful she wasn't driving a standard, Daria
tried to accelerate smoothly, but invariably lurched the SUV, like most new
drivers are prone to do. <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Her &quot;instructor,&quot;
passenger and mother Helen could see that the drive was making her
nervous.&nbsp; So, she decided to call it a day for the driving lesson and made
Daria turn into Glen Oaks to go home. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:53.25pt;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;All right, Daria, don't start
your turn until your front wheels are past the corner...&quot; Helen said as
Daria turned onto the road home.&nbsp; Turning a little late, the SUV wandered
into the next lane before finally straightening out. <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;That's it, now
accelerate as you start to straighten... Good.&quot; <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Looking into the distance,
Helen saw a stick on the road.&nbsp; At that moment, a silly looking bulldog
ambled toward the stick.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was also
aware that Daria did not slow down. <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;Watch out for the
dog,&quot;&nbsp;she said, a little nervous, &quot;Watch out, Daria!&quot; <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>But Daria still accelerated
until the last minute, and then Helen saw a very shocked Daria jam hard on the
brakes.&nbsp; The SUV gave a lurch that flung both Helen and Daria as far
forward as the seat belts would allow before snapping them back into their
seats. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>A visibly
frightened Daria looked where the dog just stood. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Oh my
god, did I kill him?&quot;&nbsp; she asked in an unusually quaky voice, &quot;I
never even saw him. I'm a dog killer.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Helen searched
for some words that would ease Daria, but could not find any.&nbsp; Just then
she realized she wouldn't really need any. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Look,
honey,&quot; she indicated toward the side walk. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>The bulldog,
stick in mouth, regarded the two with a small gaze before giving a short
bark.&nbsp; He then ran off. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Daria breathed
a sigh of relief. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;God, that
was close.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;No harm
done.&quot; Helen said, trying to reassure her daughter. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;I
couldn't live with myself if I hit a dog.&quot; Daria said, with
uncharacteristic emotion. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Putting the SUV
in drive, Daria then turned to her mother. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Would you
mind telling Quinn I killed him?&quot; she said, returning to her normal,
deadpan demeanor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:53.25pt;tab-stops:.5in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:53.25pt;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:
0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tab-stops:.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>The rest of the drive to home held no
problems.&nbsp; Daria finally managed to keep the SUV from lurching.&nbsp;
Still, the event with the bulldog bothered Helen slightly. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Didn't
you see him?&quot; she asked just as their house came to view, &quot;He came
running right up on your side of the car.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;I don't
see way off to the side too well.&nbsp; My glasses sort of block the
view.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>That admission
surprised Helen.&nbsp; Despite her eldest daughter's need for a rather powerful
prescription for her eyesight, Daria seemed to have no real weaknesses
physically. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;I didn't
know that.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>After a few
quiet moments, the implication came. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Isn't
that a problem?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Pulling into
the driveway, Daria gave the answer that Helen almost expected. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;It is for
dogs.&quot; </p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>A knock on Daria's door interrupted her
concentration on the TV.&nbsp; Turning off the set, she looked at the closed
door. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Enter.&quot;
she said, wondering which family member would be asking for her. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>It was her
mother. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Daria?&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Correct.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;You
know,&quot; Helen began tentatively, &quot;I was thinking about you're
peripheral vision.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;That's
really strange,&quot; Daria countered, already seeing where the conversation
would go, &quot;I was thinking about your high frequency hearing.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Undaunted, Helen
came to the point. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;How would
you feel about trying contact lenses?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Poorly.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Why?&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Because
there's nothing wrong with wearing glasses.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;But what
about that dog today?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Exactly.&quot;
Daria said, trying to end the conversation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;If he had his glasses on, he would've seen the damn car and we
wouldn't be having this conversation.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Daria,&quot;
Helen continued, trying to be reasonable, &quot;I just think that your field of
vision could really be enhanced.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>At that moment,
Daria stood up from her bed. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Come on,
Mom,&quot; she said, &quot;it's not my field of vision you want to
enhance.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;What do
you mean?&#8221; Helen replied, momentarily taken aback. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;We've had
this conversation before.&nbsp; You think if I get contacts, I'll suddenly turn
into the homecoming queen.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Helen
remembered the conversation Daria was talking about.&nbsp; Once, during their
stay at <st1:City><st1:place>Highland</st1:place></st1:City>, Helen suggested
to Daria that she switch to contacts when she was enrolled in junior
high.&nbsp; Her reasoning was to help Daria out of her shell.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the conversation didn't go well.&nbsp;
The subject was never mentioned again. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>However, the
event with the bulldog made Helen think that maybe Daria should at least
consider the practical value of contacts. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Daria,
give me some credit.&quot;&nbsp; Helen began, trying to be considerate,
&quot;You can still wear you glasses.&nbsp; Nobody's going to take them away
from you.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;But...?&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;But
contacts are better for some things, like driving or sports.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;You mean
I'll finally make the wrestling team?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Helen
sighed.&nbsp; She long ago realized that her daughter could end almost any
conversation she didn't like with just the right amount of sarcasm.&nbsp;
Still, Helen felt obliged as a parent to at least try and carry on. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Daria,
you can't possibly have some ethical issue with wearing contacts.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;How about
thinking people should accept me for who I am without my having to
change?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>That statement,
while understandable, was the farthest thing Helen had in mind when she started
this conversation. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Right!&nbsp;
They should accept you for who you are: a complex and interesting&nbsp;young
lady worth knowing, instead of seeing your glasses and jumping to
some&nbsp;moronic conclusion based on ridiculous stereotypes and their own
ignorance.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>It was rare for
Daria ever to be on the receiving end of sarcasm.&nbsp; She responded the only
way she could. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Mmm...
good one.&quot; </p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:53.25pt;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:
0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tab-stops:.5in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:53.25pt;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:
0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;tab-stops:.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>The next day, Daria decide to spend some
time with her friend, <st1:Street><st1:address>Jane Lane</st1:address></st1:Street>.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Time with Jane meant
three things for Daria.&nbsp; First, she could be herself without the
interruption of family.&nbsp; Second, she could spend time with a person she
liked.&nbsp; Third was the opportunity to vent without familial reprisal. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>An added bonus
was the chance to see an artist at work. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Jane's newest
work was a sketch fueled by the consumption of cookie dough in a tube.&nbsp;
Most of Jane's inspiration came from what she saw during her jogs, dreams, the
observations of the less astute members of Lawndale High, personal life and
processed sugar hallucinations. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>During Daria's
stays at <st1:Street><st1:address>La Casa Lane</st1:address></st1:Street>, Jane
would have an opportunity to critique the latest bonehead moves Kevin Thompson
or Brittany Taylor made with her amiga. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>This day,
though, Daria remained silent, not once looking up from the book she read. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;By the
way, anything eating away at your soul?&quot; Jane asked, slightly worried that
Daria had uttered little more than &quot;Hey&quot; since she arrived. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;I almost
killed a dog yesterday.&quot; Daria replied, setting Hansen's <u>The Chess
Garden</u> down. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Gonna
work your way up to humans slowly?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;During my
driving lesson.&quot; Daria elaborated, &quot;Now my mother's bugging me about
contacts again.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Boy, she
just doesn't get it, does she?&quot; Jane said, laying some charcoal down on
her canvas. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Nope, she
really doesn't.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>For a while,
Daria said nothing.&nbsp; Then, she realized that she didn't really know what
she was agreeing with Jane for. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Get
what?&quot; she asked. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;You!&nbsp;
The whole Daria Morgendorffer persona.&quot; Jane pointed out, &quot;You don't
care what people think about your looks&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Of course
not,&quot; Daria replied, silently wondering why Jane would immediately assume
that the problem with her and contacts centered on looks. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;The
glasses are you,&quot; Jane continued, &quot;they're symbolic of the whole
Daria thing.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Turning from
the canvas, Jane went into her mimic mode.&nbsp; Putting her free hand to her
eyes as if she wore glasses, she proceeded to imitate her best friend. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;I wear
glasses and I'm not going to apologize for it.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Yeah...
exactly.&quot; Daria said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Daria went back
to her book and began to read again.&nbsp; Suddenly, a thought occurred to her.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Of
course,&quot; she said to Jane, &quot;you don't wear glasses, so from your
point of view, it's all theoretical.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Muwhat?&quot;
Jane asked. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Pass the
cookie dough.&quot; </p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>That night, Daria prepared for bed as
she normally did. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>She proceeded
to brush her teeth and wash her face.&nbsp; As she took off her glasses, Daria
momentarily caught her reflection in the mirror. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Looking into
the mirror, Daria tried to remember the last time she actually looked at
herself.&nbsp; For her, appearance wasn't a necessity, but an accessory <span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>           </span>that only needed to keep from
smelling.&nbsp; As it was, she never felt the need to change her look. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>There were a
few times when Daria decided to do something with her look.&nbsp; The first was
during her trip to Swedesville for Alternapalooza.&nbsp; That counted as the
first time she wore lipstick.&nbsp; The second time happened during Quinn's
flirtation with being intellectual.&nbsp; And if Quinn's reaction to her look
was any indicator... <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Daria stopped
that line of thought.&nbsp; She wasn't vain.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But as Daria looked into the mirror, she began to wonder if maybe she
should show her eyes at least once in a while. <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>She was rather cute without
her glasses, even if she didn't think about it herself. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Help was
needed, and the source came from one she slightly dreaded. </p>

Plum... of course, Black is always good...&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Daria stared at
her sister.&nbsp; When she thought Quinn couldn't be anymore vain, somehow even
she could surprise her more.&nbsp; This time, Quinn's obsession centered around
scarves. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span><i>Into the
breach,</i> Daria thought, knocking on the door of her sister's room. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Come
in...,&quot; Quinn said absently.&nbsp; She turned to face her visitor, then
her jaw dropped.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Daria!&nbsp; What
are you doing here?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Nothing.&nbsp;
Just passing through.&nbsp; Saw your light on.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;What are
you talking about?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Uh,
Quinn, could I ask...&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Yes?&nbsp;
A question?&nbsp; A favor?&quot; Quinn asked, slightly annoyed at the
interruption.&nbsp; She just finished her scrunchie inventory and need to sort
her scarves before homework. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Could I
ask your opinion on something?&quot; Daria responded, coming to the point. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;What?&nbsp;
Is this a trick?&nbsp; What's the catch?&nbsp; Why don't you ask your friend,
Jane?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Daria never
asked Quinn for anything.&nbsp; So Daria could understand why her sister just
asked three questions in one breath. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Jane
can't help me.&nbsp; I need to speak with someone more attuned to matters of...
appearance.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Quinn's eyes
lit up. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;You're
asking my advice, aren't you?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Quinn,
please.&nbsp; This is hard enough.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;I always
knew this day would come and wondered how it would be.&nbsp; Yet now that it
has, I feel strangely... serene.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Quinn sat down
on her bed and patted it. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Sit down,
Daria, I can help you.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Who said
I needed help?&quot; Daria said sitting down.&nbsp; She started to wonder if
this was a mistake. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Daria, if
we're to make any progress at all, you must be absolutely honest with me.&nbsp;
Now, when did you first begin to suspect that your outfit sucked?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;It's not
my outfit.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Okay,
when did your &quot;friend&quot; first begin to suspect that your outfit sucked?&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Quinn,&quot;
she began, hoping that her sister could help, &quot;suppose you were well known
for not caring what other people think of you.&nbsp; Suddenly, you did
something that showed maybe you do care a little about what other people think
of you.&nbsp; Would that invalidate everything you'd done and said up till then
and make you a hypocrite?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>For her answer,
Quinn gave Daria a very confused look. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Daria,
you're giving me a headache!&quot; Quinn cried, putting her hands to her head. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span><i>Maybe I
better try a different tactic.</i> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;What
would you think if I got contacts?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Suddenly,
Quinn's eyes lit up even brighter, which Daria recognized as the start of a
speed rant. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Contacts?&nbsp;
Great!&nbsp; But what color where you thinking?&nbsp; Because clear ones don't
call attention to themselves so much, which maybe you want.&nbsp; But then, who
could resist being able to change their eye color at will...&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Wait a
minute, I...&quot;&nbsp; Daria tried to interrupt.&nbsp; This wasn't the advice
she needed. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Blue goes
with just about any outfit, but green add that touch of exotica that many young
women crave...&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Hang on,
all I asked was...&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Then of
course, you'll want to change your hair to frame your new face, a decision unto
itself -- and obviously a new wardrobe...&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>There was more
that Quinn said, but Daria couldn't, or wouldn't hear it.&nbsp; Screaming out
of panic, she ran out of Quinn's room.&nbsp; She remembered the reason why she
rarely asked Quinn for help. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Daria,
wait!&nbsp; I know you're scared.&nbsp; We'll start slow with some
scrunchies.&quot; </p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>The next day proved less stressful than
the previous. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Daria decided
not to dwell on the contact issue for now.&nbsp; After the incident with Quinn,
Daria wanted nothing more to do with changing her image.&nbsp; All she wanted
to do was finish <u>The Chess Garden</u> without interruption. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>So she sat in
the kitchen with her father, Jake.&nbsp; Although he was prone to rants about
everything, especially his father, Jake had the paper with him.&nbsp; As it
was, he would be unresponsive until all of the paper was finished.&nbsp;
Luckily for Daria, Jake read slowly. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>She managed to
enjoy some silence when her mother came in with the mail. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Oh that
sister of mine,&quot; Helen began, waving around a letter, &quot;she's as
twisted as a corkscrew.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Jake
&quot;mmmed,&quot; signifying he heard her, but lacked the effort to say an
actual word. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Damn
siblings.&quot; Daria responded, deciding to throw Helen a conciliatory bone. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Honestly,
I think the only reason she ever gets in touch at all is so that she can get
under my skin. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Mmm.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Damn
subdermal irritants.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;I mean,
listen to this note she sent when she was in <st1:State><st1:place>Hawaii</st1:place></st1:State>:&nbsp;
'Dear Sis, you'd love island life.&nbsp; Beautiful sun, wonderful people,
umbrella drinks up the kahanalea.&nbsp; Only thing is, you'd have to take a
vacation.&nbsp; Oh well, sorry I brought it up. My love to all, Amy.' <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;God,&quot;
Helen continued, &quot;isn't that annoying?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Mmm.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Damn
subtle barbs.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Look at
this picture of her smiling by the pool.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Helen produced
a picture of the middle child of the Barksdale clan.&nbsp; Looking at the photo
hard, she gave a derisive snort before tossing it onto the table. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Like she
can even see the camera without her glasses.&quot; she retorted bitterly before
stomping off. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>At that moment,
Daria perked up.&nbsp; She tuned out her mother because she though it was her
Aunt Rita that sent the photo. Slowly, the contact issue came back to her
head.&nbsp; If anyone could give an objective opinion about contacts, it would
be Amy Barksdale.&nbsp; The one relative she actually had something in common
with. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Aunt
Amy...&quot; Daria thought aloud. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>A phone call
was in order. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Mmm.&quot;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Oh!&quot;
Daria exclaimed, blushing slightly, glad she was talking over the phone. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Who is
this?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Um,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;I'm
joking, Daria.&nbsp; How are you?&nbsp; Your mother hasn't had a stroke, has
she?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Well, I

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Wish I
was still there.&nbsp; What can I do for you?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Um, I
wanted to ask your advice about something.&nbsp; I'm thinking about getting
contact lenses.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Uh
huh.&nbsp; Sounds good.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;It
does?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Why
not?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Well,
isn't it kind of... vain?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Do you
have mirrors in your house, Daria?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Yeah.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Do you
look in them before you go out?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Yeah.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Well,
then, you're already going to hell, so you might as well get the lenses.&nbsp;
You'll see the brimstone better.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;What do
you mean?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;I mean,
having contacts is no more vain than primping in the mirror.&nbsp; It just
gives you different options about the way you look.&nbsp; It wouldn't change
your personality.&nbsp; It won't change your values, and it would set your
parents back a couple hundred bucks.&nbsp; So I don't see any downside at
all.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Thanks,
Aunt Amy.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;I'd love

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>As she
considered the contact issue, Daria found herself thinking about what Amy said,
and her mother's words.&nbsp; Even if the contacts didn't work, she could
always go back to the glasses.&nbsp; After all, it wasn't that much of a
change.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Daria?&quot;

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Daria turned to
find her mother standing next to the couch.&nbsp; She spoke softly. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;I just
want you to know that I was thinking about our conversation the other day, and
I don't want you to believe for a second that I think you need contact
lenses.&nbsp; You're beautiful inside and out, no matter what, and I understand
and respect your objection to contacts, and there'll be no more discussion
about it.&nbsp; Okay.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>For a moment,
Daria was touched by this gesture, but she had already come to her decision. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;All
right,&quot; she replied after giving a theatrical sigh, &quot;you talked me
into it.&quot; <br>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>At The Lawndale Medical Arts Partners
Building, Daria sat in the optometrist's chair while the doctor did some last
minute measuring of her eyes.&nbsp; Through his examination, he gave a rundown
of things to do, expect, and look out for. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;So let's
see, there's really nothing to worry about other than a slight case of
epithelial edema, possible concern over bulbar hyperemia, the outside chance of
keratoconus and&nbsp; polymegathism and the usual tiresome worries of giant
papillary conjunctivitis.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Um, is
there any chance my eyes won't fall out?&quot; she asked after the doctor gave
her the worst case scenarios. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;There's
no reason to expect any complications whatsoever if you wear your lenses
according to instructions and take care of them properly.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;So if
anything does go wrong, it's my fault?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>The doctor
removed the lens sizer from her face. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;That'll
be our position.&quot; he replied good naturedly.&nbsp; Just then, he wheeled a
table towards Daria.&nbsp; On it stood a bottle of cleaning solution and a case
that held her new contacts. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Now show
me once again how you put the lens in.&quot; the doctor said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Daria opened up
the lens case and then squirted the cleaning solution in to it.&nbsp; After
swishing the lens a bit, she put her finger on the lens and proceeded to put it
to her eye.&nbsp; Using one hand to hold her eyelid open, she became aware that
her hand holding the lens was shaking.&nbsp; At this point she realized that
she was going to touch her eyeball. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;That's
it, right up against the eyeball.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>As her finger
loomed closer, Daria wondered if her finger would stop shaking enough so she
could put in the lens without discomfort. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>It didn't. </p>

anything that wasn't meant to be seen. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>She opened the

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;I'm not
wearing them.&quot; Daria replied, sounding a little proud. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Huh?&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;I got
contacts.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Hmm.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Just then Daria
had a slightly concerned look on her face. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;I hope
this isn't going to change your opinion of me.&nbsp; I hope you don't think
I've changed or compromised or become a shallow person who only cares about
their looks.&nbsp; Because it would really bother me if you thought that.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;No,&quot;
Jane replied, trying to reassure her friend, &quot;I don't think anything like
that.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Good.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Jane then
nodded off slightly.&nbsp; She caught herself before falling over, then
squinted at Daria. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Where are
your glasses?&quot; Jane asked at length. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Daria looked up
to the sky, thinking that she should ask Jane when she was fully aware. </p>

less awake, are you ready to tell me I've sold out?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Daria asked
this while she and Jane walked towards Mr. O'Neill's English Class.&nbsp; Now that
Jane was cognizant, she wanted an honest opinion. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;You look
pretty cool.&quot; was the reply she got. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Oh,
yeah?&nbsp; Then what did I look like before?&quot;&nbsp; Daria didn't remember
the last time, or any time, she was called &quot;cool&quot; in reference to her
looks. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Hey,
glasses, no glasses, either way works for me.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;And you
call yourself a friend.&quot; Daria ribbed. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Jane gave her a
sly grin as they stepped into the classroom. </p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>The subject of the day was Twain's <u>The
Prince and the Pauper</u>.&nbsp; Mr. Timothy O'Neill was trying to get the
majority of the class to become involved in the discussion.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, this proved problematic with the types of students he had. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Now when
he shed his regal vestments and began dressing as if he had no money,&quot; Mr.
O'Neill said to the class, &quot;a very funny thing happened to the
prince.&nbsp; What was that?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>He looked to
the front of the class and decided to give Kevin Thompson a chance. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Kevin?&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Lawndale High's
star quarterback looked up in thought.&nbsp; After a beat, he answered
hesitantly. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;He became
the poor guy formerly known as the prince?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Mr. O'Neill's
jaw dropped.&nbsp; Once, Kevin's lack of academic thought and willing displays
of stupidity would have made him weep.&nbsp; Now, he just tried to get Kevin to
at least be a little less dense without getting too emotionally involved. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Kevin, I
must say I'm mystified by your continuing inability to absorb anything from
this class.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Um, is
that bad?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;I'm sorry
to speak so harshly, Kevin, but I wouldn't do so if I didn't think you had the
inner strength&nbsp;to hear and to heed.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Thanks!&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Daria and Jane
looked at each other, wondering how Kevin made it this far in the school
system. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;<st1:State><st1:place>Brittany</st1:place></st1:State>,&quot;
Mr. O'Neill said, picking another student, &quot;how does the prince change in
this story?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Cheerleader
captain Brittany Taylor twirled one of her ponytails in her finger and looked
up in thought. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;He, um,
he doesn't turn into a frog, does he?&quot; she replied.&nbsp; <st1:State><st1:place>Brittany</st1:place></st1:State>
didn't read the assignment. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Mr. O'Neill
sighed.&nbsp; He turned to the class to see if the one student he could count
on could answer.&nbsp; Not finding her, he looked down at his feet. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Oh, I
wish Daria were here.&quot; he said with a trace of defeat. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;I'm
here.&quot; a voice piped up. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Mr. O'Neill
looked up to find the source of the familiar monotone.&nbsp; When he saw the
person in Daria's normal seat, his jaw dropped again. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Daria, is
that you?&nbsp; What happened to your glasses?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Um, I'm
wearing contact lenses.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Good for
you, Daria!&nbsp; What a positive gesture!&nbsp; You're taking command of your
appearance and empowering yourself to carve your own identity.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span><i>Didn't I
already do that with my glasses and boots?</i> Daria thought to herself.&nbsp;
Although she knew he was complementing her, sometimes Mr. O'Neill really knew
how to say the most incorrect thing. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Actually,
I'm not sure that I want an identity based on appearance.&quot; she replied,
not wanting to draw attention to herself anymore.&nbsp; Several of her
classmates were staring at her. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Of course
not,&quot; Mr. O'Neill backtracked, &quot;the inner you, that's what's
important.&nbsp; I just meant that a revised outer is an even more confident
manifestation of the unchanged inner you... the real you... the you-ness
inside.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;I got
them for driving,&quot; Daria said at last, hoping that her teacher wouldn't go
into another self-help styled lecture. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Excellent!&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Just then, a
thought occurred to Mr. O'Neill. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;So, why
are you wearing them now?&quot; he asked, a little perplexed. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Before she
could respond, Principal Li entered, wringing her hands. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Class,&quot;
she began, &quot;I have some extremely disturbing news.&nbsp; Someone has
apparently pilfered the school's finger-printing kit...&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Ms. Li trailed
off and did a double take, taking off her glasses, she looked at Daria. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Ms.
Morgendorffer?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;It wasn't
me, I much prefer fiber spectroanalysis.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Did you
get contact lenses?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Um,
yes.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Well
done!&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Excuse
me?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;You're
inviting your fellow students to get to know you a little better.&nbsp; You're
dropping that standoffish persona.&nbsp; Kudos!&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span><i>You could
take your own advice,</i> Daria thought to herself. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;I got
them for driving.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Ah.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Just then, a
thought occurred to Ms. Li. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;So, why
are you wearing them now?&quot; she asked, a little perplexed. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Daria looked up
and found herself, for one of the first times in her life, at a loss for words.

for a table.&nbsp; &quot;You're walking into more people than you're walking

blur of yellow and blue, stood Kevin. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Hey,
Daria, Jane.&nbsp; Notice anything different?&quot; he asked cheerfully. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Daria squinted
at Kevin's face and tried to see what Kevin was trying to hint at.&nbsp; After
a few moments, she turned to Jane. <br>

wearing glasses, right?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Why, yes
he's wearing glasses.&quot; Jane replied, giving Daria a questioning look,
&quot;Although, ironically, he doesn't need them.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Turning to her
newly bespectacled classmate, Jane asked the obvious question. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;What's
going on?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Well, I
got to thinking about what you said about glasses making you smart,
Daria.&nbsp; And hey, you may not believe this, but I could stand to be a
little smarter.&nbsp; So, I got some&quot; </p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:53.25pt;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:

a little smarter?&quot; asked Daria, &quot;Not possible.&quot; <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;No, no, no.&nbsp; That's
what I thought too.&nbsp; But believe me, it is.&nbsp; You know, I don't want
to be a brain or anything.&nbsp; I like having friends.&nbsp; So I got a pair
without any lenses.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Kevin then
twirled the frames on his index finger to demonstrate. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;See?&nbsp;
Now I'll be smart, but not to smart.&quot; he added, almost dropping the
frames. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Daria gave
Kevin a very blank stare. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;I'm not
really sure if it'll work without any lenses.&quot; she eventually said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Really?&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Yeah, why
don't you try one lens and see how it goes?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Great
idea!&nbsp; Thanks.&quot;&nbsp; Kevin then turned around and saw <st1:State><st1:place>Brittany</st1:place></st1:State>
waving at him. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Oh, Mr.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Brit
really loves them.&quot; he explained to the two girls while heading to his
girlfriend, &quot;Gotta go.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Daria turned
back to Jane, who she noticed had looked rather closely at her eyes rather than
join in the conversation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Right then,
Jane waved her hand in <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>         </span>Daria's
face. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;I can see
that, funny gal.&quot; Daria said, a little annoyed at Jane's presumption. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Jane didn't
respond.&nbsp; She held up two slightly blurry fingers. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;How many
fingers?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;I've got
one for you.&quot;&nbsp; Daria wanted the conversation to end.&nbsp; But Jane
was too curious to let it go. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;You're
not wearing your contacts at all.&quot; she stated. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Not if
you want to get technical about it.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Okay, I
get that they were irritating you so you thought that you'd give them a
rest.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Yeah.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;But why
no glasses?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Sheer
vanity?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Yes, yes,
very witty.&nbsp; Now really.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Daria suddenly
looked very glum.&nbsp; In her whole life, she made it a point not to be too
concerned about her appearance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jane
knew her position on that subject and supported all the way.&nbsp; However, she
found herself liking the complements that people gave her about her new
look.&nbsp; So her answer to Jane felt like she just compromised herself to one
of the few people she knew whose opinion mattered to her. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>Jane looked at
Daria's face and then had her own realization.&nbsp; Maybe Daria was a little
more girl than she made herself out to be. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;Daria!&quot;
she exclaimed happily.&nbsp; It was Jane's intent to have Daria laugh about the
whole incident. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;You hate
me,&quot; she replied, burying her face in her hands. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>&quot;This is
great!&nbsp; You want to borrow my lipstick?&quot; </p>

then, Daria leapt from her seat and went to the exit. <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;Hey, come on, Daria,
wait!&quot;&nbsp; Jane cried, getting up from her seat.&nbsp; Of all things,
she didn't want her best friend to overreact about her standards.&nbsp; As soon
as she stood up, Jane saw Daria run right into Kevin, knocking him over
completely. <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&#8220;Ow!&quot; <br>

remembered the first time Daria had a problem and went into the rest
room.&nbsp; That time also involved Daria's appearance.&nbsp; Albeit that one
centered around a rash.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Walking down
along the stalls, she checked under the doors until she found the shape of a
familiar pair of Doc Martens. <br>

tell me where Daria is?&quot; </p>

about?&quot; <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;You don't have to

yourself.&nbsp; The glasses are me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Uncompromising
and unconceited.&nbsp; Well, not anymore.&quot;&nbsp; Her tone had a hint of
bitter resignation. <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;For God's sake, Daria,
who told you had to be a martyr to principle?&nbsp; You're a teenage girl, not

voice asked. <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Jane looked up and saw Jodie
Landon right next to her.&nbsp; She didn't even hear her come in.&nbsp;
Although Jane didn't want to cause Daria too much embarrassment, she knew Daria
and Jodie got along well enough.&nbsp; Maybe Jodie could provide some help. <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;Oh, it's Daria.&nbsp;
She couldn't get her contacts in today and she didn't want to wear her
glasses.&nbsp; So she's stumbling around and bumping into stuff.&quot; <br>

<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;No.&quot; <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;What'd she hurt?&quot;

high to live up to.&quot; <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;Don't tell me she's mad

the meaning of Jane's comment. <br>

asked, hoping that Jodie's perspective would be helpful. <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;No, actually, I can't
see.&quot; <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;Daria, what's wrong with
admitting to a little vanity?&quot; Jodie asked through the stall door,
&#8220;You&#8217;re not Mother Teresa you know.&quot; <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;She wore glasses.&quot; <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;No,&quot; Jane
interjected, &quot;she gave them to an orphan.&quot; <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;Hey, what's going
on?&quot; a squeaky, fourth voice piped up. <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Jane and Jodie turned around
and saw <st1:State><st1:place>Brittany</st1:place></st1:State> with a curious

deal with her right now. <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;Nothing,&quot; Jane
answered quickly. <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;Everything's fine,&quot;
Jodie said, rather quickly. <br>

<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><st1:State><st1:place>Brittany</st1:place></st1:State>
crouched down to see who the girls where talking to.&nbsp; The boots gave her

<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;Hi, <st1:State><st1:place>Brittany</st1:place></st1:State>,&quot;

<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;By the way, Daria, I
just want you to know I think it's really brave of you to get those contact
lenses and admit that you care about the way you look, even just a
little.&nbsp; Because knowing that a brain can be worried about her looks makes
me feel, um, I don't know, not so shallow or something.&nbsp; Like we're not
that different, just human or whatever.&quot; <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Jane and Jodie turned to <st1:State><st1:place>Brittany</st1:place></st1:State>
and stared in amazement.&nbsp; Although both never had much opinion for <st1:State><st1:place>Brittany</st1:place></st1:State>'s
intelligence, times passed when she did think of things that nobody did.&nbsp;
Still, those times were very few, hence the staring.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>An awkward silence passed when, just then,
the stall door opened, and a very relieved looking Daria stepped out. <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;Well, thank you <st1:State><st1:place>Brittany</st1:place></st1:State>,&quot;
she said, with a tone of relief, &quot;you're right.&nbsp; We are just human or
whatever.&quot;&nbsp; Daria then turned to go back to the cafeteria.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, she missed clearing the stall door.&nbsp; Physically reiterating
<st1:State><st1:place>Brittany</st1:place></st1:State>'s point about being
human with a pained yell, she made her way to the bathroom exit. <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>For awhile, Jane, Jodie and
Brittany gazed at the door where Daria left.&nbsp; Then, Jodie turned to <st1:State><st1:place>Brittany</st1:place></st1:State>.

<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;That was really nice,

bathroom to check on Daria, leaving <st1:State><st1:place>Brittany</st1:place></st1:State>
behind.&nbsp; As she watched the two girls leave <st1:State><st1:place>Brittany</st1:place></st1:State>
mulled over their words.&nbsp; Then, turning to the mirror, <st1:State><st1:place>Brittany</st1:place></st1:State>
looked at her reflection.&nbsp; Pulling out a pair of purple framed glasses, <st1:State><st1:place>Brittany</st1:place></st1:State>
admired herself. <br>

and big-wheel riding toddlers that came along the sidewalk. <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>For Daria, the image was ironic,
and fitting.&nbsp; Throughout her life, she never felt the need to have anyone
help her along for anything.&nbsp; Only in those instances where she did feel
truly alone did Daria was reminded that sometimes, she did need a helping
hand.&nbsp;Sometimes the help came from a person she would least suspect.&nbsp;
Other times from family.&nbsp; But for her, the best help came from the one who
understood her the most.&nbsp; And she knew that whenever Jane ever needed
help, she would help her along as she did today. <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>However, there still remained
on last problem.&nbsp; One that Jane couldn't help with. <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;So no more
contacts.&quot;&nbsp; Jane said, mentioning Daria's new problem, &quot;Your
mother's gonna be disappointed.&quot; <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;Well, I have all
afternoon to figure out how to break it to her.&quot; <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>At that moment a horn
beeped.&nbsp; Daria and Jane turned to find the source.&nbsp; There in front of
them was Helen in her SUV. <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;Hi girls!&quot; she
beamed cheerfully. <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;Hi, Mrs.
Morgendorffer.&quot; <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;Hi, Mom.&quot; <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>&quot;Daria, my deposition was
postponed till tomorrow.&nbsp; So I thought, why not try out those new contacts
out with an unscheduled driving lesson?&quot;&nbsp; Helen asked from her
vehicle. <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>At that moment, Daria
froze.&nbsp; She then remembered a few incidents from her past.&nbsp; One was
the fund raising and eventual recital for the now defunct coffeehouse.&nbsp;
Another involved two trips to the Mall of the Millennium.&nbsp; Those and other
events reminded Daria that no matter how hard you tried to avoid certain
problems, the Law of Inevitability held sway.&nbsp; One would have to answer to
any conflict within their lives.&nbsp; Any attempt to avoid it would only make
the problem magnify to proportions that one could only imagine. <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As if to underscore that law,
Daria heard something to her left.&nbsp; There, she heard, and rather blurrily
saw, an image of an elderly gentleman walking at least four dogs. <br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><i>This had to happen,
Morgendorffer,<b> </b></i>she thought to herself, <i>might as well get it over
with.</i> <br>

mother and said the only thing she could. </p>
