<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial Narrow";'>By Bacner (<a

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>It all began in Mr.
O'Neill's class, when he spoke to the students: &quot;Class, in my hands, I hold a
piece of paper which has the potential to open up a world of positive
experiences.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Mandatory home-schooling
legislation?&quot; Daria mumbled to Jane. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Mr. O'Neill continued,
oblivious. &quot;A sign-up sheet for an overnight hill trek. An excellent
opportunity to understand the primal struggle for survival we made it through
together in <u>The Call of the Wild.</u>&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Jane and Daria looked at
each other. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Hmm, 24 consecutive hours
with our classmates,&quot; Jane said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;It doesn't get any more
primal than that,&quot; Daria replied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;So my guess is you won't be
signing up?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Daria shook her head. &quot;No.
My life is so full already that trying biodegradable toilet paper would just
bring it to the bursting point. What about you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Jane looked almost panicky.
For her, that is. &quot;No way. I had a bad experience on that hill with the Girl
Scouts. We kept marching and singing and marching and singing about some freak
named John Jacob Jingleheimer somebody.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>It took a lot to shock
Daria, but this cut it close. &quot;<i>You</i> were a Girl Scout?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Jane shivered at the
thought. &quot;Not after the deprogramming.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>In short, Daria and Jane
left, firmly deciding <i>not</i> to go the mountains at any cost. But Fate
decided otherwise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>The next morning all four
Morgendorffers were eating breakfast at the kitchen table. Jake was holding a
cereal box while covering one eye. &quot;K-I-N... or is that an &quot;M&quot;? Damn
eyes!&quot; he pounded the table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Quinn, of course, was
thinking only about fashion. &quot;Oh, Mom, look! These climbing shoes will look <i>so</i>
cute with the matching tear-resistant cigarette pants.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Helen somewhat perked-up at
the thought. &quot;Yes... Daria, is there anything you'd like to order from the
catalog?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Daria frowned, her
long-ago-installed and long-since-tested Morgendorffer alarm bells silently
sounding off. &quot;How about the tear-resistant new identity?&quot; She got up from table
to sit at kitchen counter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Quinn, of course, was as
oblivious as ever. &quot;Of course, I'll also need the Gore-Tex twin set for impromptu
parties.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Disgustedly, Daria turned
the TV on. On it, the SSW Announcer was saying: &quot;Why are so many Siamese twins
being born in this Bangkok hospital? &quot;Babes in Thailand&quot; tonight on <i>Sick,
Sad World</i>.&quot; Disgustedly, Daria turned TV off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Back at the table, Helen was
still holding court. &quot;Dad and I would be happy to help you get outfitted for
the field trip, too. Wouldn't we, Jake?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Jake was still looking at
the cereal box. &quot;-U-G-A... damn! What the hell is that letter?&quot; Helen's
patience ran-out as she grabbed the cereal box out of his hands. &quot;Hey!&quot; Jake
protested in vain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Quinn was chattering away.
&quot;Now, I'll need a credit card. Don't worry about the calls, because it's for a
field trip, so, technically, we're talking school supplies and &quot;nothing's
too good for our girls' education.&quot;&quot; She giggled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Jake's brain finally
registered something. &quot;You're going on a trip?&quot; he asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Helen immediately grasped
the opportunity. &quot;Jake, with Daria and Quinn away overnight, this is the perfect
opportunity for us to spend that quality couple's time recommended by our
intimacy counsellor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Jake looked happy. &quot;Great
idea!&quot; Suddenly something else registered in his brain. &quot;Who?&quot; he asked Helen</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;I've been seeing an
intimacy counsellor to promote growth and togetherness in our relationship,&quot;
Helen explained. &quot;It was just easier to schedule if I went alone. I'll fill you
in.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;All right,&quot; Jake easily
agreed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Daria sighed. This has gone
too far, 'twas time to remind of her own presence in the kitchen. &quot;I hate to
burst this bubble of marital bliss, but since I'm not going on the field trip,
you'll have to forego your quality couple's time for the usual inferior
couple's time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Quinn realized that she
won't be able to get anything else, so after saying &quot;Okay, Daria's talking so I
have to leave now,&quot; she got up from table and walked out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Bye, Quinn,&quot; and Helen
approached Daria. &quot;All right, Daria, name your price.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Excuse me? My refusal to
attend this field trip is based on moral and ethical objections so
intrinsic...&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Helen knew both of her
daughters better than either of them thought. &quot;$30.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;$50.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Done.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Daria decided to test her
luck further. &quot;Of course, this $50 merely buys my participation in the field
trip. For an additional $20, I could be convinced not to tell Quinn about this
arrangement.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>But when it came to
Morgendorffer family money, Helen was the smartest one. &quot;I gave you life,
Daria; I can take it away,&quot; she merely said, as she left.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Daria sighed in a resigned
voice. &quot;$50 should do it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Meanwhile, Jake was again
oblivious. &quot;&quot;King Tut was buried without his diver.&quot; What the hell
does that mean?!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>'That's &quot;liver,&quot;
Dad.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Eww...&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Next day dawned. Outside of
the school, Helen was saying to her daughters. &quot;All right, girls, your father
and I will be at the Big River Cabins just a couple of miles from your campsite
if you need anything at all.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Unless it's money. Bye!&quot;
added Jake, as they drove away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Jane approached Daria,
choosing wisely the time period. Her memories of staying-over with
Morgendorffers were still quite fresh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Thanks for coming,&quot; Daria
said flatly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Hey, that's what friends
are for. Now, where's that $50?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Sighing, Daria handed the
money to Jane. &quot;You know, I really should have thought this through better.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Kevin and Brittany walked
past, singing off-key. &quot;John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt, his name is my name,
too...&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Yeah, me, too,&quot; Jane added,
sounding as enthusiastic, as if she was going to the dentist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Meanwhile, the Fashion Club
held its' own court. &quot;Quinn, that scarf is <i>so</i> cute,&quot; Stacy said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Yeah, so cute,&quot; Tiffany
echoed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Sandi, naturally, was far
less enthusiastic. &quot;I would have brought <i>my</i> really cute scarf, but I was
under the impression we were supposed to take clothes that are functional <i>and
</i>fashionable.&quot; Sandi lied, of course. Her scarves were either solely
functional and those she didn't wear because of fashion, or solely fashionable,
which she didn't wear because it any temperature below zero they were
pointless.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>And Quinn suspected that.
&quot;Actually, Sandi, they don't call this a scarf. It's a thermal neck insulator
that easily converts into a sling-back heat-dispelling halternative for
unseasonably warm weather conditions,&quot; she said bubbly, seeming oblivious to
other girls' reactions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Wow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Wow, you think of
everything, Quinn.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;And, it comes with a
matching snakebite kit,&quot; Quinn added.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;But... why would you bite a
snake?&quot; Tiffany asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Sandi glared. &quot;You don't
understand, Tiffany, dear. The woods are full of slimy, cold-blooded creatures.
Isn't that right, Quinn?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Quinn laughed nervously,
aware that you didn't need to go to the woods for such creatures, just to
Griffins' household. &quot;Um, look at this stuff,&quot; she suggested instead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Oh, my God.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Oh, wow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>It was then Mr. DeMartino
appeared. &quot;Good morning, <b><i>students.</i></b> Please be so <b><i>gracious</i></b>
as to haul your milk-fed <b><i>buttocks</i></b> onto the bus.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Saying this inspirational
opening line, he climbed onto the bus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Ms. Barch was loading bags
into bus luggage bay. &quot;Hurry up, girls. You don't want to get left behind.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Jane and Daria looked at
each other. &quot;You mean it's an option?&quot; Jane asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Ms. Barch was oblivious to
sarcasm as she closed the luggage bay door. &quot;Oh, sure, being left behind seems
like a cute idea to you now, but when it happens to you after 22 years of
squandering your good looks and womanly charms, you might not find it so
amusing to be abandoned with nothing but eight bags of dirty laundry and a
pyramid of &quot;Beers of the World&quot; empties!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Jane and Daria looked at
each other once again. &quot;How does that saying go? &quot;'Tis better to have
loved and lost...&quot;&quot; Jane began.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;&quot;If you know a good
hit man.&quot;,&quot; Daria finished.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>In front of the bus Mr.
O'Neill was telling some boys what their responsibilities were. Unfortunately,
they were Quinn's three J's. &quot;And finally, Jamie, Joey, Jeffy, you'll be in
charge of transporting field supplies. And let's all be respectful of this
unspoiled wilderness, okay? Remember, we're in God's high school now.&quot;
Suddenly, he began to wheeze. &quot;Oh, my, there's a lot of pollen in God's high
school.&quot; The English teacher chuckled, but it sounded hollow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Jane turned to Daria. &quot;You
don't suppose we could be in for a blizzard of epic proportions?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Daria shook her head. &quot;That
would only happen if we were stranded in the comfort of our favourite pizza
place.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Ms. Li overhead them. &quot;Don't
you worry, girls. We'll reach base camp long before any inclement weather
should arrive.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Thank you, Principal
Donner,&quot; Daria said wryly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Ms. Li went on. &quot;And once
I've documented our triumphant ascent with this camera, Lawndale's Wilderness
Adventure Club will be a shoo-in for a lucrative sponsorship from Extreme
Sportz Mania Worldwide Inc. &quot;Hanging ten on the edge of the
apocalypse...&quot; Ooh!&quot; she cut-off herself, realizing that she said too much
to the wrong students.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;But Lawndale doesn't have a
Wilderness Adventure Club,&quot; Jane pointed-out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;We do now,&quot; Ms. Li firmly
said. Then she turned to the English teacher. &quot;Mr. O'Neill, you're artistic.
Document these two doing something rugged.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Unfortunately, Mr. O'Neill
was not the type of a person you would want to do something responsible or
intimidating. &quot;Okay, girls, let's see that primal instinct,&quot; he said,
mock-growling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>As a result he taped Jane
yawning and Daria rubbing her nose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Back outside, Quinn
attempted to haul her bags as the rest of the Fashion Club walked past. &quot;Sandi?
Wait up, you guys!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;I know, Quinn. Why don't
you convert one of your mittens into a luggage carrier?&quot; Sandi sneered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Joey, Jeffy, and Jamie
quickly approached their crush at that point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Want me to get those for
you, Quinn?&quot; Jamie asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;That is so sweet. Don't
fall too far behind!&quot; Quinn said, as she walked away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>The Three J's began fighting
over Quinn's bags.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;I got them!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Come on, man!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Hey, wait, guys!&quot; Joey
said. &quot;There are three of Quinn's bags and three of us!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Instantly, Jamie and Jeffy
each grabbed one of Quinn's bags, dropping the supply bags in the process.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Oh,&quot; Joey said, dropped his
supply bag and grabbed Quinn's remaining bag.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Surprisingly (mainly to
Daria and Jane,) the school bus didn't break down, and soon the students were
walking on the mountain trail.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>The hi-jinks, started, as
usual, with Kevin. &quot;Hey, babe, I got a surprise for you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Flowers!&quot; Brittany
squealed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Oh, you guessed it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Oh, Kevvy... that is so
romantic.&quot; Brittany began to sniff flowers, which released a swarm of bees.
Yelling &quot;Ow! Ow!&quot; she ran off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Hey, babe... where's my
thank-you?&quot; Kevin yelled back</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>But Brittany ran down the
mountain, chased by bees. &quot;Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Mr. O'Neill decided to turn
this into an educative experience, since he couldn't do anything else. &quot;Oh,
dear. You see, kids, even the lowly wildflower humbles us with its crafty
defences, attracting bees or spewing lung-seizing pollen.&quot; He wheezed. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Are you okay, Mr. O'Neill?&quot;
Mack worriedly said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Just seasonal allergies.
Nothing my trusty inhaler can't cure... although this one appears to be empty,&quot;
O'Neill wheezed. &quot;That's funny. I could have sworn I packed a backup.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;What's the hold-up here,
mountaineers?&quot; Ms. Li asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Mr. O'Neill can't find his
inhaler,&quot; Mack explained.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Just... need... rest.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Daria and Jane exchanged
looks. &quot;Uh-oh, teacher down.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Now we'll have to turn
back. Darn.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Again, Ms. Li heard them.
&quot;No one's turning back. I need those summit celebration shots to really grab
those Extreme Sportz Mania Worldwide Inc. execs by the hacky sacks! Someone
will just have to short-rope Mr. O'Neill.&quot; She then looked at Barch, who did a
slow burn as she remembered...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;As God is my witness, I
will never pull a man's weight again!&quot; she said and crushed a vegetable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Then the paint-ball camp:
Barch smooch-attacked O'Neill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Then the pseudo-medieval
fair: Barch dragged O'Neill under the fortune teller's table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Finally, Ms. Li's great
boating fiasco: Barch and O'Neill made-out as the ship slowly sank.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>At that point Ms. Barch
returned to present and began to drag O'Neill via a rope sling. &quot;Come on,
Skinny.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Meanwhile, Jake and Helen
entered their cabin, and were clearly underwhelmed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;This is it? For $95 and
change you'd think they'd at least throw in a lousy radio.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Jake, the whole purpose of
this trip is to deepen our relationship without distractions -- no radio, no
children, no television, no cell phone... my God, what have I done? What have I
done?!&quot; Helen yelled, as the realization hit her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Hey, look, Helen. A
bearskin rug.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Instantly, something else
came over the minds of Helen and Jake Morgendorffer. &quot;Bearskin? Me-ow!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Woof!&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>And at that point let's
leave them - they won't be doing anything, just &quot;putting some spice back
into their marriage&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Back on the mountain trail,
things were disintegrating rapidly. &quot;Money, that's corporate. Sponsorship,
that's money,&quot; Ms. Li was talking to herself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Weren't we supposed to be
at the campsite by now?&quot; Daria asked the more sportive and outdoorsy Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Yeah, but something tells
me things aren't going exactly as planned,&quot; Jane replied, casting a wary eye at
the skies overhead. They were darkening too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>DeMartino joined the group,
dragging Barch and O'Neill behind him. &quot;Please, <b><i>no one</i></b> offer to
help! I'd hate to take any <b><i>pressure </i></b>off of my <b><i>slipped disc!</i></b>&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Gee, whatever gave you that
idea?&quot; Daria commented wryly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Ms. Li turned to them.
&quot;Don't worry, girls. We'll have no problem reaching base camp before dark, as
long as there are no more surprises.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>And then the clouds burst,
and snow started to fall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>It was one of better moments
in the young life of Daria, as she, completely deadpan, said: &quot;Surprise.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Sometime later, Ms. Li was
counting her students. &quot;43, 44, 45... okay, we're missing one. Look around:
who's not here who should be?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Someone with enough common
sense to turn back while there was still time?&quot; Daria asked. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Yeah, where is that guy?&quot;
Jane added.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Mr. DeMartino was listening
to the science teacher as she grunted. &quot;What's that? <b><i>Barch</i></b> here
says O'Neill went back to the <b><i>buses</i></b> to look for his <b><i>inhaler</i></b>...&quot;
More whimpers. &quot;...<b><i>abandoning</i></b> her after all she's done for him,
just like...... <b><i>every other</i></b> lousy man she's ever known. &quot;<b><i>Men!</i></b>
I <b><i>hate</i></b> their <b><i>stinking guts</i></b>!&quot;&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;The fool! He'll never make
it down in his condition. I'm going after him.&quot; Ms Li rushed off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Wow, that's kind of
heroic.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;He's got her video camera,&quot;
Daria explained to Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Oh, yeah.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Kevin decided to lighten the
mood. &quot;Hey, check it out: snow angel!&quot; He fell to the ground with a distinct
&quot;thud&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Mack winced. &quot;You might want
to wait until there's a little more snow on the ground.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Jodie turned to the history
teacher. &quot;Mr. DeMartino, considering the low visibility, shouldn't we have a
buddy system or something?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Unfortunately, the history
teacher was quite misunderstanding the gravity of the situation. &quot;<b><i>I</i></b>
had a buddy once, until I came <b><i>home </i></b>one night and he <b><i>married</i></b>
my <b><i>mother!</i></b>&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Jane and Daria quickly
hurried past.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Do we want to hear anymore
of this story?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;March, fast!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Finally, despite (or perhaps
because of) DeMartino's story the remainder of the group arrived at the
bunkhouse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Ms. Barch shivered as she
lighted a lantern. &quot;DeMartino... out finding firewood. Get supplies unpacked.
Remember, teamwork...&quot; She suddenly spotted a student unpacking a sleeping bag.
&quot;Is that... sleeping bag? Mine!&quot; She ran over and grabbed the bag.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Jane and Daria entered the
bunkhouse, finding the students standing around aimlessly while Barch shivered
in the sleeping bag.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Is it bad if I can't feel
my feet?&quot; Jane asked her friend.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;That depends. How much do
you enjoy walking?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Kevin was talking to
Brittany, who most decidedly <b>didn't</b> look her best. &quot;Babe, I just want
you to know that I'm not mad anymore that you didn't thank me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;You wanted me to thank you
for <i>this?</i>&quot; She pointed at her swollen face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Eww! But, no... I meant for
the flowers.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Jodie was busy rummaging
through bags. &quot;All right, let's get these supply bags open and start
distributing blankets, food and...&quot; She pulled out a pair of &quot;...pink ostrich
feather earmuffs?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Oh, great! I was wondering
where those were,&quot; Quinn said as she grabbed them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Mack turned to the Three
J's. &quot;Weren't you guys supposed to be carrying the supply bags?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Yeah...&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;So where are they?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Back at the buses, maybe?&quot;
Jamie said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Probably,&quot; Joey added.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Definitely,&quot; Jeffy
finished.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Students started to converge
on Quinn. &quot;What?&quot; she asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Well, this is interesting.
We're isolated in a freak storm with no supplies and no way of contacting the
outside world.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Yeah, but look on the
bright side: we're going to see a lynching,&quot; Jane pointed-out helpfully. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Students advanced further.
&quot;What?!!&quot; Quinn continued to yell.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>At the cabin, Jake and Helen
ran into problems. &quot;Hey, honey, look what I made! A snow turkey!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Very... abstract, dear.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>The snow turkey chose that
moment to melt. &quot;Damn it! Now I have to start all over again.&quot; Jake headed for
the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Jake, aren't you forgetting
something?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Oh, yeah, my gloves...&quot; But
it was too late: his hand stuck to the doorknob; he had to pry it off with an
&quot;Ow!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;I'm talking about intimacy,
Jake. We're supposed to be focusing on each other, not a snow turkey.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;But we did that already,
remember?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Helen was growing
exasperated. &quot;I mean talking, conversation, communicating.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Oh, sure... um, you start.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Well, um...&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>The wind howled, as the cabin
sunk into silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>At the bunkhouse, Sandi was
holding court. &quot;Quinn, by causing the supplies to be left behind, you violated
the Fashion Club oath.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;I didn't know there was a
Fashion Club oath,&quot; Quinn protested.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Yeah, me either,&quot; Stacy
admitted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Oath?&quot; Even Tiffany
echoed-in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Oh, yes. &quot;To promote a
healthy glow by never allowing other members to be deprived of skin-enhancing
water reserves.&quot; I'm afraid I have to call a vote on your standing,
Quinn.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Quinn gasped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Daria watched this all with
amusement. &quot;I say she gets voted out of the Fashion Club and seeks her revenge
from a book depository with a crossbow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Really? I say she stays in
and becomes their leader, unintentionally bringing about the apocalypse.&quot; Jane
argued.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Sandi was continuing. &quot;And
who thinks Quinn should be allowed to stay in the Fashion Club?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Stacy and Tiffany remained
silent. Sandi knew her fellow Club members very well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Ooh!&quot; Quinn snapped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Jane sighed and handed $50
back to Daria. &quot;It's not the money that hurts; it's having that damn apocalypse
postponed again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Meanwhile, DeMartino was
conferring with Mack and Kevin. &quot;All right, <b><i>sport.</i></b> You and <b><i>Mack</i></b>
here are going out as <b><i>search party number one!</i></b>&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Cool, a party?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;This isn't going to be a <b><i>party,</i></b>
Kevin! You're going out into that driving, blinding, <b><i>flesh-tearing ice

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Uh, sure, but where's the
funnel?&quot; It all went over Kevin's head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Mack had to set him straight
- sort-of. &quot;Down the trail, right by the dance floor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;All right!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Kevin and Mack left, but
Jodie wasn't pacified. &quot;But even if they do find Ms. Li and Mr. O'Neill, what
are we going to do about food?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;<b><i>That's</i></b> where <b><i>search
party two</i></b> comes in. <b><i>I'm</i></b> going out in the storm <b><i>myself,</i></b>
looking for help. The rest of you conserve your energy. Do as little as possible.
<b><i>Pretend you're in class!</i></b>&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Daria, upon hearing this, turned to Jane. &quot;You know, if
this storm doesn't let up, it could take days for help to arrive.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Well, when everybody gets
hungry enough, it'll be interesting to see who gets eaten first.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;But on the downside, we'll
have to wait here with them.&quot; Daria really thought this through, Jane had to
conceive it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Good point. Hey, Mr. DeMartino,
we'd like to volunteer to go with you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>The history teacher glared
at them. &quot;As much as I appreciate your kind, if <b><i>foolhardy </i></b>offer,
I have to decline. It's too <b><i>dangerous </i></b>out there. Once you walk
out those doors, you may <b><i>not</i></b> be coming back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Daria and Jane cast their gazes over the bunkhouse, and
then turned back to DeMartino. &quot;Okay, then we're all on the same page.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Very well, but dress for
survival.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Daria nodded. &quot;Well, I was
going to dress for perishing, but okay.&quot; She walked over to Quinn. &quot;Hey, Quinn,
I need to borrow your neck insulator thingy to go out on this highly dangerous
and potentially doomed rescue mission, okay?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Whatever,&quot; Quinn said
semi-listlessly, as she handed the scarf over to Daria. &quot;I've got my own problems.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Please stop the sisterly
tears of concern. You're making a scene.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Quinn glared. &quot;Look, can you
please stop talking to me? If the Fashion Club sees this I'll be like one of
those baby birds that gets put back in the nest but the mother knows it's been
touched by a human and pecks it to death, understand?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Sure. You're a birdbrain,&quot;
Daria said and walked away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Hey, nice scarf,&quot; Jane
commented.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>As they walked out of the
door, Daria pointed out how it converts into a noose. &quot;Handy,&quot; was all that
Jane said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Once out in the blizzard,
Mr. DeMartino turned to the two girls. &quot;Okay, team, no matter <b><i>what</i></b>
happens, <b><i>stick</i></b> by my side. That's <b><i>crucial,</i></b> understand?</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Daria and Jane, as Mr. DeMartino screamed,
as he walked off a cliff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Daria turned to Jane. &quot;Okay,
quick assessment of our situation: we're lost in a blizzard with no equipment
and no leadership, and if we don't get help, we'll probably have to drag back
the body of our history teacher.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;When you put it that way
you make it sound bad,&quot; Jane was still trying to be optimistic. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>But Daria knew better that
when pessimism became realism, things were bad indeed. &quot;Then let me rephrase:
what started out as a grim, life-negating field trip has turned into a grim,
life-negating gape into the void.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Jane sighed. &quot;With our luck,
we'll probably be reincarnated and have to do high school all over again from
the beginning.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Daria shivered only
partially from cold. &quot;That does it; let's find those buses.&quot; She and Jane began
to walk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Back at the bunkhouse, Quinn
was busy with her own problems. &quot;Does anyone want to borrow my sunscreen lip
gloss? I've got plenty!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Sandi was firm. &quot;Forget it,
Quinn. We're not letting you back in the Fashion Club. We have bylaws, you
know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Stacy started to protest:
&quot;We...&quot;, but whimpered under Sandi's glare and gave-up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;But I <i>told</i> you, it's
not <i>my</i> fault the supplies got left behind for my bags.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;You didn't have to bring so
much stuff, Quinn,&quot; Stacy meekly pointed-out</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;It's almost like you were
trying to hog the spotlight,&quot; Tiffany added.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>It was all the opening that
Quinn needed. &quot;What?! That is <i>so</i> not true. I wanted to share all my
Hot-I-Rondack stuff with you guys. Here, Stacy, take this camouflage yak fur
canteen. And Tiffany, this metallic utility belt with detachable emergency food
kit is for you. And Sandi, I wanted to surprise you with this <i>Titanic</i>
edition Chenille Gorp bag.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>At that point Jodie
approached overhearing Quinn's rant. &quot;Wait a minute, you brought food and
water? We're saved!&quot; Then she examined the&nbsp;
canteen and the food belt. &quot;Um, where is the food and water?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Well, I was going to bring
it along but it just got so bulky&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Jodie just dropped the items
and walked away in disgust. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;I'm sorry I've doomed us to
a lingering death, Sandi.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Sandi paused, examining her
new bag. &quot;Oh, well. Can I have your ostrich feather earmuffs, too?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Quinn nodded. &quot;Sure.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Welcome back, Quinn.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Meanwhile, at the cabin,
Helen and Jake were clearly lacking for conversation; Jake suddenly started
whistling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;No whistling! We're
supposed to be bonding!&quot; Helen snapped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Oh, right...&quot; Jake paused,
then whistled again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Jake!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Sorry!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>And then a half-frozen
DeMartino bursts in, screaming.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Mr. DeMartino! What are you
doing here?&quot; Helen quickly covered herself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Need... phone!&quot; DeMartino
gasped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;I'm sorry, we don't have a
phone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Or a radio...&quot; Jake added.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Or a television,&quot; Helen
finished. &quot;Have a seat.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Get comfy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;How about a game of
charades?&quot; Helen suggested,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Need... help!&quot; The history
teacher headed towards door, only to be pulled back in by Jake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;You'll do fine,&quot; Jake
reassured him. &quot;Everybody knows how to play charades.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;You go first, Mr.
DeMartino,&quot; Helen added.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;But... I...&quot; Mr. DeMartino
protested.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Uh, uh, uh! No speaking!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;That's rule number one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Is it a book? A TV show?&quot;
Helen asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;An adult movie?&quot; asked
Jake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Mr. DeMartino just grunted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Meanwhile, out in the
blizzard, the Cynic Pair were walking, and even they were a little awed. &quot;I
think this could really be it!&quot; Jane suddenly said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Daria looked worriedly at
Jane, as worriedly as she could. &quot;What are you talking about? Just keep
walking. We'll find our way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;I don't know, Daria. This
is bad.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Daria sighed. &quot;Listen, I'm

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Well, I'm sorry I
embarrassed you all those times in front of my brother.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>There was a pause.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;I feel like we should say
more,&quot; Daria finally said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Jane nodded in agreement. &quot;I
know. That was kind of pathetic.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Daria tried to continue, but
the moment was clearly over. &quot;Um... I'm sorry my parents didn't stop at one
child.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Jane wouldn't let her friend
up-do her. &quot;I'm sorry they added those ugly blue M&amp;M's.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>There was another pause. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Better?&quot; Jane asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>In the meantime, also
outside, but near a cave, Mack approached Ms. Li, who was examining a pair of
underwear attached to a branch like a flag.</span></p>

miles from the bunkhouse.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Um, all right, but I hope
he didn't make any other flags.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span

is camped out around a small fire, the video camera set up on a tripod; the
camera is recording O'Neill's last words. And they were: &quot;Hello... Timothy
O'Neill here. If you are watching these last words, then you'll know that I'm
gone and you've found this camera. Well, you already know that you found the
camera, obviously, or how would you have the tape? Actually, if you found the
camera, you must have found me. Unless you recovered the camera from looters, although
I must say, it's a pretty heinous thing to steal from a frozen man. Although,
come to think of it, it's not actually all that cold anymore. And the snow got
rid of the pollen. You know, I feel pretty good!&quot; Then he heard scuffling
sounds. &quot;Ms. Li? Mack?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;O'Neill, you're wasting

talking with Daria as the blizzard stopped. &quot;So this didn't work out so bad. We

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Soon, Daria, Jane, (and also
Quinn) were going home in Jake's car</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;How was the field trip
after the snow stopped?&quot; Helen asked. &quot;Did you girls learn anything?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Quinn immediately began to
babble. &quot;I learned that sometimes being too well-dressed can work against you.
Who would have thought that one's fashion sense could have a dark side? The
normally life-affirming act of choosing an outfit...&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Helen quickly interrupted.
&quot;Yes, Quinn. And what about you, Daria?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;I came to the realization
that, given a choice between sharing shelter with my fellow students or risking
death by blindly marching into a blizzard, it's blizzard 'ho for me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Good for you, kiddo!&quot; Jake
crowed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Jake!&quot; Helen shrieked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Daria shook her head. &quot;Wow.
After all that quality time, you two are working together like a well-oiled
intimacy machine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Jake laughed. &quot;Say, girls,
when we get home, who's up for a game of family charades?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Back on the bus, Brittany
was still angry: &quot;I'm not sitting next to Kevin. I don't care how hard he
begs.&quot; She looked around, realizing something. &quot;Why isn't he begging?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Um...&quot;, Jodie said,
realizing a different thing. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>And back outside the
bunkhouse, Kevin was nervously laughing. &quot;Uh, Mr. D? Mr. O? Come out, everyone!
Um, Q.B. in distress!&quot;</span></p>
