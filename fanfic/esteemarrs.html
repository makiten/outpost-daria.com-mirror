</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jane - <I>Now</I> you're talking.  </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(In class. Mr. O'Neill is once
again addressing his captive audience)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Mr. O'Neill - And so, for tomorrow, I
want you to make a list of ten ways the world would be a sadder place
if you weren't in it. (Pause) Or I'll make you walk the plank! Just
kidding, a-heh heh ... </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Boy &ndash; Oh, Captain. O'Neill,
Captain.O'Neill?! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Mr. O'Neill &ndash; Say your word!  </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Boy - Is that if we'd never been
born, or if our ship was suddenly scuttled? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Mr. O'Neill - Never been born. <I>(bell
rings)</I> See you all tomorrow! <I>(to Daria and Jane, who have
stayed behind)</I> Ahoy! Did you need further clarification on
something we covered today? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - We feel really good about
ourselves. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jane &ndash; And our piratical
abilities.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria/Jane &ndash; We want to take
the test. . </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Mr. O'Neill - Well! I'm glad your
nautical meter has taken a good wind! But there's still three more
weeks of class left. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - This first week has been a
real eye-opener, and not because you made me take off my patch!. It
must be the way you teach. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Mr. O'Neill - <I>(flattered)</I> Oh,
well... thank you very much. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>Jane &ndash;
Arr.... </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(to Jane)</I> You know, you look
familiar somehow... </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - So can we take the test? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Mr. O'Neill - Well, it's not usual
procedure, but... I suppose ye can! <I>(grabs test)</I> Okay,
question one: &quot;Piracy is important because...&quot; </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - It's a career that will let
us get plunder for the rest of our lives.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jane &ndash; And booty.  </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Mr. O'Neill - Arr! Now, &quot;The
next time I start to feel bad about myself...&quot; </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jane - Stand before the mirror, look
myself in the eye and say, &quot;You are special. No one else on the
ship could replace you.&quot; </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Mr. O'Neill - You two really have
been paying attention! Okay, &quot;There's no such thing...&quot; </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jane - As the right weight. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - Or the right height. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jane - There's only what's right for
me and my crew. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - Because we're pirates! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Mr. O'Neill - I don't think we have
to go any further. I am really pleased with your learned' ways! I
think the rest of the school's population needs to hear about this at
morning assembly! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(the girls' faces fall as they
realize their plan has backfired in a big way)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(in the assembly hall.)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(Ms. Li is at the podium; Gunner
Gibson, Mrs. Manson, and Mr. O'Neill are seated behind her, with
Daria and Jane seated at the far end)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Ms. Li - And once again, the annual
Treasure Island expedition was a tremendous success. We looted more
than $400 of booty, which was subsequently stolen by the Grove Hill
crew&mdash;but we'll get it back, curse their hides! Now, Captain
O'Neill has exciting news about our afternoon pirate self-esteem
class. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(Mr. O'Neill stands and approaches
the podium, to meager applause)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - This is really going to help
me gradually ease into pirate life. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jane - Usually when I have this dream
I'm wearing a pink taffeta trim. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Mr. O'Neill - Thank you. You know,
self-esteem is a little like your ship's rum reserves. You may not
even know you're low on it until, one day, you go to get your drink
and there's none. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Kid - <I>(yells)</I> That's grog! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(tittering and catcalls from
audience)</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>Crowd &ndash; Arr! </I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Mr. O'Neill &ndash; Exactly as I
said! Anyway, I'd like you to meet two student pirates who have
completed my course faster than anyone ever before! Please join me in
congratulations as I present these certificates of nautical readyness
to... Daria Morgendorffer and Jane Lane. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(meager applause)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jane - Oh, what the hell. <I>(steps
up to podium)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(meager applause dies)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jane - I just want to say how proud I
am today. Knowing that I have nautical esteem makes me have even more
esteem (smirks and glances at Daria, then gets dramatic) On the other
hand, having all of you know that I had low self-esteem makes me
feel... kind of bad... like a landlubber or something. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(audience begins chuckling at
Jane's behavior as Daria looks on, approvingly)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jane - I, uh, I want to go to my
ship! <I>(lets out an exaggerated sob, complete with arm to forehead,
and runs off the stage)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(audience laughs as Mr. O'Neill
runs after her)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Mr. O'Neill - Daria, wait! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - <I>(steps up to podium)</I>
No one can sink a terrible problem like low self-esteem on their own.
It takes good coaching... </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(in the audience, Quinn is seated
between two boys, looking bored and a little uneasy)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Guy - Who cares about these losers?</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Guy 2 &ndash; Let em walk the plank,
I say! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Corey - Hey, beats cartography,
though, doesn't it? <I>(chortles and high-fives his buddy)</I> Did
you hear what I said, Quinn? I said, like, who cares how bad this is
-- it's still better than advanced cartography! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Guy - That's good, Corey. <I>(cackles)</I>
</FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn - Funny. That's funny, Corey. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Corey &ndash; Arr! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - ...realize my actually being
a pirate. Winning the fight against low self-esteem takes support...
from teachers, from friends, and most of all, from family. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Corey - Is that loser still talking?
Shoot her from a cannon! <I>(cackles and high-fives his buddy again)</I>
</FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - And so, the one crew mate I'd
like to thank more than any other is my very own sister, Quinn
Morgendorffer. <I>(audience gasps; Quinn's jaw drops to the floor)</I>
My <I>sister</I> Quinn has helped me with more self-esteem than
she'll ever know. Are you out there, <I>sis</I>? Stand up and let me
thank you in person!. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(Quinn cringes and tries to hide
as her friends turn to gape at her)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Corey &ndash; That crabby girl is
your sister?! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Kid - Are you like her too? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>Daria &ndash; Yarr ha ha! </I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(at Daria's house)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(the family is at the kitchen
table; Quinn is having a royal fit)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn - So then, she gets up in front
of the whole assembly and goes on about thanking <I>me</I>! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Helen - That's really sweet, Daria. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jake &ndash; I'm impressed with your
sisterly devotion.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Helen &ndash; It's what good pirates
do!</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jake &ndash; Arr!  </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn - Ooooh! <I>(slams fists on
table)</I> I'll have to lock myself in my chamber until I die! I'll
never talk to a single soul for the rest of my life! <I>(another
seagull arrives.)</I> That's for me. <I>(reads note.)</I>  I need to
go see Matthew at starboard.  <I>(walks out of kitchen)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jake - What upset her, anyway? Was it
a rival fleet? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - She felt I should have
thanked you and Mom as well. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Helen - No, we should thank <I>you</I>
for being such a great junior pirate. Graduating from that class
three weeks early is quite an achievement. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - Maybe we should all go out
and celebrate. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Helen - Oh, I'd love to, Daria,
but... <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">you don't have much spare
time when you're a pirate lawyer. </SPAN> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jake - Yeah. Take a rain check,
though. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - I don't know. My nautical
confidence feels like it's starting to sink. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(Helen and Jake gasp)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(Back at Pizza Island)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(the Morgendorffers are in
attendance; once again, Helen and Jake look uneasy, while Quinn would
rather be anywhere else, and Daria is basking in their humiliation)</I>
</FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria &ndash; The shanties were so
good I wanted to come back again.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jake - Uh... sure, honey. Whatever
you want. <I>(Daria, Jake, and Helen walk off-screen)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Helen <I>(O.S.)</I> - Quinn? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn - I'll wait here... or in the
bathroom.. or maybe out in the ocean. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jake <I>(O.S.)</I> - Okay. We'll be
back before you can say Bluebeard! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(a familiar-looking boy walks up
to Quinn)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Artie - Hi! I'm Arrr-tie. You're
cool. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn - <I>(shivers)</I> Mom! Dad!
You guys, wait up! Get me away from this slimy scoundrel <I>(runs
after her family)</I> </FONT>
