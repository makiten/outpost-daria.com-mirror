<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>By CAP</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span
lang=EN-GB> welcomed the cool air that leaped on him like a jaguar as soon as
he entered <i>Nick's Tavern</i>. Outside, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Dega Street</span><span
lang=EN-GB> sweltered. The summer sun had set but it scarcely made a
discernable difference. The hot, muggy air clung to everything like tar. </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> plunked at his shirt as he headed
for the corner of the highly polished long bar. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>"Hey, old timer,"
Nick said looking up from the sink as </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span
lang=EN-GB> sat down. "Happy birthday."&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thanks," </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> replied. "But as for the old timer
bit; you were born four months before I was."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah," Nick laughed in reply.
"But I still got all of my hair."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span
lang=EN-GB> grinned glancing at himself in the mirror that ran most of the
length of the wall behind the bar. He was bald from forehead to crown and a few
white hairs had taken up residence with their close-cropped black brethren that
grew along the sides of his head. It made him look older then his thirty-three
years. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A <i>Tom Collins,</i> please,"
he said pulling his eyes away from his reflection. "Don't bother putting fruit
in it."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You got it," Nick buoyantly
replied snagging a clean glass from the stack before him and scooping some ice
into it. He quickly mixed the gin, club soda, and lemon juice with practiced
ease. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thanks," </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> said as Nick placed the drink before
him. "Business looks good."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah," Nick agreed happily.
"I'll be able to pay the bills tonight."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He scanned the room. It was a
respectable crowd, especially for still being early on a Thursday evening. Nick
smiled. For the thousandth time he was thankful that he took the gamble on
opening his own business.&nbsp; It had been a hard row to hoe but it had been worth
it. The bar was undeniably a success. Unlike most of the establishments on </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Dega Street</span><span lang=EN-GB>, <i>Nick's Tavern</i> catered
to an older clientele. Many of the patrons were people like Nick and Trent;
people who had been haunting that section of </span><span lang=EN-GB>Lawndale</span><span
lang=EN-GB> since their teens but found themselves increasingly out of step
with the younger set that followed them. No one was going to mistake <i>Nick's </i>for<i>
The Zon </i>or <i>McGrundy's Pub. </i>There was no live music and the restrooms
were clean but it was near enough to the seedier elements of downtown to allow
the thirty and forty-somethings the illusion that they were still on the edge
despite driving SUV's and making mortgage payments on mock Tudor houses. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How's Renee?" </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> asked interrupting his friend's
thoughts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Getting grumpier by the day,"
Nick grinned. "I am so glad men can't get pregnant."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Definitely," </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> agreed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So how's your love life?"
asked Nick. "Gotten over Felicity yet?" </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was over her the moment she
dumped me," </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> replied with
a hint of defiance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, that's why you haven't
dated anyone in two months," Nick snorted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was," </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> protested. "I haven't dated because
I am tired of the constant break-ups. I don't seem to have the knack for making
relationships work." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whatever you say, </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB>," Nick said seriously. "Why don't
you do me a favour?&nbsp; Don't cling to that stool like moss on a tree. Talk to a
woman tonight.&nbsp; Just talk, that's all I'm asking."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe," </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> grunted. "If someone catches my
eye."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't win if you don't
play the game," Nick shot back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't lose either," </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> countered laconically. "Anymore
clich&eacute;s?" </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You gotta get back on the
horse that threw you. There are plenty of fish in the sea. Women are like buses,"
Nick laughed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, okay," </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> chuckled holding his hands up in surrender.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have one more," Nick
replied. "As long as I don't have to pick you up off the floor at closing time,
your money's no good tonight, birthday boy."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thanks. I won't cut into your
profits too much," </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB>
answered. "I don't plan on getting hammered."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nick punched him lightly on the
arm before moving down the bar to serve other customers. </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> sipped his cocktail and sighed. It
seemed as if everyone he knew was determined to see him to the altar. He thought
about Janie and her efforts when she was a teenager. It reminded him of <i>Emma</i>
and was as harmless but when he returned to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Lawndale</span><span
lang=EN-GB> after six years in the navy, he found all his old band mates
married. He soon became a frequent guest at barbeques and dinner parties that
always had a single female in-law of some sort present. The new Mrs.' </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Campbell</span><span lang=EN-GB>, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Moreno</span><span
lang=EN-GB>, and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Tyler</span><span lang=EN-GB> were determined
women and not subtle in the least. Jesse, Max, and Nick went along with their
wives labours with varying degrees of enthusiasm. He knew that they were his
friends and wanted to see him happy but it did get irritating. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span
lang=EN-GB> glanced back at his reflection as his thoughts wandered in yet another
direction. &nbsp;A staid clean-shaven face with intelligent eyes stared back at him.
He was thirty-three today. There was no denying that he was not a kid anymore but
then he never tried to do so. He had seen too many people clinging peter pan-like
to their younger days. They fooled only themselves frittering away of any
chance they had of enjoying of the present in the process. It did not bother him
to grow older. What did it mean? He felt the same as he had fifteen years ago.
Other then the gleaming dome, he even looked much the same, only his style had changed.
The earrings were history and he dressed better, discarding the earlier torn
jeans and tee shirts for a more mature look but his lanky frame carried only
ten pounds more then it had when he graduated from high school.&nbsp; Maybe it was
as the old adage stated; age is a case of mind over matter. If you do not mind,
it does not matter. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span
lang=EN-GB>'s self-appraisal ceased when a slender, elegant brunette with
shoulder length hair wearing a light blue blouse and navy skirt sat down on the
stool beside him. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you," she said in a
dulcet alto.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Huh?" </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span
lang=EN-GB> asked in bewilderment. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman held up her glass.
"For the drink."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span
lang=EN-GB> spied Nick at the far end of the bar grinning like the <i>Cheshire
Cat</i>.&nbsp; Comprehension dawned. His friend had given her the drink saying that
it was from </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You're welcome," he replied
deciding to play along. It would get Nick off his back. Besides, the woman was very
attractive. "I hope that you didn't think it too forward."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It might have been if you had
come over with some stale pick-up line but you didn't even look at me," she
said. "Did you regret it so soon?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, not at all," he quickly
reassured her. "It's just...I was just lost in thought is all."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She eyed him speculatively as
she tasted her cocktail. Fashion was no longer an obsession of hers as it was
years ago but a well-groomed man still commanded her notice. A quick perusal
showed that he was good looking, handsome even, casually but smartly dressed in
a dark brown slacks and a pale yellow short-sleeved cotton shirt open at the
neck. He smelled pleasantly of musk. He was smooth shaved. His fingernails were
trimmed and clean. His leather shoes sported a gleaming polish.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what got you started on
that dangerous mental activity?" she asked as she finished her rapid inventory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's my birthday today," </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> answered. "That's always a time of
reflection, I suppose." &nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I try to avoid examining my
life too closely," the woman replied. "It usually brings me around to thoughts
of swallowing handfuls of sleeping pills." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice was light and she
smiled when she said it but </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span
lang=EN-GB> was a sensitive man and heard the undertone. She spoke the truth. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May I use a stale line and ask
if you come here often?" he asked trying to steer the conversation back into safer
waters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She laughed softly. "It's my
first time here," she replied. "You must be a regular though. The bartender knows
you by name. He said quite a few nice things about you when he delivered the
drink you bought me."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't say that I'm a regular
but Nick was a friend of mine long before he opened this bar," </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> said. "We went to high school
together and had a band for several years."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Were you any good?" she asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," he replied "Not good
enough anyway. We never got anywhere and finally called it quits. Nick became a
bartender and I joined the navy."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I did four years in the army
after I finished at Lawndale High," the woman said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Always good to meet a fellow
vet," </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> said. "So if you don't
come to <i>Nick's</i>, where do you usually go?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No where around here," she
replied. &nbsp;"Actually, today marked my first time back in </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Lawndale</span><span lang=EN-GB> in over nine years."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You didn't return here after
the service then." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She took a long sip before she
spoke. "No, I didn't. I wanted to escape </span><span lang=EN-GB>Lawndale</span><span
lang=EN-GB> so badly that I didn't even bother to attend my high school graduation
ceremony. I was in basic two days after I took my final exams."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where's home then?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Home?" she repeated as if it were
an unknown word. "I live in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Corpus Christi</span><span
lang=EN-GB>. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Fort</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Hood</span><span lang=EN-GB> was my last duty station. Staying in </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Texas</span><span lang=EN-GB> was the easiest thing to do so
that's what I did. I found a job and enrolled in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Coastal</span><span
 lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Texas</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>University</span><span lang=EN-GB>."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you studying?" </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "International Business," she
replied. "But I'm out of school now. I got my B.S. in June."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Congratulations," said </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you," the brunette
replied looking down at the university class ring on her right hand.&nbsp; "I was so
proud when they handed me that diploma. Considering what kind of student I was
in high school, it was a major accomplishment."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know what you mean," </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> replied. "I earned my degree in the
spring term, also. I could have gotten some long odds on that ever happening."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So you're finished with
college, too," she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span
lang=EN-GB> shook his head. "No, I'll be back at UML when the fall semester
begins in a couple of weeks. I've been accepted into their MBA program."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Congratulations," she said. "But
what is UML?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They changed the name of </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Lawndale</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>State</span><span
lang=EN-GB> to Maryland-Lawndale five years ago."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I didn't know that," she
said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On the subject of names, what's
yours?" asked </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was beginning to wonder when
you were finally going to ask that," she laughed squeezing his forearm gently.
"It's Cassandra, Cassandra Griffin." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent
  Lane</span><span lang=EN-GB>."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So with the whole world to
choose from, why did you come back to </span><span lang=EN-GB>Lawndale</span><span
lang=EN-GB>, </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB>?" Cassandra
asked. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He smiled. "It's my home. Why
did you return after all this time?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cassandra tossed the rest of
her drink down before speaking. "My brother Sam needs a bone marrow transplant.
I happen to be a perfect match, the only one in the family. The doctors said
that it would be better if they did not have to freeze and transport the marrow
so here I am, back where I swore I'd never be again."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It sounds like a good reason
to break the vow," </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> sagely
said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>"Maybe," she
muttered tapping the side of her empty glass. "Do you want another one?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm still good," </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> replied. "But I'll get you one. What
would you like?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cassandra thought for a moment
before shaking her head. "No, I better not. The way I'm feeling right now, I
probably wouldn't stop once I got started." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span
lang=EN-GB> laid his hand tenderly across hers. "The reunion with your family
hasn't gone as well as you hoped it would?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sighed deeply. Tears
suddenly welled in her eyes. "I...no...it hasn't. I thought that, you know, nine
years might have changed some things. I had long since moved on or, at least, I
thought I had. One hour with Mom proved otherwise. She has neither forgiven nor
forgotten. We were right back at each others throats."&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm sorry to hear that," </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> said compassionately. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cassandra freed her hand. She
snared a handkerchief from her purse and dabbed carefully at her wet eyes.
"Listen to me. I meet a good-looking guy and I immediately start dumping on
him. You're probably thinking that I'm one of those overly emotional, needy
females to be avoided at all costs."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's all right," </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it's not," she replied.
"But it's kind of you to put a polite face on it." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span
lang=EN-GB> shrugged in response.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cassandra folded the cloth
abruptly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough about me and my family,"
she said briskly. "Tell me about yourself, Trent. What do you do for a living? Are
you married? Do you have any kids? What about your family?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span
lang=EN-GB> smiled deftly adjusting to her latest mood change. "At the moment, I
work at a car dealership but since I have earned my degree, I've looking around
for other opportunities. I've never been married and I have no children. What's
left of my family live far from here."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's left of them?"
Cassandra repeated. "You've lost one of them lately, I take it?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Most of them in truth over the
last few years," </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> told
her. "My father died of some sort of tropical fever in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Cambodia</span><span
lang=EN-GB> seven years ago. One older sister disappeared in </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>Central America</span><span lang=EN-GB>. The last we heard from her
was shortly before my father died. Another older sister died in a car accident.
No one has a clue where her kids got themselves to and my brother drowned
himself after his fourth divorce. It's only me, mom, and my younger sister
left."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So much grief in such a short
time," she replied sympathetically.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The grief is mostly in that we
had drifted apart from one another," </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span
lang=EN-GB> said. "Now, of course, that gulf can't be bridged."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that a veiled hint?"
Cassandra asked sharply</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span
lang=EN-GB> looked at her in surprise. "No, it's not," he replied grasping the
source of her sudden anger. &nbsp;"I don't know what your situation is."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cassandra nodded, mollified. &nbsp;"Where
do your mother and sister live?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Mom mostly stays at an artist
colony in the </span><span lang=EN-GB>Finger Lakes</span><span lang=EN-GB> area
of </span><span lang=EN-GB>New York</span><span lang=EN-GB> and Janie lives on
a farm in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Maine</span><span lang=EN-GB>," </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> answered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cassandra frowned. "Janie.
Jane. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Jane Lane</span><span lang=EN-GB>?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She was but she's married now.
It's Jane Dayne, these days," </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span
lang=EN-GB> said. "Did you know her in school?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peals of laughter burst from
Cassandra. </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> did not see
where the humour was but enjoyed hearing her. Her unabashed laughter was
surprisingly musical. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm sorry," she finally said. "</span><span
  lang=EN-GB>But Jane Lane</span><span lang=EN-GB> Dayne of </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Maine</span><span lang=EN-GB> was just too much. Please don't tell
me her husband's name is Cain."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span
lang=EN-GB> grinned. "It's Bede Cuthbert."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As in The Venerable Bede?"
asked Cassandra suppressing her merriment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span
lang=EN-GB> nodded. "And Cuthbert was an Anglo -Saxon saint, if you didn't
know." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't," she said. "How did
he get tagged with those names?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His father is a professor of
medieval history," </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB>
explained. "His particular field of study was Pre-Conquest Britain."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's fine but to saddle a
kid with Bede Cuthbert," she said. "Not done."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It was done," </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> said. "He prefers to be called B.
C." &nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"I can understand why," she
said. "But back to your earlier question, I kinda knew Jane in high school. She
was a grade ahead of me. We belonged to totally different cliques but her
circle and mine overlapped slightly. Her best friend and my best friend were
sisters."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Daria and Quinn," </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> supplied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's right," Cassandra
acknowledged. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you still see Quinn?" asked
</span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Occasionally but we talk two
or three times a week," she replied. "She keeps asking me to come and work for
her. She started her own company, you know. It's just over in </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Rockville</span><span lang=EN-GB>." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, Daria's mentioned it to
me a few times," </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> said.
"Marketing of some kind, isn't it?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Demographics research," she clarified.
"Very detailed. Very scientific. Several very different companies call on her
expertise and not a few political types, also. She's done so well that she's already
a millionaire." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So why don't you take her up
on the job offer?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cassandra waggled her hand.
"Part stubbornness, a desire to make it on my own and partly because </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Rockville</span><span lang=EN-GB> is too near </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Lawndale</span><span lang=EN-GB> for comfort."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nick wandered over to them. "You
two ready for another round?" he asked spying their empty glasses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A couple of orange juices
please," </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uh-oh, he's starting to hit
the hard stuff," Nick quipped. "Better keep an eye on him, Slim."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem. He's easy on the
eyes," Cassandra replied sliding off the stool. "Excuse me for a moment, </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB>. I have to take care of my mascara."&nbsp;
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span
lang=EN-GB> stood as she left. Both men watched her as she wove her way through
the crowd before disappearing into the women's restroom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You two seem to be hitting it
off," Nick observed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe," </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> cautiously replied as he sat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's with the maybe?" Nick
asked. "That is one gorgeous babe, to say the least."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She's mercurial, to say the
least," </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> responded. "She
has some issues with her family. I think she's pretty vulnerable right now."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That would be blood in the
water for some guys," Nick said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, it would be," </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> replied. "So?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nick chuckled ruefully. "Ah, the
white knight rides again. I guess her panties aren't going to end up on your
bedroom floor tonight."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You always were a romantic,
Nick," </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> said ironically.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We Scots are a direct tribe,"
he laughed in reply. "But can I give you a nickel's worth of free advice?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sounds expensive but go
ahead," </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> answered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get her out of here."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span
lang=EN-GB> blinked in amazement. "Why?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know what brought her to
my place," Nick said. "But she's not the type to hang out in bars."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>"What makes you
say that?" </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nick shrugged. "You just get a
feel for people when you run a saloon so why don't you take her somewhere else.
Some place fun that's not quite a date. Increase the comfort level and see
where it goes."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She lives in </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Texas</span><span lang=EN-GB>," </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span
lang=EN-GB> pointed out. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She's in </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Maryland</span><span lang=EN-GB> tonight," Nick countered. "Throw
the dice. It might be the beginning of a beautiful friendship."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nick turned away, taking orders
as he moved down the bar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span
lang=EN-GB> tapped his chin. He could not refute that Cassandra did indeed
intrigue him. He wanted to get to know her better but was not sure that it was
worth the effort. Her distain for </span><span lang=EN-GB>Lawndale</span><span
lang=EN-GB> was quite evident. She would certainly be gone as soon as the bone
marrow procedure was finished but he was not sure how long that process took. He
was still mulling the matter over when she returned at length.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>"I'm back," she
said, placing her purse on the counter. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you like mysteries?" he hurriedly
asked as he stood.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I devour them," Cassandra
replied somewhat surprised by the question. "I have the latest Martha Grimes in
my handbag right now in fact. I also like Sue Grafton, Lawrence Block, Margaret
Fraser, Edward Marston, just about everyone in the genre, really."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "D. B. Morgendorffer?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, her, too," Cassandra
laughed. &nbsp;"I wasn't surprised that she ended up writing mysteries. I thought
that she was spooky when we were in school. I was half afraid of her most of
the time."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You were afraid of Daria?" </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> asked incredulously. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She shrugged apologetically.
"She was so different. I couldn't understand her."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She marched to a different
drummer, to be sure," </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB>
said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, she did," Cassandra
agreed. "Anyway, why do you want to know if I like mysteries?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They're having one of those
murder mystery parties tonight at the UML student union," </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> said. "As part of the end of summer
term activities."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You mean those role-playing
games where everyone pretends to be a suspect?" she asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span
lang=EN-GB> nodded. "Yeah. It begins in about an hour."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Some of the bookstores in </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Corpus Christi</span><span lang=EN-GB> would host those
occasionally. I always wanted to go to one but they were usually on a night
that I had classes," Cassandra said. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm parked just up the
street," </span><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> said gesturing
toward the door. "We can be there in fifteen minutes."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That sounds good, </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB>," she replied spiritedly. "Let's
go."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span
lang=EN-GB> gently took her elbow guiding her toward the exit. The <i>Cheshire cat
</i>smile returned to Nick's face as he watched the pair leave his tavern
together. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
