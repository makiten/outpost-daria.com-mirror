<H2>Chapter One: The Morgendorffers Have a Visitor</H2>

<P>&quot;Kids - we have a visitor.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn's voice drifted down the stairs. &quot;Jeffy?&quot;</P>

<P>Daria peeped round her bedroom door. &quot;Jane?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You'd better come and see.&quot; said Helen.</P>

<P>Quinn walked out onto the landing and squealed &quot;Uncy Roger!&quot;
She bounded down the stairs and ran to the door, almost knocking the avuncular
visitor off his feet with the enthusiasm of her embrace.</P>

<P>&quot;Uncy Roger?&quot; Daria ran out of her room. &quot;Uncy Roger!&quot;
She ran down the stairs and fastened herself onto the other side of the
smiling, bespectacled and distinguished-looking gentleman. The cut of his
Italian overcoat and the gleam of his bespoke shoes spoke eloquently of
someone for whom style was a way of life; a given, not just something added
on as an afterthought.</P>

<P>He dropped his French pigskin suitcases and hugged the two girls who,
it was clear, could barely contain their excitement. &quot;How are my favourite
nieces?&quot; he beamed.</P>

<P>&quot;Roger?&quot; Jake strode out of the kitchen, removing his &quot;Kiss
the cook&quot; apron and tossing it aside as he held out a welcoming hand.</P>

<P>&quot;Jake! It's good to see you!&quot; He brushed aside the proffered
hand and embraced Jake, giving him a hearty slap on the back.</P>

<P>Jake stared past Roger through the open door. &quot;Wow! A Ferrari?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Just picked her up in Milwaukee. Like to take her for a spin?&quot;
He reached into the pocked of his overcoat and tossed a gleaming set of
keys to the grinning Jake. &quot;You won't need to take her out of second
around town,&quot; he chuckled.</P>

<P>&quot;Do I want to take her for a spin? Does a bear sh...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;JAKE!&quot; Helen interjected. Let Roger get in. He's come a long
way.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh - yeah.&quot; Jake grinned sheepishly. &quot;Let me take your
bags up to the spare room. You're staying for a while, right?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;For a week. If you'll have me.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh roger, you know you're always as welcome as the flowers in
spring.&quot; purred Helen. &quot;The girls are always asking when you're
coming for a visit. You know Daria always says that she wants to be just
like you.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Tell us a story Unca Roger!&quot; squealed Quinn.</P>

<P>&quot;A story! A story!&quot; yelled Daria, jumping up and down with
excitement.</P>

<P>&quot;Girls, let Roger get in. I'm sure he's tired. He's come a long
way. Can I get you a coffee, Roger?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Or a beer?&quot; Asked Jake. &quot;Hey - how about a martini?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Jake - you know I can never resist your martinis. I swear it's
the only reason I come to visit.&quot; He winked at Helen as Jake grinned
and hurried off towards the kitchen. &quot;A story then, is it my poppets?&quot;
he smiled, giving his adoring nieces a hug.</P>

<P>&quot;Yes, yes! A Story!&quot; the girls chorused.</P>

<P>&quot;Alright then. Come on.&quot; Roger walked in and sat on the couch,
the two girls snuggling up to him with anticipation gleaming in their eyes.
Helen sat opposite as Jake returned with a brimming pitcher, three martini
glasses and a bowl of olives.</P>

<P>&quot;Alright now.” He said. “Are you all sitting comfortably? Then
I'll begin...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Unca Roger?&quot; Quinn interrupted.</P>

<P>&quot;Yes, Quinn honey?&quot; he smiled.</P>

<P>&quot;This isn't going to be the story where Mom takes fertility drugs
and there are five of me is it?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You mean the one where Jane spanks you with the hairbrush, and
you get confused about oral sex?&quot; giggled Daria.</P>

<P>&quot;Well, no, I...&quot;</P>

<P>Daria interrupted. &quot;Oh, and it's not going to be the one where
Jane and I get married and I get pregnant using Trent's sperm and a turkey
baster is it?&quot; asked Daria, her eyes wide.</P>

<P>&quot;Um, well...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And it's not the one where Aunt Kara has me shipped off to a funny
farm is it?&quot; Jake looked panicky and poured himself another martini.
&quot;Goddamn cognitive behaviour therapy!&quot;</P>

<P>Roger sighed. &quot;Now that you mention it, I am a little tired. Maybe
a little nap before dinner.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Of course dear,&quot; said Helen. “Girls, let Uncle Roger get
up.”</P>

<P>&quot;Aw. Can we have a story later, uncy Roger?&quot; asked Quinn,
disappointment plain on her face.</P>

<P>&quot;Yes, of course my dear,&quot; smiled Roger as he wearily trudged
up the stairs.</P>

<P>&quot;Mom?&quot; whispered Quinn. &quot;Daria says Uncy Roger's a shipper.
What's a shipper?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well dear...&quot; started Helen, when she was interrupted by
the muted burble of a V16 engine from the street outside.</P>

<P>Daria ran to the window. A dark blue Maserati had pulled up behind Roger's
red Ferrari.</P>

<P>&quot;Uncy Renfield!&quot; she squealed. </P>

<H2>
<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="75%"></H2>

<H2>Chapter 2: Daria and Quinn Visit a Farm</H2>

<P>&quot;You girls have never been to Uncle Brandon's farm have you?&quot;
Jake asked as he swung the Lexus up the drive toward the pretty white clapboard
farmhouse.</P>

<P>&quot;No.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Uh uh.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You're in for a treat!&quot; Jake enthused. &quot;Last year Uncle
Brandon won first prize at the County Fair for growing the longest string
bean in the world! They couldn't fit it all in the back of his pickup truck
so he had to hire an eighteen-wheeler just to get it there! How about that,
eh?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Wow.&quot; mumbled Daria.</P>

<P>&quot;I can't wait.&quot; muttered Quinn.</P>

<P>As they approached the farmhouse they could see Uncle Brandon waiting
for them, straw hat on his head, blue overalls buttoned over one shoulder,
pitchfork in his hand and the ever-present straw dangling out of his mouth.</P>

<P>&quot;Jake, Quinn, Daria!&quot; he drawled as the Lexus silently rolled
to a stop in front of the flower-lined path that led to the front door.
&quot;It surely is mighty fine of you-uns to visit li'l ol' me.&quot; He
hawked a loogie at a hound that lay asleep on the porch. The dog, who had
long ago learned to ignore these indignities, wearily opened one eye and
followed its path as, true to form, the loogie landed three feet to its
left on a potted geranium.</P>

<P>&quot;Hi, Brandon! It's great to be here, isn't it girls?&quot; Jake
grinned as he pumped Uncle Brandon's hand.</P>

<P>&quot;Great.&quot; mumbled Daria.</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah. Great.&quot; muttered Quinn, looking down at her shoe and
sneering at what she'd mistaken for mud until she noticed the smell, and
suppressing an &quot;Eeew&quot;.</P>

<P>&quot;So how's the wonderful world of agribusiness, Brandon, my man?&quot;
Grinned Jake.</P>

<P>&quot;Wheeeel now, t'aint bin s' good, Jake.&quot; drawled Brandon.
&quot;Somethin's bin a gitten at mah stock. Plum put 'em off'n their feed
it has. Cow ain't a milkin', hens ain't a layin. And ol' Nutso thar...&quot;
he cocked a head at the hound, &quot;...why, as ya can see, it just ain't
right.&quot; The hound yawned, stretched arthritically and padded over
to the geranium, cocking a leg to add its offering the the loogie.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, poor old fella.&quot; said Jake. &quot;How old is he?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Six months.&quot; Drawled Brandon. &quot;And he ain't a he, he's
a she.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Um, Dad, Uncle Brandon, can we go and play in the barn?&quot;
asked Quinn.</P>

<P>&quot;Sure honey!&quot; smiled Jake. &quot;Is that okay, Brandon?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Mighty fine, mighty fine.&quot; croaked Brandon, hawking another
loogie at the dog.</P>

<P>Daria and Quinn wandered off in the direction of the barn. &quot;I like
uncle Brandon...&quot; said Quinn, &quot;...but New York is where I'd rather
stay.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I get allergic smelling hay.&quot; added Daria.</P>

<P>&quot;I just adore a penthouse view.&quot; sighed Quinn as they neared
the open door of the magnificent red barn.</P>

<P>&quot;Darling I...&quot; started Daria, but before she could finish
a cacophony of sound drowned her out.</P>

<P>A dozen chickens ran flapping out of the barn, feathers flying. The
distressed sound of Bossy, Uncle Brandon's prize milker, was unmistakable.</P>

<P>They ran towards to the barn, following the pathetic mooing.</P>

<P>A voice came out of the darkness &quot;Quinn? Daria?&quot;</P>

<P>Slowly their eyes adjusted.</P>

<P>&quot;Uncy ROGER!&quot; the girls squealed, half covering their eyes.
&quot;Eeeeeeew!&quot; </P>

<P>
<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="75%"></P>

<H2>Chapter 3: Daria's Birthday Party</H2>

<P>&quot;Cousin Cynigal! You came!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah yeah. Happy birthday, kid.&quot; Cynigal walked in and tossed
Daria a small package wrapped in black paper with a black ribbon tied round
it, ignoring Daria and casting her eye around the room.</P>

<P>Daria carefully pulled off the ribbon, unwrapped the small box and opened
the lid.</P>

<P>&quot;Gee - it's a, um...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;A four-inch-long turtle skull with sequins and feathers glued
to it.&quot; Cynigal continued her scan of the guests.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, gee, I've never had one of those before.&quot; Daria put the
box down on the table with other presents, most of which were books.</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, well kid, you know me. I...hah...&quot; Cynigal had clearly
spotted her quarry. She strode off across the room without a backward glance.</P>

<P>&quot;Daria, do you suppose Uncy Roger's going to come?&quot; Quinn
asked.</P>

<P>&quot;He called earlier and asked whether Uncle Brandon was bringing
any of his livestock. I said that I didn't think so and he remembered an
urgent appointment, so I guess that means no. He did send me a copy of
the Harry Harrison Compendium though.&quot; Daria smiled, picking up a
large tome from the table.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh.&quot; Quinn's face showed her disappointment. &quot;I was
just worried a little about Uncy Renfield. He's been drinking pitchers
of Dad's martinis - he's on his third now - and you know how, um, 'confused'
he gets after his third pitcher of martini.&quot; Quinn said, making the
'quote' sign with her fingers as she said the word 'confused'.</P>

<P>&quot;I wouldn't worry about Uncy Renfield. He's got an amazing constitution.
If I know him he'll be swapping hospital stories with Uncy Galen within
ten minutes. Uncy Galen was in the kitchen eating dad's peyote chilli last
time I saw him so they should be good company for each other about now.
I'm more worried about Jane - I haven't seen her for a while.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You're worried? How do you think I feel?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hmm, point taken. Let's see if we can find her. I'll take this
floor, you take upstairs.&quot; They nodded in agreement and walked off
in oppposite directions.</P>

<P>Daria passed by Cousin Kem, who was surrounded by Jeffy, Joey and Jehosephat
all trying to outdo each other for her attentions. She looked bored, but
waved and smiled at Daria as she walked by. Uncle Nutso had resumed his
usual place, standing on his head in the corner.</P>

<P>A tall, balding man was standing by himself, as if there was an invisible
force field around him. He was leaning heavily on a cane and clutched a
beer in his hand. &quot;Hi Uncle Crossada. Are you enjoying the party?&quot;
Daria asked.</P>

<P>&quot;Hm. Guns. Liberals.&quot; grunted Uncle Uncle Crossada. &quot;Damn
right!&quot; agreed Jake from across the room.</P>

<P>&quot;Er, yeah.&quot; said Daria, hurrying by. She'd scanned the room
by that stage - still no sign of Jane. &quot;He'll enjoy himself more when
Uncle Grimace and Uncle Devilkitty arrive.&quot; she mused.</P>

<P>She walked into the kitchen. Sure enough, Uncy Galen and Uncy Renfield
were sitting at the table babbling incoherently in animated conversation.
&quot;I wonder if they can understand each other?&quot; she thought as
she passed. Every now and then one of them would pick up a nail from the
jar that Jake had left on the table after repairing the wonky shelf, and
nibble it with obvious enjoyment. &quot;Wow,&quot; Daria thought. &quot;They're
going to be in for an interesting time tomorrow.&quot;</P>

<P>She walked to the laundry room and opened the door. The sight that greeted
her made her start. &quot;Jane! Cynigal!&quot;</P>

<P>Jane quickly pulled down her t-shirt. &quot;Um, Daria! I, um...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hey, can't we get little privacy around here?&quot; grunted Cynigal,
not bothering to do the same.</P>

<P>By an amazing co-oncidence, Quinn appeared at that very moment. &quot;JANE!&quot;
she squealed.</P>

<P>&quot;Look you two,&quot; said Cynigal. &quot;Admit it - I'm more cynical
than you, Daria. And Quinn, sorry Hon, you're just no competition.&quot;
She looked down, her meaning clear. She kicked the door closed, leaving
Daria and Quinn staring, speechless, as the sound of heavy breathing drifted
out through the louvred door.</P>

<P>
<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="20%"></P>

<P>Daria put a sisterly arm around Quinn's shoulder. The sounds coming
from the laundry room prompted her to lead her younger sister back toward
the kitchen, where Uncy Renfield and Uncy Galen, having finished the jar
of nails, had started on a tube of PVA glue from the toolbox that Jake
had carelessly left under the table.</P>

<P>&quot;Sis, I wouldn't worry. I have a suspicion that everything'll be
back to normal soon. Cousin Cynigal has to go back to Oregon tomorrow.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn sniffed. &quot;Do you really think so?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I d...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;EEP - IT'S THE HAMBURGLAR!&quot; Cousin Kem's scream interrupted
from the living room. They ran in to see her staring at the window, through
which a masked face was peering. The head that contained the face supported
a broad-brimmed hat with a yellow band, and the neck that supported the
face was attached to a short body surrounded on all sides by a black and
white striped jumpsuit.</P>

<P>Quinn giggled. &quot;Oh, that's just Uncle Wyvern. He probably won't
come in, he seems to prefer lurking.&quot; The face disappeared, only to
reappear a minute later at the window on the other side of the door. As
Quinn gazed out past Uncle Wyvern, a large livestock freighter pulled up
outside. </P>

<P>A minute later the doorbell rang. Quinn threw it open and in strode
Uncy Roger. &quot;Traded the Ferrari in for something more practical. She's
a beauty, isn't she?&quot; he asked, indicating the truck.</P>

<P>What most people were looking at, however, wasn't the truck, but Uncy
Roger's companion.</P>

<P>Beside him stood a sheep wearing red lipstick and a blue silk bow around
it's neck.</P>

<P>Quinn was tempted to suggest that L'Or&eacute;al &quot;Blazing Red&quot;
clashed terribly with the blue bow, but she didn't want to offend her favourite
uncle, or his date for that matter.</P>

<P>&quot;Everybody, meet Lulubelle,&quot; announced Uncy Roger.</P>

<P>Mutters of &quot;Hi Lulubelle&quot;, &quot;a pleasure&quot;, and &quot;charmed&quot;
came from the guests. &quot;Lambburger!&quot; whispered Uncle Wyvern through
the open door.</P>

<P>&quot;Baaaaaaa&quot; said Lulubelle.</P>

<P>&quot;Uncy Roger gives new meaning to the expression 'animal husbandry'&quot;
thought Daria, but she was too polite to say it out loud.</P>

<P>Uncy Roger led Lulubelle through the crowd straight towards Uncle Brandon,
who was thoughtfully sucking on a straw and clutching a cider. Uncle Brandon
glanced down at Lulubelle. &quot;Ain't spent much time around farms, have
ya, Rog boy?&quot; he asked.</P>

<P>&quot;No, Brandon, I admit that I haven't. But those few weeks at your
place have given me a whole new outlook on life, and Lulubelle and I wanted
to thank you.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, it was my pleasure, Rog. And since ya left things have gotten
pretty much back to normal, though Bossy does get a kind o' far away look
in her eye from time ta time.&quot; He removed the straw from his mouth.
&quot;Rog, there's really somethin' y' oughta know about your friend thar.&quot;
he drawled.</P>

<P>&quot;What? About Lulubelle?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yah.&quot; He took off his straw hat, scratched his head, and
replaced the hat. &quot;Um, I'm not sure how to tell ya this, Rog, but
Lulubelle ain't a ewe.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;She's not 'me'? What do you mean? We're a perfect match, aren't
we Lulubelle?&quot; he said, looking into Lulubelle's eyes.</P>

<P>&quot;Baaaaa&quot; said Lulubelle.</P>

<P>&quot;No, Rog, that's not what I meant. I meant that Lulubelle's a ram.&quot;</P>

<P>Roger grinned. &quot;She sure is,&quot; he chortled, elbowing digging
Brandon in the ribs.</P>

<P>&quot;Rog, listen carefully to whut I'm a' sayin',&quot; Brandon sighed.
&quot;Lulubelle is a male - a boy sheep.&quot;</P>

<P>A startled look crossed Roger's face. &quot;Brandon! I'm shocked! I
may not know much about animals, but even <I>I</I> know that a boy sheep
is a goat! You're just jealous! You're trying to come between me and Lulubelle!&quot;</P>

<P>Grabbing lulubelle by the bow, he led her away as fast as possible toward
Daria. Brandon sighed, took a large mouthful of cider, and resumed sucking
his straw.</P>

<P>&quot;Daria,&quot; he said. &quot;Where's your laundry room? Lulubelle
and I have to...talk...yeah, that's it. We have to...talk.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's through the kitchen uncy Roger,&quot; she said, &quot;But
you really shouldn't...&quot; Too late. </P>

<P>Roger and Lulubelle dashed off through the kitchen. As they passed Uncle
Renfield and Uncle Galen, Roger paused, pulled a handkerchief out of his
pocket and wiped a dribble of glue off Uncle Renfield's chin. &quot;You
boys really ought to pull yourselves together.&quot; he muttered.</P>

<P>&quot;I can't look,&quot; thought Daria as she heard the door to the
laundry room open, then close with a hurried slam.</P>

<P>&quot;Baaaaaaaa&quot; said Lulubelle. </P>

<P>
<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="20%"></P>

<P>&quot;Jane?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Shuddup. I don't want to talk about it.&quot; Jane scowled at
Daria as she stomped by. Daria thought it best not to remark on the fact
that she was wearing Cynigal's jeans. Backwards. </P>

<P>As Jane stalked off in search of Quinn, Daria turned to see Aunty Tafka
and Uncle Lew lead Andrea out of the laundry room by a rope tied onto a
studded leather collar. &quot;Heel!&quot; ordered Uncle Lew, and Andrea
trotted obediently into position behind him.</P>

<P>&quot;Andrea?&quot; said Daria, hoping everything was alright. Andrea
turned, lolled out her tongue and panted, just like a dog in the ecstasy
of a tummy scratch. <I>No mistaking that expression</I> Daria mused. </P>

<P>&quot;Struth, that was bonza.&quot; winked Aunty Tafka as she passed.
&quot;Now where's the beer?&quot;</P>

<P>They were followed out of the laundry room by Uncle Roger, who looked
crestfallen. He gloomily trudged into the kitchen and sat down between
Uncle Renfield and Uncle Galen, both of whom had miraculously recovered
- a tribute to the exceptional physiques, robust good health and extreme
strength of character. They were arm-wrestling, their bulging biceps threatening
to burst through the sleeves of their fine freedom-silk shirts. A group
of admiring and scantily-clad cheerleaders surrounded them, eager to reward
both winner and loser in the best way then knew how. Little did they suspect
that they were to be disappointed, for both men were of impeccable moral
fibre.</P>

<P>&quot;I wonder if I can get the Ferrari back?&quot; Roger muttered.</P>

<P>Cynigal trotted out of the laundry room smoking a cigarette, followed
closely by the sheep. &quot;Call me next time you're in Oregon, eh Boris?&quot;
She patted the sheep's head and strode off to join the party, Jane's pants
exaggerating her already impressive figure.</P>

<P>&quot;Baaaaaa&quot; said Boris.</P>

<P>Daria strolled back into the living room, past an intellectual group
listening in silent and rapt attention to Uncle Marcello, who was reciting
his sensual poetry inspired by some of the finest literature that the 21st
century had produced or, for that matter, was ever likely to produce. Daria
was unable to resist joining them and time, as it always does in transcendent
moments, flew.</P>

<P>&quot;Dinner everyone!&quot; Jake's hearty call made the guests realise
that they'd been having such a good time they'd completely forgotten how
hungry they were. The individual groups broke up and drifted over to the
table which Jake had piled high with a mouth-watering assortment of burgers
and condiments. Conversation lulled as members of the extended Morgendorffer-Barksdale
clan helped themselves to the delicious treats. Jake beamed as the compliments
flowed.</P>

<P>&quot;Jake, Honey, I have to admit you outdid yourself.&quot; Helen
sighed. &quot;These burgers are simply wonderful.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Mmmm, good!&quot; agreed Aunty Kara through a mouthful of burger.</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah Dad, I actually ate a whole half burger!&quot; agreed Quinn,
patting her distended stomach, belching loudly and blushing as she quickly
covered her mouth.</P>

<P>&quot;Magnificent, Jake old chap.&quot; said Uncle Grimace, giving Jake
a hearty slap on the back. &quot;Better than anything we ever had back
at the old frat house and, believe me, that's high praise. However did
you manage it?&quot;</P>

<P>Jake grinned. &quot;It was almost a disaster. I'd made a huge pot of
my famous peyote chilli, but someone had polished it off while I wasn't
looking. Lucky for me Crossada and Wyvern offered to help out and, dammit,
in half an hour they'd come back with enough meat to whip up lambburgers
for everyone.&quot;</P>

<P>Conversation, which had started to resume, died. Silence descended like
a meat cleaver on a chopping block.</P>

<P>&quot;Um, Dad, did you say 'lambburgers'?&quot; asked Daria hesitantly.</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah!&quot; Grinned Jake. &quot;Great, aren't they?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Gutted him m'self.&quot; mumbled Uncle Crossada, who was grasping
his beer so tightly that his fingers had left deep indentations in the
container. Daria noticed in passing that the container was a glass bottle.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, by the way,&quot; said Jake, still grinning, &quot;Did anyone
lose this?&quot; He held up a large blue bow.</P>

<P>&quot;Lulubelle!&quot; wailed uncy Roger.</P>

<P>&quot;Boris!&quot; shrieked Cousin Cynigal.</P>

<P>&quot;Lambburgers!&quot; chortled Uncle Wyvern from the side window.</P>

<P>&quot;Buuuuuurp&quot; said Lulubell/Boris from Quinn's stomach. </P>

<P>

<P><B>Disclaimer:</B> Daria, her family and friends belong toMTV.</P>

<P><B>Further disclaimer:</B> I&nbsp;have no evidence that Roger E. Moore
has anything other than a perfectly natural relationship with farmyard
animals. I doubt very much that either Renfield or Galen Hardesty partake
of any intoxicants other than delicious drinking alcohol.</P>

<P>Friends - your inclusion in this silly little fantasy indicates nought
but the highest degree of respect and affection. If I've neglected to include
you, it's because the story was never finished.</P>
