<b>Year 2, Fall</b><br>
</center>
<br>
<br><b><i>The Parents Are At Rest</i></b>.  On vacation and facing an empty nest when Quinn departs for California, Helen remembers the births of her daughters.  Quinn finishes her the last meeting of the honor society with relief to no longer feel like an outsider.  She also meets with the old Fashion Club to say goodbye to them.  During this, Sandi asks Daria for help to get even with Linda and presents a folded paper, presumably evidence.  Daria convinces her to be a better person and destroy the letter, since she had it only to hurt Linda.  Sandi will be going to Northern Coastal State, Stacy will attend Lawndale Community College, plus race cars, and Tiffany has started local modeling.  Daria tells Michael that she's concerned about her parents, that without children at home, their marriage will either get closer, or fall apart.  She also hopes that they can find some of their old idealism, like Jake had started to do after working with Jodie.  Helen is also proud that Jake has managed to make his business more socially responsible.  They all have a breakfast together of Helen's pancakes before Daria and Michael leave for Boston.  Lindy arrives to say goodbye to Quinn before she leaves on a four-day drive to California.  Knowing Michael will enjoy seeing her in the dress from the play; Daria puts it on for him, knowing it is another change for her and her growing acceptance of how she looks.  Quinn encounters some interesting hotels and eateries on her trip.  Jake feels the loss of his daughters when he sees both of their doors open.  Sandi stops by the road on her way to college and destroys the letter, remembering that her mother, worried about a possible divorce, had set up Sandi's trust fun so that neither Linda nor Tom would touch it.  As the wind blows the scraps, the greeting displays it was a letter to Ms. Li.  Just before leaving to return to work, Helen stops and breaks her routine by kissing Jake goodbye and saying I love you.  He's surprised but responds in kind.  Quinn arrives at Pepperhill and enjoys the immediate attention of several young men.  She then meets her roommate, Fran Lawrence.  She has very long, dark brown hair and soulful gray eyes, and a face scarred by an auto accident when she was ten.  After hanging up from Quinn's call that she arrived okay, Eric enters Helen's office to congratulate her on being made full partner.  As he leaves, he says she can take things easier, maybe spend more time with her kids, leaving her softly crying.
<br>
<br><b><i>Back Aboard</i></b>.  Karen, her arm in a cast from a horse kick, visits the grave of Laura, a high school friend who died of an eating disorder.  Karen talks of how that memory sparked her to help Daria with her self-image problems.  She also talks to her lost friend about Derek and their growing relationship, and the probability that her brother Terry's wife may be pregnant.  Karen drives home in her light truck and her parents, Geoff and Maddie, are introduced.  With the truck loaded, including a used sofa for the apartment, Karen leaves for Boston.  To avoid the cost of a hotel, she stays with Jake and Helen overnight.  She drops off a bag of sweet onions that her mother insisted she take with for the Morgendorffers.  Karen also explains how Terry's plan shift the farm to growing certified organic produce has paid off.  Karen arrives at the apartment safely and soon Derek and Michael are recruited to help unload her truck and bring up the sofa.  After a joke from Derek and Michael falls flat, Jane feels a little left out, relationship-wise.  Recovering, she suggests a beach trip before school starts.  They all agree and CC also joins them.  Soon, Karen and Derek are relaxing in beach chairs, Jane and CC go "trolling" and Daria and Michael go swimming, though Daria has done little swimming since she was 12.  By lunch, CC complains that she's had to "throw them all back as underage" and Jane was trying to teach a couple guys to foxtrot on the sand.  Daria and Michael walk back after getting drifting down the beach with the current and getting turned around before Daria asked for directions.  Karen doesn't allow anyone near the grill as she prepares lunch.  After, Jane and CC get involved in a volleyball game, and Jane comes over to get a notepad for phone numbers.  Daria and Karen agree that Jane's feeling better.  Looking and feeling their best, Daria, Jane and Karen start fall semester the following Monday.

Grabbing mail on her return home, she notices a letter to Daria from <u>Literature in Action</u> and listens to a message from Bel that Stan is stable and she probably saved his life.

After the fraternity publicly supports the brothers, most of the women in the school join the boycott against the entire fraternity.  The broad support encourages Fran.  She also gets another date that turns out nice, but not spectacular.  The support continues, but some harassment also develops.  Fran calls Daria and thanks her, but also says she wants to end things, the support she's felt has more than made up for the hurt and she doesn't feel the need to continue.  On Daria's suggestion, Fran runs a letter in the school paper thanking those that supported her and asking them to end the boycott.

That the case involves Angela Li Leonard Lamm and Linda Griffin.  When Daria calls her mother, she can't offer legal advice because she'd been retained by Linda.  The letter that Sandi had asked Daria about was a copy stolen from Linda's files and replaced by a photocopy.  Later, Mrs. Griffin discovers the missing copy and realizes she needs to destroy the original.  She tries to get it from Ms. Li's old files, but Ms. Defoe refuses because the files have been sealed as evidence.  Suspicious, she contacts an Assistant District Attorney, Mr. Sullivan.  Together, they check the files and find a letter from Mrs. Griffin to Ms. Li introducing Mr. Lamm and more that involve a complex kickback scheme between the three.  Sullivan gets a search warrant and collects files from Mrs. Griffin.  In a defense move, Mrs. Griffin claims her electronic signature was falsely used and retains Helen to sue the television station.  After Daria contacts Helen, she knows she has a conflict of interest and must stop representing Mrs. Griffin.  Helen contacts Carol Murphey to represent Daria, who is thrilled to see her again.  They meet for lunch at Good Time Chinese in Lawndale before meeting with Mr. Sullivan, who is surprised to see her representing Daria.  During the interview, Daria says that it was probably Sandi that took the letter.  In explaining why she helped Daria, she also tells Sullivan about Upchuck's website.  Sullivan says he needs to investigate that too because of how it could affect the case.  After, Daria goes to her parent's house and changes into a night shirt to take a nap.  When Jake wakes her up, he's unsettled by how feminine his daughter looks in the tighter shirt.  Daria helps Jake make dinner and realizes how much she must've embarrassed him and realizes he needs a little something from her, letting him know it's all right to call her Kiddo.  After a delay, Daria and Sandi testify to a grand jury, providing important information to the case that forces Mrs. Griffin, on her lawyer's advice, to make a plea bargain.  Sullivan gains a search warrant to Upchuck's apartment and finds evidence that he was stalking Daria, including a photo of her having lunch with Ms. Murphey, as well as hundreds of bootlegged adult videos.  He was arrested and released on bail.  Daria was advised not to return to Lawndale until his case was settled.

Concerned about what Upchuck might do if she goes to Lawndale, Daria invites Jake and Helen to Boston for Thanksgiving, along with Jane, Karen, Michael and Derek.

Michael commissioned a hand-bound diary for Daria's birthday.  Karen takes over responsibility for preparing the dinner and shopping for it.  When Daria picks up Jake and Helen at the airport, they confirm that the house was left as if occupied and the police had installed surveillance cameras inside.

She explains to Karen that they would sometimes get large rats at the commune she and Jake lived at in college.  Once everyone arrives, Karen recruits them to help with preparations.

In the morning, Helen realizes the Daria has become the student her mother had hoped Helen would be and thanks Daria for becoming someone Helen doesn't have to worry as much about.  When they get home, Jake and Helen find a single rose left on Daria's bed and they call the police.  When pulled over, Upchuck's bribe fails and he's arrested.  He had packed and had a plane ticket to Boston when caught.  Because he attempted to leave the county, his previous bail was forfeited and his father refused to post a second, higher bail.
