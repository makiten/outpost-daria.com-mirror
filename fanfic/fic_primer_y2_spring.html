To further include her children, Jane has each make a small sculpture that she'll make molds of and cast in weak tea to include in her work, a girl looking at a collection of figurines on a table.  Working around her arm crutches, Nell makes a frozen pond surface that she carefully tints by airbrushing different teas onto it.  A snag happens when the hospital's Public Information officer becomes worried about having the institution associated with the contest, after the controversial nature of some previous entries.  If the hospital pulls its approval, Jane won't get paid for any of the time she spent with the children working on the project.  Jane gets some PR advice from Daria, who worked for Helen's firm's PR office between tenth and eleventh grade.  At the meeting, Jane explains how the controversy has fallen off as more students seriously look at the contest as a springboard to get their art noticed, and also produces letters from the children's parents supporting the project.  After, Bel tells Jane that this is part of a personal dispute between her and the PI office that resulted from some bad choices Bel made a couple years earlier.  The approval goes through and Jane completes the project.  Mack makes a surprise appearance to support Jane and they tell Daria what happened after New Year's.  Neither Jane nor Nell win any prizes, but Jane does get some local press coverage for the children's participation.
