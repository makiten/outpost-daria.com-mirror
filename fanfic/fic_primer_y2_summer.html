<br>
<br><i>Registering Annoyance</i>
<br>With spring term over, Karen prepares to head back to Georgia.  Erin stops by to say goodbye and update Daria on Rita's new job and Grandma Tess's attempt to sell the old guest house to pay off debts.  Jane tells them that she's adding an Art Education minor to her studies and will take extra summer classes.  In the mail, Daria discovers a statement from Raft that she's not registered for summer, despite her registering online months before.  She spends most of the morning applying to reactivate her registration, but not before she accidentally gets a strange blond man's attention while stretching her back, stiff from waiting.  Daria manages to get her work schedule fit in around her planned class schedule, but not in the way she'd hoped.  After Daria complains about the unwanted attention to her, Jane shows Daria how "attention getting" her back stretching was.  The next day, she discovers she can't register because of a financial hold on her account.  Financial Services tells her it is a $1 library fine that has to be paid at the library.  The Library says she doesn't have a fine and gives her a printed form saying as much.  However, she has to go to work and doesn't have time to drop off the form with Financial Services.  While eating lunch, she has another encounter with the blond man that also goes badly.  The next morning, Financial Services accept the form, but they blame the error on the library for sending them inaccurate information.  Daria applies to reregister before going to work.  That night, Trent and Mystic Spiral arrive for a gig in the area, after having slept all day while Lindy drove them.  At the club, they discover a scout for a recording label is in the audience, but are disappointed when the scout makes no effort to see them after the show.  The next morning, Lindy and Daria talk about Trent's disappointment and Lindy's upcoming wedding to him.  Later, after tracking down additional override signatures to get into her classes, Daria successfully gets them.  However, on the following Monday, she gets a notice for a $1 library fine.

When Sandi is reluctant because of her looks, Quinn shows photos and tells about Fran, and her struggles to keep her weight up.

Going to bed, Sandi reminds herself that she's no longer alone, while hugging a stuffed cat similar to her cat Fluffy, still at the Griffin house.
