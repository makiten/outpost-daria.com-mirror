"FLUNKED" by Trent2 (deprater@thegrid.net)


SCENE ONE: Classroom

MR. O'NEILL: Now, class.  This test is the one that will decide what college
you might go to.  You might think that it's your SAT but it's not.  It's a new
test that the government makes you take.  It's called the PQRSAT.

JANE: I heard about this on "Sick Sad World".  It's part of a code.  The P is
S.  The Q is T.  The R is U.  The S is P.  The A is I.  And, the T is D.  It's
really called the stupid test.

DARIA: Oh.  Maybe Kevin and Brittany will actually pass a test.

JANE: Oh yeah.

QUINN: I'm goin' out with Joey and Jeffy tonight and Jamie tomorrow night.

STACEY: You're so amazing Quinn.

QUINN: I know.  I'm so smart also.

(Mr. O'Neill passes out test)

DARIA: This test looks pretty easy.

JANE: I know.  Hey, what'd you get for question 19?

DARIA: Macho Man Randy Savage.

JANE: No seriously.

DARIA: I am serious.

JANE: You're kidding me?

DARIA: No.

JANE: Oh brother.  You've lost you're touch.

DARIA: Well, the question is what advertiser of a crispy meat stick product
used to be a wrestler in the WWF but now he moved to WCW?

JANE: Yeah.

DARIA: Yeah.

JANE: Macho Man Randy Savage advertises Slim Jim.  Hulk Hogan advertises
crispy meat stick product.

DARIA: I'm sticking with my answer.

JANE: Fine.


SCENE TWO: Morgendorfer Dining Room

MOM: Daria, we got a letter from your teacher today.  He said that you flunked
your PQRSAT test and if you don't pass your next test, you'll get an F for the
semester and we don't want that to happen now do we.

DARIA: You mean I passed the stupid test?

MOM: Excuse me?

DARIA: The stupid test.

MOM: No.  The PQRSAT test.

DARIA: I know.  The P is S.  The Q is T.  The R is U.  The S is P.  The A is
I.  The T is D.

DAD: Where'd you here that?

DARIA: "Sick Sad World".

MOM: Figures.

QUINN: Cuckoo, cuckoo.

DARIA: Shut up.

MOM: I'm worried.  I think we should get you a tutor.

DARIA: I am a tutor.

MOM: Oh yeah.  I mean, a tutor for you.

DARIA: I'm the only tutor in the state.

MOM: Oh shoot.


SCENE THREE: Classroom

MOM: So what do you think we should do about Daria, Mr. O'Neill?

MR. O'NEILL: Well, I know someone that really needs a job.

MOM: Oh.  Who?

MR. O'NEILL: Well.  You might know him.

MOM: Him?

MR. O'NEILL:  Yes.  Me.

MOM: Oh boy.

MR. O'NEILL: Yes.  Me.

MOM: Okay.

DARIA: What do you mean okay?

MOM: Okay.

DARIA: Fine.

QUINN: Ha ha!

MOM: Could you tutor Quinn also?

MR. O'NEILL: Sure.

QUINN: What!?!  That's not fair.

MOM: Yes it is.

MR. O'NEILL: Great.

(Daria smiles)


SCENE FOUR: Morgendorfer Living Room

DAD: Can you pass the salt?

MOM: No.

DAD: Oh.

MOM: Daria and Quinn, did you fire that tutor?

DARIA: Yes.

QUINN: Yes.

MOM: Why?

DAD: Pass the salt please.

DARIA: Because we hate him.

QUINN: Yeah.  And he drives a pinto.

MOM: So.

DARIA: Whatever.  I got my report card today.

MOM: Oh boy.  What was your grade?

DARIA: A+.

MOM: Really?

DARIA: Yes.

QUINN: I got a D-.

DARIA: Wow.  You're a sick sad freak.

MOM: Let me guess.  The tutor tought you everything you needed to know before
you fired him.  Right?

DARIA: No.  It was a stupid test.  I was just acting stupid.  I might even go
to UUSLC.

MOM: What's that?

DARIA: University of Utah Salt Lake City.

DAD: 10,000,000 dollars!

MOM: No!
