Food fight


by Jane (hello_kitty_28@yahoo.com)

(Cut to Daria and Jane at Jane's locker.) 

DARIA: Hurry up Jane! We will be late for the English
class! You don't wanna miss it, don't you?

JANE: Of course not! I always like to hear Brittany
and Kevie stupidest comments! 

(They walk to their class. Mr. O'Neil talks in the
front of the class. Brittany and Kevin are laughing
together. Upchuck is flirting
and is watching some girls pictures in his agenda.
Mack and Jodie are talking about a homework they have
to do together. Jane is
drawing Mr. O'Neil as a little ship lost in a field.
Daria does sarcastic remarks as usual with her
classmate Andrea.)

(Cut to outside where Jane and Daria are sits on the
ground.)

JANE: I'm so bored Daria. There's nothing unusual that
happens around here. It's like, always the same.

DARIA: Yeah... I feel the same you know... This school is
like Hell to me!

(Cut to the cafeteria at noon. Everybody's having
lunch. Quinn is sit with the fashion club. The 3 J's
are sit with them. They
started to ask Quinn to go out with them again.
Sandy's dream boy comes and asks Quinn to go out with
him. She glances at him
and answer (-take a guess! -) Yes... Sandy becomes very
mad. She takes her pudding and throws it at Quinn's
face. The 3 J's
take their Jell-O and throw it to Sandy's face and
clothes. Kevin, who was thinking that was funny,
started throwing food
everywhere. Jane and Daria finish eating then run to
get out the cafeteria. They start walking and the
hall. Jane has a crashed
banana in her back, pudding in her hair and peanut
butter all over her pants. Daria has pudding and
Jell-O all over her jacket and in
her hair and peanut butter on her legs. They go to
their afternoon class.)

(Cut to later this afternoon, after school, in the
hall.)

JANE: Hey... Got a phone call to do... Come on Daria.
(Picks up a phone and dials)

(Cut to see Jane and Trent on the phone.)

TRENT: Hello?

JANE: Yo Trent!

TRENT: Oh... hey Janey... What do you want? You're not
supposed to be walking home?

JANE: Can you come take us at school and drive us
home? We can't really show off right now!

TRENT: Why?

JANE: You'll see Trent!

TRENT: 'Kay... I'm on my way...

JANE: Thanks!

(Jane hangs up the phone. She and Daria walk to go in
the front of the school, waiting for Trent. Trent
stops his car and stares at
the girls.)

TRENT: What's happened to you?

JANE: Oh! Only a little food fight that involved all
the school except us... but we were in the cafeteria so...
we've been
touched... We're lucky it was only food!

TRENT: Oh... Hey... in the back of the car girls... you
don't want to clean the front of the car tonight? (He
laugh a little) Are
you coming over our house Daria? Maybe you could eat
at our house or something!

DARIA: I'll think about it...

TRENT: I need to know it now... Daria?

JANE: Please... Daria... We'll have fun...

DARIA: Okay...

(Trent starts the car and drive home. He stops the car
in front of the Lane's house. They all got off the
car.)

(Cut to see Jane who runs to the bathroom.)

TRENT: Damn it Jane... You could let the bathroom to our
guest first...

DARIA: No...it's okay... I will wait... I don't have clothes
to change anyway...

TRENT: Wait... JANEY... MIND IF I TAKE SOME CLOTHES IN
YOUR CLOSET FOR DARIA?

JANE: NO!

TRENT: THANKS...

JANE: NO PROBLEM... NOW LEAVE ME ALONE...

DARIA: (whispering) nice...

TRENT: (laughing softly) Don't worry... It's always like
this between Janey and me!

(Trent pulls Daria in Jane's room. He opens the closet
and stares. He takes a black v-neck T-shirt and black
jeans and hands it to
Daria. Jane comes out the bathroom. The phone rings...)

JANE: Got it... Yo...? Hey Jesse... Yeah...

(Trent and Daria go to the bathroom. He starts the
shower for her, hands her shampoo and a towel.)

DARIA: Thanks...Trent...

TRENT: You're welcomed! (He smiles)

(Trent let Daria take a shower ALONE! She comes out 10
minutes later. Jane and Jesse are kissing on the
couch.)

DARIA: Hey Jesse!

JESSE: (between kisses) Hey!

(Trent is asleep on the other couch. Daria sits next
to him. Trent takes more space than when she sat down
and starts moving
closer and closer to Daria...)

TRENT: (talking in his dream out loud) Daria... DA...RIA...
JANEY... DON'T WATCH US... JESSE SHUT UP MAN...

(Daria wake Trent up)

TRENT: Mom no... I didn't rape he... Oh... (Looking
embarrassed) Oh... Hey... Daria!

(Cut an hour later... (-I had to make it finish well -)
Jane and Jesse are sleeping)

TRENT: Daria?

DARIA: Huh?

(Trent put his hand on the back of Daria's head, pulls
her closer and kisses her.)

The end...(or is it?)
