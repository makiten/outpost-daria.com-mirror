<P><B>Synopsis:</B> On a rainy night in Lawndale, two people connect. Old
scores are settled, worries discussed and resolved, and an announcement
made.</P>

<P>Gentle reader, this is a chapter in a series. It will make much more
sense if you read what has gone before, starting with &quot;My Afternoon
at Tom's&quot;. If you haven't the time or the inclination to read the
whole series, you'll find <I>Bird on the Wire</I>, <I>Quinntessence Parts
1 and 2</I>, and <I>Tie Died, My Darling</I> worthwhile background to the
events that follow.</P>

<P>&quot;Mom?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Come in, Sweetie.&quot;</P>

<P>Rain squalls lashed the bedroom window. The light from the lamp on Helen's
nightstand cast soft shadows on the wall behind Quinn as she slowly walked
into the bedroom and sat down on the bed beside her mother. Helen put down
the brief she was reading and, looking over her glasses, smiled gently
at her younger daughter.</P>

<P>&quot;I've been talking to Daria.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh.&quot; Helen's face took on a shade so slightly different that
only the trained eye of a Fashion Club member would have detected it. &quot;I
thought you might have been.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn looked away, her voice soft. &quot;She was pretty. What was she
like?&quot;</P>

<P>Helen took off her reading glasses, looked up at the ceiling and sighed.
The corners of her mouth curved up in the hint of a smile. &quot;Infuriating.
Thoughtful sometimes--she gave me the book of sonnets you like so much.
Very intense, very passionate, very possessive.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Were you in love with her?&quot;</P>

<P>Helen looked back towards Quinn, who was still not meeting her eyes.
&quot;Perhaps. I think she was in love with me, but I don't really know
if I was in love with her.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn turned and looked directly at her mother. &quot;If you don't know,
then you weren't.&quot;</P>

<P>Helen's heart missed a beat. There was more in what Quinn had told her
than all that had passed between them in years. She resisted the urge to
clutch her daughter to her, knowing that this had to move at Quinn's pace.
It would happen if it happened. &quot;You may be right.&quot;<I> </I>A
gust of cold wind rattled the windowpane.</P>

<P>&quot;Why did you let Daria tell me?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Because she wanted to.&quot; Helen returned Quinn's gaze. &quot;I
was going to tell you myself, but something she said made me realise that
it was just as appropriate for her to tell you.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What? What did she say?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That she thinks of you as a friend. A good friend.&quot; She waited,
watching the conflicting emotions cross Quinn's face.</P>

<P>&quot;I know.&quot; She smiled. &quot;I was just as surprised as you.
After all the animosity that you two have had for each other I thought
that any opportunity to cement that friendship would be worth it.&quot;
She reached out for Quinn's hand and took it gently in hers. &quot;It means
a lot to me to see you two getting close after so long.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It means a lot to me too. I guess I feel different about a lot
of things these days.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;How do you feel about...you know, me, Eric...?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;At first it was strange. I felt...as if...as if none of this had
happened, as if I should be shocked.&quot; She paused. &quot;I thought
that I should be reacting how I would have reacted before, before I realised
that I like girls. But I didn't.&quot; Looking straight at Helen, she said
&quot;All of a sudden I realised...&quot; She paused again.</P>

<P>&quot;What?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn turned towards at the rain-spattered window as a fresh gust blasted
its burden load of fat raindrops against it. She spoke quietly. &quot;It
had all just been a game up until that day...that...I mean I'd never felt
anything, you know, like...&quot; She looked down. &quot;I'm not expressing
this very well am I?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You're doing fine, honey.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;All the feelings were new. I wondered whether all that...stuff...that
I&nbsp;did, all the cuteness, the dating, the...bravado I guess you'd call
it...was just a cover-up--something I did to block out the way I really
felt.&quot; </P>

<P>She absentmindedly let go of Helen's hand, picked up the glass of water
from the nightstand and gazed into it, holding it between her hands as
if it was a crystal ball, able to tell her of hidden things, secrets. But
it was just a glass of water. She stared into it anyway. &quot;If that
was what it was, then what was the real me? What if what I'd <I>thought</I>
was me was just an act, just something I did to hide the real me? What
if there wasn't any 'real' me? I was so scared.&quot; </P>

<P>Helen thought back to the start of her relationship with Erica. It had
all been so easy then. There hadn't been any of this; no uncertainty, no
concern. Different times, different people. She hadn't ever, in her wildest
dreams, imagined this.</P>

<P>Quinn continued. &quot;But that didn't stop me. Daria stopped me. Did
she tell you that she threatened to rip my lungs out if I ever told Jane
how I felt?&quot; The ghost of a smile. She could smile about it now. But
not then.</P>

<P><I>That makes sense,</I> Helen thought, but she played the question.
&quot;No.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Have you ever seen Daria really angry?&quot;</P>

<P>Helen shook her head gently, not wanting to interrupt.</P>

<P>&quot;She scared me more than I scared myself, but the silly thing is
that, in a way, I was grateful. See? She'd given me an excuse to bury it,
to let me be the old me again. The feelings didn't go away, but they stayed
covered up and I could go back to being comfortable for while. Then that
night, when Daria brought Jane home, Daria told me I could tell Jane how
I felt, it all came to the surface again.&quot; Her voice, which had been
getting quieter, was almost a whisper now. &quot;But I knew I had to find
out. I had to take the chance.&quot;</P>

<P>She turned to face her mother.</P>

<P>&quot;Mom, you know I was grateful that you'd accepted it--me and Jane
I mean, but I still felt...that, despite all you said, you really disapproved.
I felt...guilty, as if it was something that shouldn't have happened, as
if there was something wrong with it. But now I know for certain that you
don't feel like that. I feel--I don't know--as if it's all suddenly...alright.
I still don't really know who I am, but I'm starting to understand who
I'm not, and that's a good start, isn't it?&quot;</P>

<P>They looked at each other, silently. Walls fell, barriers tumbled. For
the second time in a week, a mother and daughter who had known, but not
known, each other for too long, fell together and hugged with desperate
affection. The rain fell.</P>

<P>
<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="75%"></P>

<P>Cranberry Commons was crowded with afternoon shoppers; fish swimming
in the bright neon timelessness of an artificial ocean, lured unquestioning
into the gaping maw of the marketplace.</P>

<P>Among the shoals swam four who saw themselves more predator than prey,
at home in their natural habitat. Far from being predators they were, in
reality, the sweetest morsels on the menu. The Lawndale High School Fashion
Club was hunting and, in nature's eternal tradition, the hunter was about
the become the hunted.</P>

<P>One of them stopped, mesmerised by windowed bait.</P>

<P>&quot;Er, guys, you go on. I just remembered that I have to pick up
something. I'll catch up to you,&quot; eyes fixed on the shiny lure.</P>

<P>The lead remora turned. &quot;Gee Quinn, you wouldn't be thinking of
making any selections without the benefit of <I>our</I> advice, would you?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh Sandi, you <I>know</I> I wouldn't choose anything for myself
without your help. It's just something I promised I'd pick up for my Mom.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But Quinn, this store only caters for younger people. No-one of
Helen's advanced years and fuller figure would find possibly find anything
suitable in here.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeeeaaaah. Advanced years.&quot; said the third.</P>

<P>A fishy smile. &quot;Uh, well, okay. It's actually something for my
sister, but she made me promise that I wouldn't tell.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Wow Quinn--you mean Daria's actually taking your advice and getting
something fashionable?&quot; bubbled the fourth.</P>

<P>&quot;Yes Quinn--perhaps we should arrange a makeover for your cous...I
mean your sister. I mean with her being away at college and all, she'll
need all the help she can get.&quot; the head remora offered.</P>

<P>&quot;Heh, well, you know, what with college and everything, I suppose
she felt that she needed something new.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Alright then Quinn. If you say so. We'll see you at 'Fashions
is We'. Don't be long.&quot;</P>

<P>They rejoined the school, leaving the red, pink and blue one to dart
off alone, defenceless.</P>

<P>
<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="75%"></P>

<P>Jane opened the door. Quinn held out a shopping bag with <I>Cashmans
-- Life's a Beach</I> in bright red lettering.</P>

<P>Quinn silently held out the bag, a smile of delight on her face.</P>

<P>A gift? She and Trent always exchanged something on their birthdays,
though they tended to be practical things like paintbrushes and guitar
strings. The Lanes were hardly ever together at Christmas so exchanging
gifts just wasn't one of those things they did. It was no big deal, she
didn't miss it. But all of a sudden, the thought of someone--this someone
in particular--actually buying her a present was quite moving. And quite
exciting.</P>

<P>&quot;A present? For me?&quot; She looked puzzled, uncertain that she
understood.</P>

<P>Quinn nodded, smiling at Jane's surprise.</P>

<P>Jane looked down at the bag, then back to Quinn. &quot;We've never really
'done' presents. Well, Trent and I usually give each other birthday presents,
you know, guitar strings, paintbrushes. And there's never anyone here at
Christmas.&quot; Her voice was becoming distant, but then she grinned,
took Quinn's hand and led her, bounding, up the stairs. She hadn't felt
like this since was a little kid. Images of a long-ago Christmas flashed
fleetingly across her mind's eye.</P>

<P>Quinn pulled a wrapped box out of the bag. It was about a foot square
and three inches high, store-wrapped with a blue ribbon and a small blue
bow on the corner. She handed it to Jane, who took it and stood, looking
at it, as if she wasn't quite sure what to do with it.</P>

<P>&quot;Well...&quot; said Quinn, smirking, &quot;...are you going to
open it or stare at it.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane's attention snapped back to Quinn. She grinned, a little sheepishly.
&quot;Oh, yeah.&quot;</P>

<P>Slipping the ribbon off, she carefully removed the wrapping paper, uncovering
a foil-coated box, pale gold with diagonal silver stripes, quite elegant
in a commercial sort of way. She slowly removed the lid to reveal a layer
of blue tissue paper. Rather than just peel back the tissue paper she hesitated,
and turned to look at Quinn to see a delightful, eager expression. <I>She's
enjoying this more than I am,</I> Jane realised. &quot;Nah.&quot; she teased.
&quot;I think I'll leave it for later&quot;.</P>

<P>Quinn couldn't stand it any longer. &quot;Ooh--damn you. Here--give
it to me!&quot; She took the box and opened the tissue paper leaves. </P>

<P>There in the box was the skimpiest, bluest bikini that Jane had ever
seen. She lifted the bikini top and held it up at arm's length by one of
its ties, staring in surprise. She put the box down on the bed in a daze
and lifted out the bikini bottom. It was nothing much more than a couple
of small triangles of fabric with strings at the corners, not too dissimilar
from the top. She turned to Quinn, a rueful smile on her reddening face.
&quot;You actually expect me to wear this?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No, I bought it for you to wipe the floor with! Here--let me see.&quot;
She picked up the bikini top and held it up next to Jane's face. &quot;Perfect.
Look.&quot; She pushed Jane over to the mirror. It was exactly the colour
of her eyes. &quot;Well go on, put it on!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Not while you're watching. Wait outside.&quot; She half-pushed
a giggling Quinn out the door and closed it behind her. Once Quinn was
outside Jane was able to reflect that she was astounded. She looked at
the bikini. Not in a billion years would she have ever considered wearing
anything like this. She shook her head in bewilderment as she slipped out
of her clothes.</P>

<P>&quot;Can I come in yet?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No. Stay there. I'll tell you when you can come in.&quot; </P>

<P>She put the bottom on first, tying it tight in a vain attempt to make
it cover more than it was designed to. She looked in the mirror. <I>Uh-oh</I>.
No matter how she tried, some stray black hair poked out around the edges.
She shrugged and put on the top, which tied in a single bow behind her
back. It took a bit of fumbling before she got it right. For the first
time Jane was grateful that she had small boobs--a size bigger and this
wouldn't have...she caught sight of herself in the mirror and was transfixed.</P>

<P>There was a knock on the door. &quot;Jane--what are you doing in there?&quot;</P>

<P>The spell was partly broken. &quot;Yo,&quot; she muttered. &quot;You
can come in.&quot;</P>

<P>The door opened. Quinn stood there, eyes wide, mouth open.</P>

<P>Jane turned slowly, staring at herself in the mirror, lean, athletic
body, long legs, taut stomach, set off by a bikini that reflected perfectly
the cobalt of her eyes and contrasted magnificently with the jet black
of her hair. She could have been a picture out of Waif's swimwear layout.
How could so little fabric look so good?</P>

<P>Quinn slowly walked into the room, blindly closing the door behind her,
her gaze fixed intently on Jane. She'd known that Jane would look good.
Why not? She had exquisite and finely-honed taste, didn't she? But this...</P>

<P>&quot;Well? Aren't you going to say anything?&quot; Jane turned, smiling,
to see an unfamiliar, intense expression on Quinn's face. </P>

<P>&quot;Take it off.&quot; Almost a whisper.</P>

<P>&quot;What? But I've only just put it on...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Take...it...off.&quot;</P>

<P>Looking at the red glow extending up Quinn's face, Jane smiled as she
understood that this was no time to argue the point. She shrugged, reached
up behind her back and pulled the string that undid the bow. &quot;Chicks!&quot;
she muttered.</P>

<P>
<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="75%"></P>

<P>The Pizza king was unusually crowded for a Friday afternoon, but the
usual chatter seemed muted. Perhaps there was a sense of foreboding on
the part of the Lawndale High graduating class. Little time was left to
while away the afternoons over a slice of pizza with familiar faces. Soon,
for most, college would suck away the last glittering remnants of childhood,
replacing them with the far brighter glitter of young adulthood. Whatever.
They'd be scattered. Some were speculating about college, perhaps hiding
nervousness behind details of courses first choices, rumours of college
life, new freedoms, new experiences. </P>

<P>Others were more muted.</P>

<P>&quot;So are you going to tell me what's wrong or am I going to have
to beat it out of you?&quot;</P>

<P>Jane held a slice of pepperoni pizza up to the fluorescent light. &quot;You
know, they say the streets of Heaven are paved with gold. Personally I
think that it's just a trick of the light. See? If you hold it just right,
the way the light glistens off the grease? Just like gold. With all those
shafts of sunlight streaming down through the clouds you could be forgiven
for jumping to conclusions.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No, left over pepperoni pizza goes to Hell--the angels kept complaining
about having to wash the grease out of their wings. The streets of Heaven
are paved with Cashmans boxes, or so I'm told, and you should know. It
sounds as if you were transported there for a little while. And stop prevaricating.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane smiled sadly. &quot;It was so sweet, Daria. Do you know how long
it's been since someone gave me anything?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I gave you a loan of my pen in English the other day.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And I appreciated it. But it's not quite the same thing.&quot;
Jane took a small bite and chewed absentmindedly.</P>

<P>Daria persisted. &quot;Hey--just because I didn't make you get naked
immediately afterwards doesn't cheapen the gesture. It's the thought that
counts.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The loan of a pen only gets you a brief glimpse of left boob.
What do you think I am--a whore?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;We've already established that. I'm just trying to negotiate a
price.&quot;</P>

<P>A voice from beside them broke the flow. &quot;The prices are lower
in the next booth, or so they tell me.&quot; Mack flicked a glance toward
Kevin and Brittany. Kevin, as usual, had straws stuffed up his nose.</P>

<P>Daria turned and sighed. &quot;Have a seat, Mack&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane grinned at him &quot;Nah - we needed to be interrupted. So tell
me, big guy, do you think Daria's a lesbian?&quot;</P>

<P>Daria blushed, despite that fact that she saw through Jane's ploy like
plate glass.</P>

<P>Mack slid into the booth next to Daria and shrugged &quot;A lesbian?
Sure. If you like. Why?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Told you.&quot; Jane smirked at Daria.</P>

<P>&quot;So who's going to break the news to Tom, particularly since I
just got this?&quot; Daria deadpanned. She put a hand in her pocked and
tossed a piece of paper onto the table.</P>

<P>Jane picked it up and unfolded it. Her eyebrows told the story. &quot;Wow.
Microgynon.&quot; Seeing Mack's incomprehension she said &quot;It's a prescription
for contraceptive pills.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh--yeah. Hey, I think that's Jodie's brand. Oh damn! Forget that
I ever said that!&quot; He looked pleadingly at Daria and Jodie.</P>

<P>&quot;Said what? But I'm serious, Mack. Did you ever think that Daria
and I were, well, you know...&quot; She made kissy kissy faces at Daria.</P>

<P>&quot;You're serious, aren't you?&quot; he said, clearly surprised.</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah. Sure.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, there was some talk around the locker room, but no-one ever
claimed to be sure. You know--locker room conjecture. Believe me, you don't
want to know about some of the stuff that gets talked about in there. Anyway,
once Daria started dating Tom it all went out the window.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But I dated Tom before Daria did, and I'd been dating other guys
before that.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I didn't say it was logical--we're talking locker room here.&quot;
Mack stopped himself and suddenly turned to Jane. &quot;And you didn't
ask me whether people thought <I>you</I> were a lesbian--you asked me about
Daria.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What's this about you and lesbians, Michael Jordan McKenzie?&quot;
</P>

<P>Daria threw Jane an unspoken &quot;saved in the nick of time&quot; look.</P>

<P>Mack looked up to see his girlfriend standing beside him. &quot;Jodie!
Um, Jane was just asking me if Daria was a lesbian.&quot;</P>

<P>Jodie spoke to Mack, but she looked at Jane. &quot;And how would <I>you</I>
know, pray tell?&quot;</P>

<P>Jane smirked. &quot;Relax, Jodie. It was just a ploy to get Mack to
stop bugging Daria for a date.&quot;</P>

<P>Mack blushed, which, considering his colouring, was no mean feat. &quot;Well,
it's been nice chatting to you ladies, but we have to go now, wouldn't
want to keep the President waiting.&quot; He stood, grabbing Jodie by the
arm and dragging her away. As they walked out they heard Jodie ask &quot;Have
you <I>really </I>been pestering Daria for a date?&quot;</P>

<P>Daria turned from watching them go. &quot;Has anyone ever told you have
a mean streak, Lane?&quot; She retrieved her prescription from the table
and stuffed it back her pocket.</P>

<P>&quot;You. Constantly. That's why you like me.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Of course. Now, to take up where we were before we were so rudely
interrupted, what the hell is the matter?&quot;</P>

<P>Jane slumped. &quot;We sort of, uh, had a little fight.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Aw, a lovers' tiff,&quot; she smirked. &quot;What about?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;She wants to rip my pubic hair out by the roots.&quot;</P>

<P>Daria looked at Jane and, for a rare, fleeting instant, laughed out
loud.</P>

<P>&quot;What are you laughing at, Morgendorffer? Like anyone's ever threatened
to rip out <I>your</I> pubes!&quot;</P>

<P>Daria blushed. &quot;Um, actually, they have. More than threatened.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You're kidding? This is some kind of weird pain thing that you
and Tom are into, isn't it? Because if it is, I don't want to hear about
it!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Actually, it was Quinn.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Quinn?&quot; Jane stared, her face blank.</P>

<P>Daria smiled. &quot;I still can't believe she talked me into it, but
she actually managed to convince me to let her do a wax job on me.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Did it hurt?&quot; Jane breathed.</P>

<P>&quot;Like hell. You can imagine how much she enjoyed it.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane looked distant, her face flushed.</P>

<P>&quot;Jane?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, sorry. I was just...thinking. Look, Daria, I've gotta go.
I wanted to get some painting done. If I'm going to be alone tonight I
might as well use the time profitably, okay?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Er, sure, okay. But I thought we might spend some time together,
you know, like we did back in the good old days. Watch a little TV, eat
a little ice cream, torture a little animal.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane's thoughts were distracting her, but she couldn't help smiling.
&quot;Yeah, that'd be fun Amiga. But not tonight, okay?&quot; She got up
to leave.</P>

<P><I>What the Hell was that all about? </I>Daria thought. She was disappointed,
but Jane clearly needed some time. &quot;Okay, see you then.&quot; She
said, watching her friend walk away, wondering if there was anything she
should be doing, anything she'd missed. A tiny shiver ran up her spine.
The last time she'd seen jane like this she almost hadn't seen her again.
Ever. She leapt up and ran out of the Pizza King after her friend who was
disappearing around a corner.</P>

<P>She caught up to Jane and grabbed her by the shoulder. Jane started
and spun round.</P>

<P>&quot;Dammit Daria--don't scare me like that!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Sorry, but I wasn't going to let you go in that...mood. Are you
okay?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Sure. I'm fine. I just want some time alone, that's all.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Crap. The last time I saw you in a mood like this <I>I</I>&nbsp;nearly
spent the rest of my life alone. I'm not going to let it happen again.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane looked at her friend and felt a rush of emotion. She took Daria's
hand and squeezed, smiling at her. &quot;Thanks Daria. I really appreciate
that. But honestly--I'm fine. I'm not depressed. I just need to think,
that's all. You have to admit that a lot's been going on and I guess I
just have some things to work through. But I promise--no rash moves. Okay?.
Call me later if you want to.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, okay. If you're sure.&quot; Her voice betrayed her uncertainty.</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, I'm sure, really.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Is there anything you'd like me to tell Quinn?&quot;</P>

<P>Jane sighed. &quot;Yeah. Thanks.&quot; She whispered into Daria's ear.</P>

<P>
<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="75%"></P>

<P>Jane set up her easel and started painting. But it wasn't working. She
couldn't paint her way out of this corner. She cleaned her brushes and
palette, put them away and lay back on the bed. She thought about Quinn
and a tight knot made its presence felt in her stomach. <I>Well, if that's
not love then all the songs are wrong. Dammit. What am I talking about?
I know exactly how I feel about Quinn.</I></P>

<P><I>But what the hell happened back there? </I></P>

<P>She went back over Daria's words. The pictures appeared in her mind
again, Daria laying on her bed, a towel under her, naked from the waist
down, legs apart, Quinn applying the hot wax in strips, letting it cool,
ripping it off, Daria's stifled yells of pain, goosebumps where the hair
had been torn out. Daria in the shower after gym, soft where Jane was angular,
water dripping off a small, pale nipple...</P>

<P>She suddenly noticed that her hand had involuntarily strayed.</P>

<P><I>Oh shit.</I></P>

<P>
<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="75%"></P>

<P>&quot;Hello?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hi Elsie, It's Jane. Is Tom there?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Jane? Sure. Hang on.&quot; <I>Jane?</I> She walked to the foot
of the stairs and called out. &quot;Tom. Phone. It's Jane.&quot;</P>

<P>The surprise in Tom's voice wasn't attenuated by either distance or
soft furnishings. &quot;Jane? Jane Lane?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes, that Jane.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Okay, I've got it.&quot; He picked up the phone. &quot;Jane?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;One and the same. How are you, ex-boyfriend? This is just like
old times, eh?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Jane--what's up--is it Daria? Is something wrong?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Don't panic. I just wanted to talk, that's all.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Talk?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Very good, now let's try to string <I>two</I> words together.&quot;</P>

<P>Tom smiled. <I>Same old Jane</I>. &quot;What do you want to talk about?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Stuff. But not over the phone. Can I come round?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You want to come here?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Excellent. That was five words, though one of them was only a
teeny widdle one.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, I don't see why not. Sure, come on round. Or would you like
me to pick you up?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No. I'll get Trent to drive me. I don't want anyone to see us
together.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You're <I>that</I> ashamed to be seen with me? Should I wear a
paper bag over my head?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hey--good idea. Have the paper bag ready, I'm on my way. Oh, make
sure you tear a couple of holes to see through and one to breath through.&quot;</P>

<P>Tom hung up. He smiled again. <I>What the hell?</I> he thought.</P>

<P>She trudged reluctantly to Trent's room, trying not to think too hard
about whether what she was doing was wise or just plain stupid. It had
seemed like a good idea at the time. <I>Hadn't it? </I>Ah, good old reliable
Trent. Comatose as usual.</P>

<P>&quot;Trent. Wake up.&quot;</P>

<P>Trent grunted and reluctantly opened an eye. &quot;Janie?&quot; What's
up?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I want you to drive me to Tom's.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Tom's? You mean Tom? Tom Sloane Tom?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I'm not sure that he pronounces it exactly like that, but yeah,
I think we're talking about the same person.&quot;</P>

<P>Trent looked more than ordinarily confused. &quot;But, um didn't, I
mean isn't, weren't you...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Didn't I break up with Tom? And isn't Daria dating him now? And
weren't Daria's sister Quinn and I playing doctors and nurses? No, you
must have been dreaming. Nothing like that ever happened. Tom and I are
still a happy couple.&quot;</P>

<P>Trent looked even more confused. &quot;Oh wow. Heavy!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Now come, you've been asleep for many years, Rip van Lane, and
we must leave the hills and venture into the town.&quot;</P>

<P>
<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="75%"></P>

<P>Tom opened the door. &quot;Well, this is an unexpected pleasure.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Maybe, maybe not.&quot; She looked around, &quot;Who's at home?&quot;</P>

<P>He stared at her quizzically. &quot;Only Elsie. If you want to talk
privately we could go into the library, or...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Your room'll do.&quot; Jane walked in and headed straight for
the familiar mahogany staircase. Tom followed, trying hard to keep up.</P>

<P>Without waiting for an invitation Jane sat on the bed. Tom brought a
chair round to face her and sat down. &quot;What's going on, Jane? You
said there was nothing wrong with Daria but I get the distinct impression
that this isn't just a social visit.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Relax. There's nothing wrong with Daria.&quot; She looked straight
at him, sheepish, uncertain. &quot;I had to talk to someone and you're
the only person who might...understand. Does that give you some idea of
how desperate I am?&quot; She shook her head violently and stood up. &quot;Damn.
This isn't going to work. Sorry. I shouldn't have come.&quot; She stood
and walked toward the door but Tom stood and held her gently by the arm,
turning her to face him. &quot;Jane, please. Don't go. You don't have to
talk if you don't want to, but don't go. Should I call Daria? Or Quinn?&quot;</P>

<P>Panic crossed Jane's face. &quot;No!&quot; A pause, then, quietly, &quot;No...&quot;
She slumped as if the weight of the inevitable had settled on her and shuffled
slowly back over to the bed and sat down again, head bowed.</P>

<P>&quot;It's Daria.&quot;</P>

<P>Tom stood up. &quot;What's wrong with her, Jane?&quot;</P>

<P>She looked up at him. &quot;Sit down. Daria's fine. I meant it's not
Daria, it's me, but it's about Daria.&quot;</P>

<P>He sat uncomfortably on the edge of his chair, staring down at Jane.</P>

<P>&quot;This--thing, with Quinn. It all happened too suddenly. I mean
one minute I was happily straight, confident about who I was, and the next
I'm in bed with my best friend's sister. I haven't had any time to work
out what it means, how I feel about it. I mean I know how I feel about
it, but it's...it's complicated in ways I hadn't thought about.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You're not having second thoughts about Quinn?&quot;</P>

<P>She looked up at him and smiled sadly. &quot;No. Oh no. She's the best
thing that's ever happened to me. I can't believe how good it is, how good
she makes me feel.&quot; The smile disappeared. &quot;That's part of the
problem.&quot; She sighed. &quot;We had a little fight. Nothing serious,
it was silly.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Is that the problem?&nbsp;You want to know how to make up?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Stop jumping to conclusions. Daria told me how you make up. You
do it by being so damn nice she melts.&quot; The smile returned. &quot;No.
I know how to make up. The problem is...it's...damn, Tom, this is really
hard.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Would you like a cup of coffee?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, I would, but later. I've started now so it's probably better
not to interrupt it, I might not be able to start again. If you still feel
like offering afterwards I'll accept. The fight was about pubic hair. See,
she bought me this bikini, a really skimpy one, and it doesn't cover all
that it might. She said that she'd have to wax my pubes--you know, rip
them out.&quot;</P>

<P>Tom unconsciously crossed his legs.</P>

<P>&quot;I told her not to be ridiculous and she...well, you know how these
things escalate.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, I do.&quot; He grinned. &quot;You could always shave.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Not good enough. As far as Quinn's concerned the 'plucked chicken'
look just doesn't cut it. But that's not the point. See, I was talking
to Daria about it and she told me that Quinn had talked her into a wax
job.&quot;</P>

<P>Tom chuckled. &quot;She told me. I thought it was hilarious.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane hung her head. &quot;I didn't. I made an excuse and went home.
But I couldn't stop thinking about it. I started to think about Daria naked
and...I got...aroused.&quot; She blushed.</P>

<P>Slowly, comprehension dawned in Tom's face. He stood, speaking quietly
though his thoughts were racing. &quot;Is this some kind of revenge thing,
Jane? You've come here to tell me that you're going to try to steal Daria
from me--the same way she 'stole' me from you! Is that it? Is that what
this is about?&quot; </P>

<P>She looked up at him, a mixture of surprise and incomprehension on her
face. &quot;You're kidding?&quot;</P>

<P>His expression softened and he slowly sat down again. &quot;Oh. Damn.
Sorry Jane. I just...I guess I...well, I guess I never quite got over the
sense of guilt. I keep thinking that you still want to get back at me.&quot;</P>

<P>She laughed humourlessly. &quot;It would be ironic, wouldn't it? Poetic
justice. But I don't want to steal Daria from you. I told you how I feel
about Quinn. See, that's the problem. That's part of the problem anyway.
If I have these...feelings for Daria, does that mean that I'm being, you
know, unfaithful to Quinn? If I really do...love her, how could I have
those feelings for Daria?&quot;</P>

<P>Tom sat for a minute before answering. &quot;Um, Jane, I'm flattered
that you wanted to talk to me, really. But honestly, I'm not experienced
in this stuff. I mean you and Quinn are the only lesbians I've ever known.
I think. And apart from that, it's kind of hard for me to think about someone
else having feelings for Daria, even if it's you. I think you know what
I mean.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Uh, yeah, of course.&quot; She stood up again, but without urgency
this time. &quot;I'm sorry Tom. Come on, let's have that cup of coffee.&quot;</P>

<P>Tom sighed. &quot;No. Sit down, Jane. I'm the one who should be apologising
to you. You came to me for help and I'm just thinking of myself. I'll try,
really.&quot;</P>

<P>A little smile crossed her face. &quot;Daria's right. You really are
quite a guy, Thomas. Past activities notwithstanding.&quot; She sat down.</P>

<P>&quot;You know,&quot; he said, &quot;sometimes I think that I'm an outsider
in all this. There's something about your relationship with Daria that
goes way beyond anything that I'll ever have with her no matter how hard
I try. I'm envious and, right now, a little jealous and a lot threatened.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But that's the problem Tom. I don't want any kind of relationship
with Daria except the one I already have.&quot; Jane's voice had a rough
edge to it and her eyes glistened. &quot;I don't <I>want</I> to have these
feelings for her. I want us to be friends, just like we've always been.
I'm terrified of how she'd react if she knew, but I don't want to keep
it a secret from her. It's probably been hard enough for her to accept
this change anyway, and she's saved me more than once. I'm damned if I'm
going to let anything come between us.&quot; She swallowed, and continued
more quietly. &quot;And Quinn. I'd slit my throat with a palette knife
before I'd hurt Quinn.&quot;</P>

<P>Tom could see that she was holding herself together with a very tenuous
grip. &quot;Uh, Jane, that thing I said about not knowing any lesbians
except you and Quinn? That was really dumb. And insensitive. It doesn't
matter what your preferences are, it's what you feel that's important.
And I think I understand how you feel about this--I can put myself in your
shoes.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane looked surprised. &quot;You can?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Do you remember my friend Chris?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;How could I forget? I've still got the scars to prove it.&quot;</P>

<P>He grinned. &quot;Yeah, she's a bit like that. But you have to admit,
she's cool. She's a lot like Daria in some ways. I mean she's sexy.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh. Yeah. I guess. Blonde too.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Look, the guys I hang out with all think she's hot, but that's
not why we hang out with her. She's just one of the gang. But we wouldn't
be guys if we didn't fantasize a little now and then. You know, imagine
what she'd look like naked?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;How do you think Chris'd feel about that if she knew?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;If she knew? Don't you think she does know? How could a girl like
Chris hang around with a bunch of pathetic losers like us and not realise
that we were getting off on her every now and then? Of course if any of
us dared to suggest anything to her we'd crawl away bleeding and with our
voices several octaves higher--and that'd be before she'd even touched
us.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I can imagine. Tongue like a scalpel, that girl. But Daria...?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Do you mean do I feel like I'm cheating on Daria because I wonder
what Chris looks like naked? No. You think I wasn't serious when I asked
you and Quinn if I could watch?&quot; He was smiling, and Jane wasn't really
sure how to take it. &quot;I was only half joking. I don't know any guys
who wouldn't be turned on by the thought of watching you and Quinn...well,
you know.&quot; He unconsciously rubbed his shin where Daria had kicked
him. &quot;Daria knew that there was some truth in it. But I think she
knows that I'd never do anything about it. I feel the same way about Daria
as you do about Quinn. But just because you're on a diet doesn't mean that
you can't look at the menu.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane smiled at his simile.</P>

<P>&quot;I think it's normal to think these sorts of thoughts. As long
as that's all you're doing, I don't think there's any harm in it. I'd be
surprised if Daria didn't think about other guys from time to time, but
I'd only be hurt if it was more than just a fantasy. I think it's normal
to be--aroused--by someone who's attractive. It's just a physical thing.
But that's not the same as being in love with them.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane smiled and sniffed as she wiped the back of her hand across her
eyes. &quot;So...you think it's okay?&quot;</P>

<P>Tom chuckled. &quot;Do you see the irony in this? Me? Giving you advice
on relationships?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Beggars can't be choosers,&quot; Jane said quietly. Instantly
Tom regretted his little joke.</P>

<P>&quot;Well, relationships are complex things. Little subtleties can
become big issues. If it makes you feel uncomfortable then Daria and Quinn
will probably both pick it up. If you can think of some way of just...I
don't know, letting them know but helping them not to feel threatened by
it, I guess it would help to clear the air, for you as much as for them.
I don't mean that you should make a big issue out of it. I guess Quinn
must be going through some of the same things. It's all new to her too,
isn't it? And Daria's anything but dumb. She must realise that there are
things you're having to come to terms with. She might surprise you.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;She always does.&quot; She looked at him with a little smile of
gratitude. &quot;Thanks Tom.&quot;</P>

<P>One more try. &quot;Well, at least you have excellent taste in women.&quot;</P>

<P>A little smile lit her face. &quot;Yeah. I do, don't I?&quot; The smile
turned into a grin. &quot;I guess that's one thing--at least when I get
horny in the showers after gym no-one else knows about it. I can always
just claim that I'm cold.&quot;</P>

<P>Tom blushed. &quot;When I think of that I thank the gods I'm not gay.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane chuckled and stood up. &quot;Now how about that coffee? Oh, there's
just one more thing.&quot; </P>

<P>&quot;What? Hey - what the....&quot;</P>

<P>She leaned over and kissed him passionately. He fought it, but she hung
on.</P>

<P>If he'd worn glasses he would have straightened them. &quot;What the
hell was that about?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Revenge.&quot; </P>

<P>She looked at him, waiting for it to sink in before squatting in front
of him and taking both his hands in hers. She looked up at him and spoke
quietly but intensely. &quot;You kissed Daria, Daria kissed you. Now I've
kissed you. That's it. No more talk about who stole who from who, no more
doubt, no more revenge. Okay?&quot;</P>

<P>He looked at her with new respect, and breathed &quot;Okay.&quot; </P>

<P>She let go of him and stood up. &quot;Good. Now lead me to the coffee.&quot;</P>

<P>
<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="75%"></P>

<P>Quinn sat in the living room staring out the window, a blank expression
on her face, as Daria opened the front door and walked towards the stairs.
Something attracted her attention. Red hair just visible over the top of
the couch. She stopped, her foot on the bottom stair, turned, and slowly
walked round to where Quinn was sitting.</P>

<P>&quot;Quinn?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn looked up, saw Daria, and turned back toward the window. &quot;Hey.&quot;
she croaked, so quietly it was almost inaudible.</P>

<P>Daria sat down next to her. &quot;I know.&quot; she said. &quot;She
told me.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn's expression didn't change, but a tear ran down her face.</P>

<P>&quot;She gave me a message for you.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn turned, afraid of what it might be.</P>

<P>&quot;She said to tell you she loves you.&quot;</P>

<P>Sniff. &quot;Really?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Uh huh.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn's veneer of control disappeared and all the fear, all the imagined
horrors, had their release in a flood of tears. She buried her face in
Daria's shoulder and flung her arms around her sister's neck. The unfamiliarity
of the situation struck Daria as funny, but she returned Quinn's hug, if
a little uncertainly. &quot;Um, Quinn, you're getting my shoulder all wet.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn lifted her head and looked at Daria to see the faintest hint of
a smile. Despite herself she grinned back, just a little, her face wet.
</P>

<P>Daria felt in her pocket and produced a handkerchief. &quot;Here.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn took it and wiped her eyes. &quot;Thanks...Sis.&quot; she said,
a little timidly.</P>

<P>Daria looked down at her shoulder. &quot;Damn, I'm going to have to
get this dry cleaned now to get the dissolved mascara out of it.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I use waterproof mascara, Daria.&quot; Quinn smiled. &quot;It'll
brush out when it's dry.&quot; She blew her nose on Daria's handkerchief.</P>

<P>&quot;Well what are you waiting for? Aren't you going to call her?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I thought you'd never ask.&quot; Quinn made a bee line for the
kitchen.</P>

<P><I>Bleah.</I> Thought Daria. <I>That was so mushy!</I></P>

<P>
<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="75%"></P>

<P>&quot;Trent?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh. Hey Quinn.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Is Jane there?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No. She went to...&quot; <I>Whoa.</I></P>

<P>&quot;Went to what?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Um, to...&quot;</P>

<P>The front door opened. Trent looked round to see Jane turn and wave.</P>

<P>&quot;She's just come back. Hang on.&quot;</P>

<P>He put the phone down and walked across to where she was standing, watching
Tom drive off.</P>

<P>&quot;Hey Janie. Quinn's on the phone.&quot;</P>

<P>She turned suddenly and grinned. &quot;Great.&quot;</P>

<P>He held her arm, stopping her. &quot;Just a dream, was it?&quot; He
smiled.</P>

<P>&quot;The best kind of dream, brother dearest.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well it nearly turned into a nightmare. I almost told her where
you'd gone.&quot;</P>

<P>'Shit. You didn't did you?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No. Janie, you're not, um, you know, cheating on her are you?&quot;</P>

<P>Jane looked genuinely shocked. &quot;Damn Trent. No! I'll tell you later,
but thanks for not spilling the beans.&nbsp;Now let me talk to her.&quot;
She walked off towards the kitchen.</P>

<P>&quot;Quinn?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Jane! Jane--I'm so sorry! I was so stupid and so thoughtless and
so selfish. I promise I'll never bring it up again. I mean I don't know
what I was thinking. It doesn't mean anything. And I made such a big deal
of it. How could I be so dumb. Please can I come over? I feel so bad and...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Quinn?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;...and I just thought of how awful I'd been I thought you'd never
want to see me again and...and...&quot; her voice was starting to give
away her emotion.</P>

<P>&quot;Quinn?&quot;</P>

<P>Sniff. &quot;Uh huh.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Shut up. How soon can you be here?&quot;</P>

<P>Another tear broke through her smile. &quot;As soon as I can.&quot;
She hung up.</P>

<P><I>I'm really taking on a dominant role, aren't I?</I> Jane asked herself
as she slowly put the phone back in its cradle. <I>I guess I'm the boy
</I>she thought, silently answering a question that Jake had posed some
time ago. She smiled.</P>

<P>
<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="75%"></P>

<P>When Jane opened the door Quinn's usual smile of happiness was entirely
absent, replaced by an expression of rank fear. It was just like it had
been in those first few days--uncertainty, doubt. Jane realised that what,
for her, had been a minor tiff had been much more than that for Quinn.
She took Quinn's hand and gently pulled her through the door, closing it
behind her. In one smooth motion she pulled the redhead close, bent, and
kissed her. She felt Quinn trembling in her arms at first, then relaxing
into the kiss.</P>

<P>&quot;It's late. I guess we don't have much time. I'm sorry, Light of
my Life.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn looked up at her. &quot;I told Mom that I'd be back tomorrow.&quot;
It was only then that Jane noticed she was carrying a small bag.</P>

<P>&quot;Wow. How was she about that?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;She told me to make sure I brought my toothbrush.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I can't believe your Mom and Dad.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn grinned. &quot;I can't believe them either sometimes. But let's
say that Mom and I understand each other a lot better these days. I don't
think she'd have let me stay if tomorrow wasn't Saturday.&quot;</P>

<P>They walked up the stairs hand in hand.</P>

<P>
<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="75%"></P>

<P>Jane sat on the chair beside her bed, staring, watching the gentle rise
and fall of the covers as the girl sleeping there breathed slowly. <I>What
did I do to deserve this? </I>she wondered. <I>If nature dishes out pleasure
and pain in equal measures then I'm in for some serious punishment one
of these days.</I> </P>

<P>An eyelid fluttered. </P>

<P>&quot;Quinn? Are you awake?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Mmmf.&quot; Quinn rolled over and opened her eyes to see Jane,
wearing a t-shirt, shorts and running shoes, leaning over her. She stretched
languidly, yawning, and looked up at Jane with a half-asleep smile that
made her feel as if all her Christmases had come at once. &quot;Are you
going for a run?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Been. The best part of the day's over.&quot; She looked down at
Quinn and smiled. &quot;I felt so good. I could have run forever.&quot;
She leant over and kissed Quinn on the cheek.</P>

<P>&quot;Eeew! You're all sweaty!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I was all sweaty last night and you didn't complain.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn sat up, ignoring Jane's comment. She looked serious. &quot;Jane,
can we talk?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;As long as it's not the 'let's just be friends' talk.&quot; She
sat down on the bed. &quot;I want to talk to you too. Shower first, then
coffee and talk.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Okay,&quot; said Quinn, leaping out of bed and flashing her that
smile. &quot;Let's go.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Wow! Bonus!&quot; Jane walked to the closet and threw a towel
at Quinn. &quot;You'd better wrap this around yourself. It's only eight,
but Trent might be up.&quot;</P>

<P>They looked at each other. &quot;Nah,&quot; they chorused.</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>&quot;Orange juice?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Celery?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Cottage cheese?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Unsweetened yoghurt?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Carrots?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;An apple?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Um, Jane...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What <I>have</I> you got in there?&quot;</P>

<P>Jane stared deep into the bowels of the Lane refrigerator. &quot;Pizza.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Vegetarian, no cheese?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Pepperoni. Extra anchovies. Oh wait--there's milk!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Expiry date?&quot;</P>

<P>Jane peered at the carton in the door. &quot;How about that! We do have
unsweetened yoghurt! Or cottage cheese. Take your pick.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn sighed. &quot;Bread?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, sure, and...hey, there's ice cream and chocolate syrup but
I don't suppose you'd...&quot; She paused, picking up the bottle of chocolate
syrup and contemplating it, like Aristotle contemplating the bust of Homer.</P>

<P>&quot;Toast then. How about something to spread on it.&quot; No answer.
&quot;Jane?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What? Oh, sorry. Yeah, um, there's some honey I think, and peanut
butter.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn smiled. &quot;Just toast. Maybe a little honey.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane had a far away look. &quot;Honey,&quot; she muttered, staring into
space.</P>

<P>&quot;Jane--wake up.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane returned to the present. &quot;Sorry.&quot; She took two slices
of bread out of the freezer and put them in the toaster. &quot;So--what
did you want to talk about?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn spun round her chair, watching Jane scoop four large spoonfuls
of coffee into the pot. &quot;I'm going public. On Monday.&quot;</P>

<P>The spoon in Jane's hand hovered over the pot as she turned to face
Quinn. &quot;You mean...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I'm coming out of the closet.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane emptied the spoon into the pot, put the pot on the hotplate and
took the toast out of the toaster. &quot;When you first talked about it
I wasn't sure if you'd thought about the consequences.&quot; She put the
toast on a plate, took a yellow Disneyesque Whinnie the Pooh-shaped jar
of honey out of the cupboard and out them down in front of Quinn. &quot;But
you have, haven't you?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn picked up the knife and smeared a tiny scraping of honey onto
the toast. &quot;I'm sick of it. I'm sick of having to lie, sick of having
to hide it, sick of having to ignore you at school, sick of having to put
up with Jeffy and Jamie and Jeramiah, sick of the whole thing.&quot; The
strokes of the knife on the toast had become more violent as she spoke
and, by this stage, the toast and honey were forming a molecular bond.
&quot;The last straw was when I was shopping for your bikini. I had to
tell Sandi, (scrape) Tiffany (scrape) and Stacy (scrape) that it was for
Daria.&quot; She looked up from the battered slice of toast and made eye
contact with Jane. &quot;I've made my mind up. Yes I've thought of what
might happen and I don't care.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane walked over to Quinn and put a gentle hand on her shoulder.</P>

<P>Quinn looked down at the plate in front of her. &quot;I'm doing this
for me. No-one else. There's only one thing that could change my mind.&quot;
She looked up &quot;If you didn't want me to.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane sat down on the opposite side of the table, reached over and took
Quinn's hand, realising too late that she was holding the disintegrated
remains of the toast. She stood up and walked over to the sink to wash
the slightly sticky remnants off her hand. &quot;If it's is what you want
then it's what I want too. How are you going to do it?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;There's a fashion club meeting at Sandi's on Monday night. I'm
going to announce it there.&quot; She smiled. &quot;It'll be all over the
school by lunch on Tuesday.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Beautiful <I>and</I> devious. <I>And</I> rich. I've lucked out.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;So what did you want to talk to me about?&quot;</P>

<P>Jane blushed. &quot;It's not important.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Please Jane?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's a little.... Finish your toast. Maybe we can go for a walk
and talk about it.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn smiled. &quot;I'd like that.&quot;</P>

<P>
<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="75%"></P>

<P>They walked slowly. It was still early Sunday morning and the streets
were quiet except for the muted roar of the occasional lawnmower, paying
for disturbing the peace by spraying a hint of new-mown lawn scent into
the breeze. Jane held her cup of coffee and had bought Quinn a bottle of
orange juice at the store on the way to the park. They crossed the road
and sat on the swings, feet on the ground, slowly pushing the swings back
and letting them return in unison, not speaking, from time to time turning
to look at each other and smiling. It was a moment.</P>

<P>&quot;Well?&quot;</P>

<P>Jane looked at the ground.</P>

<P>&quot;I was just wondering...&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn stopped swinging and looked at her.</P>

<P>Jane stopped too. &quot;You know I love you, don't you?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn just smiled.</P>

<P>&quot;I was wondering, well, you've been...used to this longer than
I have. Do you ever, you know, get, um, I mean do you ever think about
other girls?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What? When we're...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No, I mean, say, in the shower after gym. Do you ever get...turned
on?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn blushed.</P>

<P>Jane took a deep breath then let it out. &quot;Don't answer that, Quinn.
I'm just trying to make you say what I'm too nervous to. The thing is that
I do get turned on sometimes and I just needed to say...to tell you.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn looked surprised. &quot;Is that all? You were worried about that?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Well, yeah. I was worried about telling you.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn giggled. &quot;You're so cute. Of course I do. Doesn't everyone?
But it doesn't mean that you should be jealous about it. You're not, are
you?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But what if it was someone, you know, um, close to us both?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn's eyes widened. &quot;Oh.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You don't...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;NO! Damn. See what I mean? But it's awkward. And I can't just
leave it there.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn stopped swinging, stood up and turned to face Jane, reaching up
with both hands to hold the chains of the swing, stopping it motionless.
&quot;Do you want her?&quot;</P>

<P>Jane looked up into Quinn's eyes. A rush of emotion. &quot;No! But I
don't want to lose her as a friend--that's what I'm afraid of. If I tell
her, will it change the way she thinks about me?&nbsp;I was just shocked
to realise that I could think of her, you know...&quot; She loosened Quinn's
grip on the chain and held her hand. &quot;There's nothing for you to be
jealous about.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But she's my sister!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And you're her sister and she's my best friend. And that's exactly
the way I want it to stay.&quot; Jane stood up and looked down at Quinn.
&quot;I didn't want to tell you because I thought you'd be hurt, but I'm
not going to screw up our relationship with secrets, even harmless ones.
No secrets. That's what I said to your Mo...Helen and I'm saying it to
you too. And it has to be the same with Daria. No secrets.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn thought for a minute. &quot;Crap. Until a few months ago Daria
and I were too different for any of that sibling rivalry stuff. I mean
it's not as if she was going to win any popularity contests, or I was going
to challenge her for the position of school brain. But now I'm feeling
jealous because you think of her...like that.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Don't. It's not like that. If it'll make you feel better I'll
stay away from the showers.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn blushed again. &quot;Um, I guess I'd have to stay away from the
showers too.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane looked up at her in surprise. &quot;So do you think about...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Jane, I fantasized about you for six months, and now I have my
fantasy in real life. When I'm in the shower, I think about you.&quot;</P>

<P>Jane smiled. &quot;Oh.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And when I have to switch hands, sometimes Stacy.&quot; </P>

<P>They burst out laughing. The laughter turned to smiles, the smiles turned
to a hug and the hug turned to a kiss.</P>

<P>Behind a window across the road, a pair of eyes doubled in size.</P>

<P>
<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="75%"></P>

<P>Sandi, Stacy, Tiffany and Quinn sat in their accustomed places on Sandi's
bedroom floor. Fluffy, Sandi's Burmese cat, sat in Sandi's lap purring
contentedly.</P>

<P>For the second time in weeks Quinn was certain that they could hear
her heart beating. Why was she so tense about this? She didn't care whether
they approved or not; it wouldn't make any difference. But it was still
a big deal. And it was no good denying it, she did care. Sandi, Tiffany
and Stacy had been her best friends ever since she arrived in Lawndale
and you can't just let that go, can you? What should she expect? Shock?
Horror? Meanness from Sandi? Blank incomprehension from Tiffany? Stacy?
How the hell would Stacy react? She felt the heat of an embarrassed blush
to realise that she had no idea how Stacy would react. Probably wait to
see how Sandi reacted first and follow her lead. But Stacy wouldn't be
mean, would she? How would Stacy react away from Sandi? What if she decided
to tell them individually instead of tonight? That wouldn't work--she'd
have to separate them somehow until she'd told them all, or else they'd
know at the speed of telephone. No, this was the only way to do it. She
didn't want to lose their friendship. She was becoming less obsessed with
the things that the four of them had devoted their friendship to obsessing
about--there were more important things now. But they were still her friends.
Would they still be her friends after tonight?</P>

<P>Quinn's reverie was interrupted by Sandi's command. &quot;This meeting
will come to order. Stacy, would you please read the minutes of the last
meeting?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Minutes?&quot; Stacy shuffled the papers in her lap, then looked
at Sandi, panic in her eyes. &quot;Oh God, Sandi. I've forgotten the minutes.&quot;
Stacy covered her mouth with her clenched fists and started hyperventilating.
Normally Quinn would have smiled inside, but her attention was completely
focussed on the announcement she was going to make.</P>

<P>&quot;Stop that, Stacy,&quot; barked Sandi. &quot;You will record in
the minutes of this meeting that the minutes of the previous meeting were
dispensed with until the next meeting. I assume that you haven't forgotten
the agenda too?&quot;</P>

<P>Stacy pulled herself together and read from the agenda. &quot;Agenda
item 1. Suspension of Agenda for announcement by Vice President.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Thank you Stacy. Well Quinn, what's this announcement that you
have to make that's so important that we have to defer discussion of important
things like our scheduled lipstick comparison and accessory exposition.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I won't take long.&quot; Quinn's heart raced.</P>

<P>&quot;Then proceed, but make it snappy please.&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn sat upright, faced the wall, took a deep breath and said &quot;I
just...I&nbsp;wanted to say...&quot; She gathered herself. &quot;I'm a
lesbian.&quot;</P>

<P>There. It was over. What would be would be. </P>

<P>Stacy looked at Quinn with her most innocent and charming smile. &quot;Oh
Quinn, you're so cute. Did you really think we didn't know?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn's eyes widened.</P>

<P>Tiffany stared down at her fingernails and frowned, clearly thinking
hard. &quot;Hhmmm.&quot; She said. &quot;I wonder if Iiiii'm a lesbian?&quot;</P>

<P>
<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="75%"></P>

<P>&quot;They knew?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I was mortified! Ooooh! I mean why didn't they tell me?&quot;</P>

<P>Jane had tried everything she could think of to distract herself from
thinking about what might have been going on while Quinn was spilling her
guts to her friends. <I>Friends? Those airheads?</I> But they were her
friends, so Jane controlled herself when Quinn talked about them. It hadn't
been all that long ago that she'd though the same thing about Quinn, had
it? She'd tried painting, but that didn't work. Television was just ambient
light and sound--she couldn't focus on it. Reading--<I>hah</I>--she'd known
that wasn't working when she realised that she'd been reading the same
line over and over for twenty minutes. The sound of the phone had been
blessed relief.</P>

<P>But she had no idea how to react to that. Of all the things she'd imagined,
of all the reactions she'd anticipated, this was right out of left field.</P>

<P>&quot;So do you still think it's going to be all over the school by
tomorrow?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I don't know. I don't care.&quot; Quinn's pout was visible over
the telephone.</P>

<P>&quot;They just went on like I'd been talking about the weather! It
was just like when I finally admitted that Daria was my sister and Tiffany
said they'd just been being polite!&quot; Her voice was a mixture of anger
and frustration, the fear of consequences overshadowed for the moment.</P>

<P>Jane was lost for words. &quot;Did they ask about whether you had a
girlfriend?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No! They just ignored the whole thing and carried on with the
agenda.&quot; She studiously neglected the fact that the second item on
the agenda had been <I>The Bikini Line: Waxing, Shaving or Electrolysis?</I></P>

<P>&quot;Tell you what--let's keep that part of it a secret for a little
while longer. Okay?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;If that's what you want.&quot;</P>

<P>
<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="75%"></P>

<P>&quot;But Sandi--you said...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I know what I said, Stacy, but it wouldn't have been, like, polite
for me to have said that I was surprised, would it?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;If you say so, Sandi. But you really didn't know?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No, Stacy, I <I>really</I> didn't know. What <I>I </I>want to
know is how you and Tiffany knew.&quot;</P>

<P><I>You're kidding, Sandi? It's been so obvious! </I>&quot;Well, I don't
know, it just seemed obvious. I mean she didn't like guys. She never really,
you know, <I>liked</I> them liked them--she never said anything even vaguely
romantic. And remember that business with Ramonica? I just think it's been
obvious that she liked girls. I suppose Tiffany saw it too.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Gee, thank you Stacy. I should have realised a long time ago that
you and Tiffany are so much more observant than I am.&quot;</P>

<P>Stacy controlled the urge to panic. <I>Think, fast!</I> </P>

<P>&quot;Oh no, Sandi! You're so much more observant than Tiffany and me!
I mean it just goes to show how unobservant we must be! If we were as observant
as you we would have been fooled by--I mean we would have been smart enough
to be be convinced by Quinn's, um, act--and it must have been a really
good act because if it hadn't been good then you wouldn't have been convinced
by it yourself, and you're so observant, so Tiffany and I must be really,
really unobservant not to have noticed how good it was, right?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Um, yes, Stacy. Of course. Quinn is an excellent actor--she had
me completely convinced.&quot;</P>

<P><I>Phew.</I></P>

<P>&quot;So, Stacy, does she have a girlfriend?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I don't know. I mean she seems to go all gooey when she sees that
friend of Daria's, you know, Jane.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Thank you, Stacy. That's very interesting.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Um, you're welcome Sandi, I&nbsp;guess.&quot;</P>

<P>Stacy hung up. <I>Oh no! Did I do the right thing? </I>she wondered,
breathing rapidly and shallowly.</P>

<P>
<HR NOSHADE WIDTH="75%"></P>

<P>Quinn swallowed nervously as she walked out into the corridor at recess.</P>

<P>&quot;Hey Quinn! I hear you're a lesbian! That's so cool!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, Quinn. I know a lesbian bar in Dega Street. Can I drive
you there after school?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hi, Quinn.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Hi Jeffy, Joey, Gerard. Um, thanks guys, but I don't want to go
to a lesbian bar. Anyway, I don't drink, remember?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Have you got a girlfriend, Quinn? My cousin's a lesbian too!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, Quinn, I'm thinking of becoming gay!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Can I get...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;GUYS! Please.&quot; The chatter stopped. &quot;You're sweet, but
really--you have to understand that I'm not interested, okay? I'm sorry
if I gave you the wrong impression. I probably had the wrong impression
myself, but you'd be better off being, um, nice, to someone who'll appreciate
it, like Sandi, or Tiffany, or Stacy. I'm sure they'd just love to have
their books carried to class, and sodas bought for them, and all those,
er, sweet things that you used to do for me. But please, stop doing them
for me. Okay?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Sure Quinn, anything you say.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I'll go look for them Quinn.&quot;</P>

<P>She watched as Jeffy and Jamie ran off up the hall in search of other
victims. She sighed, wondering whether she'd done Sandi, Tiffany and Stacy
a favour or not. It was only then that she realised that Joey hadn't left.</P>

<P>&quot;Joey?&nbsp;Was there something that you wanted?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Um, Quinn, I, I just wanted to say, I mean, that is...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What, Joey? I'm not available for dating any more if that's what
you want.&quot;</P>

<P>He smiled sheepishly. &quot;No, that's not what I want. I just wanted
to say that, um, I hope it all works out well for you, Quinn. I mean I
hope you're really happy.&quot; Quinn saw that he was genuinely embarrassed.
&quot;I guess you're serious about it, aren't you? I mean, it's not a joke
or anything?&quot;</P>

<P>Quinn looked at him with a glimmer of affection, and smiled. &quot;No,
Joey. It's not a joke. And thank you.&quot;</P>

<P>Joey looked around and, seeing the hall empty, quickly gave Quinn a
quick peck on her cheek. &quot;'Bye, Quinn. And good luck&quot; He turned
and walked off.</P>

<P>Quinn put her hand to her cheek where he'd kissed her and smiled. <I>That's
the nicest thing that any of them ever did for me,</I> she thought, a little
chuckle escaping as she turned to go and find her friends. Perhaps it wasn't
going to be so bad after all.</P>
