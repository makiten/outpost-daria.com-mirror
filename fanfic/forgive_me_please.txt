 Dear Diary  April 5, 2002.

Well, it's been 3 years in prison for the rape. I feel well kinda bad for 
raping that girl Jane Lane. I don't know what got into me. It was like a 
force deep within in me that did this. I tried to stop after that but I 
sexually assaulted some girl Stacy Nibblett on a date. Prison life is pure
hell. Each day I am subjected to beatings by two guys. I feel really bad 
diary. If only she would forgive me.

================================================================

Scene 3: Show Joanna, Steven, Medow, and Eric of F.L.I.P rehearsing.

================================================================

Joanna: O.K, let's see here. we're going to practice "My Alter Ego".

Eric: Man, that's all we ever practice.

Steven: Don't you have any other songs?

Joanna: Well, no.

Medow: Ha! I know that look.

Joanna: What look?

Eric: You got something, don't you?

Joanna: Yeah it's called "The Crappy Song". Wanna hear it? O.K. (picks up 
guitar.  Starts to play.) Crap!crap!crap!CRAP!CRAP!CRAP!

Medow: O.K, we get the point

Joanna: Good. Look let's just skip today. I'll call you back when 
something inspires me.

Eric: O.K.

Medow:Come on, let's go.

(The two walk out together. Eric with blonde slicked back hair, blue eyes,
a baby face. Medow with blonde hair, blue eyes, and pretty short. 5'1" to 
be exact.)

Steven: So, can't get inspired, can you?

Joanna: Not yet.

Steven: All well that's O.K. (he kisses her on the lips)

================================================================

Scene 4: Show Jane and Brandon at the Lane residence.

================================================================

Brandon: So, you ready for our all day date?

Jane: Yeah. What are we doing anyway?

Brandon: Oh I was thinking first the movie, then a picnic, then the 
carnival, then we could go to a hotel.

Jane: Sounds good.

Brandon: Really?

Jane: Yeah.

Brandon: You sure?

Jane: Shut up before I change my mind.

Brandon: O.K Well, let's go.

(In the car.)

Jane: So, what are we going to see?

Brandon: Hmm. Haven't decided. Up to you.

Jane: I don't care. Umm, uh, I guess that remake of "Titanic". I hear both 
Jack and Rose die.

Brandon: Cool!

(At the ticket counter.)

Brandon: Two for "Titanic", please.

Ticket Seller: Agh here's ya tickets. Enjoy the flick.

Jane: O.K do you want me to save us a seat, and you can get the snacks?

Brandon: Nah. How 'bout you?

Jane: O.K you want a large coke, and Milk Duds?

Brandon: Yeah.

Jane: O.K see you in there. I'll wave.

(Brandon goes in the theater, and see's no one there.)

Brandon: Alright!

Jane: Alright what? Oh! (Notices the empty theater.) Woo Hoo!

Brandon: Front, or back?

Jane: Middle.

Brandon: As you wish.

(Three hours later.)

Jane: So Rose falls down, and gets chopped up by the propellers? And Jack 
also falls trying to save her. That was way shorter than the original.

(Sorry all you Leo fans. I couldn't resist.)

Brandon: Most of my attention was on you.

(They've been making out the whole three hours.)

Jane: So, now the picnic?

Brandon: Of course, Madam Lane.

Jane: Oh shut up with the country accent.

Brandon: Ready?

Jane: Yeah.

Brad: Hey.

Evan: Look, just leave me alone.

Knife: Ya know we've been hearing rumors that you might get off for 
parole.

Evan: Yeah, right.

Brad: Nah they said possibly. Tommorow.

Evan: Mmmm hmm. Sure sure.

Knife: And that means we get to have one more day of fun.

Brad: Come on, little boy.

Evan: Hey, leave me alone!

Knife: Nope sorry. (He picks up Evan, and throws him against the wall.)

Evan: OW!

Brad: Hmm. I believe the last thing you did was kick that girl. (Starts 
kicking him) How do you like it? HUH!?

Evan: Ow! Stop it, please. (Starts to cry.)

Knife: Oh the little boys crying. (Drags him to the toilet, and dunks his 
head in.) Wash yer face, cry baby.

Evan: Oh, please, somebody HELP!

Guard: Hey, YOU TWO ,CUT IT OUT!!

Knife: Why, he deserves it.

Guard: STOP! OR I WELL TAKE DRASTIC MEASURES!!

Brad: Oh, fine!

Evan: Thanks.

(Midnight. Evan squints to write in his diary.)

 Dear Diary April 6, 2002

Well diary. Rumor has it I'll be free tommorow. On parole that is. I 
suffered, a bad beating by those two guys. I really want to talk to Jane, 
say I'm sorry, but I know that's not enough. I took something from her. I 
was like--well you know--the little boy that wants a toy, but can't have 
it, so he steals it. Kinda like me. I wanted to go out with her. She said 
"No" and I raped her. But also call me crazy, but it seemed something 
enetered me after she rejected me. It was like a force controlling me to 
do this. Yeah I know it sounds crazy. I wonder what she's doing now?.....

================================================================

Scene 6: Show Brandon, and Jane at a hotel.

================================================================

Jane: I'm tired.

Brandon: That was fun.

Jane: What the carnival, or the picnic?

Brandon: Both.

Jane: Hmm.

Brandon: Hey umm listen. We've been dating for three years. Do you think 
you're ready?

Jane: To do it?

Brandon: Yes.

Jane: Do you have protection?

Brandon: Of course.

Jane: O.K

Brandon: Let me go get ready.

Jane: Uh huh. Umm, Brandon?

Brandon: Yeah?

Jane: I, uh, umm, er, uh..

Brandon: Is anything wrong?

Jane: I wasn't a virgin before the rape. I know I should have told you 
some time ago.

Brandon: That's O.K. At least you were honest.

Jane: Thanks.

(Brandon goes into the bathroom to get ready. Jane turns on the T.V)

SSW Announcer: On the next "Sick Sad World", porn stars who do the Foo Foo
Nasty.  With animals.

Jane: (Turns off the T.V) I'm going to be sick.

Brandon: Huh? Why?

Jane: Oh I found something repulsive on T.V.

Brandon: O.K so you ready? (He's standing there wearing boxers only, Jane 
is still dressed.)

Jane: Yeah. (They stare at each other for a moment. Brandon leans foward 
to kiss her. They kiss gently at first, but then in more passion. 
 And then... (author heres her consiouse.)

consiouse: Now. now no sex.

Me: Buzz off!

1 hour later

(they collaspe in each others arms.)

Brandon: How was it?

Jane: Great. (They hear a knock at the door.)

Brandon: Oh geez. Just a minute! (Show outside the door; we see Daria and
Trent.)

Daria: Sounds like Jane was listening to porno tape.

Trent: Nah. Not her style. (The door opens. We see Brandon in just his 
boxers.  His hair is mussed, and he has scratch marks all over his chest 
and back. Daria and Trent's eyes go wide.)

Daria: Jesus Christ. Were you just mauled by an animal?

Jane: Oh, Shut up!

Trent: Janey?

Jane: Yes. What do you want?

Daria: Here, we were told to give you this note.

Jane: You interrupted our fun for this?

Trent: The question is. Were you doing it, or killing him?

Jane: Ha ha! Trent. Gimme that! (She snatches away the note; then reads it.)

 Dear Jane,

 Meet me at the Lawndale cafe tommorow at 8 am. I can't tell you who I am 
just now. I well be wearing a white T-shirt, and khakis, and sitting at 
table three. Bring somebody with you.

Jane: Umm, sure.

Brandon: Well, are you going to?

Jane: I suppose.

Trent: Well, see ya, Janey; don't forget to trim those nails.

Jane: URUGH!! (She throws a pillow at Trent. It hits him upside the head.)

Brandon: Should we get back to bed?

Jane: Yeah.

(They crawl back in bed together. Jane snuggles close to Brandon, buries 
her face in his chest, and falls asleep. Brandon looks at her smiles, 
strokes her hair, and falls asleep.)

================================================================

 Scene 7: A dream sequence. Show Jane with Brandon.

================================================================

Brandon: Jane, you're a fucking bitch.

Jane: What?

Brandon: You heard me. You're a no good bitch, and a slut!

Jane: Hell, no!

Brandon: (He turns into Evan)

Evan: Come on, little girl, let's have some fun. (He grabs Jane, who kicks 
him away. She starts running as fast as she can. Evan is close behind. He 
tackles her to the ground, but some how she manages to escape. She runs 
into a chain link fence.)

Jane: (Shaking, and clawing the fence.) SOMEBODY HELP! PLEASE! 
OH, GOD, SOMEBODY HELP! (Evan corners her. She drops down and cowers 
with fear, and starts to cry.)

Evan: Jane, Jane, Jane...

Brandon: Jane, JANE!

Jane: Ack! (Starts to cry.)

Brandon: Jane, what's wrong?

Jane: I had a bad dream.

Brandon: About Evan?

Jane: Yeah. Only in this one it started out as you, and you turned into 
Evan.

Brandon: Jane,  I wouldn't hurt you.

Jane: I know. Umm, what time is it?

Brandon: 7:30. Guess we better get ready.

Jane: Yeah.

(Brandon puts on a shirt, and a pair of jeans. We see Jane putting on her 
bra, and panties under the covers. She then gets a black shirt, and jeans 
and puts those on. She then brushes her hair a little.)

Brandon: Ready?

Jane: Yeah.

================================================================

Scene 8: Show Jane, and Brandon in the cafe. We see Evan at table 3. He
has on a cap, and pair of shades on.

================================================================

Jane: Well that's table 3. Might as well get this over with.

(They walk over to the table)

Jane: O.K Mister. . .

Evan: Jane, it's me. (He removes his cap, and sunglasses)

Jane: Oh, my God!  You're supposed to be locked up. What the hell are you 
doing here? Oh, wait, never mind; you are probaly here to rape me?

Evan: No Jane I'm not. I got out on parole. Jane I... how do I say this? 
Look I realized I hurt you. I violated you, and I know you probaly have 
visions of killing me, but Jane, if you could, find the heart to forgive 
me, please?

Jane: (She looks stunned.) Evan I don't know what to say. I mean you 
treated me like I was an object you could just screw when ever you want.
I don't know if I can. It's a big step.

(Cut to outside. For some reason we see Joanna running at top speed. She
enters the building gasping for breath, muttering something)

Jane: What the hell are you doing here?

Joanna: Darkness, darkness..

Brandon: Jane, she's scaring me.

Jane: What is it?

Joanna: Come outside.

(Cut to outside)

Evan: What?

Joanna: I just had a vision. My home is being destroyed.

Jane: You came screaming, because your house is being destroyed?

Joanna: No. I'm not from Earth I'm from the DarkWorld.

(Stunned looks on all. Fade to black where we see the words "To be
continued in 'Our Alter Egos'".)

O.K you thought that was weird bizzare? Will boys and girls you haven't 
seen nothing yet. "Our Alter Egos" is going to be as bizzare as I can get. 
(And beleive me, I can get really bizzare.)

The one reason why I did this story is because it sorta teaches the value 
of forgiveness. Which as we see Jane doesn't forgive him off-hand. Well, 
seeing as this is a lead on to "Our Alter Egos", I'll stop now.

NOTES:

(1) Knife and Brad were introduced in "Are You That Guy?"
