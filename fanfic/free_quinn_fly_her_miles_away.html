<p>There's not really a whole lot to say about this little production. It's a standard sitcomesque
"Daria" episode that follows a pretty conventional plotline. No hurricanes, no crossovers. Just good
clean American fun at European expense, as God intended.

<p>Acknowledgements: Thanks to my parents, for taking me to Germany and France to visit relatives when
I was little. Thanks to my friends for sharing their exchange experiences, and thanks to the
exchange students who had the misfortune to have to go to my high school for a year. I learned from
your captivity.

<p>Act I.

<p>FADE IN.

<p>INT. Mr. DeMARTINO'S CLASSROOM - DAY.

<p>WS of CLASSROOM, POV BACK WALL. MR. DeMARTINO is speaking to the class in his usual borderline sociopathic fashion.

<p>SLOW ZOOM IN TO MS as DeMARTINO speaks.

<center><p><b> DeMARTINO </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Now, class, I have some very
INTERESTING news for you. Well, at least for ONE of you. The STUDENT
EXCHANGE COMMITTEE, consisting of myself, Ms. Li, Ms. Barch, and Mr.
O'NEILL, have agreed upon two things that will impact one of you.
FIRST, due to budget cuts, our YEARLY EXCHANGE with our sister school
in Bruges, Belgium will be cut from three months to THREE WEEKS. </blockquote>

<p>FINISH ZOOM.

<p>CUT TO CU OF BRITTANY.

<center><p><b> BRITTANY </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Rouge? I love makeup! </blockquote>

<p>CUT BACK TO MS of CLASSROOM, POV BACK WALL.

<center><p><b> DeMARTINO </b></center><br>
<center><p> (Irritated.) </center>
<blockquote> That BRUGES, Brittany. As in the
city in BELGIUM. (Beat.) Now, before I was so RUDELY interrupted, I was
getting to the second point. I have the unique PLEASURE of
congratulating the lucky student who will receive this BOUNTY from our
impoverished school system FREE of charge. (Pauses for effect.) Ms.
Morgendorffer, PACK your bags. </blockquote>

<p>CUT TO XCU of DARIA, who is stunned.

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<center><p> (Shocked.) </center>
<blockquote> Excuse me? But I didn't even apply. </blockquote>

<p>ZOOM OUT TO MS of BRITTANY, JANE, DARIA. DARIA looks over at BRITTANY.

<center><p><b> BRITTANY </b></center><br>
<blockquote> But Daria, you could use some free makeup! </blockquote>

<p>DARIA rolls her eyes. JANE grins.

<p>CUT TO CU of DeMARTINO, who is a bit irritated that DARIA is not visibly ecstatic or overjoyed at her sudden good fortune.

<center><p><b> DeMARTINO </b></center><br>
<center><p> (Irritated.) </center>
<blockquote> Yes, Daria, we were AWARE that you
did not file an APPLICATION. Apparently your COUSIN submitted an
application FOR you. She wanted to SURPRISE you with this GIFT of
travel on the school's DIME. SOME of the committee members were moved
by her selfless ACT, and so IMPRESSED with your CREDENTIALS that we
finally agreed that you should have the HONOR of representing Lawndale
High in Belgium. </blockquote>

<p>CUT TO CU of JANE and DARIA.

<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Wow, lucky you. I wonder what moved <i>her</i> to such an act of selflessness? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<center><p> (Suspiciously.) </center>
<blockquote> She's not capable of selfless
action-- it interferes with her dating, shopping, and personal grooming
schedules. I don't know what she's up to, but I'll find out one way or
another. </blockquote>

<p>CUT TO MS of DeMARTINO, looming over DARIA.

<center><p><b> DeMARTINO </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Well, Ms. Morgendorffer, what is your ANSWER? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<center><p> (Stalling for time.) </center>
<blockquote> Uh, I need to ask my parents first. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DeMARTINO </b></center><br>
<center><p> (Grins evilly. In a more moderate tone.) </center>
<blockquote> No need. Your cousin already spoke
with them, and they agreed to let you make the journey, and take in the
exchange student who will be visiting here in your place for the next
three weeks. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Ummm, I don't have a passport. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DeMARTINO </b></center><br>
<center><p> (Hands her a passport.) </center>
<blockquote> Taken care of. </blockquote>
<center><p> (Snaps at her.) </center>
<blockquote> Your ANSWER, please? Or would you
RATHER I send someone else to Belgium in your place to LOAF around for
three weeks, and send your regrets to your PARENTS and COUSIN? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<center><p> (Resigned tone.) </center>
<blockquote> Okay, okay. I'll go.  </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DeMARTINO </b></center><br>
<center><p> (Sarcastic tone.) </center>
<blockquote> Thank you for your ENTHUSIASTIC
acceptance, Daria. Your flight leaves in two days. (Hands DARIA an
envelope.) You'll find your tickets, your instructions, and your
CONTACT INFORMATION for Bruges in this envelope. </blockquote>

<p>CUT TO CU of JANE and DARIA.

<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>
<center><p> (Smirks. To DARIA, in a fake French accent.) </center>
<blockquote> Just remember to find Remy and get zee microfeeelm, or else do not come back at all. Ze Free World 'angs on your every breath. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Great. Now, where's Q with my combination wristwatch/blowgun? </blockquote>

<p>INT. -- HALLWAY/LOCKERS -- DAY -- 10 MINUTES LATER.

<p>MS of DARIA and JANE walking down the hall POV SIDE.

<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> So, have you figured out why they want you out of the town for three weeks? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Unfortunately, no. But
knowing Quinn, she probably just saw it as an opportunity to get a free
vacation from me and score points with Mom and Dad. Hm. (Beat.) That
means that she must be up to something, because she doesn't usually
need to build up points with Mom and Dad. </blockquote>

<p>CUT TO CU of DARIA and JANE walking down the hall, POV FRONT.

<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> So, does that mean you won't go? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Much as I'd love to kick over Quinn's little sand castle, I don't think I can avoid going. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>
<center><p> (False Shock.) </center>
<blockquote> Does this mean that you've actually been outmaneuvered? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Hardly. I thought you knew me
better than that. (Beat.) No, Quinn couldn't have thought of this by
herself. (Beat.) Mom is behind this to get more extracurriculars on my
transcript. She knows I wouldn't turn down an opportunity to be away
from the family for three weeks. Especially if the school's paying for
it. Mom probably fooled Quinn into thinking that she'd get some kind of
perqs out of me not being there, but since they're going to be hosting
the exchange student, I bet Quinn ends up doing all of my chores.
(Grins.) </blockquote>

<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> So, does that mean you <i>will</i> go? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Well, it's not like Quinn
could sabotage the trip or anything. She can't even spell the word, let
alone understand what it means. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Well, do me a favor, and get me something uniquely Belgian when you get there. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Don't worry, I'm sure there's a waffle out there with your name on it. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>
<center><p> (Smiles.) </center>
<blockquote> Aw, that's awfully nice of you. </blockquote>

<p>CUT TO MS POV SIDE.

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Now, if I can just figure out
how the Gang of Four got swayed into agreeing to all of this, I'd feel
much better about the whole thing. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Why do you think they agreed on you? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Hm. They wanted someone whom
they knew wouldn't embarrass the school on an academic level, someone
who was observant enough to understand the differences between the two
countries' cultures, and someone who could competently report about it.
(Beat.) Damn. That's the hook. They knew I'd go just because I can't
resist the opportunity to see something different, and I won't be able
to resist writing about it either. I bet O'Neill was behind that part. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> That's kinda scary. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> I know. I wonder what else they've been planning? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Don't worry, we'll probably never even notice it when they implant the electrodes. </blockquote>

<p>BRITTANY runs to catch up to DARIA and JANE.

<center><p><b> BRITTANY </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Daria! Wait up! I need to ask you something! </blockquote>

<p>DARIA and JANE turn to face BRITTANY.

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Yes, Brittany? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> BRITTANY </b></center><br>
<blockquote> When you get to Belgium, can you do something for me? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<center><p> (Sighs.) </center>
<blockquote> What is it, Brittany? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> BRITTANY </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Can you get me some of that rouge that Mr. DeMartino was talking about? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<center><p> (Closes her eyes. Sighs.) </center>
<blockquote> Brittany, that's the name of the city.  Bruges.  It's a city in Belgium. They don't make rouge there. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> BRITTANY </b></center><br>
<center><p> (Confused.) </center>
<blockquote> They don't? (Beat.) Well, could you just get me some eye liner, then? Thanks! </blockquote>

<p>BRITTANY runs off in the direction she came from.

<p>CU of DARIA, as she turns to face the camera with a deadpan look on her face.

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Whatever I did to deserve this, it couldn't've been <i>that</i> bad. </blockquote>

<p>CUT BACK TO MS. JODIE walks up to DARIA and JANE from the other direction.

<center><p><b> JODIE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Hey, Daria, I just wanted to congratulate you on getting the trip. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Thanks. Didn't you apply? I thought this would be the sort of thing you'd love to do. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> JODIE </b></center><br>
<center><p> (In a wry manner.) </center>
<blockquote> Ordinarily, it would, but I've got
so much on my plate already that I can't afford to take three weeks to
actually do something that I might actually find interesting. (Starts
ticking items off on her fingers.) Instead, I get to baby-sit the
sophomore student council members, teach a group of young children to
read, work the next five Saturday mornings in the soup kitchen, go to
tennis practice four times a week, work on the yearbook, and somehow
manage to fit in time to study, eat, and sleep. (Beat.) Oh, yeah, and
still make time to see Mack-- whenever that happens. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Well, if you suddenly decide
to give in to the overwhelming urge to dump it all a start a new life
for yourself in Belgium, let me know before I leave and the ticket is
yours. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> JODIE </b></center><br>
<center><p> (Grumbles.) </center>
<blockquote> Don't tempt me. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>
<center><p> (Grins.) </center>
<blockquote> You could always say that you always
wanted to help disadvantaged Belgian youths truly understand the
American work ethic, and you just decided to Follow Your Dream. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> JODIE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> And spread the American
disease even more? It's bad enough as it is, let's not ruin anyone
else's lives. (Beat.) Daria, could you do me a favor while you're over
there? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Sure, name it. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> JODIE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Could you get me something uniquely Belgian? </blockquote>

<p>CUT TO CU DARIA. She gets her note pad out, and starts writing.

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<center><p> (Out loud, as she writes.) </center>
<blockquote> Get waffles for Jane and Jodie, eyeliner for Brittany. There. Did you want fries smothered in mayonnaise with that order? </blockquote>

<p>CUT BACK TO MS.

<center><p><b> JODIE </b></center><br>
<center><p> (Grins.) </center>
<blockquote> I'll trust your innate sense of good taste. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Then I should warn you that I have no sense of taste, fashion, or style. </blockquote>

<p>CUT TO CU JODIE.

<center><p><b> JODIE </b></center><br>
<center><p> (Shrugs.) </center>
<blockquote> Well, if all else fails, just get me a shot glass. </blockquote>

<p>CUT BACK TO MS.

<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> A shot glass? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> JODIE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Yeah, I get one wherever I
go. It serves two purposes-- I get a cheap memento without having to
waste time in gift shops, and it has the added benefit of irritating my
parents. </blockquote>

<p>JODIE grins.

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<center><p> (Smiles ever so slightly.) </center>
<blockquote> That's a nice tactic. I gotta make a note of that. Fat Elvis or skinny Elvis? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> JODIE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Surprise me. (Looks down at watch.) Whoops! See you guys later, I gotta go to practice. </blockquote>

<p>JODIE runs on through the scene from left to right.

<p>INT. MORGENDORFFER KITCHEN -- SAME DAY -- AFTERNOON.

<p>MS of MORGENDORFFER KITCHEN, POV
BACK WALL. QUINN is seated at the kitchen table facing the wall. She is
talking on the cordless phone.
<p>ZOOM IN to CU of QUINN as she talks on the phone.

<center><p><b> QUINN </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Yes, I'm sure. She won't pass
up a free trip to Europe or whatever, so she'll be out of the way for
the next three weeks. (Pauses.) Uh-huh. (Pauses.) Uh-huh. (Pauses.)
Sure, I'm sure! (Pauses.) Okay, bye! </blockquote>

<p>CUT TO WS of KITCHEN, SAME POV. DARIA has
paused in the doorway, and watches as QUINN hangs up the phone and
walks out the sliding door.
<p>ZOOM IN to MS of DARIA as she walks towards the kitchen table.  She picks up the cordless phone and dials *69.

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<blockquote> You mean you won? Congratulations, sweetie! </blockquote>

<center><p><b> HELEN </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Jake! Don't! </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> I was going to say that the interesting part is that I didn't even apply for it. </blockquote>

<blockquote> Really? </blockquote>

<p>CUT TO MS of DARIA and QUINN, POV BEHIND QUINN.

<center><p> (Looks at QUINN.) </center>
<blockquote> Yes, apparently someone claiming to be my <i>cousin</i> applied for me. </blockquote>

<p>CUT TO MS QUINN, POV BEHIND DARIA.

<center><p><b> QUINN </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Don't look at me, I didn't do
it. It's not like I want to do your chores while you're off wandering
around the world in Japan or whatever. </blockquote>

<p>The phone rings. QUINN picks it up.

<center><p><b> QUINN (CONT'D.) </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Hello? (Pauses.) Oh, <i>hi</i> Larry. Sure. (Walks away from the table.) </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> What? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> HELEN </b></center><br>
<blockquote> I just want you to promise to
be careful over there. You'll be travelling alone, and, well, I just
don't want anything to happen to you. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Don't worry. Since it's a school trip, I have to obey their rules at all times. </blockquote>

<p>MS of DARIA'S ROOM OBLIQUE POV
FRONT CORNER (Hall side). DARIA has put a small backpack on her bed,
and stands next to it, packing it, while JANE sits on the bed. Both are
watching TV.
<p>CUT TO XCU TV. A hand lifts a silver lid from a dish, revealing a plate of wriggling worms.

<p>CUT BACK TO MS OBLIQUE. JANE picks up a book titled "Let's Blow Through Europe."

<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> "Let's Blow Through Europe?" Where did you find this book? It still has a section on East Berlin. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> It may be a little dated, but
I figured it'd have some cool advice on travelling abroad. I refuse to
carry the chunky old travel guide that the golf pants crowd uses. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Here's something helpful-- did you know that the Tall Thing to Climb in Paris is the Eiffel Tower? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Yeah, it has other useful
advice, too, like "Don't bother trying to learn all of those languages.
They all speak perfectly good English over there." </blockquote>

<blockquote> So, you're going to go as the Ugly American? </blockquote>

<blockquote> Why not? It's something to do. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Did you find out anything about Quinn's little plans for the next three weeks? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Yeah. It's actually a little disappointing. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> What do you mean? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Well, it seems like all she's planning is some sort of lame get-together with her little friends. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Why is that disappointing? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> I don't know. I was just hoping that maybe she had something big planned, and I could somehow ruin it from afar. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Don't waste the energy. Save it for Bruges. (In the fake accent.) Remy will need all of your strength. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Exactly! </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> The only problem is, I don't like fun. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Daria, will you loosen up a
little? Most kids our age would kill to get this kind of opportunity.
So what if the Gang of Four, Helen, and Quinn are behind it? Sometimes
you've just got to grab an opportunity like this and just ride it-- see
where it goes. (Beat.) Has it ever occurred to you that maybe some of
these people <i>do</i> respect you? And that maybe your Mother wanted
you to have a little fun, too? Get some of that attention that Quinn
always seems to hog? (Beat.) And even if it does turn into a disaster,
so what? (Grins sardonically.) You'll get a great experience to write
about, and a whole new trauma to discuss with your therapist when you
turn forty. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<center><p> (Sighs.) </center>
<blockquote> Okay. I'm just suspicious when the
people I don't respect agree with the people I don't trust and send me
off to somewhere I've never been to stay with people I don't know.
(Beat.) But, since Remy does need my help, I'll try to relax. </blockquote>

all of the added work here as well. Surely you understand, Quinn? </blockquote>

interesting and worthy of our attention! I'll let you plan the guest
list, I'll arrange the "entertainment." This will be perfect!</blockquote>

<p>QUINN gulps a little nervously, as she is
getting out of her depth. SOPHIE knows a heck of a lot more about being

before I leave-- that'll give us plenty of time to prepare, and I can
rest up for it. You'll need time to rest too, Quinn. </blockquote>

that is that it's got to be better to live 4 hours away from London

to learn a few beauty tips from our visitor, or maybe a few helpful
hints at mass manipulation, because except for her ability to attract
every guy in a room, she doesn't really have any objectionable flaws.

way, even if it is a sort of curse. To be attractive and popular, and
envied and despised at the same time. If she had any depth, she'd ditch
that crowd, but she's still having fun. And getting the exchange was a
feather in her cap to make everyone else even more jealous of her. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> MIRJAM </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Well, Daria, goodbye. It has been nice having you, even though we didn't get to see very much of you. Helmut? (Beat.) Helmut! </blockquote>

<p>HELMUT turns to MIRJAM with a questioning look on his face.

<center><p><b> MIRJAM (CONT'D.) </b></center><br>
<center><p> (Grinding her teeth a little bit.) </center>
<blockquote> Please wish Daria here a nice trip back home. </blockquote>

<p>HELMUT smiles briefly at DARIA and nods, then goes back to his cell phone, nodding away. MIRJAM just shakes her head and sighs.

<p>ZOOM OUT TO include ANALISE and BERTHOLD.

<center><p><b> ANALISE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Have a nice trip back. (Beat.) (To MIRJAM.) Can we go now? I have a party to go to. </blockquote>

<p>BERTHOLD scowls at ANALISE.

<center><p><b> BERTHOLD </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Honestly, 'Lise, you're the

to DARIA, who shakes it.) Sorry about that. </blockquote>

<blockquote> It's okay. After 14 and a half years, I'm used to it by now. Thanks for showing me around. </blockquote>

<blockquote> Well, it's a good thing I didn't take you to the seedy side of town, then. Bon voyage! </blockquote>

<center><p><b> BERTHOLD </b></center><br>

<p>INT. LAWNDALE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- EVENING -- A FEW MINUTES LATER.

<p>MS of JAKE, HELEN, and QUINN (who doesn't look too thrilled to be at the stupid airport <i>again</i>.) JAKE and HELEN have goofy smiles plastered all over their faces.

<p>DARIA walks into the scene from the
LEFT. HELEN runs up to DARIA and gives her a hug. DARIA cringes a
little at the PDA, and HELEN releases her.
<center><p><b> HELEN </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Oh, sweetie! It's so good to have you back! </blockquote>

<p>JAKE grabs DARIA's backpack and almost knocks her off balance.

<blockquote> Have you been eating mushrooms from the front yard again? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> QUINN </b></center><br>

<p>DARIA and JANE walk off to the LEFT. PAN RIGHT TO MS of QUINN, SANDI, STACY, and TIFFANY.

<center><p><b> QUINN </b></center><br>
<center><p> (Irritated.) </center>
<blockquote> Look, I <i>said</i> I was sorry. I
didn't make up the guest list, and I didn't hand out the invitations.
And I told you before that my parents made me hang out with her. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> SANDI </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Quinn, I most definitely told you that I'd handle it, and you let her take over and mess everything up. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> QUINN </b></center><br>
<blockquote> You're just mad because your
date wound up talking to Sophie all night. (SANDI scowls at QUINN.) But
look, she's gone now. The boys will forget her soon enough. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> SANDI </b></center><br>
<blockquote> <i>They</i> might, but don't count on everyone to forget this incident anytime soon. </blockquote>

<p>SANDI walks off.

<center><p><b> TIFFANY </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Don't worry, Quinn, she's just mad that Michael ditched her for Sophie. She'll get over it. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> STACY </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Yeah, Quinn, don't worry about it. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> O'NEILL </b></center><br>
<blockquote> And now, class, please welcome back Daria from Belgium! Daria, we eagerly anticipate your report! </blockquote>

<p>CUT TO WS of CLASS, POV FRONT of ROOM. DARIA gets up from her desk and walks to the front of the room.

<p>CUT TO MS of DARIA and MR. O'NEILL, POV CLASS.

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Thank you, Mr. O'Neill.
Before I start my presentation, I'd like to thank Berthold van Rijn,
who served as my guide and camera assistant. I hope you enjoy this
slide show of sites of famous executions in England, Belgium, and
France. </blockquote>

<p>MR O'NEILL pales visibly.

<center><p><b> DARIA (CONT'D.) </b></center><br>
<blockquote> First slide, please. </blockquote>

<p>A slide of the Tower of London appears behind DARIA.

<center><p><b> DARIA (CONT'D.) </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Here we see the Tower of
London, where many a famous historical personage has spent time
enjoying its various sights such as -- next slide please -- </blockquote>

<p>A slide of a rack appears behind DARIA.

<center><p><b> DARIA (CONT'D.) </b></center><br>
<blockquote> --The rack. An early form of
the now-popular lie detector, the rack was used to ensure that people
were telling the truth by pulling their arms slowly from their sockets.
Next slide please. </blockquote>

<p>CUT TO CU of MR. O'NEILL, who is cringing.

<p>CUT BACK TO MS of DARIA, as a slide
of a small courtyard with a small stone tablet surrounded by a black
chain-link fence appears.
<center><p><b> DARIA (CONT'D.) </b></center><br>
<blockquote> After a good confession, the
guilty were then sent to an area such as this-- the place where Anne
Boleyn, one of Henry VIII's wives, was beheaded. In those days, it was
always the custom to tip the headsman a gold coin, to ensure he did a
neat job. </blockquote>

<p>DISSOLVE TO LAST SLIDE, of the BASTILLE.

<center><p><b> DARIA (CONT'D) </b></center><br>
<blockquote> ... and, finally, the French
inventor, Joseph Guillotin, finally found a way to save the condemned
that gold coin I mentioned earlier, with his invention of the
guillotine. Here at the Bastille, many condemned Frenchmen were given
quick, clean deaths, and could pass that gold coin on to the State.
That ends my report on my three weeks in Bruges. Any questions? </blockquote>

<p>There is a brief uncomfortable silence, which MR. O'NEILL quickly fills.

<center><p><b> O'NEILL </b></center><br>
<center><p> (Shaken.) </center>
<blockquote> Uh, thank you, Daria, for your very,
um.... interesting report on an, uh, aspect of European culture that
many of us haven't, um, had the opportunity to consider. </blockquote>

<p>CUT TO XCU DARIA. DARIA smiles that secret smile. "Gotcha!" is probably what she's thinking.

<p>INT. LAWNDALE HIGH SCHOOL. HALLWAY. -- DAY -- AFTER THE LAST CLASS.

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Well, they thought they had me pegged. I had to find a way to reestablish the balance of power. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Yeah, otherwise they might send you on those school's Outward Bound trip next month.</blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<center><p> (Cringes.) </center>
<blockquote> Don't even mention that around Quinn. She might get another stupid idea. Speaking of which... </blockquote>

<p>BRITTANY runs up to catch up with DARIA and JANE.

<center><p><b> BRITTANY </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Daria, did you get me my eye liner? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Huh? (Beat.) Oh, yeah, Brittany, I almost forgot. </blockquote>

<p>DARIA rummages around in her bookbag and hands BRITTANY a pencil.

<center><p><b> DARIA (CONT'D.) </b></center><br>
<blockquote> It's the latest in European cosmetics. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> BRITTANY </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Really? Wooow! And they made it look just like a Ticonderoga #2! They're really clever about design! </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Yeah, but don't mix it up with the rest of your pencils, though. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> BRITTANY </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Thanks, Daria! </blockquote>

<p>BRITTANY runs off.

<p>MS. LI approaches from the other side.

<center><p><b> LI </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Ms. Morgendorffer! A word with you, please! </blockquote>

<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Uh-oh... </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Yes, Ms. Li? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> LI </b></center><br>
<blockquote> I understand that we sent you
on a three week exchange to Europe, and all you had to report on was
the various methods of execution used through the ages? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Well, that wasn't all of the information that I was going to report. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> LI </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Really? What else did you learn on your trip? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<center><p> (Leans closer to Ms. LI.) </center>
<blockquote> Well, I met Ms. DeGroot, and she wanted me to report back to you that "the vulture circles hungrily over the fatted calf." </blockquote>

<center><p><b> LI </b></center><br>
<center><p> (Quickly and nervously.) </center>
<blockquote> Uh, oh, well, good work, Ms. Morgendorffer. Carry on! </blockquote>

<p>MS. LI walks quickly to her office.

<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> What was that all about? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Well, it turns out that Ms.
DeGroot used to work for NATO counter-intelligence. And now, I've just
managed to prove to my satisfaction that Ms. Li must still be working
in counter-intelligence-- other than in her role as Principal, I mean. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Which agency, do you think? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> What difference does it make?
This just gives me another bargaining chip for future use. It still
doesn't solve the final mystery, though. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Which one? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> The mystery of why Quinn put me up to this stupid trip in the first place. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Oh, come on, don't tell me you didn't have fun? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Well, yeah, of course I had
fun. Three weeks away from my family and Lawndale, the opportunity to
see some real cities, experience real culture, and, of course, the
opportunity to get one up on Ms. Li and Mr. O'Neill in one fell swoop.
But I still can't figure out why Quinn put me up to it in the first
place. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Oh, I figured that out a while ago. </blockquote>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>
<blockquote> Really? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>
<center><p> (Grins wickedly.) </center>
<blockquote> Yeah, because Quinn never filled out
the forms. (Beat. Pauses for effect.) I did, and I got your mother to
go in on it with me. </blockquote>

<p>DARIA looks at JANE, speechless. DARIA shakes
her head slowly, then covers her eyes. As she starts to walk away, JANE
follows her out of the scene.
<center><p><b> JANE (CONT'D.) </b></center><br>
<blockquote> What? You had fun, didn't you? Oh, come on, you can't tell me you didn't have fun, Daria. (Beat.) Daria? </blockquote>

<p>FADE OUT.

<p>ROLL CREDITS to "Roam," by the B-52's.

<br><br><br>


<p>NOTES:

<p>I'll add more notes later. This'll have to do for now. <a href="mailto:rich@paperpusher.simplenet.com">Email</a> me if you have questions, though.

<p>First off, I'll explain the title.
If you say "Free Quinn Fly Her" really fast, it sounds like "Frequent
Flier." I thought it was kinda cool. As for who "Her" refers to, well,
at first it refers to Daria, but after the party, it refers to Sophie.
"Unbargained For Exchange" was the original working title, but I liked
"Free Quinn" better for the finished product.
<p>Okay, I've never been to Belgium,
London, or Paris. I have travelled around Germany, Switzerland, and
France, and half of my family lives in Europe (Germany, mostly.) So,
while I do have some "European Experience," I did have to drop the
doughnut and do a little research. As usual, what I couldn't research,
I faked.
<p>Bruges? Why Bruges? Well, at first
it was going to be Brussels, so I could really play up the NATO angle,
but then a friend of mine pointed out the "Tick" episode where the Tick
gets sent to Brussels. So I picked Bruges, mostly because it rhymes
with "rouge," and gave me the cheap Brittany joke early in Act I.
<p>"Let's Blow Through Europe" is a
real book. The edition I have I got in 1989, but it's still funny, and
very much dead on about those college trips to Europe. They're all the
same.
<p>"Golf-clap." You know, like when
somebody makes a putt for par on one of those boring TV golf
tournaments. Polite, restrained applause.
<p>Quick turnaround on the mail...
isn't it a little unrealistic? Okay, I understand that ordinarily the
postal services of the various countries involved aren't nearly this
efficient, but hey, it <i>is</i> a work of fiction. Besides, it'd cost too much to phone from Belgium.

<p>Dr. Toungue's House of 8-Tracks?
Well, there actually is a club in Bruges called "Dr. Vinyl's." In order
to avoid being sued by Dr. Vinyl, I made up a fictitious place. I also
wanted to get in a gratuitous SCTV reference as well. (Does anyone else
remember Dr. Tongue's 3-D House of Stewardesses? Or any of the other
Dr. Tongue movies? Or am I the only sick, sad, soul?)
<p>PDA=Public Display of Affection.

<p>So, why no chemistry between Daria
and Berthold? Well, just cause. I dunno. Maybe there just weren't any
"sparks," beyond those that co-conspirators share. I also didn't want
to bog the story down with a gratuitous affair/romance.
<p>So, why no Trent? Please. I won't even dignify such a question with a response.
