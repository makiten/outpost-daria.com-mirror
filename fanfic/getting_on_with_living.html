<p class=MsoNormal><span class=postbody1><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:Verdana;letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane had decided, oh, five or six
seconds before, exactly what she wasn't going to do to the swelteringly
beautiful woman standing in front of her: </span></span><span style='font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:Verdana'><br>
<br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><i><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>I'm not going to take
this paint brush, turn it over in my hand and plunge it directly into her black
heart, sending her off to the hell of the hundreds of vampires turned into dust
by Buffy Summers over seven seasons of kick-ass TV - well, okay, five, because
the last two were so-so - gotta admit, though, it made my heart jump into my
throat when Willow slaughtered the fawn for the potion to bring Buffy back - </span></i></span><i><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Alright - say it with
me, everybody - <b>FOCUS! </b>Focus on the bitch who's just begging for the
right to get a taste of my left...</span></span></i><span class=postbody1><span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'> </span></span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>'<b>YOU</b> actually
dated Thomas? My God... I thought his taste was all in his navel.' The tall
redhead with the born-to-slink figure gave Jane yet another stare of absolute
disbelief. 'It seems that it's actually a half-turn around and several inches
down. I suppose that you do perform on all fours, yes?' </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>'For your information,
Beth-' </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>'That's 'Bethany'. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>'That's your problem,
not mine.' </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane was a good eight
inches smaller than the other woman, yet Bethany Chambers-Cullen flinched and
stepped back as Jane bore in on her, acutely aware of the crowd that had
silently coalesced about them in the W. J. Dakken Memorial Stone Gardens, one
of the larger exhibit areas at Boston Fine Arts College. 'You see, your problem
is that you can't see any man wanting to be around a woman unless she's
sleeping with him. That's your problem and that's sad, because, honey, what
you've got won't keep any man for too long if that's all you're offering -
especially when it gets compared to the younger models, or a man like Tom's
doing the comparing.' </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Bethany wilted; Jane had
struck a visible nerve. 'When Tom and I first met, he saw something different
in me-' </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>'Maybe him and a friend
at the same time,' Bethany spewed acidly. </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>'See? All you know is
sex.' Jane shook her head sadly. 'Let me spell it out for you. Tom liked me as
a person. I liked him as a person. It just didn't work out for us as a couple,
and although I don't exactly consider him a friend, he is a good man. He's
intelligent, adventurous, playful, he's able to appreciate other people for
what they are and what they're into... basically, he's a great guy!' </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>'Oh, so you're <i>over</i>
him?' </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Wasn't that hard -
unlike you, I was never <b>under</b> him.<b><i>' I can't believe that I
actually scored a kill on this bitch with a line from 'Friends'!</i></b> </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>'But that's your problem
in the first place; in or out of bed, you know that you ARE beneath him. You're
just mad that I'm not.' </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane turned and started
away. 'In any sense of the word.' </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The crowd parted
respectfully to let Jane pass, and Daria, closing a copy of 'The Sewing
Circle', rose from an outcropping of red marble to walk aside her. 'So, how
much of that did you actually mean?' </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>'All of it,' Jane said
airily. 'He's a great guy - just not for either of us. People have to learn to
move on with things, and see the good in what's happened in the past. If you
don't, you'll be trapped there forever.' </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>'Since when did you
become so philosophical?' </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>'Always have been, D.
How else could I have stayed friends with someone as bitchy as you?' </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>'So, now I know where my
bottle of milk went to last night... want an emery board to sharpen up those
claws a little more?' </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The two young women
shared a trademark smirk as they stepped through the large, stylish wooden
doors into the brisk crispness of the late Boston afternoon, their faces
luminous in the cinnammon- and burnt-orange that was the fading sun just above
the horizon. 'You know, having a family that's so wealthy that we can all have
serious issues and walk around like it also takes the edge off being played by
a guy, no matter how nice he is...' </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>A light just went off in
Daria's eyes. 'No. Tell me that <u>you</u> aren't the one that-' </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>'Ask me no questions,
and I'll not tell your dress size.' </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>'You did! You actually
did it!' </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>'Look, Ana already
wanted to go out with Penny and Penny didn't have any problems with that once
she saw Ana in that peasant blouse - I was just able to get something out of it
myself.' </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>'You got a Columbian
drug lord to threaten Tom about coming onto his daughter by having your sister
agree to go out with his sister, and scared him so badly that afterward, he
didn't go near a single girl during his entire freshman year at Bromwell,'
Daria mused, smiling as they started across the campus. Now that's a rich
girl's revenge. If we had that kind of cash, Quinn would do that twice a week.'
</span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>'Hey, sometimes you have
to do something stupid to finally let go, and 'Voodoo.com' shut down before I
could get their help,' Jane laughed, 'and if Quinn knew the type of money that
greases the wheels of the Lane gravy train, she'd probably have never left the me
alone. She'd have pestered me until I let her give me a makeover or had her
killed,' Jane sighed. 'She just never quits, does she?' </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>'Yeah, about my
sister...' </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>'Daria, I thought you
were past that!' </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>'No, I'm not thinking of
you having her sharing a queen-size with Luca Brasi; I'm just wondering about
something else.' </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Jane raised an eyebrow.
'And that is...?' </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>'Well, now that you're
actually over young master Thomas, I'm wondering about your next romantic
obsession,' Daria observed, her face in a textbook deadpan expression. 'You <b><i>do</i></b>
have a habit of hooking up with the most unexpected types in the most
unexpected ways -coughcough<b>BobbyBighead</b>coughcough - and somehow, you've
made a habit of always bringing up my sister in conversation recently.' </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>'I think your common
sense is floating off on that 'Raft' you're on.' </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>'Weak pun - proof that
you're zoning in on a target. Say, that day Quinn grabbed you out of my room
for something about colors or whatever; you never told me what she wanted.' </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>'No, I didn't,' Jane
said, and her sudden smile seemed to make everything looking in her general
direction feel breezy and light. 'However, food loosens my tongue. Feeling
homesick for Pizza King?' </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>'Oh, you <b><i>found </i></b>it!'
Daria exclaimed, her eyes lighting up. 'Lords of 'Za?' </span></span><br>
<br>
<span class=postbody1><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>'Lords of 'Za', ' Jane
agreed. 'First pie's on me.' </span></span><br>
