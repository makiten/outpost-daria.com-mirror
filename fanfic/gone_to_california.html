You will see it in my eyes<BR>
This girl will always find her way<BR>

(The girls bury the box and walk away laughing)<BR>
________________________________________________________________________<BR>
Hey! hope you likes it this is my first fanfic! I know that Daria was way out of character<BR>
and do was Jodie but thats the price you pay when you do a crossover right? It was<BR>
painful for me because i don't like to pair Daria up with Trent (I'm a Daria/ Tom shipper<BR>
kind of gal) but i couldn't think of any other character to play that part. So if you have<BR>
seen Crossroads you'll know what i meant. Anyways e-mail me and tell me what you<BR>
think of my first fanfic (I'm terrified lol!) Don't get mad at the characters not being<BR>
themself because i've read some fanfics and they had Daria so out of character so i'm not<BR>
