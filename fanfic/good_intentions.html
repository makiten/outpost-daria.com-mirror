<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, Daria, can I speak with you for a minute?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The halting, effeminate voice stopped Daria dead in her
tracks, even as it gave her feet the urge to dash forward.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Dammit, I almost made it out.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></i><span style='font-style:normal'>She
looked to her side and saw O'Neill beckoning to her, even as the rest of the
class rushed out the door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Seeing
the smiling face and vacant eyes, she could feel her shoulders slump as she
resigned herself to the inevitable interaction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hey, Daria," said Jane, standing at her side, "were you
making paper airplanes in class again?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You promised me we would work on the nuclear-tipped ones together."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The jibe gave Daria's spirits a brief
uplift.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Not yet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've
still got the uranium purifying.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Our clients deserve only the best."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, just remember to use the good stuff.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We don't want those Libyan terrorists
coming after us again."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane hiked
her bookbag higher up on her shoulder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"See you after math class.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Remember, don't look him directly in the eyes!"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This last was a parting shot as she
walked out the door, leaving Daria alone with their English teacher.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He pulled out a brochure from his desk
drawer as Daria approached.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria, I'm so glad we have the chance to talk," O'Neill
began, his voice vibrating with what Daria assumed was the closest his hourly
dose of lithium would allow him to get to excitement.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"I've just found out about a wonderful opportunity for you
to further develop your writing skills, a chance for you to travel higher on
the road to literary excellence in both an academic and a collaborative
environment."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He handed her the
brochure, upon which was printed <i>Young Writers Conference and Seminar,
Baltimore, MD</i><span style='font-style:normal'>.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"It's a chance for you to learn from many of the top writers
of our area, as well as to meet many of your fellow young writers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You can listen to real published
authors talk about their road to success, as well as have your own work heard
and critiqued &#8211; but not too harshly!<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&#8211; by other authors your own age.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Doesn't it just sound fantastic?!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Taking a cursory scan of the paper, Daria had to concede
that the idea had potential.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
recognized many of the listed speakers as actually good authors from in and
around the Baltimore area, some of whom she personally enjoyed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And she wasn't so arrogant as to
believe she was the only good student writer around; the idea of having her
work appraised by other talented writers was very appealing, since her work was
usually only appreciated by Jane, and not always by her.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It didn't look like such a bad way to
spend a Saturday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless,
she did her best to hide her interest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><i>No reason to let O'Neill think he might have actually hit upon a good
idea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That will just encourage him</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I suppose I could borrow Dad's car for a Saturday," she
said in monotone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, no, Daria," O'Neill replied.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"This is a school-sponsored event.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>You have to be accompanied by an approved educational
sponsor."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The warm flush of
interest drained from Daria's body.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You mean, you would have to take me."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her voice was now not just monotone,
but dead flat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes, Daria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Isn't it great?!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I want to
take you, along with my other most promising writer.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>To join you both in your great journey of inward discovery
and development.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Won't that be
fun?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A special experience just for
the three of us!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Other promising writer?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Oh, dear god, don't let it be Quinn!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></i><span style='font-style:normal'>"Don't
most male teachers get ten to twenty for having special experiences with their
female students?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria grinned
inwardly as O'Neill's face turned five different shades of red in as many
seconds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh . . . ah . . . well . . . um . . . that's not really the
kind of special experience I mean .<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria let him stammer on for a few more seconds before her
conscience got the better of her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's fine, Mr. O'Neill.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I know what you meant."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She didn't know whether to feel relieved or even guiltier at
his own massive sigh of relief.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, that's good, because you know I would never make any
unwelcome advances, Daria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I fully
respect your body and your personhood and your right to define your own
personal space and would never think of violating it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But, you know that if anyone else ever disrespected you in
such a fashion, that you could come to me and -- "</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes, I know," Daria butted in, hoping that she would never
again hear the words <i>I fully respect your body</i><span style='font-style:
normal'> come out of any teacher's mouth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"About this -- " she continued, waving the brochure.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I don't know.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm usually really busy on Saturdays
with schoolwork."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, please, think about it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It would be such a great growth opportunity for you."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'll think about it," she said.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It did still sound like a great idea, if she could manage to
ditch O'Neill and this other student.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>O'Neill almost bounced up and down with joy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That's so great, Daria, really!<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I just know you won't regret it if you go.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe we can even make this a yearly
event for us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The student writer
and her mentor, studying annually at the feet of the masters."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I just hope they've been washed," Daria replied.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The likelihood of her accepting the
offer had taken another big step downward.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"I have to be off to my next class now.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>DeMartino hates it when we're
late."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria exited quickly,
sliding the brochure into her jacket pocket.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal>"I think you should go for it," Jane said as they trudged
home from school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Are you sure?" Daria replied, raising an eyebrow.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"It means a day with O'Neill, not to
mention whatever other Lawndale High student he's pegged as having
'potential'.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Remember, this is the
same man who gave Quinn an 'A' for 'Academic Imprisonment'."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Just do what I did that time we had to ride home with him
from the theater &#8211; jump in the back seat and pretend you can't hear
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you're lucky, the other
student will be riding shotgun, and O'Neill will spend the whole time pestering
<i>him</i><span style='font-style:normal'>."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Jane, when am I ever lucky?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Then you'll still just have to deal with one nitwit, not
two.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe the other rider will be
a cute senior."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane's grin was
evil.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Riding with cute boys in the backseat is more Quinn's life
than mine."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A nagging worry in the
back of Daria's mind surfaced again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"This other writer had better not be Quinn.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>That essay still haunts me."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Why would it be?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She hasn't done anything brainy since then."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane shrugged.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"I'd say you scared her back into the fashion fold pretty thoroughly."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You make it sound like a bad thing."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You put Quinn in her place, regained your status as the
brain of the school, and all was right with the world.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Works for me.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But if you're so worried that it was Quinn, why didn't you
just ask?"<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I should have, but I decided instead to take the perfect

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, it backfired on me a bit, but it was still worth
it."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even with the aftermath,
though, Daria still relished the memory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"But you're right, it wouldn't be Quinn.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Even if he asked her, she would never say yes, and waste an
entire Saturday on something as geeky as a writer's conference."<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Whereas you, on the other hand, have nothing better to do
on a Saturday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You might as well
spend it at a writer's conference, rather than in your room plotting world
domination, or watching <i>Sick, Sad World</i><span style='font-style:normal'>
at my place."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Not until something better comes along, which it
hasn't.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But seriously, I really
think this would be good for you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I've told you before, I believe in a community of artists, and you
aren't going to get that here in Lawndale.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, I might be spending this summer at an artist's
colony myself."<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You're going away for the summer?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Who's going to hold me back when I finally go after my
family with an axe?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria wasn't
certain to what extent she was kidding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Now that she had her, the idea of a summer without Jane was appalling.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I don't know," Jane replied, looking a little guilty.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Maybe.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I haven't been accepted yet.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And you're right, a whole summer is a very long time.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But if I do go, it won't be to get away
from you, but to bask in the glow of my fellow artists.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A whole summer of talking art with
people who don't look at me sideways when they see my work."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane's lips turned up slightly at the
corners.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"It's a great feeling,
believe me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is your chance to
get the same thing, even if it's just for a day.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>You're always saying how you can't wait to get out of this
town and around some people who actually appreciate intelligence.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I can't believe you're not jumping at
this chance."<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You're starting to sound like O'Neill."<span

real insult was intended.<o:p></o:p></p>

talking about.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Go, mingle,
learn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ditch O'Neill and the other
student if you can, and if you can't, have some fun messing with their minds
between lectures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Or find someone
more interesting to spend time with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class=MsoNormal>The chilly Saturday morning air rushed Daria from the front
door of her home into the back door of O'Neill's car, her face and eyes lowered
against the wind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She dropped
herself into the empty seat and faced forward, quickly noticing that the only
occupied place in the front of the car was behind the steering wheel, where
O'Neill was glancing at her through the rear-view mirror, his mouth already
assuming a vacuous smile of welcome.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She could feel a presence beside her, and knew that she had not been so
lucky as to be the first on O'Neill's route, to claim the rear for
herself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She turned to ascertain
the identity of her so-far silent fellow passenger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Stacy?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, hi . . . Daria," Stacy replied hesitantly, eyes
wide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She bit her lower lip.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Um, Quinn's . . . cousin, right?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Something like that," Daria said, not able to keep the
sneer completely out of her voice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

how low are O'Neill's standards, anyway?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

verisimilitude.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"It's too noisy

<p class=MsoNormal>"I just want to tell you that I loved the story you read at
the coffeehouse last year."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Stacy's earnest comment caught Daria off-guard.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Of all the things she had expected to
hear from Quinn's pig-tailed friend, that was the lowest on the list.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was so surprised that, for a few
seconds, she was speechless.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stacy
looked at her a little funny.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh . . . ah . . . thank you," she finally stammered out, in
her uncertainty going with the safe and expected reply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's too bad that all those jocks rioted and the place got

just be so . . . stupid, you know?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Should I tell her that was the reaction I was hoping for,
and really freak her out?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></i><span
style='font-style:normal'>The idea had a sadistic appeal, but she had heard
Quinn talk about Stacy in a panic, and she didn't think she was prepared to
deal with a hysterical teenage girl.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></span><i>Besides, she was complimenting my work.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How big of a jerk would I be if I took
a potshot at her for that?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And she
did say jocks are stupid, so maybe she's not all bad.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Are you going to read another story today?" Stacy went
on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"They're supposed to have
workshops where we read our stories to each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I brought some of mine."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She held up the notebook she had been clutching in her lap,
it's dark blue cover bejeweled with sequins and little red hearts.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Cute.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>All it needs is a unicorn standing under a rainbow</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a
matter of fact, Daria had brought "In the Cards", the story she had written for
O'Neill near the end of the last school year.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite a certain sentimental tone, it was still one of her
favorites; she hoped to get some advice on how to reduce the sentimentality
while keeping the kernel of the story alive.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"I hope they like them," Stacy went on, her expression
darkening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"It would be horrible
if everyone told me that my stories were awful and I had no talent."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now tears started to form.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"What if they do, Daria?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What if everybody laughs at me, like
Sandi does when I wear sandals with the wrong dress?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>What if I'm no good, Daria?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I really, really want to be good at something .<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her cheeks were now
coated in salty tracks, and her voice choked.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal>It took most of the trip to get Stacy calmed down, Daria
awkwardly patting her on the back and offering half-hearted assurances that
everything would be alright, with O'Neill providing what support he could from
the front seat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Eventually the
tears stopped flowing, by which time her mascara was running and her makeup
smeared, leaving Stacy looking like some demented clown.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The only way they could calm her down
then was to pull over and let her in the front, where she could meticulously
fix herself up by the visor mirror.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Finally left blissfully alone in the back, Daria spent the rest of the
drive into Baltimore perusing the schedule of talks in the brochure, mentally
checking off the ones which seemed the most interesting and useful, planning
out her day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When they arrived at the convention center, O'Neill went to
sign them in, leaving Daria and Stacy standing briefly alone in the enormous,
high-ceilinged room, only partly filled with milling high school students.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stacy edged slightly closer to Daria, a
nervous expression on her face as she looked around at the room filled with
strangers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria had to fight an
urge to edge away; she didn't want to set the girl off again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I didn't know there were so many young writers around," she
told Daria in a small voice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I
don't know anyone else who writes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Well, except for you, of course, and that weird goth girl from the
coffeehouse."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"The rocks we all live under are in the unfashionable part
of town," Daria replied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"We only
come out into the light for conferences, coffeehouses, and alcohol binges.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Don't worry; as soon as this is over,
we'll all go scurrying back under cover again."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You don't really go on drinking binges, do you?"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stacy's eyes were wide.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I mean, you're unfashionable, but you
always seemed to be pretty together."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><i>Is that actually concern in her voice, or did I just freak her
out?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></i><span style='font-style:

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, Stacy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
was joking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't drink or do
drugs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy Reagan would be so
proud."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Please don't ask me who
that is.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm glad to hear that," Stacy said, and it seemed to be
sincere.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>O'Neill chose that increasingly uncomfortable moment to make
a reappearance, two rectangular pieces of paper stuck to his left hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I've got both of you registered, and here are your nametags
.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He waved the
pieces of paper at them, and peeled one of them off his left hand with his
right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For a split second, he made
as if to place the tag on Daria's chest, but then his hand froze as he realized
where it was headed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He swallowed
heavily, and looked uncertain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Before she had to deal with yet another breakdown, Daria yanked the
sticky square off his fingers and slapped it on her left breast, noticing that
it was emblazoned with the name "Dora".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><i>Now, what shall we name the other one?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span></i><span style='font-style:normal'>she thought.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stacy did something similar, but with a
good bit more grace.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><i>Her</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> name, Daria noted, was technically correct, but
spelled "Stacie".</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Now, we're all ready!" O'Neill said, waving to his own
cartouche.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"There's so many
interesting talks to choose from.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It's all so exciting!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Oh,
look, they've got Honeytree Jones talking on "Finding Your Inner Poet".<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I just love her books; they're so
inspiring."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Then go, be inspired," Daria said, not daring to hope that
getting rid of him could be that easy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>O'Neill looked off to the side, then back to Daria and Stacy, and
repeated the motion several times, his face drawn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"But I don't want either of you to feel abandoned.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The loss of an authority figure can be
such a traumatic event in the life of a young woman.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I would hate to be the cause of some later neurosis."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Don't think of it as abandoning us," Daria replied, feeling
the muscles in her eyes wanting to roll.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"Think of it as pushing us out of the nest so we can learn how to fly,
like a mother eagle."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria had to
fight hard to keep the sarcasm out of her voice, and she didn't think she was
fully successful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, Daria, that was so beautiful!" O'Neill gushed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I can see you've already found your
inner poet, so you free me to find mine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I feel much better about it now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I'll see both of you later today."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>With a cheerful wave, he was off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria, that was so smart," Stacy said.<span

feel better."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Really?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"So," Stacy said, looking over Daria's shoulder at the
schedule, "where are we going first?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>We?!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></i><span

<p class=MsoNormal><i>What is wrong with this girl?<span style="mso-spacerun:

style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She couldn't, or didn't want to,

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria's prediction proved all too true.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At each lecture Daria attended &#8211;
"Constructing Characters", "Science Fiction and other Fantastic Writing",
"Getting Published", "Humor and Story", and others &#8211; Stacy was right
there beside her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria took every
opportunity she could to suggest that Stacy might find lectures of her own
choosing to be more interesting, but each time Stacy demurred, stating that she
trusted Daria's choices more than her own, her abdication of responsibility
adding yet another level of discomfort to Daria's situation.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Several times, Daria wondered if Stacy
had ever made a single decision on her own in her entire life, or if she had
always just attached herself to the nearest stronger personality to do her
thinking for her &#8211; first Sandi, and now, under these circumstances,
Daria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She wondered if Stacy were
ever trapped alone on a desert island, if she would do anything at all.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A part of her really wanted to try the
experiment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Still, it could have been worse.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>While she harassed Daria between classes with her constant
babbling, during the lectures she was very focused, paying close attention and
taking numerous notes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And the
whole time, she never said a single word about fashion, cuteness, or
popularity, spending all her words instead on the various writers she enjoyed
&#8211; never had Daria heard so much discourse on Judy Blume &#8211; and
requests to Daria to clarify various aspects of the lecture they had just
attended.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Requests Daria felt
honor-bound to answer, though she tried to do so as curtly as possible to
discourage further questions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Daria couldn't deny, though, feeling a certain amount of satisfaction in
the attention; a member of the school's precious Fashion Club was looking to <i>her</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>, the unpopular girl, for guidance.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was a victory of sorts over the
shallow values of Lawndale High life as usual.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And once she began to get used to the constant stream of
verbiage, the attention just felt </span><i>good</i><span style='font-style:
normal'>, though she hated to admit it to herself.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>That didn't mean that the situation was in any way ideal,
but there was a distinct silver lining she would not have predicted, especially
since they were able to avoid O'Neill for the rest of the day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, at the end of the day, came the final workshop, the
lynchpin of the entire conference.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>All the students were divided in groups of four and five, and each
student was to read a short work to be evaluated and critiqued by the other
members of their group.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria had
originally been looking forward to this, to both giving and receiving real
criticism with other writers, but as her day with Stacy had wore on, she had
begun to dread it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She would be
forced to listen to some doubtlessly dreadful piece of writing from her &#8211;
"A Day at Cashman's", perhaps, or "The Day My Boyfriend Broke Up With Me"
&#8211; and be forced to one of two choices, to either lie to preserve the
girl's feelings and ensure a pleasant ride home, or tell the truth and crush
her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was still Stacy, after
all, and even though she had not proven to be as odious a companion as she had
feared, this was still the girl who would spend hours talking to Quinn about
scrunchies and sundresses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So, as
Daria and Stacy took their places in the circle of four, Daria felt a twinge of
real resentment towards her companion, for spoiling an experience Daria had
been anticipating, even if Stacy had no idea what she had done.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She noted that Stacy was apparently even
more nervous about the workshop, though; her face was white and her eyes wide
as they took their places.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
locked her gaze with Daria's in a plea for silent support, making Daria feel
about ten inches tall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>How am I
supposed to be honest to </i><span style='font-style:normal'>that</span><i>?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But if I just tell her what she wants
to hear, what's the point of all of this?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Damn you, Stacy, I never asked for a follower!</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since Stacy was on the verge of a breakdown, and Daria was
still trying to decide how to handle the situation, the other two members of
the group presented their stories first.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A smartly-dressed, bespectacled girl named Bethany read a poem about
love of nature, and a geeky-looking, rather scruffy boy whose nametag
proclaimed him to be David read a sci-fi story.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither were bad, though neither were brilliant either, and
the other members of the group spent about half an hour making suggestions for
improvement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria made a point of
toning down her usual sarcasm, more for Stacy's sake than for the others, and
she was relieved to see that as the discussion went on, Stacy slowly regained
her usual color, and even gained enough confidence to participate, though she
never said anything that was not positive.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Still, Daria was encouraged that she did not react badly to
hearing the gentle criticisms offered by the other members of the group.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Hearing it about others isn't the
same thing as hearing it about your own work, though.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next was Daria's turn, and she spent about 10 minutes
reading "In the Cards", to a very positive response.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>David and Bethany thought that the story was touching, which
was doubly reassuring to Daria, since they had no personal experience with her
family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stacy was the most
effusive of all in her praise, which was coupled with a wistful smile that
Daria thought probably had less to do with the story and more to do with the
portrayal of Quinn's future within.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The other two agreed with her that the tone of the story was a bit
sentimental, and suggested that it may have been better to not portray the
future as so perfect, but as a whole, it was a success.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was now Stacy's turn, and all the ease she had gained
over the past 45 minutes or so vanished.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She opened up her notebook with trembling hands, that
colorfully-decorated cover doing nothing to alleviate Daria's fears, and took a
few breaths.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'd &#8211; I'd &#8211; I'd like to read a story called . .
. um, 'Sisters'."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She paused to
steady her voice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I wrote it
about . . . well, I was going through . . . um, that doesn't really matter, I
suppose."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was clearly
terrified, and Bethany reached out and touched her knee in a soothing
gesture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stacy smiled shyly.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Anyway, here it is."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Here it comes</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria
braced herself, not reassured by what already sounded like an overly-treacly
intro.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But, as Stacy read, Daria was shocked to discover that her
fears were almost completely unjustified.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Stacy's style was engaging and personal, drawing the reader in like an
old friend, and her vocabulary was surprisingly strong for someone who
willingly spent time with Tiffany Blum-Deckler.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria had to acknowledge that, in terms of style, Stacy
might very well be her superior; she easily drew emotion from the reader that
Daria had to fight for.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even more
important, the story itself was powerful, and Daria could feel it tugging at
the heartstrings she thought she had cut long ago.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She told of two sisters where the younger was always looking
up to the older, seeking guidance and advice, while the older simply used the
younger for her own ends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria
couldn't help but wonder if it wasn't derived from Stacy's own experiences with
Sandi, and if so, if Stacy knew it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was a sad, lonely tale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The story was not without its flaws, however.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In Daria's opinion, it veered too often
into melodrama, sacrificing believability for even more emotion.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It also had a tendency to wander and
lose focus, diluting some of its emotional power, and the pacing felt a bit
off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria knew that these were
areas in which she excelled, so she felt confident in her judgment, if not in
how to let Stacy know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Maybe
I'll be lucky, and the others will say it for me.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I might still have to deal with a weeping Stacy all the way
home, but at least my own conscience will be clear of it.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By the time Stacy was finished, Bethany was in tears, though
David seemed a bit bored.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stacy
had gained confidence as she had read, becoming absorbed in her own work, but
as soon as she was done she clutched her notebook to her chest and looked at
each of them, her eyes begging for approval.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, Stacy, that was beautiful," Bethany gushed through her
tears.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"That's one of the best,
saddest things I've ever heard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They should make a movie out of it."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Stacy nearly lept out of her seat to embrace the other girl.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!" she said.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"No one's ever told me anything like
that about one of my stories before!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I mean, Sandi always laughed at me for trying, and my parents are always
telling me that I'll never make any money writing.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And O'Neill always told me I was good, but he says that to
everybody.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thank you!"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They broke the embrace after a few more
seconds, and Stacy turned to David and Daria for their opinions, her mouth
twitching between a delighted smile and a worried frown.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It was OK, I guess," David said, still sounding bored.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stacy's mouth began to twitch faster,
and he quickly amended his statement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"I'm sorry, but it just sounded like a chick story to me.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't mean that it's bad; I just
don't feel qualified to comment because I just can't relate.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I think your writing was
good."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stacy nodded, seeming to
accept this, and turned to Daria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She was biting her bottom lip and her knuckles were white from clutching
her notebook, even more so than she had been for the others.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Oh, great, it's my turn.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And she obviously values my
opinion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What to say?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At least I can start with the positive;
at least there's positive to start with.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I think it was good, overall," Daria began, and Stacy's
expression immediately relaxed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"Your style is easy to hear, and I imagine is probably easy to
read.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You clearly know how to tell
a story.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I think that, on the
whole, based on what I've heard, you're a good writer, Stacy."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A huge grin split Stacy's face, and she
made to jump up and embrace Daria as well, but Daria held out her hand.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She sat back down, and waited
expectantly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>So, do I tell her the truth?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I think I have to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It wouldn't be right to hold back; that's the reason she's here, after
all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She's already been told by
two of us that she's a good writer; hopefully, she'll be able to handle a
little criticism now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I have to be
as gentle as possible, though.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That being said, there are a few things that could be
improved upon."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stacy visibly
gulped, but otherwise controlled herself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"You know how to tell a story well, but you seem a bit fuzzy on how to
put one together."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She went on to
outline, as dispassionately as she could, the flaws she had seen, and gave a
few off-the-cuff ideas on how to improve them.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>To her credit, Stacy accepted the criticism in silence, with
no hysteria or tears, even jotting down a few notes.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria went on for a few minutes, and by the time she was
done, it was time for the workshop &#8211; and the conference &#8211; to be
over.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria and Stacy said goodbye
to Bethany and David, Stacy and Bethany exchanging email addresses, then walked
out to the main foyer to look for Mr. O'Neill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For much of the ride home, Stacy was uncharacteristically
silent, looking out her window as Daria sat next to her, going over her notes
from the various sessions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Shortly
before reaching Lawndale, she turned her gaze over to Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria, can I ask you something?"<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">&nbsp; </span>Her face was so serious that Daria surpressed her usual
sarcastic reply to such an inquiry, and gave a simple affirmative.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"All those things you told me that I
could do better in my stories . . . you're really good at those, I can
tell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've . . . um, always wanted
to write a story with someone else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It seems like it would be a really fun thing to do, especially if the
other person is a really good writer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Would you write a story with me?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You could help me do everything right.<span style="mso-spacerun:

with her wasn't that bad, but I don't want to always have to be watching what I
say so I don't freak her out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And
I have the feeling we really don't write the same kind of stories.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></i><span style='font-style:normal'>Still,
the idea of being a mentor did have its appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And she knew that, if Stacy could learn from her, she could
also learn a few things from Stacy as well.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But that wasn't enough of a reason to put herself through a
collaboration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria, please!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span>I really want to be a good writer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Sandi's always telling me that it's a waste of time, that I should just
worry about being cute, and that no cool boys will like a girl who writes, but
there were a lot of cute girls there today and some cute boys too, so that may
not be true.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And I'm not really

and was concerned that it could make her sound like either a nut with a

would be Jane.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I think this is my

rose ever so slightly as she began to warm to her subject.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"After spending a day with her, I don't
think Stacy really fits with the rest of the Fashion Club.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Most likely, she was looking for some
group to identify with, and Sandi was the strongest personality around.<span

needs her and that group, but I think she's denying who she really is.<span

might have the confidence to go it alone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Imagine what it would do for Stacy if I could break her away from
Sandi's grip, show her all the other things out there besides clothes, make-up,
and boys.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There might be a real
person down there, hidden underneath the fashion drone.<span

<p class=MsoNormal>That next Saturday morning, giving Daria the least amount of
time possible to wake and shower and shake off the last few remnants of
unconsciousness, Stacy arrived, cute notebook in hand, eager to begin.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria motioned for her to sit on the
bed, as she took the desk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stacy
sat, but it seemed an impermanent gesture; she looked ready to jump back up
again at a moment's notice, her gleeful energy too great to be satisfied with
such a stationary condition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
sat in silent for a few seconds as they looked at each other, Stacy bright-eyed
and Daria a little bit wary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Stacy's eyes then dimmed a bit, and she leaned in as close as she could
get.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria, do you think Quinn knows I'm here?"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her eyes darted quickly to the door,
then to the wall that separated Daria's domain from her sister's.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"You didn't tell her anything, did
you?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The eager eyes were now
rimmed with anxiety.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That would require me to willingly converse with her,"
Daria replied wryly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Don't worry;
this will never get back to the Fashion Club.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>My room is a fashion-free zone.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>You're still in good standing with Sandi the queen
bee."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stacy looked doubtful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm never really in good standing with Sandi."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her gaze was now completely
downcast.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"There are just so many
ways to mess up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nothing's ever
good enough for her."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>If I'm good enough, you won't have to worry about that
much longer</i><span style='font-style:normal'>, Daria thought with secret
satisfaction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><i>But we'd
better get started, before she loses it completely and the whole morning is a
waste.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Did you bring any stories to work on?" Daria asked.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Almost immediately, Stacy brightened up
and flipped to the back of her notebook.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes, I've got all sorts of ideas," she said, handing it
over.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Whenever I get an idea for
a new story, I write it down here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Most of them, I never do anything with, but a few really inspire me."<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria looked over the list of hastily scribbled story
seeds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As Stacy said, most of them
weren't that great, but a few looked promising.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><i>I can work with this.</i><span style='font-style:normal'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Do you have an outline for any of these?"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stacy just blinked in surprise.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Do I need
one?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now it was Daria's turn to
react with amazement.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How do
you expect to know where you are going without an outline to follow?"<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I don't.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
just start writing and see where it takes me.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I like to be surprised by where the story goes."<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria could feel her neck muscles wanting to shake her head
back and forth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>She has so much
to learn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I came along just in
time, it seems.</i><span style='font-style:normal'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That certainly explains a lot," she said, trying not to let
her amazement show through too clearly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"Stacy, that's why those stories you gave me to read are so
unfocused.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When you don't have a
clear plan, you can't organize around central themes, you can't foreshadow
later events, you can't tie everything together.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>You just wander from scene to scene."<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"But . . . that story I read at the conference, the one
everyone said they liked . . . that's how I wrote it."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stacy's breath quickened.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Were they lying to me?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Did everybody really hate it?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Were they all laughing at me behind my
back?!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her eyes widened to
saucers, and her breath began to catch.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, Stacy!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Daria felt a bit of panic herself, not knowing if she could deal with
this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"That story was good.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Everyone really did like it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No one was laughing at you."<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Are . . . you . . . sure?"<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm sure, and I don't lie.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>You wrote a good story."<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That seemed to do the trick.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Stacy's breath slowed and the color diffused back into her
cheeks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She took a few more
moments to compose herself.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"So it really was a good story?"<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes, Stacy, it was."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><i>God, is this what Quinn has to deal with all the time?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I never thought I would feel sympathy
for her.</i><span style='font-style:normal'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"But I wrote it without an outline."<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You got lucky," Daria said.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"It still wanders a bit, though, and it would probably have
been better had you thought it out beforehand.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>A good story is one that has been gone over with a
fine-toothed comb, all the unnecessary material cut out to emphasize what's
important.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You can't get that by
just going with whatever you feel at the time."<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"But .<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Stacy's voice was tentative, and she was starting to slouch
down into her seat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I enjoy
seeing where the story is going to take me.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I like to be surprised.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>That's the fun of writing.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>At least . . . it is for me."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This last was barely audible.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Fun?" Daria said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"Writing isn't about fun."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>If
she doesn't take this seriously, I don't know if I can help her.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></i><span style='font-style:normal'>Stacy
looked simply dumbfounded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You don't think writing is fun?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Why do you do it?"<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The question caught Daria off-guard.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She had always just been a writer.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It came naturally to her.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She had to think to disentangle and
verbalize her feelings on the matter.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"There's a real satisfaction in the completed work.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I enjoy the feeling of having created
something, of having contributed to the world of literature.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I like the idea of something that will
live on after me."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Yes, I think
that sums it up pretty nicely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></i><span
style='font-style:normal'>"But the actual writing process itself is hard
work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you treat it as just a
game, something to have </span><i>fun</i><span style='font-style:normal'> with,
then you'll never produce anything great."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I don't know that I want to write something 'great'," Stacy
said with a demure shrug.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I just
want to be <i>good</i><span style='font-style:normal'>, and write stories that
people will like.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've always
thought I could do that and have fun, too."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Maybe someday you will," Daria said, relying heavily on
what patience she had.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Maybe,
when you are good enough, you'll be able to write good stuff easily enough to
enjoy it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I haven't reached that
point yet, but I won't deny that it exists.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But you'll never reach it if you're concentrating on just
having fun.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Writing is hard, but
if you're willing to put the work in, I think you can become 'good', though I
would hope you wouldn't be content with stopping there."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>No wonder she's so content to stay
in Sandi's shadow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I think there's
still hope, but I'm going to have to push her.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Damn it, she's really going to make me work.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></i><span style='font-style:normal'>"So,
are you willing to work, and be serious about it?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes, I am, Daria," Stacy replied, squaring her shoulders
like a soldier preparing for battle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"I promise I'll try to be more serious."<span style="mso-spacerun:

from school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"How goes the
emancipation of Stacy Rowe?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria
just groaned in response.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"That
bad, huh?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's like the girl has no clue how to construct a realistic
story," Daria said in a strained tone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"Not only did she have some crazy idea that we could just start writing
and 'see where it takes us', but she doesn't seem to see the importance of
character or continuity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I keep
trying to steer her towards a straightforward, character-driven plot for the
sake of simplicity, so she can learn how to really perfect a basic story before
she tries something complex, and she keeps throwing in all these off-the-wall
developments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She wants people to
act out of character for the sake of melodrama, and is always asking me what we
are going to do for a plot twist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She puts excitement above all else.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I keep having to remind her that stories are about more than
just cheap thrills, that the ones that really last are those where the
characters and situations are consistent and believable."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"But weren't you telling me a few days ago about how
promising she is, and how good that one story was?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It was, and a lot of her ideas have real potential, if she
learns how to use them correctly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But she has no discretion, no clue as to when an idea will work and when
it needs to be kept out for the sake of the overall story."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria shook her head<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"She just wants to throw a bunch of
plot elements at the wall and see which ones stick.<span style="mso-spacerun:

</span>So far, I've been pretty patient about it and haven't challenged her on
some of them, but I'm nearing my limits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class=MsoNormal>"Maybe that's not what Stacy wants, even deep down," Jane

<p class=MsoNormal>The hands on Stacy's watch ticked inexorably towards four,
but with just a few minutes to spare, Sandi and Quinn were still heavily
involved in their debate over strappies and strapless dresses in relation to
the upcoming spring season, with no signs of stopping.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stacy found herself bouncing in her
seat, body torn between jumping up and running off to Daria, or staying put
until the official end of the meeting, when she could leave without suspicion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Oh, why can't they just shut up about it</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>, she thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></span><i>Daria really doesn't like it when I'm late, and I can already
tell that I'm getting on her nerves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But Sandi hates it when I leave early, and if she gets too mad at me,
she'll make me organize her lip glosses again.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Or kick me out of the club altogether, and then no one will
like me anymore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I wish Quinn were
president.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But she would think me
writing with her sister was too brainy, too.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Oh, I really need to go.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe they'll just think I need to use the little girl's room.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></i><span style='font-style:normal'>She
giggled, and immediately Sandi turned to her with scorn on her face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Stacy," Sandi said in her deep, almost lisping voice, "do
you find something funny about the upcoming spring dress line?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, no, Sandi," she replied, the words coming out as a
squeak as she hurried to repair whatever additional damage she had caused, "not
at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's really
important.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was just thinking
about something else, that was all."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She knew as soon as the words were out of her mouth that her explanation
was a mistake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Stacy, as Fashion Club Secretary, it is your duty to treat
all subjects as serious and record them with the proper gravity.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Also, letting your mind wander during
an important debate is simply unacceptable.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>If you do not begin to treat your duties with the proper
amount of respect, then we will be forced to put your membership on
probationary status until such time as you have proven yourself worthy of the
dignity of your position.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Is that
clear?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stacy had to catch her breath before answering, as she had
lost nearly all of it during this diatribe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Of course, Sandi, whatever you say."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She nodded jerkily several times to
reinforce her acceptance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Um . .
. the thing is . . . um, I really need to go right now."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Oh, god, she's going to kill me.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But if I'm much later, Daria will kill
me.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Indeed, it appeared that Stacy's prediction was about to
come true.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sandi's eyes narrowed
and her mouth tightened into the expression that always sent fear straight
through Stacy's heart and into her very gut.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She squeaked again and was about to back down, no matter
what the later consequences, when help arrived from an unexpected quarter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, Sandi, I forgot to tell you," Quinn said breezily.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"There's a sale on moisturizer at the
mall, and I asked Stacy to run down and get me some before they were all sold
out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You know how it gets after
rush hour; all the moisturizer will be gone in an hour or so.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stacy needs to hurry to make sure she
gets there well in advance."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stacy
just stared at Quinn in open-mouthed shock until Quinn nudged her with her
foot; then, Stacy jumped up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, yes, that's why I have to go," she said.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"And I need to leave right now."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Very well, then," Sandi said with an imperious wave.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"As Quinn is your superior Fashion Club
officer, this can be considered official business.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But you will need to get enough for everyone.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And come see me tonight to find out
what discussion you missed out on."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"OK, great," Stacy said.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>With one more curious glance at Quinn, she raced out of the
door, mind already switching to writing mode.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In short order, Stacy bounded into

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Hey, Daria!&quot; she began,
nearly breathless.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I had
this great new idea walking over here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I think we should have Diane turn out to be Angela's long-lost
sister!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That way, when Jim finds
out about them &#8212;"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Stacy!&quot; Daria
exclaimed, cutting her stream-of-consciousness off in mid-thought.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>That's it</i></span><span
style='color:black'>, she thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><i>I can't take any more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Time for a talk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></i></span><span
style='color:black'>Stacy immediately choked back her words, staring at Daria
with wide, nervous eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria
took a breath, resisting the urge to massage her aching forehead.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I think it's time we had a talk
about plot direction.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Um, sure, Daria,&quot; she
replied, considerably subdued.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;Whatever you say.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So,
what do you want to talk about?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Stacy, you know as well as I
do that this story just isn't working out right now.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Writing a good story takes careful planning, and the
self-awareness to know which ideas work and which ones just aren't
believable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We agreed to outline
this from the very beginning, with all of the plot developments laid out well
in advance, because that's the only way to keep things from becoming
confused.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But every time we talk,
you bring up more and more crazy ideas, ones that don't make any sense in the
context of the characters or the storyline we already agreed on.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;But,&quot; Stacy replied,
her lip trembling, &quot;I'm just trying to make the story more fun.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>People like surprises.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What's the point of writing if it's
like working a math problem?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Yeah, Daria,&quot; Jane
butted in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;What's wrong with
being a little out-there every now and then?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>You know, like Melody Powers.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Daria cocked an eyebrow at Jane in
surprise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>What is she trying to
do?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I thought she was on my side.</i></span><span
style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;The problem is that it
doesn't work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My Melody Powers
stories are just satire, more exercises than anything else.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But the story we're writing now is more
serious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stacy, remember that was
the big problem with all of your earlier stories -- they didn't have any
focus.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;But . . . you told me you
thought I was a good writer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I did
the outline like you wanted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've
tried to be serious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I even tried
to read that book you gave me, though I didn't make it very far.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What else do you need me to do?&quot;
The lip tremor was bigger now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;I think you show a lot of
promise, Stacy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But if you don't
learn some discipline, your stories are never going to be any more than just
melodramatic fluff pieces.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That
means more than just making an outline, though that's a start.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You have to treat every aspect of the
story with the same gravity and consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>You asked me to teach you, but I can only do that if you're
willing to do what I say.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Can you
do that, Stacy?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Stacy looked down for a moment,
her eyes perusing the sheets of paper she had brought with her, sheets covered
with her own handwriting, furious scribbles of all the ideas her fertile mind
had generated in just the last few hours, between classes at school and even
during the Fashion Club meeting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Her hands tightened, wrinkling the paper slightly, as she bit down on
her lip.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane's eyes, on the other
hand, were boring into Daria.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Stacy,&quot; Jane broke in,

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Sure, Daria,&quot; Stacy said,
her voice as resolute as she could make it.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Daria and Stacy worked together
for a couple of more hours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Or
rather, Daria worked, outlining plot ideas and sketching out sections of dialogue,
while Stacy mainly took notes, jotting down shorthand versions of Daria's ideas
for later reference.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Every now and
again, she would speak up, offering her own variations on Daria's themes, but
such times were few and far between.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the meantime, Jane watched, occasionally sketching in the pad she
always carried with her, her face unreadable.<span style="mso-spacerun:

to a meeting with Sandi and she had to stop by the mall first.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Very well, then,&quot; Daria
replied, a little short.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;You
can't afford to anger the queen bee, I suppose.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But I'll see you back here tomorrow, right after school.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now that we've gotten our kinks worked
out, I want to get to actual writing as soon as possible.<span

momentum.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Of course, Daria,&quot;
Stacy answered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;But, um, I
don't suppose you could think a bit about some of the things I talked
about?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I really think we could do
something interesting with Jeremy.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;I'll think about it,
Stacy,&quot; Daria said, with the air of giving a concession.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Adding anything to the overall
outline will affect the entire work, but it might be possible to make a few
small, reasonable changes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'll
sleep on it and let you know my final thoughts tomorrow.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Go on, now, before Sandi makes you
alphabetize her lip gloss collection again."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Stacy's eyes widened, and she left the room in a hasty walk
that bordered on a sprint.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
she left, Daria began to gather up the sheets of paper now scattered all over
her desk, when Jane cleared her throat rather forcefully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Interesting definition of
'instruction' you have there, Morgendorffer.<span style="mso-spacerun:

looking?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Jane,&quot; Daria said, the
sound more an explosive exhalation of breath than a word, &quot;I don't need to
hear this from you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, you
think I should go easier on her, and I wish that I could, but that would do
Stacy more harm than good in the end.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;Really?&quot; Jane replied,
her voice dry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Because from
what I remember, the whole point of this project was to teach Stacy how to be
herself, and not to find her identity in some other group.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Don't you think that the message might
come across a little more strongly if you used ideas that Stacy came up with <i>herself</i></span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>"Jane," Daria said in exasperation,
"the ultimate goal is for Stacy to find her own individuality, true, but it's a
process, and we're still in the very early stages.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Before Stacy can discover who she really is, she has to have
the confidence to leave the Fashion Club and Sandi behind; and the way for her
to get that confidence is to feel she has something to offer outside of that
little group.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When she's finally
learned how to be a truly good writer, then she will have that confidence, but
she will only learn that if she listens to what I have to say."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>"And you think the best way to
give her confidence is to toss aside all her ideas and dictate to her what her
own story should be?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane set
down her pencil and crossed her arms, pad held to her chest.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"And what about all that you said about
learning from her?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Is she no
longer worthy of instructing the great Morgendorffer?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&quot;I know what you're implying,
Jane, and it's not true."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria's
voice was hard, and she met Jane's crossed arms with her own.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I plan to give Stacy a lot more free
rein once we're actually writing and not just planning.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stacy's strength is in her prose, which
can be very . . . evocative.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
good prose is nothing without a good story, and that's where my strength comes
in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She needs to learn to rely on
my guidance in the areas where we both know I am her superior.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Jane's eyebrows rose as far as her
forehead would let them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;You
know, Daria, I've heard you be sarcastic plenty of times.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've heard you be a smartass.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've even heard you be incredibly perceptive,
on occasion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But until now, I
don't think I've ever heard you be out-and-out arrogant.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite what some may think, it really
doesn't suit you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Daria's lips tightened, and she
glanced down at the papers on her desk as she gathered her thoughts. <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&quot;Jane,&quot; she said slowly, her
tone indistinguishable from both anger and hurt, "I really do have the best of
intentions here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm not off on
some ego trip.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I think I can
really help Stacy, both as a writer and as a person.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Jane tapped her pad on her palm as

a well-known saying about good intentions, but you do what you think is
best.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I want you to think
about one more question: do you want to deprogram Stacy, or to reprogram
her?&quot; Dropping her pad on Daria's bed, she stood and left without another

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Jane, you're about as subtle as Vegas neon.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Yes, I saw it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You know I saw it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You made it impossible to miss.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Your message came through loud and
clear."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"The pen is mightier than the sword," Jane intoned, "though

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"What exactly does that mean?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I don't know," Jane shrugged.<span style="mso-spacerun:

style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But the real question is, what are you
going to do about it?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria
sighed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Jane," she began with exasperation, "I know you think I

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"So that's all you got out of it?"<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes, of course.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, nothing."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The tone of Jane's voice clearly said otherwise, but Daria didn't much
feel like pressing the issue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
Jane was trying to tell her something else, she could just come out and say it
in the open.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"So," Jane continued,
"what are you going to do about it?"<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Nothing," Daria said, maybe a bit harsher than she
intended.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She tried to tone down
her frustration as she continued.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"Just because you want me to do something doesn't mean I am
automatically going to follow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
doesn't mean you're automatically right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I'm sorry if you think I'm a harsh taskmaster, but I'm doing things the

<p class=MsoNormal>"If you won't do it for Stacy's sake, do it for mine," Jane
replied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I really hate to see you
act this way, Daria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't like
this side of you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a favor for a
friend, go easy on her."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria

<p class=MsoNormal>"You're really pulling out the big guns on this one, aren't
you?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A part of Daria resented
Jane for the guilt trip, even though she knew that Jane also believed she was
doing the right thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Is it
really that important to you?"<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Then how exactly would you have me handle the situation?"

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"If you really want Stacy to have the confidence to be

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm not insisting that she be just like me," Daria
protested with a scowl.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I'm
trying to teach her the proper principles of writing.<span style="mso-spacerun:

be good ones."<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Is it really all-important that her stories be absolutely
perfect?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you want to give her
confidence, isn't it more important that she be comfortable with her
stories?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If she's always worrying
about whether or not she's living up to your standards, she'll never have any
confidence of her own."<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Jane, I can't believe you said that.<span

bullshit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>'It doesn't matter if
it's good, as long as we feel good about it.'<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Them's fighting words, Daria," Jane replied with a
smirk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Fortunately, challenging
you to a duel just wouldn't be worth it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

forest for the trees."<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm saying that if your ultimate goal is to give Stacy the
confidence to express her individuality, you're not doing yourself any favors
by undermining what individuality she already has.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Don't insist that she write just like another Daria.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Let Stacy be herself, and give her
confidence in <i>that</i><span style='font-style:normal'>.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Figure out how she can produce a good story
using her own methods, not yours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Who knows, maybe you'll learn something as well."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Jane, there's a difference between different writing
techniques and just plain bad habits."<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria, maybe you're right.<span style="mso-spacerun:

</span>Maybe, despite the fact that she managed to produce a story that you
liked, Stacy really is filled with bad habits.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But I heard what you said yesterday, and I saw how Stacy
reacted, and I do know that it really bothered me.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, fine, then," Daria said, more out of exasperation than
agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"For your sake, I'll
see what I can do, though I don't know exactly how I'm going to handle it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'll try to be more lenient, but she
still wants me to help her improve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I'm supposed to be guiding her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class=MsoNormal>"You'll just have to use some discretion.<span

<p class=MsoNormal>Stacy took her usual place on Daria's bed, as Daria sat
across from her at the desk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
she sat there, ever-present notebook in lap, Daria thought she looked eager to
please, but she couldn't help but wonder if there was an undercurrent of
anxiety there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stacy wouldn't
quite meet her gaze, keeping her eyes down in what Daria could not shake the
feeling was a submissive posture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria took a deep breath and plunged in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Stacy, I think I might have been a bit too hard on you
yesterday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe since before
yesterday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't think I've been
treating you with the same respect I would treat a friend.<span

<p class=MsoNormal>They did, and for a while, Daria felt good about it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She had kept her promise to Jane, and
it didn't look as though it would be a disaster.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The first few suggestions Stacy had were pretty good, and
with a little adaptation, Daria felt certain that they would work with the
story.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stacy listened carefully to
Daria's advice, and they were able to resolve her objections to the
satisfaction of both.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She even had
Stacy give her a few pointers on punching up her writing, giving her style a
little oomph without resorting to sarcasm.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal>Then Stacy made a suggestion that didn't sound quite so good
to Daria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They talked about it,
but in the end, it wasn't quite how she wanted it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Some of her objections were not answered to her satisfaction.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Feeling as though Jane were looking
over her shoulder, Daria didn't press the issue.<span style="mso-spacerun:

style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>This is what Jane was talking about,

dissatisfaction remained.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, a

</span>Another substandard idea, another unsatisfactory turnout.<span

this time, but Daria once again shoved it to the back of her mind.<span

pen was a little tighter, her posture a little stiffer.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Every few minutes, the process would
repeat itself, and the knot of irritation grew.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria began to feel restless, and an ache began behind her
eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She pushed back that
restlessness as well, concentrating on her promise to Jane as a guard against
the temptation to object too vigorously to Stacy's ideas.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, Stacy proposed an idea that Daria
found truly egregious, and Daria's control slipped just a little.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Writing for Michael Bay now, are we?" she said
snidely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It felt good, like
lancing the boil of her frustration, but Stacy looked at her in bewilderment,
then lowered her eyes again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Damn</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>, Daria thought.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span></span><i>She may not have understood it, but she knew what
I was getting at, I think.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I can't
say things like that if I'm going to keep my promise.</i><span
style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But a
few minutes later, another sarcastic remark spilled out, almost like a reflex
to her annoyance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This one was a
bit more obvious, and Stacy's head dipped lower.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria once again reprimanded herself, but it was becoming
harder and harder to suppress her sarcasm.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span></span><i>How can I have respect for ideas that I find
ridiculous?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I told Jane that I
wouldn't outright dismiss her ideas, so it's either stuff it all in and get a
headache, or let it out with sarcasm.</i><span style='font-style:normal'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><i>Well, maybe I can be a bit
more subtle about it.</i><span style='font-style:normal'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For about half an hour, Stacy made no more frustrating
suggestions, and Daria began to believe that the worst was over with.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, out of the blue, she had what to
Daria was her worst idea yet, which caught her completely off-guard.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You should really send that one in to Dan Brown," Daria
snipped, almost without thinking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"He could always use fodder for his next bestseller."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For a second or two, Stacy just stared
at Daria, making Daria think that she had gotten away with it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then Stacy started to sniff, and Daria
remembered that just a couple of days ago, she had held up Brown as the worst
example of popular but bad writing that she could think of.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She had forgotten that conversation,
but Stacy obviously had not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Stacy's sniffles grew, and Daria had a sinking feeling in the pit of her
stomach.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm . . . I'm sorry, Daria," Stacy said in between wheezing
breaths that grew larger and larger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"I'm such a failure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've
wasted your time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I can't ever
write as good as you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm
hopeless.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sandi was right all
along.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I can't do anything
right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't know why I ever
thought I could."<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Her breath quickened and her hands shook.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, as though a switch had been
turned on, an anguished howl shrieked from her mouth, and her eyes spat
tears.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her nose ran.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She gulped in great gasps of air in between
wails that would shame a banshee, and buried her head in her hands.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria sat in shock for a few moments,
appalled at herself for what she had done, completely at a loss for what to do
to make it better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She made an
abortive attempt to place a hand on Stacy's shoulder, but before her hesitant
motion could reach its destination, Stacy bolted up from the bed and out of the
door, the sound of her cries reverberating down the hall.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria just sat in her chair, trapped by
remorse and astonishment.<o:p></o:p></p>

sounded from out in the hall, right before Daria heard the front door slam
shut.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the ringing silence that
followed, Quinn appeared in the entrance to Daria's room, face like a
thundercloud before a hurricane.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria, <i>what did you do</i><span style='font-style:normal'>?"
Quinn said, her voice an accusation, not a question.<span style="mso-spacerun:

to gather herself again, but Quinn interrupted.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You . . . knew?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

her mind still playing Stacy's reaction over and over in her head.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I've known all along, Daria.<span style="mso-spacerun:

style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've even been covering for her with

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"What?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You may think you know Stacy, Daria," Quinn said, her voice
surprisingly solemn, "but I'm the one who sees how Sandi treats her every
day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sandi's my friend, and she's
really good with fashion tips and being president and all, but I know she's not
perfect, and I know she's not good for Stacy.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I do my best to help Stacy feel better when I can, and I thought
working with you would be good for her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You know, something a little bit different, something to get her away
from Sandi a bit, even if you were doing brain stuff."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She advanced into Daria's room, finally
standing before her, towering over her seated sister.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria felt an urge to dive underneath the desk.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"But I've been listening in to you when
I can, to see how she was doing, and I've heard what you've been saying to
her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And now she's running away crying."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To Daria's shock, Quinn looked less
angry than hurt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I know you can
be annoying, and you're way too brainy, and you can be stuck-up, but I've never
thought you were outright cruel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
thought you would be better for her than Sandi.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But I was wrong.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You're no better for her at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, you're just like Sandi.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Now I have to go find my friend and make her feel better.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Again."<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria just sat there, stunned.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><i>What can I do now?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stacy already ran out of here in tears.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I doubt she'll ever want to work with

style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Fool me twice, shame on me, and all
that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Of course, the first time,
my heart wasn't really in it; I just wanted to keep my word to Jane.<span

would be better, and really mean it this time, I can't guarantee it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I lost my temper once.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I could do it again.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The answer came to her in a flash
of desperation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She knew the only
option left to her to make things right with Stacy.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It would be hard, a sacrifice of her ego, and maybe even an
offense against literature, if Daria's writing instincts really were
trustworthy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But that didn't seem
quite so important as it had before, and there was one shining hope.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It would be something that, as far as
she knew, Sandi had never done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>That thought gave Daria enough peace to lie back and fall to sleep once
more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once again, Daria caught Stacy outside of Math class.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her hands were sweating, moistening the
sheaf of papers in her hands; absurdly, she hoped Stacy wouldn't mind.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She felt short of breath, nervous, not
sure of how this conversation would go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><i>Stacy might just throw it back in my face; well, maybe not, but she
could just give me the cold shoulder and walk away.<span style="mso-spacerun:

of indignation at the thought -- how dare Stacy refuse her sincere
apology!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>-- but she couldn't deny
that Stacy would be within her rights to do so.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span></span><i>I have to make the effort, whatever Stacy
does.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is just as much for me

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Um, Stacy . . . can I talk to you?&quot; There was a
slight quiver in her voice, and she despised it.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stacy's eyes widened, and she drew her books up to her
chest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria thought she was going
to turn and run, but instead she merely nodded silently and followed Daria off
to the side.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They both stood there
for a couple of minutes without a word, shifting their weight from side to
side, neither one quite attempting eye contact.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>After a bit, Daria started to feel absurd, and her doubts
crowded in, whispering to her that this would do no good, that nothing she
could do would make things right so why try, that she didn't really need to do
anything at all since the sentiment is the point anyway right?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria realized that, if she didn't do
something soon, nothing would ever get done -- the bell would ring for classes,
and her chance would be gone, and she didn't know if she would get up the
courage for this again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She had
never realized that admitting you were wrong could be so hard.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She didn't know how to begin, so she
simply held out the papers in her hand, pushing them in Stacy's direction.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Here, take them."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She hadn't intended to be so blunt -- it certainly didn't
fit her conciliatory intent -- but that was how it came out.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Slowly, Stacy reached out to take the
crumpled sheets of notebook paper and flipped through them.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Daria,&quot; she said, her voice rising in surprise,
&quot;these are all our story notes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Everything we talked about."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>For the first time, she caught Daria's gaze with her own.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I want you to take all the ideas we discussed, yours
and mine,&quot; Daria replied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now
that the first gesture was made, the words came easier.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;They're yours.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rightfully, they always were.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm sorry that I tried to take
over.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Do whatever you want with
them, with my blessing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm
done.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Daria, please!&quot; Stacy exclaimed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I know that I'm hard to work
with, and that I'm not as smart as you, and I know that I get on your nerves
sometimes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm sorry.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'll try to do better.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I want us to work together.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;And so do I, maybe one day.<span style="mso-spacerun:

</span>I'm not ready.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;But a lot of these ideas are yours,&quot; Stacy
protested, once again flipping through the sheets.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Then put my name on it along with yours.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't care."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>But I do care!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They're my ideas!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't want them used in a bad story!</i><span
style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria
squelched the selfish cry from inside her.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span></span><i>Let go!</i><span style='font-style:normal'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I would really like to see this
story written, but I don't think I'm ready to help you with it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm sorry I acted like it was 'my way
or the highway'.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just because you
work differently than I do doesn't make your way wrong.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm still learning that, and I don't
know how to practice it yet. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>I
think I showed that yesterday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
fault, not yours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I shouldn't have
treated you like a piece of clay to be molded to my will.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And no one else should either."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She wanted to say more, to be more
blunt, but she felt she had abrogated her right to advise her about Sandi.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Please, use whichever of my ideas you
want, along with yours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I really
want to see what you'll do with them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><b>Author's Note:</b></span><span
style='color:black'> This fic started out as an entry in Angelboy's
&quot;Fandemonium&quot; project on the PPMB. The idea was that, if we're
writing fanfic about <i>Daria</i></span><span style='color:black'>, what kind
of show might Daria and Co. be watching and writing about? In a way, it was the
ultimate in-joke, in that various <i>Daria</i></span><span style='color:black'>
fans were to be used as characters in the show. Most entries revolved around
the show <i>Fandemonium</i></span><span style='color:black'> itself, but some
were about the <i>Daria</i></span><span style='color:black'> characters
watching it or talking about it. atimnie made a post about Daria and Stacy
collaborating on a <i>Fandemonium</i></span><span style='color:black'> fanfic,
which sparked my imagination, leading to the first version of this fic. It was
originally intended as a satire of the various arguments on the PPMB concerning
the writing and direction of fanfic, but took on a life of its own when I
realized how it could be used to explore the idea of &quot;Daria as
Sandi&quot;, which has been brought up by several fanfic writers. When I finished
the "Fandemonium" story, I decided to adapt it into a standalone work, and take
the opportunity to add a bit more depth to the story and improve some things
that hadn't worked as well the first time. The result is the fic you've just
read. I hope you enjoyed it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Thanks to Angelboy for the
"Fandemonium" project that first housed this story, and to atimnie for making
the post that inspired it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thanks
also to RLobinske, who pointed out a major out-of-character moment for Daria in
the first draft, leading to revisions which (I hope) vastly improved the
story.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, a big thanks to
the creators of <i>Daria</i></span><span style='color:black'>, for giving us
characters complex enough to dig deep into, and that we can love even if we
don't always like what we find.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
