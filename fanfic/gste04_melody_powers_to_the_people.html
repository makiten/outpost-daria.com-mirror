<br>
She sat in darkness lit only by monitors, a spider in a vast electronic web.
The suspects were entering the area again. They had to be watched. Only she
stood against the terrorists, the drug dealers, the gangstas, the smokers, and
the people who put gum under the seats, stood between them and Laaaawndale
High.<br>
<br>
Li tapped a button and Camera 12's image covered the screen; a push of the
controller and it zoomed in on one Daria Morgendorffer.<br>
<br>
"You're well behaved and intelligent, Ms Morgendorffer," she told the screen.
"And <i>that</i> was what gave you away! Oh, you're going to be trouble, I know
it &ndash; but I'm got my eye on you, I've got my eye on <i>oh my god</i>-"<br>
<br>
She grabbed the security phone, already screaming her commands before the
guards had picked it up: <i>"Scarlet alert! Individual with a suspicious bag
approaching the entrance &ndash; POSSIBLE TERRORIST!"</i><br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
The guards, faces obscured by hastily donned gas masks, surrounded Mohammed
with their tasers drawn. The boy sighed and dropped the sports rucksack on the
floor.<br>
<br>
"Hey Steve," he said to the lead guard.<br>
<br>
"Hey," replied Steve, his voice muffled by the mask. <br>
<br>
"It's my Gym gear. Just like it is <i>every</i> day I have Gym."<br>
<br>
"The damn screen on this mask has steamed up again, can someone else check the
bag?"<br>
<br>
Daria stood watching this display with her mouth open. She turned to Jane,
remarking: "Please tell me there's a logical reason why Li started doing that."<br>
<br>
"Mohammed came into school one day with a T-shirt saying 'Bummer'."<br>
<br>
"Well, that's logical for Li. I'd say I was amazed everyone accepted it, but Li
ruled this whole country in spirit for eight years and everyone went along with
it then too. I'm not sure if we're 1984 or Brave New World here..."<br>
<br>
At that point, the Fashion Club &ndash; Sandi Griffin, Elsie Sloane, Tiffany
Blum-Deckler and Stacy Rowe &ndash; walked past, engrossed in philosophical
discussion:<br>
<br>
"We HAVE to confront Brittany on this, Sandi, I'm telling you &ndash; one of her
cheerleaders was wearing PLAID. I mean, what's up with that? Even public
schools should have more taste!"<br>
<br>
"Eeeeewwwwwwww."<br>
<br>
"Too true, Elsie dear &ndash; though Brittany may be incapable of grasping the
severity. All that exercise must have gone to their heads. And all those
muscles they develop, ewww."<br>
<br>
"I'm so glad I'm not a cheerleader, they work too hard &ndash; I'm so glad I'm in the
Fashion Club instead!" <br>
<br>
Daria blinked as they walked. "Ah. Brave New World it is."<br>
<br>
"But we don't have soma to drug us into a state of narcotic, sleepy bliss,"
said Jane.<br>
<br>
"We have O'Neill's soothing voice and Maths class."<br>
<br>
"Ahhhh."<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
O'Neill's class was particularly soothing that day, as he tried to discuss the
news media without touching on any potentially touchy or upsetting subjects.
His deliberate vagueness helped Daria get a well-earned nap in.<br>
<br>
"Anyway, erm, we have a few minutes left, would anyone like to discuss any of
the issues or their thoughts from today's lesson?"<br>
<br>
Nobody moved. <br>
<br>
"Oh dear. Erm... Jodie! How about you?"<br>
<br>
Jodie Landon looked up. "Well, I think you've done the class a disservice by
not touching on the pervasive liberal bias and stranglehold on the traditional
news media."<br>
<br>
"The great liberal bias of wanting to make lots of money," said Daria, earning
herself a sharp look from Jodie. "We all remember Marx's seminal Yay Kapital."<br>
<br>
"See? The bias is so pervasive that people don't realise it <i>exists</i>!
People need to be educated."<br>
<br>
"You just snarked yourself so I don't have to."<br>
<br>
"This is just <i>typical</i> of the left, you have to put down and smear and
insult everyone because you can't put up an argument-"<br>
<br>
"The larger members of the American news media uniformly reported President
Bush's views on Iraq as clear fact, rarely questioning them or any of the shady
backroom deals," said Daria, her voice flat. "This is despite the fact that
foreign news media agencies were pointing out the problems, including large
media organs in other coalition partners. Today, the American news media
contains many stories pointing out mistakes made by and flaws inherent in the Obama
administration. Much of news media is owned by a few companies, all large and
wealthy and obviously not run by Berkley hippies. And fourth-"<br>
<br>
"So <i>that's</i> why Daria sits on the left side of the room!" exclaimed
Kevin, his brain catching up with Jodie's last remarks. "Oh, wait, bummer &ndash; <i>I'm</i>
near the left too! Does that mean I have to move?"<br>
<br>
The bell rang, and Mr O'Neill gave a great sigh of relief. "Oh dear that's all
we have time for!! See you tomorrow, class!"<br>
<br>
As the students trooped out, Jodie pointedly ignoring Daria, the teacher called
the misfit over. For a brief minute she thought she was going to get a stern
talking to until she remembered it was O'Neill and it'd just be a talking. (<i>That's
bad enough</i>, she thought)<br>
<br>
"Daria, it's... well, I've been reading some of your essays and Language Arts
submissions--"<br>
<br>
"This is about the Ebola story, isn't it."<br>
<br>
The teacher briefly shuddered. "N-No... It's just you've quite the talent for
writing &ndash; not that you need me to tell you that, of course! I was wondering,
have you thought about joining our school newspaper, the Lawndale Lowdown?
You'd do great work there, I think! And you'd be able to make some friends!"<br>
<br>
She was about to snipe at him for that last remark when she realised &ndash;
newspapers meant journalism. Journalism meant getting to investigate and show
everyone what you found. Investigating Li&mdash;<br>
<br>
"I'll do it."<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
The Lowdown staff met after school, working out of O'Neill's room. It brought
out the odd print copy but was primarily online, mainly for budget reasons.
Since its website was linked to the school's own, Daria knew any investigation
she did would have to be sneaked into the print copy - and at the last moment,
when nobody was looking, so it'd be in print before anybody could raise a
finger. But she could be patient. She knew how to plan.<br>
<br>
And then she entered the room and found out Jodie was editor.<br>
<br>
<i>I should have known to make a Plan B.</i><br>
<br>
"Daria," said Jodie, her voice brittle. "I didn't really expect you to want to
join. You never struck me as the... contributing type."<br>
<br>
"Well, we may have our political differences, but I'm sure we <i>both</i>
support the principles of journalism!" She grinned, a difficult act. <br>
<br>
"But there's nothing happening at the school except sports and gossip, which
you hate," said Jodie, looking confused. "Wait a minute. You don't plan to
smear Ms Li for trying to keep the school safe and call that journalism, are
you? I've had people try that before."<br>
<br>
"...oh, perish the thought."<br>
<br>
"We have feature slots, if you want to pitch something."<br>
<br>
Daria shut her eyes for a brief second and breathed deeply, trying to think of
a reply that wouldn't be full of swearing. And then it occurred to her that
Jodie have given her an opportunity: an opportunity for a really <i>petty</i>
and childish bit of revenge. <br>
<br>
"Do you ever publish short stories?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

color:black'>Melody Powers eased her catsuited form into the chair, her long
jet-black hair tossed over her shoulder. She was always relaxing, for there
would be time enough in kill-or-die combat to be serious.<br>
<br>
Joe Plumer, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency, cut straight to the
point: a no-nonsense, straight-shooting mid-westerner. "We thought OAK were
destroyed but they're reorganising in San Francisco &ndash; we have intelligence
reports of them courting funding from the sex trade, the Mexican narco-cartels,
Cordoba House..."<br>
<br>
Melody raised a dainty eyebrow at the last one. "Iran?"<br>
<br>
"If it's not the PRC, it's Iran. The President is ignorant of that angle, he's
just hoping to use OAK as a proxy to create a socialist uprising on the city
streets. His pet senators and judges are already trying to push through his
Youth Hope Brigade crap into being compulsory, and once those guys are on the
streets on SanFran any opposition to OAK is dead. You have to take out the community
organisers before they're done!"<br>
<br>
Melody had spent the last two years of her career quietly neutralising threats
to America who were from America itself. Plumer would never let her take out
the President himself, the principle was too horrific to contemplate, but until
2012 there would be no stopping the Red tide. Her beloved country was on a
knife-edge.<br>
<br>
"I've got a contact on the ground, a private eye &ndash; PI Staker should be able to
help me figure it out..."</span></i><span style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<br>
Daria stopped typing and made a note to include Kenya as a hostile foreign
power too.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Meals had gotten strange since cousin Erin and her fianc&eacute; Brian had moved in.
Jake and Helen were actually using table manners. (Quinn refused to) There was
even discussion that didn't involve (much) swearing. Weirdest of all, with Erin
around, someone was talking about a normal 9 to 5 job.<br>
<br>
"...and the manager said if I keep getting us that many clients, I'm eligible
for fast-track promotion to <i>junior management</i> in Sales! It really is a
surprise to me, I'm just being myself really."<br>
<br>
"It's a good career, Sales, many... opportunities to move up," said Helen
cautiously, restraining her usual 'screw the man' rhetoric. <br>
<br>
"These clients you keep getting," asked Daria. "They wouldn't happen to be men
that sound middle-aged, are they?"<br>
<br>
"You're right, Daria, they usually are. I wonder why that is?" wondered the
perky, demure-sounding young woman.<br>
<br>
"Isn't she a <i>pip</i>!" smarmed Brian. "Great little career she's got going,
eh? Course, once <i>I've</i> passed my real estate exam, we're back to good ol'
man-the-breadwinner, am I right? It's a tough exam, but I'm really knocking the
hell outta the subject!"<br>
<br>
"What's a housing cooperative?" asked Daria.<br>
<br>
Brian froze. Then he said: "So, young Daria! How's school going?"<br>
<br>
"We're studying the news media in English. We learnt how people duck
journalist's questions."<br>
<br>
"Aww, I remember when you used to work on the school paper in Highland," said
Jake. "You were really great!"<br>
<br>
"I was kicked off it because my first act as Fashion Reporter was to get Beavis
and Butt-head inside the girl's changing rooms, to get their views of current
underwear fashions."<br>
<br>
"I know! Gonzo journalism, <i>rad</i>!"<br>
<br>
"No interest in the Lawndale school paper, sweetie?" asked Helen. "It seems
like it'd be just your thing."<br>
<br>
"Maybe you'll see me in there, and maybe you won't..." <br>
<br>
"Print is <i>dead</i>!" yelled Quinn, figuring out a way to join the
conversation. "Old media for old people! **** the old! Down with corporate
controlled press! The revolution will be <i>Youtubed!</i>"<br>
<br>
"And have lots of comments about it making gay jokes."<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
After dinner, Daria finished off the remains of "Melody Powers and the
Communist Organisers", and did a quick scan to make sure all the plot points
were as stupid as possible. After that, it was time for a brief surf of the SSW
boards (she was kicking ass on the Caption Contest).<br>
<br>
TheNoticeablyFAT had posted a link to another "TOTALLY AWESOME" blog, because
the day had a Y in it. Daria would have ignored it &ndash; FAT had yesterday linked
to a blog that was just photos of someone's pet mouse sleeping &ndash; but the blog's
name, "The Angry Teacher", perked her interest.<br>
<br>
The Angry Teacher's current entry was a furious rant about football players
being given byes on their history tests, even though they were plainly ignorant
of everything on it. Or, as the blog said, "IGNORANT of even WHAT YEAR that
PEARL HARBOR took place!!!!". It especially focused on "Quarterback".<br>
<br>
Alarm bells ringing, Daria checked further and saw the teacher worked as
"Grassdale". <br>
<br>
"Huh. Just when you think you know a man."<br>
<br>
On impulse, she searched the entry from yesterday &ndash; the day she'd made a very
sarcastic comment about the occupation of the Philippines &ndash; and found the blog
referred to a girl called Dire. Dire's "RELENTLESS jibes", according to the
Angry Teacher, were "starting to GROW on me" and he quite liked her response to
Quarterback's confusion.<br>
<br>
That made Daria's night.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Daria had emailed Melody Powers to the Lawndale Lowdown address before going to
bed, and spent the first two periods at school eagerly awaiting Jodie's
reaction.<br>
<br>
"Every member of a local workers union turn out to be armed KGB sleeper
agents," she told Jane and Tom. "<i>Muslim convert</i> sleeper agents. Helping
illegal immigrants pass through on their way to raid suburbs."<br>
<br>
"Does Melody eat any Irish babies?" asked Tom.<br>
<br>
"I knew I forgot something."<br>
<br>
"You're not going to be allowed to <i>read</i> the Lowdown from now on, never
mind contribute to it," said Jane. <br>
<br>
"What can I say? Tacit support of Big Brother just brings out the bitch in me."<br>
<br>
"Everything brings out the bitch in you."<br>
<br>
Jodie soon found them, and Daria felt a brief surge of triumph. And then it
went surging down the drains as she noticed Jodie looked <i>happy</i>.<br>
<br>
"Daria, that story was <i>brilliant</i>."<br>
<br>
Her mouth hung open. After a second, Jane pushed it shut.<br>
<br>
"It's going into the new issue and I'm uploading that issue especially early,
just for that short story! It's fast, pacey stuff, you've really got the format
down pat! Everyone will love it."<br>
<br>
Daria still didn't speak.<br>
<br>
"I'll ask Li about a regular slot for Melody Powers, this feature could run and
run. Quite surprising, really &ndash; I don't think anyone at school would have ever
thought <i>you</i> felt that way about things! Anyway, I'll see you around."<br>
<br>
Silence reigned after Jodie left before Daria muttered "I think I've
miscalculated."</span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal>AUTHOR'S NOTES: Jodie as hardcore right wing and Li being
overly paranoid of a Muslim student comes from ideas by The Angst Guy. Lawndale
Leaks was thought up and done before the US State Dept cable leaks and
Assange's sex crime allegations, which would've provided extra joke fodder
otherwise. Daria's Highland reporter job is from <i>Beavis and Butt-head</i>
episode Sporting Goods; there, her parents made her join the paper and she was
forced to be the fashion reporter because "<i>I'm</i> a <i>girl!</i>";
punkverse Daria clearly didn't put up with this... </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>DeMartino as a neo-hippie comes from The Daria Diaries,
where his singles ad says he used to be a beatnik &ndash; a subculture that had been
replaced by the wider counter-culture in the sixties, when he'd have been a
teenager. Cue a frantic search on Wikipedia to find something equally
out-of-date for the 80's...<span style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>
