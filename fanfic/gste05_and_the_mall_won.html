recession had not been kind. A third of the shops were boarded-up and the rest
clung to grim life by their fingertips. The scant shoppers could <i>smell</i>
the desperation. Jake had been in full punk gear and <i>still</i> the
businessman clothing store (Suits You!) had sent staff to ask him if he'd ever
thought of owning a tie, because they had a HALF PRICE SALE!!! on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Quinn's
gang had all gathered outside the school, all ready to leave it far behind and
head out to the Mall of the Millennium. Her plan was brilliant: they would get
into cars and <i>go</i> there, as opposed to walking into the school.<br>
<br>
There was one tiny problem: only two people in the gang could drive. And there
were eleven of them. <i>Someone</i> would have to squeeze their sixth body into
a car meant for five people and that would lead to arguing, discontent, face
punching, etc. No, it just wasn't on. They needed a third car.<br>
<br>
And that was how Jamie White, arriving to school on his first day of a
provisional learner's licence, got cornered by Quinn before he could exit the
car.<br>
<br>
"You will ****ing drive me and some others where we want to go, or I'll t***
you one."<br>
<br>
He stared up at the vision of loveliness (and leather) and whispered happily
"Okay".<br>
<br>
<i>Fashion Club, eat your heart out,</i> thought Quinn.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
"...it was <i>such</i> a good idea of yours, <i>El-see</i>," said Sandi, with a
smile that didn't reach her eyes. "Taking advantage of the plummeting prices in
clothes and make-up at the Mall of the Millennium, I wish <i>I</i> could have
ideas like that &ndash; gee, you guys should impeach me and make her the Fashion Club
President!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><br>
"Oh it'd be a shame to lose you but if you insist."<br>
<br>
Sandi took a brief, terrified second at the malignant look in Elsie's eyes and,
just a bit too late, laughed. "Funny! You're such a great kidder, El-see!"<br>
<br>
"You were both kidding?" asked Stacy, confused.<br>
<br>
"Oh yeah, Sandi was," said Elsie.<br>
<br>
Not for the first time, Sandi considered that she'd made a severe tactical
error in getting Elsie to join the Club. With her family's wealth, reduced as
it was, she could clean up the clothes aisles, and her status as a Sloane
immediately put them on the social map. Unfortunately, Elsie Sloane was the
type of girl who knew the Vice President was meant to take over if something
bad happened to the President and was always going to be prepared for bad
things. And, sometimes, might cause them.<br>
<br>
"Anyway, let us depart before Security spots us." She turned to the one guy
around, the one they'd found with a car. The one called... guy? "We shall be
departing now."<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
"Seventy eight bottles of <b>beer</b> on the wall, seventy eight bottles of <b>beer!</b>
If one of those bottles should happen to fall, seventy-seven bottles of..." <br>
<br>
When Daria had gotten on the school bus, she'd snarked that maybe they could
sing 99 Bottles to pass the time. This was the first time she'd ever heard
someone really do it. And hopefully, it would be the last.<br>
<br>
"Babe? That's a really cute song and all, but do you think you could stop for a
while?" Brittany hadn't said 'or I'll kill you' but everyone but Kevin heard it
anyway.<br>
<br>
"Sorry, babe," said Kevin, who wasn't. "We always sing that song on the team
bus. It makes us <i>fierce!</i>" <br>
<br>
"You're not <i>on</i> the team bus now. I'm not your teammate. I'm your
girlfriend! We talked about the difference, remember?"<br>
<br>
"He's going to sing again anyway, isn't he?" muttered Daria.<br>
<br>
"Nah, he'll hum," said Jane. "Really loudly. I've been on these trips before,
you can never stop him humming without taking drastic action."<br>
<br>
"You've brought a knife then?"<br>
<br>
Soon enough, Brittany distracted Kevin by making out with him. Noisily. Right
in earshot of Mack and his girlfriend Angie. <br>
<br>
"Sorry Ms Parks, but I want to sit at the back of the bus," said Mack.<br>
<br>
Angie frowned. "There's something bad about the back?"<br>
<br>
The boy blinked, prepared to speak, then visibly gave up. "At least she stopped
him singing."<br>
<br>
<i>Hmmm-hmmm-hmmhmmhmm-HMMMM-hmm-hmmm...</i><br>
<br>
That had briefly amused Daria, but soon she began to have nausea creep over
her. She might have been able to bear it except Upchuck came over, trailing a
long pretend-it's-mink purple scarf behind him and smelling of desperation.<br>
<br>
"<i>Ladies!</i>" he perved, tipping his shades down in an attempt to seem
flirty. "I have to acquire some bikinis for... <i>business</i> matters, aheheh,
and I need a couple of models. The two of you are about Tania's size! What do
you say, girls?"<br>
<br>
Jane thought this over. "You know, I can't think of an appropriately vicious
comment. Over to you, Daria."<br>
<br>
"I feel sick," muttered the girl.<br>
<br>
"That's just disappointing."<br>
<br>
"No, I <i>really</i> feel sick. Can someone open a window?"<br>
<br>
Upchuck leered and went to do so, to display his virile masculinity. The
window, of course, would not open, though he would be thankfully occupied for
fifteen minutes trying to open it.<br>
<br>
"I didn't know you got car sick," said Jane, looking concerned.<br>
<br>
"I don't, usually. It's the fumes. It smells like... <i>perfume</i>, but why
would <i>oh god say nothing Jane.</i>"<br>
<br>
Jane bent down to Daria's ear and whispered "Brittany must be working up a <i>sweat</i>."
<br>
<br>
"I know where you live, Lane. And it's somewhere flammable."<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
"They can't read my po-oh-ka faaace!" sang Erin, the wind in her hair and the
radio in her ears and everything bright and happy and sunshiney, a beautiful
car purring around her. <br>
<br>
A company car, anyway. She couldn't borrow Brian's car, that'd be selfish of
her. <i>He</i> might need it in the day to go... er...<br>
<br>
<i>WHERE DOES HE GO ALL DAY</i><br>
<br>
Her mind instantly clamped down on the rebellious, angry thoughts (the
Morgen-Thoughters, she called them) and tried to focus on the beautiful
scenery. Unfortunately, the beautiful scenery had a fat biker with a "COCK
&amp; ROLL" jacket and the mother of all builders' cracks right in front of
her. <br>
<br>
She sure had been seeing a lot of... people like that on the way to the Mall.
She wondered why.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
The school bus arrived at the car park early. It was a titan of a car park, one
so big and the ends so far away that it would logically need a <i>tram</i> to
get you easily from there to the mall. And there was such a tram, but it had
died from neglect years ago and was half-rusted. The bus was able to get near
the front of the lot no problem.<br>
<br>
Daria would've noticed a number of scrappy looking cars and bikes across the
lot if she hadn't been struggling to keep her breakfast in the inside. She ran
out of the bus, looking for a safe place to unload, and it was Tom Sloane's
severe misfortune to walk over at that point to start a conversation.<br>
<br>
After a while, he said "Hey, I needed new shoes anyway."<br>
<br>
"Do you think they sell intestinal tracts here," she got out, before a second
barrage was unleashed.<br>
<br>
Tom put a consoling hand on her shoulder, helping steady her. "You okay now?"<br>
<br>
"I'm on a field trip, so the answer would be no even without the puke."<br>
<br>
"You should've held it until we'd gotten <i>into</i> the mall. You could've
told your parents you were making a statement."<br>
<br>
They both went quiet as they came to the realisation that Tom's hand was still
on her shoulder. She stiffened slightly, and he gingerly removed it. <br>
<br>
"Sorry."<br>
<br>
"Um." Daria thought quickly to come up with another word. "Um," she settled
for.<br>
<br>
"Hey, look, there's a really fat guy in a bike arriving!" said Tom desperately.
"Let's make sarcastic comments about his worth as a human being!"<br>
<br>
She agreed readily and looked up, and saw Tom had undersold it. There were <i>multiple</i>
fat guys on bikes. And, as they watched, two arriving cars spat out a
collection of Goths and punks. The new arrivals eyed each other with mutual
suspicion, then turned as one to eye the schoolkids with suspicion. (Some had <i>bright
colours</i>) Brittany gave a nervous wave.<br>
<br>
"Oh no," said Daria. "I... I wasn't paying much attention at dinner these last
few days or, indeed, ever, but I think I remember Dad mentioning he had
something going on at a mall on a Friday. And either this is it, or the dregs
of society have finally risen up to destroy Western civilisation and they
didn't think I was cool enough to invite. It could be either, really."<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
The Mall was <i>flooded</i> with punks, hippies, Goths, stoners, metalheads,
nu-metallers, rockers, mods, alternatives, outlaw bikers, BDSM doms and subs,
anarchists, gangstas, and two Orthodox Jews who were thought to have gone to
the wrong place until one high-fived a nu-metaller and sung out Slipknot lyrics
as a greeting. Posters had been stuck to walls and windows, advertising a Suck
It Capitalism festival with live acts and sales at selected shops. <br>
<br>
A make-up shop, all pink and light and glittery, was now being besieged by
Goths and dommes, and a shop assistant had emerged to hastily paint black
streaks over the pink.<br>
<br>
Mrs Bennett had immediately gone into crisis mode, forcing the students
together into a tight square with the larger boys on the outside. Everyone had
a buddy to look out for them, and she marched up front while also trying to
cover the rear. <br>
<br>
"We need to get to area C, section Orange!! That area is secure! Follow me and <i>do
not stop for anything!!</i>"<br>
<br>
A pierced-everything anarchist walked past the class and roared "**** SCHOOL
BRAINWASHING!!".<br>
<br>
"And, it appears, normal washing," said Daria. <br>
<br>
"I hate to say this," said Jane, "but this trip is on the verge of becoming <i>interesting</i>."<br>
<br>
"A hippie and a stoner have just got into a fight over whose subculture is the
biggest sell-out," said Tom, pointing them out.<br>
<br>
"Not quite there. Needs something more..."<br>
<br>
As the class rounded area Q, section Canary, they passed the Sound It Out music
store, where a large crowd was gathering for a live performance. A live
performance by...<br>
<br>
"Hey. We're Mystik Spiral. And..." Trent spotted Jane's class, blinked. "Your
whole <i>class</i> cut class to see us? Cool."<br>
<br>
"Ah yep," said Jane. "There's something more." <br>
<br>
"Okay, in honour of that, we're going to be leading with one of our older
songs: Lawndale High Really Really Sucks. We thought about changing the name,
but... y'know. Ahem. <i>Condemned by the BELL! To stay in this HELL! ...</i>"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Erin's
brain had managed to place all the weird cars and bikes in the compartment
marked Nothing To Do With Me, but once she'd entered the mall &amp; could see
the dark hordes it gave up and left her to face stark reality.<br>
<br>
"Oh dear."<br>
<br>
She glanced to her side and saw four pleasant-looking fashionable girls and one
generic guy, all five looking terrified and checking each other to make sure
nobody had noticed. <br>
<br>
"Arrrrre we gooiiing anywheerrreeee thennn?" asked one girl.<br>
<br>
"Of course, Tiffany dear!" snapped the lead girl. "Unless, of course, <i>El-see</i>
is worried-"<br>
<br>
"I'm not worried," lied El-see. <br>
<br>
The leader looked a bit upset about that. "Okay then. Um. That idea of finding
some hideously out of style nobody and making her look almost as good as us..."<br>
<br>
"I think it's still a good idea! Don't you?!?!"<br>
<br>
"Oh yes, no objections here!"<br>
<br>
The girl with pigtails was about to cry. Erin knew how she felt.<br>
<br>
Taking a deep breath (<i>you've been around Mum and your aunts arguing, this is
</i>nothing), she headed towards the first shop on her list, determined to sell
things. She was going to sell things. She wasn't scared of the big scary people
all around here. <i>She was going in the shop now.</i><br>
<br>
Fifteen eyes belonging to eight huge bikers turned to watch her enter. The
clerks of Bullock &amp; Ina's China Shop looked at her desperately, as if
hoping she was an undercover CIA agent.<br>
<br>
"How would you like to save approximately 2.3% of your AC's power usage?" she
said very very carefully.<br>
<br>
--- <br>
<br>
To Daria's disappointment, the class made it to a conference room unmolested.
Now they were being hovered over by very, very nervous executives, who were
doing a live demonstration of how focus groups worked. (A cheque had exchanged
hands with Bennett) Normally, this would have irked Daria but the sheer <i>desperation</i>
of the executives to gain <i>any</i> information that could save their mall was
hilarious.<br>
<br>
She quietly began to plot ways to mess with them.<br>
<br>
"And when you go to the mall, you look for what?" asked Exec One, making the
mistake of asking Upchuck.<br>
<br>
" Bikinis! Make that lovely, luscious, ladies <i>in</i> bikinis! Rrrrow! <br>
<br>
"I always look for security guards leading away someone in handcuffs," said
Jane. "Shoplifters are the best judges of merchandise."<br>
<br>
"I concur with Jane," said Daria. "I haven't seen a single shoplifter in all my
time here. I'm <i>very</i> concerned. Something must be wrong with the products
if none of <i>today's</i> crowd want to steal it."<br>
<br>
" I meant more along the line of the qualities you look for?" said Exec One
with growing worry (images of looting had just ended up in his head, Daria
betted). "The stores? What should they be like?"<br>
<br>
" I have a question," snapped Jodie. "How much benefits and handouts do you
give to your staff, exactly? Because I don't see why <i>our</i> tax money
should be bailing out a store that wastes its money like that!" <br>
<br>
"Oh yeah, Obama's trillion dollar bailout of malls was definitely a step too
far," said Tom, deadpan. "But we should've seen it coming after the Pet Store
Bailout Act."<br>
<br>
"I thought Obama <i>had</i> a pet?" Brittany looked lost. "Can he really look
after more than one?"<br>
<br>
"<b>How about you?</b>" said Exec Two loudly, looking at Mohammed in the hopes
he would be a safe target. "How many times a year do you go to the mall?"<br>
<br>
"Sorry man, I stopped paying attention at the bikinis bit. Can you repeat that
question?"<br>
<br>
While the chat went on around her, Daria took a look at the large,
not-suspicious-honest mirror in the corner. "I bet that's a two-way mirror."<br>
<br>
"You mean, if you turn out the lights you can see through it?" asked Jane.<br>
<br>
"I have a better idea." Daria turned to Kevin. "Hey, Kevin. If you moon a
mirror, does that mean you can see your <i>own</i> butt?"<br>
<br>
His eyes lit up. "Whoa, I dunno but I'm gonna find out!"<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Bikini Island was going to safe. It sold <i>fashionable</i> clothes. The Great
Unwashed would not dare go in there.<br>
<br>
That, at least, had been the Fashion Club's plan. Unfortunately, Bikini Island
was one of the contributors to Suck It Capitalism and once they were in, the
press of incoming women made sure they could not get out. It was four of them
("guy" had been made to wait outside) surrounded on all sides by women that
Sandi lacked the vocabulary to describe. <br>
<br>
"How many cows did they kill?" whispered Stacy as she looked at their jackets.<br>
<br>
"Don't... make... eye contact..." said Elsie, her every muscle tensed. "I hear
this type view that as a challenge."<br>
<br>
"I want to make a bitchy comment about their hair and make-up."<br>
<br>
"<i>Stay strong, Sandi.</i>"<br>
<br>
"I'll be alright. As long as nothing <i>too</i> gauche goes past-"<br>
<br>
It was at that moment that Andrea and Quinn emerged from behind a rack, both
testing out bikinis with no concern for public modesty. Andrea was wearing a
skimpy one. <i>Andrea</i>.<br>
<br>
On instinct, Sandi said "urg, <i>puh-lease</i> get a larger size for, like, the
sake of <i>oth-ers</i>".<br>
<br>
Quinn and Andrea turned their heads. So did every other woman in the shop.<br>
<br>
"Iiiii'm scaaaarrrred."<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
"...and in light of all that, don't you consider that this mall indicates that
Marx was right and communism is truly inevitable in our society?" asked Daria.<br>
<br>
Exec Three burst into tears.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Things were going badly for Erin. No, not badly: just <i>difficult</i>. She had
to stay focused and positive. She could do it. <br>
<br>
It was the Fuzzy-Wuzzy Wee-Bits store next. That would be safe. You always knew
a Wee-Bit was nice and wholesome. She'd be safe there.<br>
<br>
A punk from out of Aunt Helen's wet- Helen's <i>day</i> dreams and a stoner who
had not bathed since the Civil War exited the Wee-Bit store, their arms loaded
with product. The punk was saying "my ma LOVES these things!". <br>
<br>
<i>Oh dear,</i> thought Erin.<br>
<br>
Her legs, sensing no safe zone anywhere, locked up out of sheer fright. Around
her, huge men and woman in ripped and filthy clothes pushed past, a Goth
headbutted someone for calling him an emo, a Hell's Angel and a Crip wannabe
eyed each other for signs of trouble, and someone vomited on a window to cheers
from his fellows. In the circumstance, Erin decided it would be sensible to
pretend she was invisible and hope everyone else would play along.<br>
<br>
There was an unholy screaming as the girls and guy from earlier ran past her,
looking like all the hounds of hell were after them. A few seconds behind them
came Quinn and some friends she'd made, which would explain why. <br>
<br>
"LET'S ****ING HAVE THEM oh hey cousin Erin FIRST DIBS ON THEIR WALLETS"<br>
<br>
Erin remained ramrod straight, even as a group of hoodie-wearing men with
pierced eyes came towards her. When they got close enough for her to read the small
type on their nu-metal band logos, her brain hurriedly rebooted itself in the
hope of some adequate response.<br>
<br>
"Do you ever have problems vacuuming those cracks in the corner than the nozzle
<i>just</i> can't reach?"<br>
<br>
The gang stopped and huddled together. After a few seconds muttering, the lead
male agreed that they did indeed have that problem.<br>
<br>
"Well, your friends at Landon Enterprises have just the gadget for you...!"<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
The executives had finally thrown the class out, which left them with a
dilemma: Bennett would have paired them off to do assignments, but with the
mall overrun she didn't want to let <i>anyone</i> out of her sight. Not when
the anarchists and the rockers were eyeing each other with "wanna start
something" eyes, just across the floor.<br>
<br>
"We... We'll make our way to the food court," she said, noticing a clear path
to an escalator. "We will stay there until it's safe. <i>No one child gets left
behind.</i>"<br>
<br>
"I think the sensible and mature thing to do here is to sneak off," Tom said to
Daria and Jane.<br>
<br>
"Good plan," replied Jane. "I wonder what song Trent's up to now?"<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
"OW!" yelled Mystik Spiral, and then ceased playing.<br>
<br>
<b>"MY NOSE!"</b> roared back the crowd.<br>
<br>
"OW!"<br>
<br>
<b>"MY FACE!"</b><br>
<br>
Jane watched them, smiling proudly. "They've learnt how to play their instruments.
Your father's consulting made them learn how to play."<br>
<br>
"Speaking of my family, is that Quinn in the front row dancing really
suggestively in the hope Trent pays attention? Why yes, it is. Shall we go over
and embarrass her by being square?"<br>
<br>
They did so. Quinn, engrossed by Trent's presence, didn't notice them until it
was too late and was quite mortified when she saw them.<br>
<br>
"<i>Gawd</i>, Daria, why do you and Tom have to... have to <i>ruin</i> things
for everyone by turning up looking like that!"<br>
<br>
"At least you asked me that at a counter-culture gig this time, rather than my
own birthday party."<br>
<br>
"Is there something you <i>want</i>?"<br>
<br>
Daria grinned evilly and hugged her. "I <i>love</i> my sister!"<br>
<br>
<i>"Dah-ree-ah! The rockers are going to think I'm wussy!!!"</i> <br>
<br>
"You know, if that was my sister, I'd blackmail her by threatening to tell our
parents that she was skipping school," said Tom.<br>
<br>
"I'd never do that," said Daria, still hugging away. "They'd be proud of her."<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Jane decided to hang with Trent for a while, enjoying his new somewhat-talent.
This left Daria and Tom to wander on their own, and come across the eternal
statue of Erin. They could see people leaving it, carrying products and order
brochures. One burly biker was holding a foldable notepad holder ((C) and TM
Landon Enterprises), cheering "I dunno what this is but I bet I can hit someone
really hard with it!".<br>
<br>
Daria, ashamed of her pang of conscience, went over to her cousin. "Erin?"<br>
<br>
"Hello Daria," her cousin said, a fixed smile on her face. "It's rather
embarrassing but I don't think I can move. Too many... customers around."<br>
<br>
"I think you need to go to the food court and get some good, unhealthy junk
food into you."<br>
<br>
"They have scary hair, Daria."<br>
<br>
"Don't worry. If anything happens, Tom will save us. He's a <i>male</i>."<br>
<br>
Tom flexed his arms. "Booya."<br>
<br>
"Oh. That's... that's good. I could do with some food, I guess..."<br>
<br>
Gently, she led Erin up the stairs and to the sanctuary of McDonalds, where no
counterculture type would dare trade (except for the stoners who were desperate
by this point).<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Stacy had been separated from the others but her instincts for fashion saved
her. She'd immediately found her way to Scissor Wizard. They had hair-dye and
could style things. Then, with speed that would've stunned the track team, she
reached the make-up shop and then managed to pick up a denim punk jacket that
had been mislaid. It wasn't much of a disguise, but with luck it'd help her get
through the day.<br>
<br>
She turned the corner and ran into Quinn, who cried out "bitching hair! What's
your name?"<br>
<br>
"Stacy &ndash; er, I mean-"<br>
<br>
"Cool name! Hey, hang with us, we're going to go throw things at that dude over
there!"<br>
<br>
Stacy remembered something about frying pans and fires.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Erin ate her hamburger like it came from Jesus Himself, with a sprinkling of
Mohammed's own secret sauce to go with the Buddha lettuce. <br>
<br>
"This is a bad time to say how burgers are made, isn't it?" asked Daria.<br>
<br>
"If you get me back to my car, I'll do anything in return!" <br>
<br>
"Well, a ride home would be great. Tom and I really aren't in the mood to take
the bus back, and Jane... Is Jane hitching a ride back with Trent?"<br>
<br>
"Risky," said Tom. "Trent will need to remember he drove here."<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Jane, when they found her, was busy selling fake tattoos and face painting to
the mall's customers, right out of a <i>very</i> grateful State Of The Art arts
'n' crafts shop. She'd told them she was happy enough and, having slipped Red
Bull to Trent without him knowing, was interested in seeing how long he'd play
for. That meant they could leave her behind and head the hell back to Lawndale
without any guilt.<br>
<br>
As Erin drove away as fast as she could, Daria noted to Tom: "And you know,
those shops involved in Suck It Capitalism really were booming. And some of the
others-"<br>
<br>
"Except that one with the broken windows. Er, one of the ones."<br>
<br>
"It turns out supply and demand does work, though I'm not sure any of them knew
what it was they were demanding. Maybe the chance to look cool and outlaw in
front of others, though if that was it they shouldn't have been buying
Wee-Bits. Except the dinosaur Wee-Bits. Those guys keep it old-school."<br>
<br>
Erin, as she often did when Daria was using odd words, tuned the talk out. The
important thing, after all, was that she'd got away safely and had somehow made
a whole bunch of sales. And her cousin had helped her out, which was nice.<br>
<br>
She'd have to tell Mum and Grandma that. Grandma always was asking about Daria
for some reason.<br>

It was approaching midnight and the mall could not close because Trent was <i>still
playing</i>. Jane had run out of paint, ink, and crayon over an hour ago, and
was now using leftover food &ndash; some of the BDSM crowd had started some dodgy
games up thanks to that. <br>
<br>
"Hey, I've got some French fries left over!" she called to Quinn and Stacy.
"Five for five cents!"<br>
<br>
"If we stick that in our hair, Trent'll think we're <i>really</i>
counter-culture!" squeed Quinn. "Come on, Stacy!"<br>
<br>
"I... I'm okay, thanks," she whispered, coming to the conclusion she was never
going home. <br>
<br>
To the side, some anarchists were discussing how this sort of gathering was
raising a finger to the capitalist system, but they couldn't be heard over the
Sound It Out manager yelling "WE HAVE HOW MUCH MONEY OH THANK YOU GOD
AHAHAAHA!!!". <br>
