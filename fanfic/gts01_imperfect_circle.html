<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>This
isn&rsquo;t working.&rdquo;  Quinn Morgendorffer yanked her bass
guitar over her head and tossed it aside with a clatter.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Quinn!
 Be careful!  You&rsquo;re not going to be able to play if you trash
your bass.&ldquo; Daria Morgendorffer glared at her sister from
across the basement, where she&rsquo;d been fiddling with the amps.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;Daria,
I&rsquo;m not going to be able to play at all.&rdquo; Quinn matched
her sister&rsquo;s glare with one of her own.  &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
sing and play the bass, no matter how hard I try.  I&rsquo;m not
Bobby Joe, or something.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;You
mean Billie Joe?&rdquo;  Daria couldn&rsquo;t help but smirk.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;What<I>ever!</I>&rdquo;
 Moments like this were a reminder that, no matter how much she knew
or how far she&rsquo;d come, deep down Quinn was still Quinn and
always would be.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;I
think she&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Jane Lane said from her perch behind
the drums.  Both Morgendorffer sisters turned in shock, and she
continued.  &ldquo;Look, Daria, Quinn&rsquo;s singing is wonderful
and she&rsquo;s really got presence, but she&rsquo;s not getting any
better at bass.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>As
Daria paused to reply, Quinn jumped in, sensing weakness.  &ldquo;Yeah,
and we need another voice.  Jane&rsquo;s drumming is better
every week, but she&rsquo;s no one&rsquo;s idea of a singer.  We need
a low voice to help us on the harmonies.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Daria
looked back and forth between her two bandmates.  She&rsquo;d had
this argument with Quinn before, but this was the first time Jane had
taken a side.  That it wasn&rsquo;t Daria&rsquo;s told her that her
position was probably untenable.  &ldquo;We could&mdash;&ldquo; she
paused and sighed.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right.  We do need a fourth.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>She
stared moodily around their practice area, the basement of the
three-story house that contained her one-bedroom apartment.  Talking
her absentee landlord into letting them use the space hadn&rsquo;t
been nearly as difficult as Daria might have expected, but then she
should have taken into account that she lived in a college town.  Her
landlord was well aware of the habits of college students, hence the
absentee status.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>It&rsquo;s
just that the three of us fit.  Jane and I can gang up on you, Quinn,
when you&rsquo;re being flighty, and Quinn and I can gang up on you,
Jane, when you&rsquo;re being lazy.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Jane
laughed, &ldquo;And Quinn and I can gang up on you, Daria, when
you&rsquo;re being rigid and unreasonable, like right now.&rdquo; 
Quinn nodded, smiling.  In different ways, they were the two people
who knew Daria best.  &ldquo;We need a fourth.  We&rsquo;ll just get
some genius bass-chick who has no opinions as long as she gets to
play.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;And
sing low harmonies,&rdquo; Quinn added.  &ldquo;Sorry Jane, but your
voice may be even worse than my bass.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Both
fell silent, waiting expectantly.  With a sigh, Daria gave in.  &ldquo;All
right.  It looks like Girls Together Sarcastically will be adding a
fourth.  But,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;we continue to practice as a
three-piece until we find the right person.  After all,&rdquo; she
said, overriding Quinn&rsquo;s objections, &ldquo;playing while you
sing can&rsquo;t hurt if you want to pick up rhythm.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Agreed.&rdquo;
 Jane smirked.  Watching Daria ride herd over her sister was always
entertaining.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Agreed.&rdquo;
 Quinn grunted.  At least Daria had thrown her a sop this time. 
Quinn had to admit that her sister was getting better at managing
people.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Then
if we&rsquo;re all in agreement, I believe we had a couple more
numbers we wanted to run through&hellip;&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Alone
in her bedroom later, Daria struggled with lyrics by the light of her
bedside lamp.  It was a small room, similar to the old cell in
Lawndale sans padding.  The Kafka poster had made the trip with her
and now overlooked a couple of full bookshelves, a much emptier
dresser&mdash;Daria was still not one for too many clothes&mdash;and
a spacious and cluttered work desk on which sat her trusty iMac.  The
iMac, a gift from her parents on the occasion of her starting at
Raft, was now pushing two and a half, but had given her no trouble.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   There
was also a nondescript twin-sized bed, and it was there that Daria
sat, back propped against the wall.  She had always felt that
poetry&mdash;and, by extension, lyrics&mdash;was best written in the
most primitive fashion, since it usually dealt with the most primal
emotions.  Thus, she used an old-style marble-bound notebook as a
lyrics book, one that right now seemed to be laughing at her.  She
knew why.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Jane
and Quinn were right.  Playing bass and singing was the musical
version of patting your head while rubbing your stomach. Expecting
Quinn, who had never picked up an instrument before joining the band,
to do it was brutally unfair.  Daria herself had taken guitar lessons
for nearly two years while still in Highland.  She had mentioned this
in a late night conversation with Jane near the end of freshman year,
and was surprised to find that Jane had, at a teenaged Trent&rsquo;s
urging, learned the rudiments of the drums.  Though she quickly lost
interest in playing with her brother, in Mystik Spiral or any other
form, Jane had never quite given up on the skins.  It had taken some
doing, and not a little histrionics, but she had finally convinced
Daria that, with Daria&rsquo;s poetry serving as lyrics, they already
had the basis for a band.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Quinn,
on the other hand, had no instrumental background, but she did love
to sing.  Learning of Daria and Jane&rsquo;s plans on their return to
Lawndale that summer and knowing that she&rsquo;d be joining them in
Boston in the fall&mdash;New England School of Design had accepted
her&mdash;Quinn had set about convincing her sister that she would be
the perfect vocalist for their little group.  Daria had finally
conceded, partly out of curiosity about Quinn&rsquo;s motivations and
partly because she was forced to admit that her sister had a fabulous
singing voice, although she'd set her sister two conditions.  The
first condition was that Quinn learn bass to keep their group a trio. 
 Quinn had quickly agreed.  The second was that &ldquo;Girls Together
Sarcastically&rdquo; would be the band's name.  Quinn had tried 
her hardest to sidetep this condition, but both Daria and Jane
remained adamant: The name was a tribute to a man they both admired,
as well as a pretty good explanation of what they were about, and
Quinn would go before it did.  In the end, Quinn had no choice but to
agree.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Blood,
sweat, and not a few tears shed over the next eighteen months had
brought them to this point.  Jane, Daria knew, was in it to make the
big time.  Daria had her reservations, which she believed Quinn
shared, but found herself intrigued by the possibilities.  After all,
a platinum album would be a wonderful platform for her words, and in
a world where Mystik Spiral&rsquo;s first CD was to appear on record
store shelves any day, Daria had reason to believe that anything was
possible.  But they still needed a bassist.  Loath as Daria was to
admit an outsider into their charmed circle, she would have to accept
it for the good of the group.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   An
idea struck her and she scribbled &ldquo;Charmed Circle&rdquo; at the
top of an empty page in her notebook.  Within minutes, she had a
rough poem that could be polished into lyrics with a little time. 
Smiling to herself, she put the notebook aside, shut off the light,
and got under the covers.  She was soon fast asleep.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Rehearsals
over the next couple of weeks went uncommonly well.  From the start,
the girls had committed themselves to a regular three-times-a-week
rehearsal schedule.  Keeping this schedule had often proved arduous,
as Daria and Quinn were both forced to hold down part-time jobs as
part of their agreement with their parents.  Helen and Jake were
willing to subsidize the girls in off-campus housing but they were
adamant that the girls pay their own expenses.  Between schoolwork
and the jobs, the Morgendorffer sisters hardly had time to breathe
sometimes, but they managed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Jane,
on the other hand, seemed to have no source of income.  Her tuition
was paid, and Quinn, with whom she shared an apartment a town over
from Daria, reported that Jane&rsquo;s half of the rent was always
there on the first of the month, even if Jane usually wasn&rsquo;t. 
When she wasn&rsquo;t at Daria&rsquo;s, which admittedly was most of
the time, she seemed to drop out of sight.  For all Daria knew, Jane
could be stripping in one of the clubs in the Combat Zone, but she&rsquo;d
long since decided that prying into Jane&rsquo;s affairs was bad for
her mental health.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Regardless,
the girls had persevered, and in the last few weeks had begun to reap
the rewards.  Knowing that she would soon be free of the bass had
relaxed Quinn immensely, and the relief had her in fine voice.  Daria
and Jane, no longer concerned with covering up for the bass, had also
shown a marked improvement, and the basement rang with laughter and
good humor, as well as something that to Daria&rsquo;s ear was
beginning to approach music.  They still needed a real bassist
though, and that had Daria, if not looking forward to the ordeal of
auditions, at least willing to endure it.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
first audition was scheduled for two o&rsquo;clock that day, a
Saturday.  The three girls sat on the couch in Daria&rsquo;s
apartment, chatting quietly.  The living space was somewhat larger
than the bedroom, with space for a long couch and a couple of chairs.
 Opposite them stood the entertainment center, holding an imposing
television&mdash;another gift from Helen and Jake; this time for
making the Dean&rsquo;s List freshman year&mdash;with a VCR/DVD combo
and a small stereo, which Daria had treated herself to after a summer
of hard work, both at the bookstore and with the band.  On either
side of the entertainment center were the doors to the bedroom and
bathroom.  A tiny kitchenette, rarely used except for the microwave,
completed the apartment.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>As
the girls waited, their voices the only noise, two o&rsquo;clock
turned to three.  Daria, who had to work at five, began to get
irritated.  &ldquo;This is getting ridiculous.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Relax,
amiga,&rdquo; said Jane, who had a good idea what her friend was
thinking.  &ldquo;Us artistic types have a relaxed attitude about
time.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Like
Trent?&rdquo; Daria asked in an acid tone.  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think &lsquo;Early, late, or whatever&rsquo; is what we&rsquo;re
going for here, Jane.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Jane
smiled apologetically.  &ldquo;Trent takes things to extremes.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;But
it works for him,&rdquo; added Quinn.  &ldquo;I mean, they&rsquo;ve
got a contract and an album and everything, right?  You have to go
with what works for you.  That&rsquo;s what style is all about.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Well,
I don&rsquo;t think super slacker mode will work for me as a style,
Quinn,&rdquo; Daria said.  &ldquo;I have to make the four-thirty bus
if I&rsquo;m going to be at the bookstore by five.  If we have to
work around &lsquo;Spiral-time,&rsquo; we may as well just give up,
grab the tin cups, and head for Crestmore Square to start our new
careers as street beggars.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Ewwww,
Daria!&rdquo;  Quinn wrinkled her nose in disgust.  &ldquo;How can
you even think that?  It&rsquo;s bad enough I have to sweat while I
sing&mdash;&ldquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Mercifully,
the deep tone of the doorbell cut Quinn off.  Daria headed out the
door and down one flight of stairs.  Opening the front door of the
house, she confronted a dark-haired girl who seemed to be a bit older
than Daria.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Uh&hellip;
hey,&rdquo; the girl said in a drowsy voice.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m, uh,
supposed to have an audition.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;You
must be Cinder.&rdquo;  Daria said in a more clipped than usual
monotone.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Daria.  The rest of the band is
upstairs.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Cool,&rdquo;
Cinder said, hefting a large black case that Daria could only assume
contained her bass.  &ldquo;Sorry I&rsquo;m late,&rdquo; she added as
she followed Daria up the stairs.  &ldquo;I kinda lost track of
time.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Figures,&rdquo;
Daria muttered.  She snuck a look back to see if Cinder had heard
her, but the other girl seemed to be fascinated by the walls of the
stairwell. &ldquo;Cool place,&rdquo; she said.  Daria grunted
something that could have been an assent as she led Cinder into the
apartment.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Jane,
Quinn,&rdquo; Daria said as the other two girls stood, &ldquo;this is
Cinder.  She&rsquo;s going to audition for bass.  Cinder,&rdquo; she
turned, &ldquo;this is Jane Lane.  She&rsquo;s the drummer.&rdquo; 
As she did the introductions, Daria got a better look at her
prospective bandmate.  Cinder was several inches taller than Daria,
with near buzzcut-short black hair and more earrings than Jane.  A
blue nose stud dominated her otherwise unremarkable face, and her
pants and jacket were a matching gray.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;And
I&rsquo;m Quinn Morgendorffer.  I&rsquo;m the singer.  You&rsquo;ve
got a great look, but the clothes drain the color from your face.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Daria
shot her sister a hard look.  &ldquo;Thank you, Quinn.  We can have
fashion hour later.&rdquo;  With an apologetic nod, she continued. 
&ldquo;Sorry about that.  My sister had a terminal case of
fashionitis.  We thought she was in remission, but apparently it&rsquo;s
come back.  I play lead guitar, by the way.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Sisters,
huh?&rdquo;  Cinder smiled.  &ldquo;I can see the resemblance.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Identical
looks of shock crossed the faces of the two Morgendorffers.  Daria
looked from Quinn back to Cinder, who seemed indifferent to the chaos
she&rsquo;d just caused.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>So
where do we play?&rdquo;  She shifted the bass case on her back.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Jane
jumped into the breach, not quite hiding an evil smile at her
bandmates&rsquo; discomfort.  &ldquo;The basement.  It&rsquo;s down
the back stairs.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   She
led them through the apartment&rsquo;s other door, in the kitchen
area, and down the back stairs to the spacious basement, half of
which was given over to assorted junk, a lot of it so rusted as to be
unidentifiable.  Another quarter was clearly a laundry area, with a
washing machine and dryer set on concrete block.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
was their rehearsal area, separated from the laundry area by drywall,
creating the effect of a cubbyhole.  Jane&rsquo;s drum kit&mdash;bass
drum, snare, and three toms, one of which was a floor tom, along with
ride, crash, and hi-hat cymbals&mdash;sat in the back like the lord
of the kingdom, flanked by several small amps.  In front of it were
three microphone stands and off to the side were twin racks, one of
which contained Daria&rsquo;s mint green Fender.  Quinn&rsquo;s hot
pink bass, however, had surrendered pride of place to the new
bassist, leaving the other rack empty.  On all three walls and the
ceiling hung heavy quilts.  &ldquo;Compromise with the landlord,&rdquo;
Jane explained at Cinder&rsquo;s puzzled look.  &ldquo;Dunno if it
helps, but it makes him happy, so who are we to argue?&rdquo; 
Grabbing her sticks off the snare, she hopped behind the kit, while
Daria showed Cinder where to plug in and Quinn did breathing
exercises.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;So
what&rsquo;s your deal?&rdquo; Cinder asked, after they&rsquo;d set
up.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;A
pop-punk thing,&rdquo; Daria replied, &ldquo;sort like an updated
Runaways or Ramones.&rdquo;  Daria had to laugh inwardly at her
descriptions.  Tom Sloane&rsquo;s secret fascination with early punk
had been a shock to her when they were dating, but an even bigger
shock was coming to like it herself.  Her own musical interests
pre-Lawndale had been almost entirely shaped by her parents, so it
was only in the last couple of years that she&rsquo;d learned that
music didn&rsquo;t begin and end with the Beatles.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;A
little like Eve&rsquo;s Plum,&rdquo; Jane added, &ldquo;or the Donnas
with brains.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>

people doing the same thing,&rdquo; Cinder said diffidently.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Well,
it&rsquo;s just a starting point.&rdquo;  This from Quinn, who had
finished her breathing and taken her place by the mike stand.  &ldquo;With
Daria&rsquo;s lyrics, we&rsquo;ll probably end up sounding like
Smashing Pumpkins or something.&rdquo;  Daria once again reflected on
what a major change college life had wrought in Quinn.  If Daria&rsquo;s
musical tastes could be summed up as &ldquo;sheltered&rdquo; before
leaving Lawndale, her boy-band-loving sister&rsquo;s could only be
described as &ldquo;appalling.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Cinder
gave Daria a look.  &ldquo;You write, she sings?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Daria
nodded.  &ldquo;I have the words; she has the voice.  Let&rsquo;s
play.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   They
started with &ldquo;Blitzkrieg Bop,&rdquo; and ran through &ldquo;Basket
Case,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lipstuck,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cherry Bomb,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Going Down to Liverpool,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I Will Follow,&rdquo;
before finishing with &ldquo;Paperback Writer.&rdquo;  Daria called
out the tunes, and Jane gave the time.  Both noted happily that
Cinder was familiar with all the songs and didn&rsquo;t miss a beat. 
The sound was still raw to be sure, but with a strong bass
complimenting Jane&rsquo;s drums, the songs were really starting to
go.  As the last notes faded, Daria looked back at Jane, who had a
huge grin on her face.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Not

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Not
fair,&rdquo; said Quinn.  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind slower stuff. 
You&rsquo;re the one who insists everything be short and to the
point.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;What
can I say?&rdquo;  Jane returned her drumsticks to their previous

Keith Moon.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Or
Animal from the Muppet Show,&rdquo; Daria shot back.  &ldquo;Now,
there&rsquo;s an idea.  We could chain you to the drum kit to keep
you out of trouble.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Cinder
cut in before Jane could answer back.  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay.

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Well,
then, let me talk to my bandmates and we&rsquo;ll see where we go
from here.&rdquo;  Daria smiled a Mona Lisa smile. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Uh.
 Look,&rdquo; Cinder started, and then paused uncomfortably.  &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t have to bother to decide.  I&rsquo;m gonna, uh, take a
pass.&rdquo;  She packed up her bass and lifted it to her back, while
Jane and Quinn exchanged shocked looks.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;
 Daria tried to hide her disappointment.  &ldquo;I thought we sounded
good.  You and Jane really meshed, and the harmony will get better
with practice.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Cinder&rsquo;s
mouth quirked in a half-smile.  &ldquo;Sound&rsquo;s not bad.

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Daria
folded her arms.  &ldquo;Feel free to explain that whenever you

and your sister.&rdquo;  Cinder&rsquo;s glance traveled from Daria to
Quinn.  &ldquo;Total opposites.  If you ever make it, you&rsquo;ll
make the Gallaghers look like the Petersons.  I don&rsquo;t need the
hassle.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;So
you&rsquo;re saying that Quinn and I aren&rsquo;t mature enough to
keep from ripping the band apart?&rdquo;  Daria asked in her coldest
voice.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Cinder
shook her head.  &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t say that at all.  You&rsquo;ve
got as good a shot as anyone.  Maybe better.  You&rsquo;ve got
something good going on.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;So
you won&rsquo;t join, even though you think we have a shot.  Why?&rdquo;
 Jane asked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Even
if do you make it, I&rsquo;ve got a feeling you&rsquo;ll hate every
minute.  Your two bandmates,&rdquo; she nodded at Daria and Quinn,
&ldquo;are a time bomb.  And when they go off, it's not going to be
pretty.&rdquo;  She turned to the door that led up the stairs.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
let myself out.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   The
thud of the closing door was the only sound in the basement for long
moment, before all three girls began speaking at once: Jane excitedly
about their chances of making the big time; Quinn angrily about the
implication that she and Daria were too immature to work together;
and Daria quietly about what in their behavior would set off alarm
bells in someone as experienced as Cinder seemed to be.  Realizing
that her own words were being lost and no actual communication was
occurring, Daria kept her thoughts to herself until Jane&rsquo;s
enthusiasm and Quinn&rsquo;s anger ran their separate courses.  While
they settled down, Daria decided to keep her concerns to herself for
the moment.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
she said, when she judged the other two girls were ready to listen,
&ldquo;who&rsquo;s the next audition?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Quinn
looked shocked.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not mad or worried about what
she said?&rdquo; she asked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
Daria lied matter-of-factly.  &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not going to be
playing with us, so her opinion doesn&rsquo;t count.  What does count
is that we still don&rsquo;t have a bassist.  So we need to worry
about auditions.  Jane?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Jane,
who had been lost in a daydream where both the art and music worlds
groveled at her feet, snapped back to reality.  &ldquo;Uh, we have
two tomorrow afternoon and one on Wednesday night.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Good,&rdquo;
Daria nodded.  &ldquo;So, things are rolling right along.  I have to
work tonight, but why don&rsquo;t you two get here early tomorrow and
we&rsquo;ll go for pizza or something.  On me.&rdquo;  Jane and Quinn
both agreed enthusiastically.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Later,
waiting for the bus in the late February raw, Daria let herself
consider Cinder&rsquo;s words.  She knew that entente between Quinn
and herself was a fairly new phenomenon and she still worried that
the spirit of cooperation could collapse at any minute, revealing
Quinn to be as self-centered as ever, or worse, Daria the rigid
self-righteous misanthrope she&rsquo;d always feared she&rsquo;d
become.  Bands, she knew from watching that peculiar four-headed
entity known as Mystik Spiral, were difficult at the best of times. 
You lived in each other&rsquo;s pockets all the time.  Even as kids,
Daria and Quinn had always been able to avoid each other if they
really needed to, retreating to neutral corners as it were, but
within Girls Together Sarcastically, she knew that wouldn&rsquo;t be
possible.  Cinder&rsquo;s grim prediction worried her, but she knew
there was nothing she could do about it.  She and Quinn would have to
cooperate.  They had been so far, which was encouraging.  As they bus
pulled up, Daria shoved the doubts down.  She and Quinn would be
fine.  They had to be.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Two
months later, the doubts were stronger than ever.  The three
auditions that followed Cimber&rsquo;s had all been unmitigated
disasters.  Despite their insistence on an all-female lineup, one of
the auditions was a guy in comically bad drag who was convinced he
could win them over with his playing, even though it had become
quickly apparent that his bass skills were on a par with his disguise
skills.  Daria had driven him off with a few cutting remarks, and the
girls had laughed about it later.  The other two auditions were
merely bad.  The girls were nice enough, but neither of them had even
Quinn&rsquo;s rudimentary bass skills.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Initially,
it hadn&rsquo;t seemed so bad.  They could laugh at the bad
auditions, not realizing how lucky they&rsquo;d been to get someone
as talented as Cinder on the first try.  As February turned to March
and March to April, the string of failed auditions began to wear on
the girls.  For one thing, the semester was winding down, placing
free time at even more of a premium.  Daria never sweated midterms,
but the end of April was when her various papers were due, each of
which required solid days of research in the library, which had to be
eked out around her classes and job, if Daria was going to stay on
course for graduation.  She knew Quinn and Jane had similar crunches:
Though they both had presentations throughout the semester, the big
projects&mdash;the ones that determined the semester grade&mdash;were
all due at the end of April as well.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>On
top of that were the auditions themselves.  Girls Together
Sarcastically was made up of unknowns, and unknowns simply didn&rsquo;t
draw much talent.  Most of the girls who auditioned were nice enough,
but almost none of them could play even as well as Quinn.  The few
who could were all slightly older women looking for a backing band. 
Girls Together Sarcastically hadn&rsquo;t been founded to play backup
to anyone, so those auditions always followed a similar pattern.  The
bassist would make two or three condescending offers to &ldquo;guide&rdquo;
the girls, after which Daria, acknowledged by mutual consensus as the
best at telling people off, would issue a blistering reminder of
exactly who was auditioning for who.  At that point, the would-be
bassist/bandleader would usually leave in a huff.  If she didn&rsquo;t,
Daria, sometimes assisted by Jane or Quinn, would continue to insult
her until she did. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
problem, Daria reflected, as she headed up the stairs to the
apartment one Friday evening after a dreadful all-day shift at the
bookstore, was time.  Time was at a premium.  Daria had wanted to be
playing in front of audiences after two years, which would be this
August.  To do that, they needed to break in a bassist, but even
stealing an hour to audition one was nearly impossible.  They would
have plenty of time during the summer, but that would be too late. 
After the semester, all three girls were returning to Lawndale for
two weeks&mdash;Daria and Quinn to reassure Helen and Jake; Jane to
see if squatters or her nieces and nephews had taken up residence in
Casa Lane&mdash;and by the time they got back it would already be
June.  If they didn&rsquo;t find someone in the next couple of weeks,
they were going to lose months.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Grim
thoughts in her head, Daria reached for the doorknob, only to pause
as she heard Jane&rsquo;s voice through the door.  Jane&rsquo;s
presence in her empty apartment wasn&rsquo;t a total shock to Daria,
who had given Jane a key on moving in.  Quinn&rsquo;s voice was a
little more surprising, but not much.  Letting curiosity overcome
manners, Daria turned the knob slowly and cracked the door to hear
what they were saying.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>She&rsquo;s
not going to like this,&rdquo; Quinn said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>For
the fifth time, Quinn, Daria will just have to deal.&rdquo;  The
irritation in Jane&rsquo;s voice made Daria wince. &ldquo;If she&rsquo;s
willing to play on our terms and she&rsquo;s as good as she says she
is, I don&rsquo;t see how Daria can object.  Did you set up an
audition?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Yes,
for tomorrow at one.  I&rsquo;m not telling her, though.&rdquo; 
Quinn actually sounded frightened.  Daria briefly wondered what kind
of a martinet she&rsquo;d turned into.  And why was Quinn so worried
about setting up an audition?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Fine.
 I&rsquo;ll tell her,&rdquo; Jane said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Daria
decided that she&rsquo;d heard enough.  &ldquo;Tell me what?&rdquo;
she asked as she pushed open the door, with what she hoped was a
pleasant expression on her face.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Jane
and Quinn both almost leaped to their feet, eyes fixed on Daria with
something akin to horror.  &ldquo;Uh, we have an audition tomorrow,&rdquo;
Jane said after an uncomfortable moment.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>So
I&rsquo;d gathered,&rdquo; Daria said dryly.  &ldquo;Now, which one
of you wants to give me the bad news?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Bad
news?&rdquo; Quinn said tentatively, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no bad
news.  It&rsquo;s just another audition, and she&rsquo;s really
good.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Uh
huh.  That&rsquo;s why you two are hanging around my apartment in
your copious spare time, looking at me like I&rsquo;ve just finished
the Idi Amin Leadership and Home Cooking Correspondence Course.&rdquo;
 Daria gave Quinn a cold glare.  &ldquo;Spill.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Panicking,
Quinn began to babble.  &ldquo;Well, I ran into her at a sale at one
of the boutiques in town and we got to talking and she asked me what
I was up to and I sort of mentioned the band, and I told her we
needed a bass player, and how was I supposed to know she could play? 
She never mentioned it in Lawndale and I never would have guessed,
but then I never guessed that Stacy liked magic so much and I had to
listen to her and, Daria, she&rsquo;s really good&hellip;&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Wait!&rdquo;
 Daria threw herself in the path of Quinn&rsquo;s verbal barrage. 
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s someone from Lawndale?!&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Quinn
nodded, shutting up.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Not
Upchuck in drag, I hope.&rdquo;  This earned a chuckle from Jane.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Well,
that&rsquo;s something, at least.&rdquo;  Suddenly, the pieces
clicked.  Quinn&rsquo;s nerves, Jane&rsquo;s reluctance, the mention
of Stacy.  Everything made sense.  &ldquo;Quinn,&rdquo; Daria said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to ask you again who will be auditioning with
us tomorrow, and when I do, you&rsquo;re going to tell me it&rsquo;s
Sandi Griffin, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Quinn
nodded again, eyes darting.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Fine,&rdquo;
Daria said.  &ldquo;then I won&rsquo;t ask.  I&rsquo;m going to beat
my head against the wall.  Or I could use the basement, where there&rsquo;s
cement.  Much harder than this stuff.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Daria--&rdquo;
Jane began.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Sandi
Griffin, Jane.  I don&rsquo;t like her.  You don&rsquo;t like her. 
For fuck&rsquo;s sake, even <I>Quinn</I> doesn&rsquo;t like her.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Hey!&rdquo;
 Quinn broke in.  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not fair.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Fine,
Quinn.  Look me in the eye and tell me you like Sandi after all the
crap she gave you in high school.&rdquo;  Quinn met her sister&rsquo;s
glare for a long moment before looking away.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
thought so.&rdquo;  Daria enjoyed a brief moment of satisfaction.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Daria,&rdquo;

and Jane leaped into the breach.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>It&rsquo;s
about what, Daria?  We need a bassist.  Let&rsquo;s hear her play
before blowing her off.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Daria
started to say something and stopped.  She stared at Jane for a long
moment and then suddenly rose.  &ldquo;Fine.  Whatever.  Tomorrow. 
Now if you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;d like to be alone.  You can
show yourselves out.&rdquo;  Heading to the bedroom, she slammed the
door on Quinn&rsquo;s plaintive, &ldquo;That didn&rsquo;t go well at
all.&rdquo;  Opening a history text, she tried to study, but couldn&rsquo;t
focus.  Giving up, she put her headphones on, sat on her bed, and
played loud music for hours until she fell asleep.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
next morning, having used the music to burn off her rage, a much

looked up.  &ldquo;Hey, Jane,&rdquo; she said as the door opened.</FONT></FONT></P>

nodded.  &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t played in a couple of days.  I
probably should be studying, but I want to work on my fingering. 
After all,&rdquo; she smiled wryly, &ldquo;we have an audition
today.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Jane
took a seat next to Daria.  &ldquo;About that&hellip;&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Not
your fault, Jane.  Mine.  It&rsquo;s just&hellip;&rdquo; Daria
shuddered.  &ldquo;Sandi Griffin.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Yeah.
 Now Quinn has a Fashion Fiend faction.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Not
just that.&rdquo;  A shower of discordant notes came from the guitar
as Daria strummed aimlessly.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to explain.&rdquo;
 She set the guitar aside, then turned to face Jane.  &ldquo;Until I
moved to Lawndale, I always thought that Quinn was the worst thing
I&rsquo;d have to deal with.  She was vain, shallow, and stupid...
and she was ashamed of me.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;The
cousin thing,&rdquo; Jane said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;The
cousin thing,&rdquo; Daria nodded.  &ldquo;It started at summer camp.
 I was twelve and Quinn had just turned eleven.  And it kept on like
that for five years.  I told myself that it didn&rsquo;t matter.  My
sister was the worst person in the world, so why should I care if she
treated me like crap?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Daria&hellip;&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Things
changed between me and Quinn after we moved to Lawndale.  Slowly,
but&hellip;&rdquo; she paused, with an expressive shrug.  &ldquo;Quinn
started to realize that her head served a purpose besides supporting
bouncy hair, which made her easier to relate to.  And thanks to some
great people, especially my partner in crime&mdash;&ldquo; Jane had
to smile at that, &ldquo;I started to realize that other people could
be worth bothering with.  Even Quinn, I suppose.  You know what the
other thing was?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Lemme
guess,&rdquo; Jane said with a half-smile.  &ldquo;You found someone
worse than Quinn.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Got
it in one.  One of the things that made me see that Quinn had
redeeming qualities was meeting someone with none of those qualities.
 Sandi&rsquo;s like Quinn&rsquo;s more evil opposite.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Like
that <I>Star Trek </I>episode.&rdquo;  Jane
said then grinned.  &ldquo;That gives me an idea.&rdquo;  Pulling her
sketchbook out of her bag, she began roughing out an image in pencil,
an image of a feminine face with long brown hair and attractive
features marred by a black goatee.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Daria
watched her friend indulgently for a minute before continuing.  &ldquo;Yes,
O officer of the Imperial Federation of Planets.  That&rsquo;s what
I&rsquo;m talking about.  I&rsquo;m afraid Sandi&rsquo;s going to be
a bad influence on Quinn, but most of all I&rsquo;m afraid of having
to deal with someone like that.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;You

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;No,
I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;  Daria sighed.  &ldquo;At school, I could
always keep her away.  None of Quinn&rsquo;s friends really wanted
to deal with me.  The only people that would were you, Jodie, and
Brittany.  And even if Brittany only bothered with me because she was
too stupid to know she wasn&rsquo;t wanted, she was at least nice
enough to try.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;We

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Actually,
we do.  We&rsquo;ve been floundering around for nearly two years now,
and we&rsquo;re finally building up some momentum.  We can get paying
gigs by August, but if we don&rsquo;t get a bassist now, we won&rsquo;t
have time to work her in.  Then school starts again and who knows how
much time we&rsquo;ll lose.  I suppose we could force Quinn, but I
don&rsquo;t think her heart&rsquo;s in it, even if she&rsquo;d be
ready in time.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Daria&rsquo;s
right,&rdquo; Quinn added from the doorway as Jane and Daria turned
in surprise.  &ldquo;We do need a bassist and it can&rsquo;t be me.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Who
let you in?&rdquo; Daria gave Quinn an evil look, one that Quinn
returned unruffled.  &ldquo;Grow up, Daria.  I copied Jane&rsquo;s
key three days after you gave it to her,&rdquo; she said, walking
over and taking a seat next to Daria and Jane.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
right about the timing, but only if we&rsquo;re ready.  There&rsquo;s
no way I&rsquo;m going to be ready to play by August.  Not in front
of people.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;So,
if Sandi can do it, I guess she&rsquo;s in,&rdquo; Jane said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Even
is she is my more evil twin,&rdquo; Quinn added.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Quinn&hellip;&rdquo;
Daria said in protest.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Daria&hellip;&rdquo;
Quinn mocked, then added.  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. 
Neither of us was the best sister, but we&rsquo;re past all that,
right?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
Daria paused for a moment, seeing a challenge in
Quinn&rsquo;s eyes.  Cinder&rsquo;s gloomy predictions of renewed
sibling warfare rose in Daria&rsquo;s mind again.  Comparing them to
the Gallagher brothers, who occasionally squeezed in making music in
the band Oasis around a nonstop schedule of abusing each other in the
press, was a particularly low blow.  Ruthlessly, she crushed her
black thoughts.  &ldquo;Yeah, Quinn.  We&rsquo;re past it.  It&rsquo;s
twelve now.  What time did you say the audition was?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;One,&rdquo;
Quinn supplied.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Fine.
Let&rsquo;s set up now, then, so we can get started as soon as she
gets here.  Wouldn&rsquo;t want to keep her waiting.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Both
Quinn and Jane nodded and the three girls got to work.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Sandi
let the last bass note fade, while Daria banged out one more chord
and Jane covered everything with a wash of cymbals before snapping
off a quick roll to end the song.  As the music faded and Quinn left
her mike to towel off, Daria took a deep breath, allowing her to come
to grips with the bare facts.  Sandi was good.  She was better than
good.  The four of them had ripped through eight songs in less than
half an hour and to Daria&rsquo;s ears, no one had missed a note. 
Sadly, the music was not the only issue.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Helen
had once said in Daria&rsquo;s hearing that one of the things she
hated most about Sandi&rsquo;s mother Linda was her disapproving
eyes.  When Daria, for once intrigued by her mother&rsquo;s words,
asked what she meant, Helen had tried her best to explain.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not easy to put into words, sweetie, but with certain people, you can
tell that no matter what they&rsquo;re looking at, they can find
something wrong.  It&rsquo;s just the way they look at everything and
everyone.  Your grandfather Morgendorffer was like that.  Linda
Griffin is, too.  It&rsquo;s like nothing in the world can match up
with what they see in the mirror every morning.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Reflecting
on her mother&rsquo;s words, Daria concluded that whatever other
traits she had, Sandi certainly had her mother&rsquo;s eyes. 
Disapproving eyes.  Not that she&rsquo;d been difficult today.  Far
from it: Sandi had been punctual and reasonably pleasant.  Though she
still pronounced Quinn&rsquo;s name with two syllables, she didn&rsquo;t
refer to Daria as &ldquo;Quinn&rsquo;s cousin&rdquo; once, nor did
she pronounce &ldquo;Jane&rdquo; as &ldquo;that weird art chick.&rdquo;
 In fact, she hadn&rsquo;t said much at all.  She&rsquo;d just played
what she was asked&mdash;a set similar to what they&rsquo;d played
for all the auditions right back to Cinder.  And played it well. 
None of their stuff was musically complex&mdash;no Yes covers
here&mdash;but Sandi was fast and steady, and clicked well with Jane.
 She seemed a gift from heaven, the answer to all their prayers. 
Only she hadn&rsquo;t smiled.  Not once.  And there were those eyes.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   After
Daria and Sandi put their instruments away, Sandi headed upstairs to
let the bandmates make their decision.  Jane, who hadn&rsquo;t moved
from behind the drum kit, leaned forward.  &ldquo;We sounded good. 
Who&rsquo;da thunk the little fashion fiend could play?&rdquo;  Daria
nodded slowly.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Quinn
joined them, having finished her ablutions.  Her doll face was marred
with a frown, though.  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think this going to work,
Daria,&rdquo; she said, without preamble.  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
Sandi&rsquo;s going to fit.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Before
Daria could respond, Jane jumped in.  &ldquo;Why not?  We sounded
great.  She and I really clicked on the backbeat.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Quinn&rsquo;s
frown deepened.  &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s right. 
Working with her will be impossible.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Jane
snorted.  &ldquo;Impossible how, Quinn?  She was punctual, polite,
and efficient.  And she&rsquo;s perfect for what we&rsquo;re trying
to do.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Sensing
an ear-piercing whine coming on, Daria cut Quinn off.  &ldquo;Jane
has a point.  As a musician, do you have any objections to Sandi&rsquo;s
audition?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Quinn
struggled visibly before finally giving in.  &ldquo;No.  She was
fine.  Even her harmonies weren&rsquo;t too bad.  But you don&rsquo;t
know her like I do.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
to know, Quinn?  You were the one who set up the audition.  Now, all
of a sudden you can&rsquo;t work with her?&rdquo;  Jane&rsquo;s tone
was sardonic.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Sensing
her sister&rsquo;s anger growing, Daria raised a hand.  &ldquo;Hold
on, Jane.  Quinn has a point, too.  We don&rsquo;t know Sandi like
she does.  Quinn, what are you worried about?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Daria&rsquo;s
interjection seemed to calm Quinn.  &ldquo;Look, you two saw how she
was today, right?  She was pleasant enough, but she was totally cold.
 That&rsquo;s the nicest she&rsquo;ll ever be to you.  She&rsquo;ll
try to be fake friends with me because we were in the Fashion Club
together, but all she&rsquo;ll really want is to use me to take
over.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;This
isn&rsquo;t the Fashion Club, Quinn,&rdquo; Jane said.  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
no Stacy Rowe to push around here.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t
matter, Jane.&rdquo;  Quinn&rsquo;s voice was cracking, a clear sign
that her temper was, too.  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what Sandi does. 
She takes over.  Doesn&rsquo;t matter if she&rsquo;s the best person
for the job.  I thought she might have changed, you know, but I can
tell she hasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Watching
her sister lose her composure, Daria was beginning to see Quinn&rsquo;s
point of view.  After all, Quinn knew Sandi better than Daria or Jane
did, and Daria knew Quinn.  Her sister clearly didn&rsquo;t want to
deal with Sandi, and after years of watching them interact in the
Fashion Club, Daria could certainly see why.  On the other hand,
Sandi was just what they needed.  Improvement had been measurable
over the last several months, but they had hit a wall with Quinn&rsquo;s
bass playing, and a good bassist was just the thing they needed to
keep the momentum going.  With Sandi, Daria thought they could meet
her timetable.  Otherwise, they didn&rsquo;t have a chance.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   As
if in answer to Daria&rsquo;s thoughts, Jane said, &ldquo;Can we
afford to pass her up, Quinn?  She puts us right where we need to
be.&rdquo;  Unable to answer, Quinn just looked at the floor.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;In
that case,&rdquo; Daria said, feeling they&rsquo;d said all that
needed to be said, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s time we vote.  Jane?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Yo!&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Am

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;And
Quinn?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Quinn
made a small grumbling sound, without looking up.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to take that as a vote against Sandi joining.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Quinn
made no attempt to disagree, so Daria took that as an affirmative. 
&ldquo;I see.  This leaves the decision in my hands.&rdquo; She
sighed.  &ldquo;Wonderful,&rdquo; she said, her tone wry.  &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;d be willing to go upstairs and tell
Sandi that we&rsquo;ll let her know tomorrow?&rdquo;  Jane shot her
an evil look, while Quinn continued to ignore her.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;Fine.&rdquo;
 Daria really didn&rsquo;t want to make this decision, but she&rsquo;d
known from the moment they decided to find a bassist that the choice
would eventually come down to her.  Could she live with Sandi?  Her
heart said no.  Quinn was right; Sandi would wreck everything for the
sheer joy of destruction if she didn&rsquo;t get her way.  But her
head said yes.  She would make it work.  She and Jane were stronger
than Sandi and they&rsquo;d make it work.  Daria Morgendorffer had
always lived by her head and not her heart.  Even if forming the band
was the ultimate expression of emotion over reason, that was no
reason to let emotion determine how things were run.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
got to take her,&rdquo; Daria said.  &ldquo;We have no choice.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>   Quinn
looked up and heaved a resigned sigh.  &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;d
better tell her then.&rdquo;  All three girls headed for the stairs. 
When they got upstairs, they saw that Sandi had made herself
comfortable on the couch.  The television was on and she&rsquo;d
snagged a beer. </FONT></FONT>

This is my first published fanfic, and the first in a planned series of stories about Daria, Jane, Quinn, and Sandi as a band.  The title is taken from the song "Perfect Circle by R.E.M. I like the idea of exploring the relationships between the characters in a different way, and I like rock and roll, so sticking them in a band seemed like a good idea.  It's not anything supported by canon, but it's not outside the realm of possibility.  And besides, it's fun.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Some of my musical references are no doubt out of date, as I'm about 10 years older than Daria, and my taste runs more towards classic rock, anyway.  I'll do my best to reference at least <i>some</i> stuff that kids in college five years ago would listen to, but I make no promises.  Also, I didn't know when I wrote the line, but know now that Billy Joe Armstrong plays guitar, not bass, for Greenday.  That said, I figured it's a natural mistake for Quinn to make, so I left it in.</FONT></FONT></P>
