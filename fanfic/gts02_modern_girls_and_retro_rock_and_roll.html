two, three&#8213;&rdquo; Daria Morgendorffer began to count out the
time again, when her sister Quinn interrupted.  &ldquo;I hate this
stupid song.  Why do we have to do it?&rdquo;</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
gone over this before, Quinn.&rdquo; Daria&rsquo;s eyes behind her
glasses were narrowing, which Quinn knew never a good sign.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a good song to close with.  We'll mostly be doing the same covers
everyone else does, and this will help us stand out, even if our own
stuff doesn't.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Why
would they want to hear it?&rdquo;  Quinn knew she was being
petty&#8213;after all, they'd had this argument several times
before&#8213;but she didn&rsquo;t care.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a stupid
song.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;&rsquo;Roadrunner&rsquo;
is a Boston classic, Quinn,&rdquo; Jane Lane jumped in from behind
the drum kit.  &ldquo;Lots of people know it, but not too many bands
play it any more.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Quinn
was feeling ganged up on again and didn&rsquo;t like it.  She knew
better than to look to Sandi Griffin&#8213;standing mutely, bass in
hand&#8213;for support.  Sandi rarely involved herself in the
squabbling unless it was really important to her, and she&rsquo;d
made it clear that she didn&rsquo;t really care what was in the set
list.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Daria
cleared her throat.  &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re done?&rdquo;  Without
waiting, she started counting time again.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Quinn
knew the argument was tired, and that having it again would piss
Daria off to no end, but she couldn&rsquo;t help herself.  &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
not done.  Isn&rsquo;t there another song we could close with?&rdquo;
 When Daria rounded on her, Quinn swore she could see steam coming
out of her sister&rsquo;s ears.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;You
want us to maybe play something perkier, Quinn?&rdquo; Daria said, an
edge to her voice.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Well,
it might help.&rdquo; When Quinn got nervous, she started babbling,
and under Daria's withering glare, she was off and running.   &ldquo;I
mean, I know we're not doing anything really perky, because that's
what boy bands and teen pop girls do, and we're going for a cooler
crowd, because this is a college town, but there's gotta be something
that's cool enough for college, but not, you know, weird, or anything
because not that many college students wear clothes that are three
sizes to big and don't comb there hair, or at least I hope not...&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Quinn!&rdquo;
Daria shouted, bringing her to a stop.  &ldquo;We have reasons for
doing this song, you know.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;But....&rdquo;
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Before
Quinn could get going again, Daria rolled right over her. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
definitely closing with one of the covers, right?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Quinn
nodded, knowing she wasn't expected to say anything.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;And
we decided it would be cool to close with something related to
Boston, since that's where we all are.  No one thinks a rockin'
medley of hits about New York, LA, or Chicago is going to bring the
house down here.  So we decided to close with 'Roadrunner.'&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  <I>You
and Jane decided</I>, Quinn started to say, before deciding it was a
bad idea.  Getting in Daria's face when she was already angry would
only make it worse, and she didn&rsquo;t want this to turn into a
screaming fight.  &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s so geeky,&rdquo; she said,
retreating for now.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Jane
laughed.  &ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t want geeky, Quinn, you picked
the wrong bandmates.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Look,
this all very productive, but could we, like, get on with it?&rdquo; 
Sandi didn&rsquo;t bother to hide her irritation.  &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re
not playing, I have better things to do.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="DDE_LINK1"></A>
<FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Daria grimaced. 
&ldquo;Sandi&rsquo;s right.  We&rsquo;ve got auditions in ten days,
and I&rsquo;d like to get through this damn song once without
screwing up.  So, if you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; she shot Quinn a
glare before counting off again.  &ldquo;One, two, three, four, five,
six...&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Quinn
slid the key into the lock.  No light under the door.  Good.  She
unlocked and opened the door as quietly as she could and slipped in,
letting as little of the hall light as possible into the living room.
 Jane would sometimes crash on the couch when she&rsquo;d been
sketching or just watching TV.  Waking her would probably be Bad.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Quinn
wasn&rsquo;t really sneaking&#8213;at least she told herself that&#8213;she
just didn&rsquo;t want to talk.  Work had sucked.  She&rsquo;d made
mistake after mistake, and her &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m cute, redheaded,
and really, really trying&rdquo; defense hadn&rsquo;t worked with
anyone&#8213;not even the guys.  Even though it was only Wednesday,
some of the other waiters were going out after work, but with less
than half her usual take in her pocket, Quinn didn&rsquo;t feel like
paying Crestmore Square prices for even one or two drinks.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Shedding
her light jacket&#8213;Septembers could be cold in the Boston area,
especially at night&#8213;Quinn was about to congratulate herself on
her escape when Jane&rsquo;s bedroom door opened suddenly.  Frozen,
Quinn swore lightly under her breath as the living room light came
on.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Hi
Quinn,&rdquo; Jane didn&rsquo;t look out of it at all, which told
Quinn that she hadn&rsquo;t been asleep.  Quinn knew from experience
that her roommate took as long as half an hour to wake up sometimes,
and never less than ten minutes.  &ldquo;I thought you might like to
talk.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Uh&hellip;
thanks, Jane.&rdquo;  Quinn said, &ldquo;but I think I&rsquo;d rather
just go to sleep.  It&rsquo;s been a rough day.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Let
me put that another way.&rdquo;  Jane gave her a Look&#8213;one that
said Quinn would not get off the hook that easily.  &ldquo;I thought
you might <I>need</I> to talk.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &quot;What's
to talk about?&quot; Quinn said.  &quot;I had a rotten night at work
and I'm ready for bed.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &quot;Not
so good during the day either,&quot; Jane quipped.  &quot;How long
did Daria lay into your after Sandi and I left?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &quot;Twenty
minutes,&quot; Quinn sighed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &quot;Only
twenty?&quot;  Jane grinned.  &quot;Daria must be getting soft.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &quot;That's
how long it took me to get past her and out the door.  For all I
know, she's still there yelling at my picture or something.&quot; 
Quinn looked down.  &quot;Jane, the nicest thing she called me were
childish and unprofessional, or at least I think those were the
worst, because I'm not sure what some of the other words meant.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &quot;She
can really do damage when she gets going.  I've never seen someone
wield a tongue quite like that.&quot;  Jane's face twisted into a
leer.  &quot;Other ways are more more fun anyway.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &quot;Ewww.
 I don't want to know.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Jane
laughed.  &quot;Have a seat.  You've had a tough day.  I'll grab a
couple of beers from the fridge, and we can talk.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &quot;Uh
sure.&quot;  Quinn took a seat on the sofa.  They'd gotten it
secondhand, and she felt the red was a little strong for furniture,
but she had to admit it did balance the rest of the room nicely. 
Unlike Daria's place, which was plain and functional, her and Jane's
apartment had a touch of class.  Drapes hung in the windows, and the
coffee table was elegant rather than boxy.  Prints of some of the old
masters, courtesy of Jane, decorated the two of the three walls&#8213;the
fourth was a kitchenette. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Quinn
had to admit, living with an artist had its good points.  Jane had
unerring color sense when she chose to use it, and she knew how to
get good stuff cheaply, something Quinn had never even thought about
until now.  Even the paintings fit the room's design.  Of course,
Jane's room was different, but that had been part of their agreement
on moving in together.  Jane got the bigger bedroom for her artwork,
but Quinn got the closets, and the living space had to be kept
inspiration-free.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  After
a long moment, Jane returned with the beers.  &quot;So, what's up?  I
assume this isn't just part of a complex plot to put Daria in the
loony bin.&rdquo; With a smirk, she added, &ldquo;If for no other
reason than that she'd probably be sent up for killing you.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Quinn
opened the beer and took a sip.  &ldquo;I don't know, Jane.  It's not
like I'm trying to piss Daria off.&rdquo;  Unhappiness painted her
face.  &ldquo;I'm just good at it, I guess.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Jane
gave Quinn a sympathetic smile.  &ldquo;Yeah, well.  It's pretty easy
to do, and you've had more practice than anyone.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;I
know,&rdquo; Quinn said, &ldquo;And it worries me.  Remember what
that girl said at the first audition.&rdquo;  She felt fear closing
over her again&#8213;the fear that she and Daria were doomed to
repeat the sibling battles of their mother and Aunt Rita.  A total
stranger could tell.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Not
really,&rdquo; Jane smiled.  &ldquo;She was kinda out there.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;I
don't know,&rdquo; Quinn said.  &ldquo;She seemed pretty sharp to me.
 She said that Daria and I would never get along, that we'd
eventually mess up everything with our fighting.  She compared us to
the guys from Oasis, you know, the brothers who are always beating
each other up and saying mean stuff about each other in magazines.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Quinn,&rdquo;
Jane's expression grew serious.  &ldquo;It's no big deal.  Cinder
spent an hour with us.  What makes you think she knows us better than
we do?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;If
it was no big deal, why do you remember her name?<I>&rdquo;</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2><I>   </I>Jane
tried to shrug it off, but Quinn was having none of it.  Her eyes
bored into Jane's until Jane gave in.  &ldquo;Alright.  She got to me
too.  But that doesn't change what I said.  Sometimes, you have to
ignore what other people say.  You know, like Daria.  She didn't have
any problem ignoring Cinder.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &quot;Yeah,
well, Daria's good at ignoring people,&quot;  Quinn said, flatly.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &quot;Usually
you, right?&quot;  Jane gave her an impish smile.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;You're
not helping, Jane.&rdquo;  Quinn's voice came out as a whine. She
knew Jane wasn't trying to push her buttons, but the angry words
Daria had hit her with this afternoon were still stuck in her head.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;I'm
sorry, Quinn.  Look, I'll just shut up for a minute.&rdquo;  Jane
grinned again.  &ldquo;I got a beer to finish, anyway.&rdquo;  She
took a long drink.  &ldquo;So do you.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Comparative
silence reigned until Jane finished and stood.  &ldquo;I'm getting
another.  You want?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;I'm
okay.  I still have half of this one left.&rdquo;  As she watched
Jane walk into the kitchen, Quinn shook her head.  <I>If only my
high-school self could see me now.  It's Saturday night and am I out
on a date, drinking wine at a French restaurant?  No, I'm sitting
home, drinking beer with Jane Lane and wondering if I should save
everyone some time and let Daria kill me now.</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  The
offer to room with Jane had come as something of a surprise for
Quinn.  It had taken Daria all of three weeks as a freshman to decide
that dorm life wasn't for her, but Raft rules required her to finish
out the year.  When Jane moved up to Boston in January, she lucked
into an apartment.  Her mother's friend's niece or something had
needed a roommate for the rest of the school year&#8213;the last
roommate had finished school in December and left for a gallery job
in Austin, Texas.  When Jane's roommate finished school, she left
too, to backpack across Europe, an idea Quinn found disgusting.  <I>I'd
love to go to Europe, but not with one change of clothes.</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Quinn
had naturally figured that Daria would move in with Jane, leaving her
to find a place for herself, unless she wanted to deal with what
Daria described as, &ldquo;mutant mystery meat that will make you
long for Dad's kitchen sink stew.&rdquo;  But Daria had found the
one-bedroom in the next town and Jane had invited Quinn to move in. 
Jane had never said why she hadn't roomed with Daria, and Quinn
hadn't asked.  After all, the price was right, the place was
convenient to the T, and Jane wasn't a bad roommate when she was
around, which wasn't all that often.  Quinn wasn't about to look a
gift horse in the mouth.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Fresh
beer in hand, Jane rejoined Quinn on the couch.  &ldquo;So why do you
put up with Daria?&rdquo; she asked without preamble.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;How
can you say that?&rdquo; Shocked, Quinn narrowly missed knocking over
her own beer.  &ldquo;You're her friend.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Yes.
 That's my answer.  But sister's not the same as friend.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Don't
I know it.&rdquo;  Quinn sighed deeply and downed the rest of her
beer.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Jane
said nothing, just waited as the silence stretched out.  It started
to feel like it was alive, alive and pushing down on Quinn.  When the
weight of it became unbearable, she blurted, &ldquo;I want to
understand her.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Like
a light coming on, sudden knowledge filled her and the words came
out.  &ldquo;We pretty much grew up apart.  Even living in the same
house, even sharing a room, we never talked, never showed any
interest in each other.  It's only in the past couple of years I've
even tried to get to know her, and now I feel like she's this really
weird movie with no plot, but maybe if I watch it over and over again
I might figure out the littlest part of what happened.  Being in the
band gives me a chance to watch the movie again.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;So?&rdquo;
 Jane gave a half-smile.  &ldquo;I don't understand my sisters, and
it doesn't bother me.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;You
can get away with it.  The Lanes don't have any family expectations.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Well,
except for the Lane family reunion.&rdquo;  Jane shuddered in memory.
 &ldquo;Did Daria ever tell you about that?  It was the same weekend
you guys went camping and got whacked out of your skulls on
psychotropic berries.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Yeah,
she did or you did.  I don't remember.&rdquo;  Quinn waved a hand
dismissively.  She didn't really remember the camping weekend at all.
 &ldquo;You're never going to go back to the Lane reunion, though. 
The Barksdale women don't have that option.  We'll get pulled into
stupid family stuff, no matter what.  Have you ever seen my mom and
Aunt Rita together?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Daria's
told me stories.  Your cousin Erin's wedding, for one.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;I
don't want that to be me and Daria in twenty years.&rdquo;  Something
new came into Quinn's voice, maybe equal parts sadness and
resignation.  &ldquo;My mom says she loves Aunt Rita, but they fight
like cats and dogs whenever they see each other.  I want to be able
to say I love my sister and know that it's true, and that we love
each other because we understand and respect each other, not because
we have to.  And the band is the best way to spend time with her. 
When she isn't ready to kill me, anyway.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;There
are easier ways, Quinn.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;You've
been Daria's best friend for five years, Jane.  Do you really think
'easier' is the right way to go with her?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Point.&rdquo;
 Jane laughed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Quinn
finished her beer and rose.  &ldquo;Look, it's been a long day, so
I'm going to sleep.  Thanks for listening.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Any
time, Quinn.  Sleep well.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Much
to her surprise, Quinn did.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Over
the next couple of days, Quinn's mood lightened a lot.  Getting back
into the swing of classes helped&#8213;it always took her a couple of
weeks to settle in at the start of a semester. So did her Friday
night at work.  She made more than enough to make up for her
disastrous Wednesday, and got asked for her phone number by three
guys.  She hadn't given the digits to any of them&#8213;there was far
too much going on in her life to keep anything like her old dating
schedule&#8213;but it was nice to be noticed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2><I>   Daria
would appreciate the irony, if she ever thought about my dating
habits, </I>Quinn thought as she counted her take on Saturday
morning.  She sighed, and gloom settled over her like a blanket. 
Today was the first GTS practice since their blowup on Wednesday, and
Quinn wasn't sure what to expect.  Daria ignoring or resenting her
was easy to deal with, but Daria actually mad at her was totally
unpredictable.  <I>Well, it was a nice couple of days while it
lasted.</I>  She pulled on a pair of jeans and a tan top and headed
out the door to catch the T, and headed over to Daria's.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Jane
greeted her at Daria's door, in her usual outfit.  In high school,
Jane had favored a red jacket and black t-shits, but now she favored
red t-shirts and black or dark brown pants.  &ldquo;Sandi's not here
yet, and Daria's already downstairs,&rdquo; Jane said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Quinn
wasn't sure what to make of that.  Quinn knew Daria often wanted to
be alone when she was mad, but she also liked to be alone when she
was happy, and at most other times for that matter.  Wordlessly, she
followed Jane, wondering what to expect.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  They
found Daria with the acoustic guitar over her knee, in jeans and a
black t-shirt, similar to the outfit she'd worn to Alternapalooza all
those years ago.  Her face was creased with deep concentration as she
fingered the strings.  After a moment, she looked up, expression
unreadable, at least to Quinn.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Jane,&rdquo;
Daria said quietly, &ldquo;can you excuse us for a moment?  I need to
talk to Quinn.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Jane
shrugged.  &ldquo;Sure.  I'll come back down when the screaming
stops.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Quinn
gave Jane an unfriendly look, and noticed that Daria did the same. 
Jane grinned and headed up the stairs.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Have
a seat, Quinn,&rdquo; Daria said, her voice still quiet.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  A
little worried, Quinn grabbed a chair.  For once, she truly had no
idea what Daria would say.  Her jaw dropped when Daria's next words
were, &ldquo;Look, I'm really sorry.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  At
Quinn's stunned silence, Daria continued.  &ldquo;About Wednesday.  I
had no right to lay into you like that.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
Quinn finally managed, &ldquo;you didn't.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Daria
digested that for a moment.  &ldquo;Touch&eacute;, Quinn,&rdquo; she
said, with her little smile, and Quinn started to calm down.  <I>It's
funny.  Even though she's the most sarcastic person in the world,
Daria's smiles are all genuine.  She does it so rarely that she only
has one.</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2><I>   </I>&ldquo;I
thought about it and I realized I was out of line.  It's not like you
were making trouble just to make trouble.  I should have listened,&rdquo;
Daria added.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Look,
Daria,&rdquo; Quinn said, &ldquo;I know you think I'm, what's the
word..., frivolous, but I do have reasons for the things I do.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;I
know you do,&rdquo; Daria returned.  &ldquo;I don't know why I
decided you didn't.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Maybe
because old habits are hard to break,&rdquo; Quinn smiled, but knew
there was an edge to it.  Unlike Daria, she did have more than one
smile.  It would have been easier to just take the peace offering,
but her words to Jane last night came back to her.  <I>Easier is not
the way to go.</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;For
both of us, I think,&rdquo; Daria said, all smiles gone.  &ldquo;You
can take or leave the apology, Quinn.  I don't care.  I needed to say
it, and it's done.  But I also wanted to talk about what happened
Wednesday.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
Quinn was suddenly uncomfortable.  &ldquo;It's over.  I accept your
apology, and let's get back to work.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Sure,
Quinn.  But on what?  We still have auditions in a week and we still
don't have Roadrunner down.&rdquo; Quinn started to object, but Daria
raised a hand, and Quinn stayed silent.  &ldquo;I know you don't like
the song, but I've got a good feeling about it.  I know it's pretty
old, but like Jane said, it's a Boston tune.  Not that many people
play it, but lots of people still like it.  And it's pretty catchy,
so even if people don't recognize it, they'll probably dance along
anyway.  We get credit for being fun, without being predictable.&rdquo;
 Daria finished, and sat as if expecting something.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  What
seemed like years, or maybe a minute, passed.  Quinn started to get
nettled.  &ldquo;What do you want me to say, Daria?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;I
want you to tell me why you object to the song.  Believe it or not,
Quinn, I respect your opinion, so if you have good reasons for not
wanting to do the song, we can talk to Jane and Sandi and come up
with something else.  But I need to know what they are.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Shocked,
Quinn thought.  &ldquo;Well, you know, it's like...,&rdquo; she
trailed off.  The problem was, now that she was on the spot, she
didn't really have a good argument.  &ldquo;I mean, I just don't
think it fits my, you know, that thing, like style, but more....&rdquo;
 Not liking the song wasn't going to be enough.  &ldquo;We're four
girls, and the song is old, so the audiences won't... I mean, we
won't... that is....&rdquo;  If she couldn't tell she was beaten by
her inability to finish a sentence, Daria's smug expression
definitely gave her a clue.  She gave in.  &ldquo;All right, Daria,
but if people don't react, we're pulling it right away.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Whatever
you say, Quinn,&rdquo; Daria deadpanned, and Quinn was amazed that
she'd been outmaneuvered so badly.  She liked hearing that Daria
respected her opinion, but she also recognized the leverage that it
gave her sister.  Before she could consider the problem any more, the
thump of boots told Quinn that Jane was coming back down.  Sandi,
dressed in a skort and top combination made up of several
complementary shades of blue, followed.  Quinn noted that Sandi now
favored blues as the base for her outfits far more often than she had
in Lawndale.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Check
it out, Sandi,&rdquo; Jane said.  &ldquo;No blood.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Sandi
gave her a thin smile, one that Quinn recognized from the Fashion
Club.  <I>Now there's someone whose smiles are never real.  I don't
think I've ever seen Sandi smile just because she's happy. She's
always sending a message.</I>  Quinn wasn't sure what the message was
this time, which made her uncomfortable.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Practice
began and they rolled through the dozen or so GTS originals first. 
Since Sandi joined four months ago, their playing had become really
tight.  Her steady bass kept Jane, who liked to play fast, from
falling out of time, but left room to add rolls and fills, which made
the sound denser.  Daria's economical leads were easy to hear but
never got in the way, and Quinn could feel the strong rhythm section
forcing her to find more power in her voice.  To her ear, they
sounded <I>good</I>.  Like pros.  She thought &ldquo;Charmed Circle&rdquo;
sounded especially great, and &ldquo;Wherever You Can Find It&rdquo;
was only a little behind.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Most
of the covers sounded good too.  It was just that one damn song.  As
soon as Daria began to count the time, Quinn began to tense.  Her
singing, which had been so effortless for most of the day, began to
sound constricted.  Halfway through, Daria called a halt.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Aww...,&rdquo;
Jane said, &ldquo;We still haven't gotten to the good part yet.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Quinn,
what happened?&rdquo; Daria asked.  &ldquo;That was awful.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Quinn
gave Daria a glare.  &ldquo;Thanks so much, sis.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Daria
ignored it.  &ldquo;You sounded great on all the other songs.  We
started 'Roadrunner,' and you suddenly sound like a bullfrog.  What
gives?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Quinn
didn't like the sudden look on her sister's face.  &ldquo;I don't
know, dammit!  I try to sing the stupid song, and it just comes out
wrong.&rdquo;  Anger and nerves combined to take over her brain yet
again.  &ldquo;You know, it's like when you've got the perfect
outfit, except for the shoes, and you're so self-conscious that it
messes up the way you walk, and pretty soon, you're stumbling over
every third step until you end up throwing the shoes in the sewer,
and making someone drive you home.&rdquo;  She ran down, and realized
how silly she sounded.  &ldquo;Not that <I>I</I> would know, of
course.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Oh,
I believe you,&rdquo;  Jane cracked.  &ldquo;Doesn't sound like the
voice of experience at all.&rdquo;  Sandi just looked smug.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Fascinating
sidelight, Quinn,&rdquo; Daria said, &ldquo;but I don't see what it
has to do with the damn song.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Look,
Daria,&rdquo; Quinn snapped.  &ldquo;I'm trying to tell you that the
song doesn't work for me.  It's like my body injects it or
something.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Rejects,
Quinn,&rdquo; Jane murmured.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Yes,
rejects,&rdquo; Daria snapped, &ldquo;which is what we're going to be
if we don't get this song down.  Sparing a glare for all of them, she
added, &ldquo;Try harder, Quinn.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Quinn
glared right back,  but before either sister could speak, Sandi
jumped in, &quot;Gee Daria, if you want 'Roadrunner' in the set so
badly, maybe you should sing it yourself.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  A
shocked silence fell, as the tensions in the room suddenly shifted. 
Sandi didn't involve herself in petty details, especially not the set
list.  Quinn's eyes narrowed.  <I>What's she up to?</I>  &ldquo;I'm
the lead singer,&rdquo; she started to say, but was distracted by
Daria's simultaneous, &ldquo;Quinn's the singer.&rdquo;  The sisters
shared a quick look before turning back to Sandi.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Indifferent
to their glares, Sandi addressed Daria.  &ldquo;Look, Quinn's having
a hard time with the song anyway, because it's too low for her voice.
 Maybe if she liked the song, she'd find a way to sing it, but she
doesn't, so it's never going to work.&rdquo;  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  To
Quinn's eyes, Sandi's smirk was unpleasant.  A quick peek at her
bandmates told Quinn that, for whatever reason, neither Daria nor
Jane had noticed.  Well, they didn't have Quinn's experience with
Sandi.  <I>It's weird, though</I>, Quinn thought.  <I>She could have
just let things play out.  She </I>did<I> stop us, when we might have
had another fight.  But she didn't look like she was doing us a
favor.</I>  As she thought, Daria made an &ldquo;uh-huh&rdquo; sound.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;So,
if you're, like, intent on having us do the song, you're just gonna
have to sing it yourself.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Sandi,&rdquo;
Daria said, trying to sound patient.  &ldquo;If Quinn's voice is too
high for the song, what makes you think mine will be better?  In case
you've forgotten, I do high harmonies.  You're the one with the deep
voice.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;The
song's spoken, not sung, Daria.&rdquo;  Jane, forgotten for the
moment behind her kit, jumped in.  &ldquo;And your speaking voice is
right.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;So's
Sandi's,&rdquo; Daria said, sounding annoyed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  If
Quinn was any judge, Daria was starting to feel ganged up on. 
Sometimes that worked, like when she and Jane had convinced Daria
that a fourth Girl was needed.  If it didn't, though, Daria would
eventually lose it again, and Quinn didn't want to deal with that for
the second time in a week.  She threw her sister a little support. 
&ldquo;Yeah, Sandi.  Your voice is better for the song than Daria's. 
Why won't you sing it?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;I
don't like it either.&rdquo;  Sandi's smirk grew more obvious,
leaving Quinn feeling like she'd been outmaneuvered again.  And this
time, she didn't even know how.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;And
you didn't point this out before, why?&rdquo; Daria sounded like
someone trying hard to keep her temper.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;I
care about playing, not about what we play.&rdquo; Sandi shrugged. 
&ldquo;And your reasons make sense.  If you think doing the song is a
good idea, we should do the song.&rdquo;  A faint accent on the 'you'
told Quinn that Sandi was referring only to Daria.  &ldquo;After all,
it's your band.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;That's
a rotten thing to say, Sandi.&rdquo;  Quinn said, recovering from her
shock.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Sandi,
focused on Daria, ignored Quinn </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Look,
Sandi,&rdquo; Daria said, teeth clenching.  &ldquo;We all offer
something, and we all need each other to make this work.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Sure.
 Whatever,&rdquo; Sandi's eyes met Daria's.  Her look was direct,
challenging.  &ldquo;Are you going to sing the song?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  The
question hung there, as Daria met Sandi's gaze with a cold
expression.  Quinn recognized that face on her sister.  Daria was on
a knife edge, wanting very badly to lose it and cut into Sandi but
knowing it was important not to.  With an effort&#8213;visible to
Quinn, and almost certainly to Jane&#8213;Daria got control of
herself.  &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she finally said.  &ldquo;I'm going to
sing the song.&rdquo;  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Quinn
wondered if Sandi realized how close she'd come. <I>Probably. I bet
she wants to see how far Daria can be pushed.</I>  The grim
predictions she'd made four months ago about Sandi wrecking the band 
for the sheer pleasure of it floated into her mind.  <I>She's like
her brothers.  But Sam and Chris break things.  Sandi breaks people. 
Of course, Daria's not very breakable.  </I>Quinn knew her sister
also didn't let things go, even if she had apologized today.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">  <FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Daria's
voice counting off the time called Quinn back to herself.  &ldquo;One,
two, three, four, five, six...&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  </FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  October's
in Jefferson Square wasn't the nicest place Quinn had ever been in,
but it wasn't a total dive either.  The long bar extended back
towards a raised bandstand, but there was space in between for a
decent-sized dance floor.  At least a hundred, maybe two hundred
people could fill the space when a band was playing.  Compared to the
last place they'd auditioned at, it was a palace&#8213;a palace
looking for a steady band for Tuesday nights.  And Tuesday nights
didn't conflict with either Daria or Quinn's work schedule.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Daria,
standing in the doorway behind Quinn, said, &ldquo;Well, it's not
bad.  It's not like our first gig was going to be at the Paradise.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Jane,
to Daria's side, laughed.  &ldquo;It's no McGrundy's, but I could see
us playing here.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Sandi,
bringing up the rear, said nothing.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  The
heavyset man who had let them wore faded blue jeans over work boots
and a buttoned flannel shirt.  <I>Not quite a reject from Seattle,</I>
Quinn thought, <I>but not </I>far.  He looked them over.  &ldquo;So,
you're here to audition for the Tuesday night slot?&rdquo;  Quinn
nodded slowly, and pale blue eyes under beetle brows flicked over
her.  &ldquo;Well, at least you put a looker in front.&rdquo;  Before
anyone could register what he'd said, he turned and walked into the
bar.  &ldquo;Well, come on in.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  They
followed him back to the stage.  Sudden nerves gripped Quinn, and a
quick look at her bandmates told her they weren't doing much better.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Get
yourselves set up,&rdquo; the owner said.  &ldquo;We can do all the
introductions and chit chat after I hear you play.  After all,&rdquo;
he added with less than friendly chuckle, &ldquo;we might not need to
bother.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Uh,
sure,&rdquo; Quinn said.  &ldquo;We'll just get our stuff out of the
van.&rdquo;  She hurried out, to hide her nervous confusion.  The
other Girls followed quickly.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Despite
their nerves, they set up quickly. All four of them understood that
wasting the owner's time was a good way to blow the audition without
getting to play a note, so over the last few weeks, they'd practiced
setting up and breaking down almost as much as they practiced music. 
Quinn had thought it dull, but had to admit it paid off when the
bar's owner gave a little nod at their speed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  They
finished setting up, and the owner stood, arms folded.  Seeing no
indication that he was going to ask them to play, Quinn looked to
Daria and then to Jane, who shrugged and began counting the time. 
They tore into &ldquo;Charmed Circle,&rdquo; then rolled right into
&ldquo;Wherever You Can Find It.&rdquo;  Quinn knew they were playing
well, could feel the music moving her, but she wasn't sure they were
getting across.  The owner didn't change position at all; the music
just rolled over him.  As Jane's last roll died, he grunted, &ldquo;Let's
hear the covers.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  The
owner's disinterest hit Quinn like a lead weight, and she almost
missed her cue in &ldquo;Basket Case.&rdquo;  She could feel the
first verse fall flat, earning her a quick glare from Daria that she
hoped no one else noticed.  As the song roared on, she found her
footing again.  The power of the rhythm section filled her, and she
fell into the song, her voice gaining confidence and power.  They
steamed through &ldquo;Rock and Roll Machine&rdquo; and &ldquo;Helter
Skelter,&rdquo; with Jane in a frenzy on the drums and Daria
uncharacteristically bouncing around the stage wildly on guitar. 
&ldquo;I've got blisters on my my fingers!&rdquo; Jane shouted, and
the music stopped.  All three other Girls shot her a look.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo;
Jane shrugged, an impish smile on her face.  &ldquo;Couldn't resist.&rdquo;
 Not for the first time, Quinn thought to herself that Jane's body
was well-suited for shrugging.  Her long arms caused her shoulders to
roll just so, and the effect was very, very cute.  If Quinn had
Jane's look, she'd be sure to wear tank tops and shrug as often as
she could.  Quinn knew there was no way Jane would take this advice,
but after her years in the Fashion Club, there was no way she could
stop thinking it.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  The
owner was obviously unmoved by Jane's Ringo impression or her rolling
shoulders.  &ldquo;You got anything else?  Something that stands out
a little, maybe?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;We've
got one more,&rdquo; Daria said, sounding a little annoyed.  &ldquo;Ready?&rdquo;
 Quinn nodded back.  So did Jane and Sandi.  Daria counted out the
time for &ldquo;Roadrunner,&rdquo; and they were off.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Since
Quinn didn't play an instrument and the song had very little harmony,
at least until the end, she didn't have much to do except look good. 
So she danced along with the song, noticing that despite the weird
lyrics and minimalist sound, it really did make her want to move. 
And Daria's voice did the song justice in a way hers didn't.  As they
hit the  climax, Quinn began to get a good feeling, a feeling
reinforced by the owner's tapping foot, the first movement he'd made
since they started playing.  By the end of the song, Quinn could see
the man smiling, but he quickly hid it as the music stopped.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Okay.
 Tuesday's yours.  I'll give you a month at $100 a night.  We can
talk more if you stay past that.  And no originals.&rdquo;  All the
Girls stared in shock, but it was Quinn he fixed with his glare. 
&ldquo;Take it or leave it.  I'm not negotiating.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Quinn,
oddly flustered at being singled out, blurted, &ldquo;We'll take it,&rdquo;
just as Daria started saying, &ldquo;We'd like to talk it over for
minute.&rdquo;  Daria glared, and Quinn wilted.  &ldquo;I mean, my
sister's right.  We'd like to talk for a minute.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;I'll
be back in five minutes.  You can give me your answer then.&rdquo; 
He headed towards the other end of the bar, but not before adding,
over his shoulder, &ldquo;The name's Tierney, by the way, Mike
Tierney.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Almost
before he was gone, Jane rounded on Quinn.  &ldquo;What the hell was
that, Quinn?&rdquo; she said, voice low but angry.  &ldquo;You think
maybe the three of us might want a say before you open your mouth?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  The
anger in Jane's voice wiped away Quinn's embarrassment and replaced
it with annoyance.  &ldquo;Were you planning on turning him down,
Jane?  He's giving us a steady gig.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;At
a hundred bucks a week, playing only covers.&rdquo; Jane retorted. 
&ldquo;I'd like a minute to think about what we're getting into.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;We're
getting into a gig, Jane.  That's what we're getting into.&rdquo; 
Quinn could feel her skin going red with anger.  &ldquo;What's your
problem?  Is it because I said something first?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;I
think that's a different Morgendorffer's line, right Jane?&rdquo; 
Sandi's voice was quiet, but even as angry as Quinn was, she couldn't
miss the smirk on Sandi's lips.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Before
Quinn could say anything or Jane could round on Sandi, a whip-crack
voice barked, &ldquo;Stop!  All three of you, just stop.&rdquo; 
Quinn almost didn't realize her sister had spoken, as Daria hadn't
used her 'I <I>will</I> get my way, no matter what' voice in a very
long time.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;We
have four minutes to decide if we take this gig,&rdquo; Daria
continued.  &ldquo;I don't care who said what.  I want to know what
you think we should do.  What <I>all </I>of you think we should do,&rdquo;
she added, sparing a cold glare for Sandi.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
Sandi replied, unfazed by the glare.  &ldquo;What do you think,
Daria?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;I
think we should take it,&rdquo; Daria said.  &ldquo;I want the
experience, even if it's a disaster.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;What
if he cheats us?&rdquo; Jane asked.  &ldquo;I don't like being
pressured, and that's what this Tierney guy is doing.  And who's to
say we're ever going to get to play our own stuff?  I didn't get into
this to be a cover band.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Most
of the other places didn't even offer to pay,&rdquo; Quinn countered.
 &ldquo;They thought we'd be happy with the exposure.  I'm with
Daria.  I say we take the gig and get the experience.  If he screws
with us, we know not to work for him again.  And if it works out, we
can build up a following.  He'll be begging us for our own stuff.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;That's
two for, one against,&rdquo; Daria said.  &ldquo;Sandi?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Sandi
nodded.  &ldquo;Whatever you guys want.  After all, it's not much,
but it's a paying gig.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Jane
sighed.  &ldquo;I never said I was against it.  I just said I wanted
time to think.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;I
know,&rdquo; Daria said, &ldquo;and I'm sorry, but we don't have
time, and it's three to one, so it looks like we're taking it.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Looks
like we are,&rdquo; Jane agreed, as Tierney came back.  &ldquo;I just
hope we're not the ones who get taken.&rdquo;  The rest of the
discussion went quickly, and mostly without surprise, although Daria
did get him to agree to paying them half before the show.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  As
they got in the van to head back to Daria's, Quinn realized she had a
lot to think about.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>She
didn't have much time to think over the next couple of days, though. 
Between schoolwork and work-work, they went by in a blur, until
before Quinn knew it, she found herself on Monday night sitting in a
caf&eacute; in Jefferson Square sipping a mocha latte and waiting for
Sandi, who was already fifteen minutes late.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2><I>   I
really don't have time for this</I>, Quinn thought as she waited. 
She'd just decided to give Sandi another five minutes before
finishing her latte and leaving, when through the store window, she
saw Sandi hurrying up the street, several bags in hand.  <I>Another
blue outfit, </I>she thought aimlessly.  <I>It does suit her, though
not as much as some of the more vibrant colors she used to wear in
Lawndale.</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  As
Quinn's frown deepened, Sandi made her way to the table, her swinging
bags just missing some of the other customers.  &ldquo;Sorry I'm
late, Quinn, but I stopped to pick up a dress and three of the stores
in the Galleria were having sales.  You know how that goes.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Sure,
Sandi.  I know how that goes.&rdquo;  Quinn buried her irritation and
took a sip of her latte. &ldquo;So, what's up?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Well,
I just wanted to, like, catch up.&rdquo;  She sat and hailed a
passing waitress.  &ldquo;Double cappuccino, extra cinnamon.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Quinn
gave Sandi a curious look, which Sandi met with a sheepish smile.  &ldquo;I
know we see each other all the time, but we never sit and talk.  It's
always play this, tune that, how do you want to arrange the other. 
When's the last time we had a real conversation about something other
than the band?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;The
last week of High School.  We didn't see a lot of each other over the
summer.&rdquo;  Quinn tactfully didn't mention the reason they hadn't
spoken much.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Well,
don't you think it's time we did again?&rdquo;  Sandi looked up as
the waitress brought her cappuccino.  &ldquo;Seriously, I feel like I
don't even know what you've done for the last two years.  Well,
besides sing, of course.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Like
that's not enough,&rdquo; Quinn gave Sandi an arch look.  &ldquo;I
also tried to play the bass, which probably wasn't such a good idea.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Sandi
smiled thinly at the reference to her own position.  &ldquo;Gee
Quinn, I'm just surprised you ended up in a band with Daria.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Quinn
found the slight emphasis on Daria's name unpleasant.  &ldquo;She's
my sister, Sandi.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Not
your cousin?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;High
School's over.&rdquo;  Quinn gave Sandi a flat stare.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo;
Sandi's expression didn't change.  &ldquo;It's just that you two
never got along, and now you're, like, spending all your time with
her and Jane.  I'll bet you don't even keep up your old dating
schedule.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Do
you?&rdquo; Quinn asked.  &ldquo;Look, it was fun when we were in
high school, but you grow out of things.  Or into them,&rdquo; she
added.  &ldquo;I've learned a lot these past couple of years.  I know
that I have to work hard to get the life I want.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Just
because of school?&rdquo; The waitress placed a cappuccino in front
of Sandi, who began to stir it absently, intent on Quinn.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">  <FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&ldquo;School's
part of it.  But there's my job, the apartment, the band. I still go
out every couple of weeks, you know, to make sure I haven't lost my
touch, but my priorities are different.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;I
didn't know that waiting tables could be a priority.&rdquo; Sandi's
face was all artless innocence, but her tone was cutting.  &ldquo;Couldn't
your parents pay for your apartment?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Suddenly
uncomfortable with Sandi's questions, Quinn took a sip of her latte
to gather her thoughts.  She knew Sandi wanted something, but in
typical Sandi fashion, she was being deliberately confusing, asking
one question to get the answer to another.  <I>If I know what she
wanted to know,</I> Quinn thought, <I>I'd know how to answer her. 
I'll bet she doesn't think I'll be honest, though, so maybe that's my
best bet.  Hiding one step behind where she thinks I'll be may throw
her off.</I>  &ldquo;Well, it's kinda hard to explain.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;
 Sandi raised an eyebrow and sipped her cappuccino.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Well,
I probably could guilt them into covering for me, but I don't think
it's the right thing to do.  I want to be in control of my life.  As
it is, they still pay for college, but I have my own place, that I
pay for with money I earned, and it makes me feel independent and
more ready for the real world.  Otherwise, I'd be dependent on them
even after I got out of school.  I might even end up back in
Lawndale.  Brr...&rdquo; Quinn shuddered at the thought.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;What
about the band?  You're not in control of that.&rdquo; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;But
I'm not dependent either, Sandi.  The band needs all of us to make it
work.&rdquo; Quinn let a little irritation touch her voice.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Oh,
I think I understand.  Jane and I and you and your sister are
equals.&rdquo;  Sandi sipped her cappuccino, but Quinn thought she
saw the hint of a smug Sandi smile, the same one she'd worn when she
was about to maneuver Tiffany and Stacy into blabbing about Quinn's
neck zit back in high school.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  <I>Shit</I>,
Quinn thought.  <I>Whatever Sandi wanted, I just gave her. I just
wish I knew what it was.</I>  She decided to turn the tables on
Sandi.  &ldquo;So,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you still haven't told me
why you're in Boston.  Last I knew you were going to Lawndale State
to major in marketing.&rdquo;  <I>Right before you blew me off
because I got into a real design school, </I>she didn't add.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Oh,
you know,&rdquo; Sandi's voice was cool.  &ldquo;Plans change.  I
decided school wasn't for me.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  <I>You
flunked out, you mean.</I>  &ldquo;I'm surprised you didn't stay in
Lawndale for a while, or head to New York to look for your big
break.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;My
aunt lives up here,&rdquo; Sandi said.  &ldquo;Boston's not as
fashion forward as New York, but it's better than Lawndale, or even
Baltimore.  My aunt's cool, so I thought I'd see what life was like
someplace less lame than Lawndale before I decide what to be.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Quinn
was sure there was more to it, but she knew better than to push
Sandi.  &ldquo;So,&rdquo; she changed the subject, &ldquo;have you
heard from anyone back in Lawndale?  I know Stacy's still going to
Lawndale Community, and she's been dating the same guy for almost two
years.  Not someone from Lawndale High; I think he went to Oakwood,
or maybe Fielding.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Sandi
shook her head.  &ldquo;I haven't heard from Stacy since college
started.  I'm not surprised, though.  She was never cutthroat enough
for the popularity game, so finding a nice guy was only a matter of
tine.&rdquo;  A wicked smile suddenly lit her face.  &ldquo;I know
what happened to Tiffany, though.  She's married.  To a much older
man.  Regular little trophy wife.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
Quinn gasped.  &ldquo;Anyone we know?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Sandi's
smile grew even more evil, if that was possible.  &ldquo;How about
Charles Ruttheimer, Jr.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;You
mean she's,&rdquo; Quinn's voice rose with every syllable, &ldquo;Upchuck's
stepmother?!  You're kidding me.'<BR>  &ldquo;I swear on my old
official Fashion Club scrunchy,&rdquo; Sandi managed, before having a
fit of giggles.  Quinn soon joined her.  For the next half hour, they
chatted about old places and familiar faces, as if they'd always been
the best of friends.  Later, Quinn reflected on the weirdness of her
relationship with Sandi&#8213;one minute competing in a game that
made one of those games like <I>Risk </I>that Daria used to play look
like tic-tac-toe, the next laughing like the best of friends.  She
knew Sandi had won tonight, so she would be extra-careful until she'd
evened the score.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The next day, just after three in the afternoon, Quinn stood in front of her sister's door, wondering whether to knock.  The Girls had agreed to meet at
five for a quick run through the set before loading up the van and
heading for the bar, and Quinn wasn't sure how, or even whether,
Daria would welcome her two hours early.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  The
decision was taken out of her hands when the door swung open. 
Daria's dress sense had improved since high school.  The skirts had
gotten longer and shirts fit better.  She still favored green, but
softer shades.  The outfit was a bit too librarian for Quinn, but she
had to admit, it suited Daria very well.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  If
Daria was surprised to find her sister on her doorstep, she gave no
sign. &ldquo;I'm sorry, but the this week's meeting of Fashion
Anonymous has been canceled.  If you want, we can organize a field
trip to Wal-Mart, though.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Dar-i-a,&rdquo;
Quinn said, drawing out all three syllables, something she usually
tried not to do.  &ldquo;I'm not here to talk to you about fashion. 
It's not like I have so much free time that I can afford to waste it
trying to do the impossible, like that guy with the rock.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Then
why are you here?&rdquo;  Daria asked.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  After
a long moment, Quinn sighed.  &ldquo;I need someone to talk to.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Daria
looked her over for a long moment before speaking. &ldquo;Well, I was
just heading out to the supermarket, but it can wait until tomorrow.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  She
turned and Quinn followed her up the steps and into the apartment. 
As she headed into the kitchen, Quinn threw herself on the couch
grabbed the TV remote.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;So,&rdquo;
Daria said, as returned with two drinks and handed one to Quinn,
&ldquo;shouldn't you still be in class?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Well,
you know.&rdquo; Quinn said, in her best vacuous Quinn voice.  Now
that she was here, she suddenly wasn't sure what she wanted to talk
about.  &ldquo;My last class for the day is over.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Daria,
of course, was having none of it.  &ldquo;If memory serves, it ends
at 3.  It's now 3:15, and your campus is 45 minutes from here by T.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Quinn
sipped her drink.  &ldquo;It's nice of you to keep diet cola for me,
Daria.  I know you don't drink it, and Jane doesn't either.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Daria
fixed her with a hard glare.  &ldquo;Spill, Quinn.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;I
did cut my one o'clock,&rdquo; Quinn said with a sigh.  &ldquo;I just
couldn't concentrate.  It was like there was a voice in my head
saying, 'Tonight's our first gig,' every minute.  My first two
classes were disasters.  I mean, I got called on three times, and I
wasn't close on any of them.  Once I answered for the other class,
and once I started talking about the band, and I knew I had to
escape, so I got an early lunch, a nice salad with a fat-free
vinaigrette&#8213;Bagel-Bagel does a good one, for a chain bagel
store&#8213;and walked around for a while&#8213;&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Quinn,&rdquo;
Daria interrupted, &ldquo;I don't need the entire itinerary.  I just
want to know why you came here.&rdquo;  She frowned, but added after
a moment, &ldquo;Not that I mind.&rdquo; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Well,
I figured you'd know what to say to calm me down.  After all, nothing
gets to you.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;That's
not quite true, Quinn.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;
Quinn smiled slightly, &ldquo;I'll bet you're not nervous about
tonight.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Well,
no,&rdquo; Daria said.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;See?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Actually,
I'm scared shitless.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Daria!&rdquo;
 Quinn wasn't sure if she was more shocked at the admission or the
language.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Well,
why wouldn't I be?&rdquo; Daria sounded a little impatient.  &ldquo;The
last time I played music in front of an audience was 'Pop Goes the
Weasel' the summer after fifth grade.  You remember how well that
went.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;I
enjoyed it,&rdquo; Quinn said with a smirk.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Because
you were laughing at me.  Mom and Dad and all the other parents had
to polite.&rdquo;  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Quinn
had the grace to look sorry&#8213;a little bit.  &ldquo;That was a
long time ago.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Daria
sighed.  &ldquo;Look, Quinn, I know it's not the same.  For one
thing, I can actually play.  For another thing, it's not just me. 
There are four of us, and I know we sound good, so there shouldn't be
anything to worry about.  But every time I think that, in the back of
my head I hear 'hum hum HUM-HUM hum.'&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;I
can see that.  But I know you.  You're not going to let it stop you.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Of
course not.&rdquo;  Daria said, &ldquo;I may throw up before we get
on stage, but I'm still playing tonight.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Ewww....
Daria.&rdquo;  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Don't
worry.  I promise not to get any on you... as long as you don't annoy
me.&rdquo;  Quinn saw her sister's Mona Lisa smile and knew she'd
been gotten.  She stuck her tongue out at Daria, who chuckled.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;And
Quinn,&rdquo; Daria added, all smiles gone, &ldquo;I know you're not
going to let it stop you either.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Her
sister's bald statement gave Quinn a warm feeling inside.  She knew
Daria wasn't one to sugarcoat things or lie to make anyone feel
better, so for Daria to simply say that Quinn wouldn't fail meant
more to Quinn than a hundred pep talks.  &ldquo;Uh, thanks, sis.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  They
talked quietly for a while longer, chatting amiably about  nothing. 
Quinn liked the sense of closeness the conversation brought&#8213;something
she worried she would never feel around Daria.  Her relationship with
her sister wasn't exactly like her relationship with Sandi, but it
was still complicated and they still didn't entirely understand each
other.  The whole &ldquo;Roadrunner&rdquo; blowup proved that.  But
still, they were trying to get along, and mostly doing a good job.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Quinn
gave her sister a fond smile as the TV started playing the <I>Sick
Sad World </I>theme.  &ldquo;Okay.  But I get <I>FashionVision</I>
after this is over.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Deal,&rdquo;
said Daria, as they settled in to wait for Jane and Sandi.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>At
five to eight, Quinn let herself indulge in one more fit of panic. 
The amps and drums were already on stage, but the band was
downstairs, waiting to be told they could go on.  Jane was sketching
away, while Sandi thumbed through a <I>Waif </I>magazine she'd
brought, and Daria sat quietly, lost in thought.  Quinn sipped at a
diet soda and looked from face to face, silently screaming.  <I>I
can't do this.  I can't.  I can't.  What the hell was I thinking? 
There's no way.  I wonder if I could make it to the back door.  Would
Daria kill me if I ran out now.</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2><I>   A
voice interrupted her terror.  &ldquo;Five minutes, girls,&rdquo;
Mike Tierney said from the top of the stairs.  Five minutes.  What do
I do?</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Is
everyone ready?&rdquo; Daria asked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  <I>No.
No. No. No. No. No. No. </I>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; <I>Look at me.  I'm
Quinn, the little liar.</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Whatever,&rdquo;
Sandi said with a shrug.  Quinn knew Sandi wouldn't show any
weakness.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;If
by ready, you mean terrified,&rdquo; Jane said, &ldquo;then I'm
ready, amiga.&rdquo;  Quinn found Jane's remark, and Daria's
answering smile, comforting.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Okay,
then,&rdquo; Daria said, after a moment. &ldquo;Let's grab our gear,
head upstairs, and blow their socks off.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Whatever,&rdquo;
Sandi shrugged again.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Better
watch out Sandi,&rdquo; Jane said.  &ldquo;All that enthusiasm might
tire you out, and then you won't be able to play.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Sandi
bared her teeth.  &ldquo;I'll manage.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Quinn
looked over to Daria, wondering if they should interrupt.  Daria
didn't seem too concerned, though, so Quinn decided to take her
sister's lead.  <I>I seem to be doing that a lot lately.  But she's
gotten us this far.</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2><I>   Jane
and Sandi lapsed into silence and the next few minutes crawled by. 
&ldquo;It's time,&rdquo; Mike said from the top of the stairs.  Daria
and Sandi grabbed their instruments, and the four girls filed up the
stairs.  Too late to run now, Quinn thought, and seconds later found
herself on the stage staring out at a small sea of faces, some
curious or even intrigued, others bored or actively hostile to the
noise that was going to ruin their conversations.  Her stomach gave a
sickening lurch, and all the fear and worry... was suddenly gone. 
We're going to do this!  And we're gonna be good, dammit!</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  As
Daria and Sandi finished plugging in, Quinn stepped up to the mike. 
&ldquo;We're Girls Together Sarcastically.  And we're gonna knock
your socks off!&rdquo;  Insistent guitar chords signaled the
beginning of &ldquo;Basket Case,&rdquo; and off they went.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>As
Jane let the cymbal wash die, the hundred or so people in the bar
gave a happy cheer.  Quinn smiled down, enjoying the sound.  Sure,
most of them were pretty drunk, and they weren&rsquo;t tearing the
roof off, but they weren&rsquo;t booing or throwing bottles, which
was a good sign for their first paying gig.  She addressed the mike,
&ldquo;Before we go, we&rsquo;d like to do a local favorite for you.&rdquo;
 She turned to Daria, &ldquo;Ready, sis?&rdquo;  Daria nodded in
return, &ldquo;Ready, sis.&rdquo;  Quinn turned back to the crowd,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been great.  We&rsquo;re Girls Together
Sarcastically, and this is 'Roadrunner.'&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Daria
counted off the time, &ldquo;One, two, three four, five, six,&quot;
and banged out three chords&#8213;BAM! BAM! BAM!&#8213;as Jane hit
the drums in perfect sync.  The crowd greeted the sound with their
loudest roar of the night&#8213;after all, this <I>was</I> Boston. 
The music, simple but powerful, surged as Daria half-spoke, half-sung
Jonathan Richman&rsquo;s paean to Massachusetts, modern music, and
the joys of cruising to the Stop and Shop with the radio on.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Me
in love with modern rock &amp; roll/Modern guys and modern rock &amp;
roll/Don't feel so alone, got the radio on/Like the roadrunner,&rdquo;
she said, and raised her arms, letting Sandi and Jane carry the music
for a couple of bars.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Jane
Lane on drums,&rdquo; Daria shouted, and the crowd roared.  Jane
smiled as her sticks moved in time, almost too fast to see.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Sandi
Griffin with the bass.&rdquo;  Sandi didn&rsquo;t even acknowledge
the words, standing stock still as she had all night, though her
fingers flew.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;Quinn
Morgendorffer singing lead.&rdquo;  The crowd roared again as Quinn
shook her long red hair and the beat kept going.  With an arch smile,
Quinn grabbed the mike and pointed to Daria, &ldquo;And Big Sister
Daria Morgendorffer wailing lead guitar.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  Daria
dropped her arms and banged out the song&rsquo;s signature chords. 
&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m in love with modern music,&rdquo; she sang,
&ldquo;with the radio on.&rdquo;  The music once again roared to
fever pitch.  &ldquo;What do you say, Girls?&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;RADIO
ON!&rdquo;  Quinn and Sandi sang in harmony, heads bobbing in time to
the chords, as Daria continued, &ldquo;I got the FM&hellip;&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;RADIO
ON!&rdquo;  The crowd was really getting into it, as Daria improvised
lyrics about the &ldquo;rockin&rsquo; neon streaming sound,&rdquo; to
go with the original &ldquo;modern Massachusetts sound.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>  &ldquo;RADIO
ON!&rdquo;  One last repetition as Jane went nuts on the drums and
Daria spoke the song&rsquo;s famous and appropriate coda.  &ldquo;Right!
 Bye, bye.&rdquo;  Quinn found the crowd&rsquo;s full-throated roar
to be quite satisfying.  <I>We're on our way.  Now, let's see how far
we get.</I></FONT></FONT></P>

Note:</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Well,
here's fic number two in the GTS series.  &ldquo;Roadrunner&rdquo; is
by Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers, who could sort of be
considered a protopunk band insofar as they fit any categories. 
Jerry Harrison from Talking Heads was a Modern Lover.  The song was
recorded in 1973, though not released until 1976.  As the story says,
it's weirdly minimalist, but very catchy.  If you haven't, I suggest
checking it out.  I don't know that it be a big hit with Boston
crowds, but given that Jonathan Richman still plays here every year,
it's not outside the realm of possibility.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Trebuchet MS, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Many
thanks to my beta-readers, Brother Grimace, Scissors MacGillicutty,
and Richard Lobinske, who helped me better capture the characters'
voices.  Without their help, this fic would be a lot less fun.  Look
out for installment #3 before the end of June (I hope).</FONT></FONT></P>
