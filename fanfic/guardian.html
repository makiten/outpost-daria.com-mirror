<p>&quot;Damn screwdrivers!&nbsp; Why can't they make one type of
screw and one type of screwdriver?&nbsp; Would that really be so
difficult!&quot;</p>
<p>I watched as Jake struggled vainly with the light fixture.&nbsp;
He owed me his life, though he didn't know it.&nbsp; The poor kid would have
been char-broiled if I hadn't nudged the light switch into the &quot;off&quot;
position before he'd gone to work on the lamp.&nbsp; That's Jake for you,
though.&nbsp; Thinking things through was never one of his strong points.</p>
<p>&quot;Um, Dad?&nbsp; The rest of the household is trying to
sleep.&nbsp; Except for the lawyers, they're doing paperwork in bed.&quot;</p>
<p>It was Daria, of course.&nbsp; I chuckled lightly at her choice
of words.&nbsp; She and I had a similar sense of humor, God help her.&nbsp; When
I wasn't needed elsewhere, I always got a real charge out of listening to her
banter with her friend Jane.&nbsp; Those kids just crack me up.</p>
<p>&quot;Hm?&nbsp; Oh, Daria, I'm glad you're here.&nbsp; Hand me a
screwdriver, will you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What kind?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know!&nbsp; Just hand me all of them and I'll pick
one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, Dad, you did remember to turn off the switch before
you started working on that lamp, didn't you?&quot;</p>
<p>No, he didn't.&nbsp; But we've been through that.</p>
<p>&quot;Um... yeah!&nbsp; See, it's off!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's good.&nbsp; There's already enough mysterious odors
emanating from this kitchen on a regular basis.&nbsp; No need to add barbecued
Dad to the mix.&quot;&nbsp; She handed him a single screwdriver, which of course
was the one he needed.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks, kiddo!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Any time.&quot;&nbsp; Daria went to the refrigerator,
stepping carefully around her father in order to avoid being hit by the fixture,
which she wisely assumed would fall from the ceiling as soon as Jake got another
screw loose.&nbsp; Like he needed another screw loose.&nbsp; Thinking about that
made me chuckle a bit, with the result that I almost missed the moment when I
had to give Jake a nudge to catch the damn thing when it did fall.</p>
<p>&quot;Whoa!&quot; Jake
teetered on top of the chair, suddenly supporting the weight of the fan.&nbsp;
Wires pulled from the fixture as he struggled vainly to keep it close to the
ceiling to avoid that very thing.&nbsp; I'd have helped him, but there's only so
much I can do when it's not actually a life-threatening situation.&nbsp;
Eventually, he got the thing on the table.&nbsp; &quot;Whew!&nbsp; Got it.&nbsp;
Dammit, all the wires got pulled out!&nbsp; How the hell do I... say, Daria, do you know what all these
wires do?&quot;&nbsp; Jake reached up and started fiddling with the wires.</p>
<p>&quot;They ignite the house if you reconnect them the wrong
way,&quot; Daria yawned.&nbsp; &quot;Come on, Dad, let's just leave it alone for
the night.&nbsp; No one in this house enjoys breakfast anyway, it's not like we
actually need the light on in the morning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh...&quot; Jake hesitated.&nbsp; I applied a little
gentle urging.&nbsp; &quot;Oh, all right.&nbsp; I guess it can wait.&quot;&nbsp;
He stepped down from the chair, his foot heading toward a small screw that was
just barely large enough to roll under his foot and cause a potentially
skull-cracking fall.&nbsp;
Except that I stopped it.</p>
<p>&quot;Good night, kiddo!&quot; Jake called as he bounded up the
stairs.</p>
<p>&quot;'Night, Dad.&quot;</p>
<p>I sighed, and went to take a look at Jake's handiwork.&nbsp;
Sure enough, he had two wires crossed over that would cause a really nasty short
if I left them that way.&nbsp; I reached up and uncrossed them, then went to go
check on Quinn.&nbsp; The next morning, I'd undoubtedly have to offer Jake some further assistance installing the
new fan, or he'd likely kill himself in the process and likely burn his home to
the foundations while he was at it.&nbsp; My work is never done.</p>
<p>Not that I mind.&nbsp; It's what I do.&nbsp; I protect them.</p>
<p>I'm their Guardian Angel.</p>
<p><center>* * * * *</center></p>
<p>It was pretty late by the time the entire house was
asleep.&nbsp; Of course, I don't sleep.&nbsp; A good thing, too, because one of
my most important tasks is undertaken at night, when I listen in on their
dreams.</p>
<p>I started with Daria, not for any particular reason except that
she happened to be pretty deep into REM sleep by the time I got upstairs.&nbsp;
I took a moment just to watch her sleep.&nbsp; She'd be mortified to know it,
but she's really cute when she's sleeping.&nbsp; I could feel a genuine,
fatherly affection toward her at times like these.</p>
<p>Her dreams were troubled ones - they'd been getting that way
lately, mostly due to her growing attraction to her friend's boyfriend.&nbsp; It
was still on a level that her conscious mind wouldn't acknowledge, but her
subconscious broadcast it loud and clear through her dreams.&nbsp; Sooner or
later, I knew it was going to come to the surface, and then I anticipated a lot
of work to do.&nbsp; This is the sort of thing that can tear friendships apart,
and I didn't want that to happen to her.</p>
<p>It's easy to see why dreams are so useful to Guardian
Angels.&nbsp; They often give something of a preview for what to expect, or
insights that one couldn't normally get.&nbsp; Sigmund Freud was reading tea
leaves compared to what we can divine from a dream.</p>
<p>I passed Quinn's room for the time being and moved on to Jake
and Helen's bedroom.&nbsp; This was always excruciatingly difficult, but it was
something I endured on a nightly basis.&nbsp; Jake's nightmares could get pretty
intense, so much so that he usually didn't remember them.&nbsp; And, of course,
I can't interfere with a dream.&nbsp; Jake was a man with a lot of pain in his
past, but I could only help him through it in the waking world.</p>
<p>I steeled myself for the ordeal, and forged ahead.&nbsp; It
would hurt, but it had to be done.&nbsp; It's my sacred duty.</p>
<p><center>* * * * *</center></p>
<p>The next morning, I was mulling about in the kitchen before
anyone else was even awake - something told me it was going to be a busy week,
though just how busy and for what reasons I never would have guessed.</p>
<p>The true sign of a good Guardian Angel is subtlety, getting
results out of unnoticeable adjustments.&nbsp; I managed to keep Jake from doing any further work on the light
fixture through the simple process of causing him to oversleep by ten
minutes.&nbsp; He had to rush a bit and got a little chewed out by Helen, but it
saved him from electrocution for the time being (I wanted to get a closer look
at his handiwork before allowing him to do anything further).&nbsp; The rest of
the day went fairly smoothly, though Quinn seemed to need my help more than
usual.&nbsp; Sure, the kid's got her priorities mixed up, but I like to help her
with the little things from time to time.&nbsp; What can I say, she has a
special place in my heart.&nbsp; Don't get the wrong idea, I love both the
girls, but Daria just doesn't need my help as much.</p>
<p>It was the evening, around six-thirty, that things started to
get interesting.&nbsp; Jake was back at it in the kitchen, and taking up
virtually all my attention.&nbsp; I'd managed to turn one of the wires green to
better match the instructions for the new fan, and this time he at least
remembered to leave the light switch off.</p>
<p>&quot;Dammit!&nbsp; Where does it say which wire is which?&quot;</p>
<p>Okay, so my color coding didn't help.&nbsp; And Daria was coming
in, which probably wasn't going to help the situation.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe a little light would make things easier.&quot;&nbsp;
Daria went for the light switch.&nbsp; I stood back and let her - I'd learned a
long time ago just to let her sense of humor take its course.&nbsp; Besides,
Jake would have to be a real moron to think she was serious -</p>
<p>&quot;No, Daria!&nbsp; <u>Don't</u>!&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, well.</p>
<p>&quot;I was joking, Dad.&quot;</p>
<p>Jake let the incident go.&nbsp; Probably the smartest thing he'd
done all day.&nbsp; &quot;Was this green one always here?&quot; he asked
himself, going back to the ceiling.</p>
<p>Boy, you try to make things easier for a guy...</p>
<p>Well, Jake was confused enough for the time being that he wasn't
likely to try anything stupid.&nbsp; And I was getting a funny vibe from the
next room, so I went to have a look.</p>
<p>Quinn was watching TV with a box of tissues at her side.&nbsp;
The show was - oh, that was interesting.&nbsp; It was about Guardian
Angels.&nbsp; I sat on the couch next to her to watch, keeping one ear on the
kitchen in case Jake suddenly got into trouble.</p>
<p>&quot;The man who rescued Donna that snowy Christmas Eve was no
ordinary roadside mechanic,&quot; the TV was saying.&nbsp; &quot;The authorities
have no record of his existence.&nbsp; But someone - or something - fixed the
flat tire on her sport utility vehicle.&nbsp; To this day, Donna believes it was
a Guardian Angel.&quot;</p>
<p>God, people will believe anything!&nbsp; Like any
self-respecting Guardian Angel would show up as a mysterious roadside mechanic
who just happened to be in the right place at the right time.&nbsp; That's about
as subtle as a shotgun blast in a convent.&nbsp; And I loved how they make all
that noise about how the authorities had no record of him, as if these
mysterious &quot;authorities&quot; routinely keep records on the comings and
goings of local mechanics.&nbsp; I glanced over at Quinn, who was swallowing
this tripe hook, line, and sinker.&nbsp; Poor kid.</p>
<p>&quot;Too bad the angel didn't fix Donna's brakes before she
flattened that family in the hatchback,&quot; Daria said.&nbsp; I chuckled at
that.</p>
<p>&quot;You shouldn't make fun, Daria,&quot; Quinn
admonished.&nbsp; &quot;There are some mysteries that are just beyond our
knowledge.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like the fact that the human ego is bloated enough to
believe that the force that created the universe gives a crap about our
blowouts.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, that's Daria the Skeptic for you.&nbsp; She might even
appreciate the irony that it's when she's driving that she needs my help the
most.&nbsp; Although I've
never fixed a flat tire for her, there was that one time that I prevented her
from flattening a dog with Helen's car, and during that wild ride out to Fremont
I kept one hand on the wheel the entire time.&nbsp; Still, it's just as well she's a
nonbeliever.&nbsp; It kind of makes my job easier that she doesn't feel the need
to depend on me
in any way.</p>
<p>&quot;You wouldn't say that if your life were touched by an
angel!&quot; Quinn insisted.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd be too busy suing for harassment.&quot;</p>
<p>Note to self:&nbsp; retain a good lawyer.</p>
<p>&quot;Daria!&quot; Quinn said.&nbsp; &quot;Don't even joke like
that!&nbsp; Angels are everywhere.&nbsp; They can hear you.&quot;</p>
<p>And this one frequently laughs his ass off at the stuff she
comes out with.</p>
<p>&quot;Then I'm going to my room so we can talk about you behind
your back,&quot; Daria said as she left the room.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people just won't listen to logic,&quot; Quinn said,
going back to her ridiculous program.</p>
<p>I spent the rest of the evening helping Jake, though I did keep
an ear on Daria's room in case she made good on her promise to talk to me about
Quinn.</p>
<p><center>* * * * *</center></p>
<p>More nightmares with Jake that night, one which actually caused
him to wake up in a cold sweat, shivering with terror.&nbsp; Helen calmed him
down well enough, assuring him that his father was dead and that Corporal
Ellenbogen was far away.&nbsp; I offered what help I could as well, calming Jake
down and keeping a hand on his racing heart.&nbsp; After his heart attack the
previous year, I was taking no chances - it had been all I could do to get his
heart started again quickly enough to avoid any permanent damage, even
death.&nbsp; Neither the family nor the doctors ever could have realized what a
close call that was.&nbsp; The day I finally knew he would be all right, I
learned that even angels can cry.</p>
<p>I didn't check on the girls at all that night, staying by Jake's
side until the morning.</p>
<p><center>* * * * *</center></p>
<p>The next day was fairly uneventful at first.&nbsp; Jake actually managed
to get the light fixture up, and without much help from me.&nbsp; Quinn shocked
the hell out of me by going to the library.&nbsp; I followed her around just to
make sure there was nothing I should know about, but it turned out she was just
picking up books on Guardian Angels.&nbsp; I didn't attach much importance to it
at the time, though in retrospect it might have saved me a lot of trouble if I
had.</p>
<p>Daria surprised me as well, agreeing to go to a party at
Brittany's house.&nbsp; There was an event I'd definitely have to attend, even
though I dreaded it almost as much as Daria did - I'm not really into
mind-numbing parties, I go to enough of them with Quinn.&nbsp; I really don't
look forward to the day when she goes off to college and joins a sorority, and I have to worry about her
getting drunk or something.&nbsp; But it's all part of the deal, so I take it as
it comes.</p>
<p>Much to my horror, Jake had taken his successful swap-out of the
kitchen light fixture and was threatening to turn it into a hobby as an
electrician.&nbsp; Now <u>there</u> was something I didn't need.</p>
<p>&quot;Well I'll be damned!&quot; he said, looking up from his
book.&nbsp; &quot;So <u>that's</u> why they call it a male plug!&quot;</p>
<p>It's times like these that I'm glad I never developed the habit
of reading over people's shoulders.</p>
<p>&quot;Where's Quinn?&quot; Helen asked, wisely ignoring Jake.</p>
<p>&quot;I warned you,&quot; Daria replied.&nbsp; &quot;Remove
those day-glo arrows from the floor, and she gets all confused.&quot;</p>
<p>Damn, that kid is a hoot.&nbsp; Quinn actually showed up right
at that moment, showing no sign of having heard Daria's comment, as usual.&nbsp;
And she was carrying one of those books she'd gotten at the library.</p>
<p>&quot;Quinn!&quot; Helen said with no little surprise.&nbsp;
&quot;Is that a book you've got?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Daria smirked slightly.&nbsp; &quot;Sorry to give away the
surprise, but in the end, he eats the green eggs <u>and</u> the ham.&quot;</p>
<p>Normally I might have laughed out loud at that one, but I
suddenly realized something of far greater importance.&nbsp; Jake had screwed
the new light fixture into the drywall instead of the wood beams, and it was
giving way even as they spoke.&nbsp; I leaped up onto the table and held the
fixture against the ceiling, even as I began urging Quinn with all I had to get
out of the chair.&nbsp; But once she and Daria were into a verbal volleyball
match, it was hard to get them to think about anything else.&nbsp; And I
couldn't hold back a solid object from the force of gravity forever.&nbsp; We
angels have considerable power when it comes to life-or-death situations, but
unfortunately, basic forces of nature have even greater power.</p>
<p>&quot;For your information,&quot; said Quinn, &quot;I'm reading
about real-life people who have had encounters with Guardian Angels.&quot;</p>
<p>Dammit, if she didn't move soon, she was going to encounter one
in a fairly sudden and final way.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I know that book.&nbsp; Chicken Soup for the
Stupid.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I just finished a story about a family whose house caught
on fire, and the cat saved their baby's life!&quot;</p>
<p>I considered letting the fixture slip a half inch to warn Quinn
out of the way, but I wasn't sure I'd be able to catch it again if I did.&nbsp;
And with all my attention on the fixture, I couldn't even throw any significant
energy into getting her to move.&nbsp; My only hope was that Daria might
irritate her enough to make her want to leave.</p>
<p>&quot;Technically, that's a guardian cat.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, come on, Daria, you can do better than that!&nbsp; Damn
light fixture!</p>
<p>&quot;You know, I wanted a cat when I was little,&quot; Jake put
in, &quot;but my father never let me have one.&nbsp; 'Dogs are for boys, cats
are for girls!'&nbsp; Well you know what, Dad?? I didn't want a dog, <i>okay?!</i>&quot;</p>
<p>Oh God, this was all I needed!&nbsp; I had enough distractions
without one of Jake's rants about his childhood!</p>
<p>Fortunately, Helen came to my rescue.&nbsp; &quot;Oh my, aren't
those diagrams fascinating?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah!&quot; Jake said, his attention back on the
book.&nbsp; Well, that was one problem less, but I really didn't know how much
longer I'd be able to hold the fixture up,&nbsp; I could feel it starting to
slip, and when it hit Quinn's head, the results could be... I couldn't let
myself think about that!</p>
<p>&quot;Quinn, I think it's wonderful that you're discovering your
spiritual side,&quot; Helen said.</p>
<p>Dammit, don't draw her into conversation!&nbsp; Pretty soon, her
spiritual side was going to be all she had left if she didn't get her ass out of
that chair!</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks,&quot; Quinn said.&nbsp; &quot;I think I'm very
spiritual.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, you take after your mother in that,&quot; Helen
acknowledged.</p>
<p>&quot;You work fourteen-hour-days helping giant corporations
find loopholes to skim on their taxes,&quot; Daria pointed out.</p>
<p>The last screw slipped minutely, and the fixture was hanging
completely free.&nbsp; If I dropped it, only the wires would be left to hold it
up, and I knew that even if Jake hadn't done such a lousy job with them, they'd
never hold the weight of the chandelier.&nbsp; I strained with everything I had
to keep it against the ceiling.</p>
<p>&quot;See, you said it yourself.&nbsp; 'Helping'.&nbsp; That's
spiritual.&quot;</p>
<p>Daria and I just rolled our eyes at that one.</p>
<p>&quot;It's okay Mom,&quot; Quinn said.&nbsp; &quot;Daria just
can't understand because she's so un-spiritual.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh God.&nbsp; This was it.&nbsp; The fixture was slipping and it
would all be over in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>&quot;You know,&quot; Quinn said, closing her book, &quot;I
think I'll finish dinner in my room.&nbsp; I don't want to be disturbed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Too late,&quot; Daria inevitably said.</p>
<p>It almost was.</p>
<p>As Quinn got up, the chandelier finally slipped through my
hands.&nbsp; It dropped heavily onto the very seat that Quinn had vacated
seconds before, shattering into fragments.</p>
<p>You know, there are times when even Angels have to take a deep
breath and sigh with relief.</p>
<p>&quot;Dammit, my fixture!&quot; Jake squealed.&nbsp; Count on
him to miss the damn point entirely.&nbsp; I felt like smacking him, until I
remembered where he learned that kind of attitude from.&nbsp; If I'd been there
for him when he was younger... but I couldn't think about that.&nbsp; It dawned
on me, as I looked at the busted fixture, Quinn's face, and the book in her
hands, that I was about to have some serious issues on my hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Quinn!&quot; Helen exclaimed.&nbsp; &quot;That just
missed you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I mean - yeah!&quot; Jake chimed in.&nbsp; &quot;Are you
all right, sweetie?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh my Gosh!&nbsp; If I hadn't gotten up at just that
second, that would have hit my head!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Or something vital,&quot; Daria said.&nbsp; That was
good.&nbsp; Maybe Quinn would get upset with her and not stop to think that -</p>
<p>&quot;Someone - or someTHING - told me to get out of that
chair,&quot; Quinn said.&nbsp; &quot;Don't you see?&nbsp; This is proof that I
have a Guardian Angel!&quot;</p>
<p>Aw, crap.</p>
<p><center>* * * * *</center></p>
<p>I suppose I should explain.&nbsp; See, there's
very little that's worse for
a Guardian Angel than to have someone in his charge figure out that he
exists.&nbsp; Once they do that, your job gets harder and harder as they stop
taking care of themselves and count on their Angel to solve their problems for
them, until they depend on you completely.&nbsp; Then one day they step in front
of a truck and BAMM! they've kicked the oxygen habit.&nbsp; It makes for an
awfully awkward trip to the other side when you have to spend the entire time
explaining that it's occasionally more than you can do to instantly stop ten
tons of moving steel from turning them into street pizza.</p>
<p>See, Angels have some pretty impressive powers, but we're not
the end-all, be-all shield against danger that we're sometimes made out to
be.&nbsp; I think I mentioned that basic forces of nature have even greater
power than we do, and that's a fact.&nbsp; It only makes sense - if that weren't
the way things are, then nothing bad would ever happen to people.&nbsp; It's
also a powerful truth that Angels help those who help themselves.&nbsp; I knew
Quinn all too well; I knew how she would react to the idea that some presence
was there watching her every move and helping her through the rough times.&nbsp;
It wouldn't take long before she stopped watching out for herself.</p>
<p>I had to nip this in the bud.</p>
<p><center>* * * * *</center></p>
<p>The first thing I had to do was make a plan.&nbsp; See, this was
a delicate situation.&nbsp; On the one hand, I had to get Quinn back to the
point where she wasn't counting on being rescued from any given situation, but
on the other hand, I didn't want to destroy her faith.&nbsp; Lack of faith can
be just as damaging as too much of it.</p>
<p>Step one of any successful strategy is observation.&nbsp; It was
vital that I determine exactly how seriously Quinn was now taking her new
beliefs, and whether this was something that would really take hold or be tossed
out like that $70 pair of shoes that went out of style the week after she bought
them.&nbsp; Sometimes I can't believe her shopping habits.&nbsp; Oh well, we all
have our vices.</p>
<p>Quinn actually did go up to her room to finish dinner, partly
because the kitchen was a mess from the fallen fixture, partly because she
wanted to study the Guardian Angel books she'd taken home from the
library.&nbsp; Much to my dismay, she was even taking notes on them.&nbsp; I'd
only ever seen her get that into studying anything once before, when she
received her first Cashman's catalog.</p>
<p>And the stories in these books were the worst possible
bunk.&nbsp; Angels flying babies from house fires, helping people overturn cars
to release those trapped underneath, holding jumbo jets in the air for crucial
seconds to avoid deadly crashes.&nbsp; Okay, we sometimes do all those things,
but we do it in ways so that you'd never know we were there.&nbsp; We don't fly
the babies out of the fire, we clear the smoke so the firemen can see
them.&nbsp; Subtlety is our watchword.&nbsp; Otherwise, we get problems like the
one I had now.</p>
<p>A sudden harsh throbbing entered my head, and I realized Jake
was having another nightmare.&nbsp; As important as my problem with Quinn was,
it had to take a back seat to this.&nbsp; I left her alone with her books and
slipped back into Jake and Helen's room, sitting beside him so that I could be
there to comfort him when he woke up.</p>
<p>I stayed with him for half the night.&nbsp; Dear God, listening
to those dreams is the ninth circle of hell.</p>
<p><center>* * * * *</center></p>
<p>The next morning I walked to school with Quinn.&nbsp; I knew
that as soon as she ran into her friends, she'd tell them all about me, and I
wanted to be ready to do damage control right from the start.&nbsp; I still
didn't have much of a plan, and that made me pretty uncomfortable, but sometimes
you have to work off the cuff.</p>
<p>Quinn didn't run into any friends until she actually got to
school, where she found Stacy and Tiffany by her locker.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey Quinn!&quot; Stacy called, waving.</p>
<p>&quot;Guys!&quot; Quinn responded, running up to them.&nbsp;
&quot;Guys, you are not going to believe what happened to me last night!&nbsp;
Where's Sandi?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She's still at the mirror...&quot; Tiffany drawled.&nbsp;
&quot;Something about her eyelash curler acting up...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind, this is too important to wait.&nbsp; You're
not going to believe this, but last night I actually had a near-death
experience!&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, swell.&nbsp; This was going to go great.</p>
<p>&quot;See, I was sitting at the table organizing my lipsticks,
and that girl who's been staying with us was being really rude and everything
-&quot;</p>
<p>Quinn tends to be a little creative when she tells
stories.&nbsp; Unfortunately, that meant that she would probably overplay my
role in it as well - and she'd believe her own retelling.</p>
<p>&quot;- and we had just gotten a new chandelier in the kitchen
and I was sitting right under it.&nbsp; Well, I was just sitting there minding
my own business, and the light fixture came loose from the ceiling!&nbsp; And
then <u>something</u> just pulled me out of my chair seconds before that light
came crashing down!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wow!&quot; Stacy said, instantly impressed.&nbsp; &quot;A
real life miracle!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like in that movie... about the Bible...&quot; Tiffany
added.</p>
<p>You know, as a side note, I really wish that
Tiffany girl would just
never talk again.&nbsp; I can think of very few things that get on my nerves as
much as that agonizingly slow and stupid tone she has.&nbsp; But that's neither
here nor there.&nbsp; In any event, an even more irritating presence was
approaching on Quinn's left.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't believe Ms. Barch banned phones in study
hall,&quot; Sandi griped as she walked past Quinn and rudely barged her way into
the conversation.&nbsp; &quot;I mean, what am I supposed to <u>do</u> in there
for an hour?&quot;</p>
<p>The only good thing about Sandi happening along was that I could
pretty much count on a change in topic.</p>
<p>&quot;EEEK!!&quot; Quinn screeched.&nbsp; &quot;Your <u>sweater</u>!&quot;</p>
<p>I smiled.&nbsp; Fashion.&nbsp; The one thing that might distract
Quinn from anything else.&nbsp; For once, I was glad to have such a conversation
to look forward to.</p>
<p>&quot;Isn't it rude when people try to pretend they don't like
something you're wearing because they're secretly jealous?&quot; Sandi asked in
that snotty tone of hers.&nbsp; Quinn could desperately use some new
friends.&nbsp; I've tried to send a few her way, but so far nothing has clicked.</p>
<p>&quot;No, Sandi!&quot; Quinn said.&nbsp; &quot;I almost bought
that exact same sweater, but <u>something</u> told me not to!&quot;</p>
<p>Uh-oh.&nbsp; I got a sinking feeling that this
discussion
wasn't going the way I'd hoped.&nbsp; It was time for some drastic action.&nbsp;
I'm really not supposed to influence the actions of others besides my own
charges, but in this case I felt it was called for.&nbsp; I gave Sandi a bit of a
nudge to say something that might change the course of the discussion.</p>
<p>&quot;Could that something be a mirror?&quot; Sandi asked.&nbsp;
&quot;Because a sweater like this only looks good an a very tall and lean
figure.&quot;</p>
<p>If that didn't get Quinn's blood up, nothing would.</p>
<p>&quot;No, no, no!&nbsp; My Guardian Angel told me not to get the
sweater.&nbsp; He knew you already had it!&quot;</p>
<p>Well so much for that.&nbsp; And matters were worse than I
thought.&nbsp; Quinn was already starting to credit me with the most trivial
things that I had nothing to do with.&nbsp; That could be disastrous.</p>
<p>&quot;Your Guardian Angel is a guy?&quot; Tiffany asked
irrelevantly.</p>
<p>&quot;I think so,&quot; Quinn mused.&nbsp; &quot;I mean,
whenever I talk to him about low-fat yogurt flavors, he seems very detached.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, she had a point there.</p>
<p>&quot;Quinn,&quot; Sandi said, &quot;maybe you'd better stop
putting your coats in storage until we know more about the effects of mothball
fumes on the human brain.&quot;</p>
<p>Ordinarily it ticks me off hearing Sandi make thrusts at Quinn
like that, but for once I was glad for it.&nbsp; Anything that got her
sidetracked from the current conversation was fine with me.</p>
<p>&quot;No Sandi,&quot; Stacy said, uncharacteristically
disagreeing with Sandi, &quot;Quinn really <u>does</u> have a Guardian
Angel.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He saved her life...&quot; Tiffany added.</p>
<p>&quot;And he found this earring I was missing since last
September!&quot; Quinn added.</p>
<p>&quot;But if a Guardian Angel is supposed to help you, why would
he find an earring that's so... eighties?&quot;</p>
<p>Go, Sandi!</p>
<p>&quot;Gee, Sandi, that's a good question,&quot; Stacy agreed.</p>
<p>Go, Stacy!</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah...&quot; Tiffany added, &quot;It's relevant...&quot;</p>
<p>Actually, it wasn't, but what the hell - Go, Tiffany!</p>
<p>&quot;I guess there are some mysteries that are just beyond our
knowledge,&quot; Quinn said with finality.</p>
<p>Dammit!</p>
<p>I sensed the presence of Daria down the hall,
and thought for a moment that perhaps she might be the solution to ending this
conversation before it got any worse, but I knew she
wouldn't approach Quinn in school.&nbsp; Besides, I'd done enough
observing.&nbsp; It was time to take some action.</p>
<p><center>* * * * *</center></p>
<p>The fact that Quinn had started to assume I was responsible for
such things as finding her earrings made the situation ten times worse.&nbsp; Life-or-death situations I'd been prepared to handle for a bit while I got this
mess straightened out, but her new ideas were actually even more
dangerous.</p>
<p>See, if Quinn started giving me credit for every positive thing
that ever happened to her, it could easily have the effect of eroding away her
own self-esteem.&nbsp; People have to be able to take some pride in their own
accomplishments, even if it's something as trivial as finding an earring.&nbsp;
If Quinn decided that I was responsible for everything good in her life, it
wouldn't be that big a leap for her to decide that everything negative was a
sign that I'd abandoned her.&nbsp; And while that would accomplish my goal of
keeping her from depending on me, it wouldn't do her soul any good.&nbsp; And I
was charged with the protection of her soul as much as her life.</p>
<p>It occurred to me, however, that here might lie the solution to
my dilemma.&nbsp; Perhaps if I caused Quinn a minor inconvenience here and
there, she would eventually come to believe that she couldn't depend on me for
absolutely everything - but she might not lose her greater faith.&nbsp; There
was a lot that could go wrong with such a plan, and it's very, very difficult
for an Angel to deliberately harm his charges, even in a small and necessary
way.&nbsp; But I'd done a lot of difficult things since I got this job, and the
prospect of one more wouldn't stop me.</p>
<p><center>* * * * *</center></p>
<p>I got an idea for a plan during lunch, while Quinn was telling
some other friends about my grand and noble deeds, like preventing her history
teacher from embarrassing her in front of the class.&nbsp; I happened to be in a
position to overhear Sandi talking about how pathetic and desperate Quinn was
being, making up stories for attention.&nbsp; It occurred to me that Sandi might
actually be my salvation for once.&nbsp; Her next move would undoubtedly be to
steal Quinn's thunder by conjuring up her own Guardian Angel and ascribe various
deeds to him.</p>
<p>And before anyone asks - I'm sure Sandi does actually have a
Guardian, but we don't tend to talk amongst ourselves.&nbsp; We Angels
discovered long ago what the U.S. Government and the business world has yet to
do, which is that meetings are inherently counterproductive.&nbsp; We concern
ourselves with our own charges, nothing more, and in fact I've never even seen
another Angel directly.&nbsp; That's one reason why going
outside one's own circle is discouraged - I wouldn't want to mess with another
Angel's designs.</p>
<p>But there was no need to influence, only observe.&nbsp; I could
tell that Sandi had that very thing in mind.&nbsp; All I had to do was wait.</p>
<p><center>* * * * *</center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After lunch, all Quinn's friends could talk about was me.&nbsp;
Some of them were having semi-intelligent discussions over whether Guardian
Angels really existed, but most of the conversation was on the lower side of
asinine.&nbsp; Like that Corey kid, who was actually praying to me to grant him
a date with Quinn that weekend.&nbsp; Or those three pathetic morons who stumble
after her all the time, who had become convinced that I was some kind of stalker
and that they should kick my butt.&nbsp; Ooh, <u> that</u> was going to keep me awake at
nights.&nbsp; Yes, I know I don't sleep, it's just an expression for God's sake.</p>
<p>True to form, Sandi was deep into describing the worthy
accomplishments of her own Guardian Angel.&nbsp; I listened closely, ready to
help the situation go my way if needed.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't understand why you're making such a big deal out
of this, Quinn,&quot; she said.&nbsp; &quot;I mean, I have a Guardian Angel too,
I just don't brag about it all the time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really?&quot; Quinn replied.&nbsp; &quot;That's great,
Sandi!&nbsp; What kinds of things does he do for you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, today in the cafeteria, my Angel told me to have the
raspberry/vinaigrette dressing because it will make my hair
extra-luminous.&quot;</p>
<p>So far, so good.</p>
<p>&quot;I had the same dressing!&quot; Stacy enthused.&nbsp;
&quot;I wonder if my hair will get more luminous.&quot;</p>
<p>Tiffany looked.&nbsp; &quot;It didn't.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh.&quot;</p>
<p>Sometimes, I really feel sorry for Stacy.&nbsp; But she's not my
responsibility, and I have a feeling that whoever is watching out for her is
preparing something big for her.&nbsp; But I digress -</p>
<p>&quot;But you always eat salad with vinaigrette dressing,&quot;
Quinn pointed out.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry, Quinn,&quot; Sandi said, turning her nose
up.&nbsp; &quot;Maybe you should tell my Angel to stop being so
consistent.&quot;</p>
<p>Uh-oh.&nbsp; I sensed a sudden, major change in Sandi's
aura.&nbsp; Quinn sensed it too, from the more direct evidence of Sandi turning
suddenly very green and putting a hand to her mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;Sandi?&quot; she asked.&nbsp; &quot;Is everything
okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh... I gotta go!&quot; Sandi said as she ran off to the
girls' room.</p>
<p>Whatever was going on, it suddenly hit Stacy and Tiffany as
well.&nbsp; &quot;Ohhh... I feel really sick...&quot; Tiffany said, even more
protracted than usual.</p>
<p>&quot;Me too!&quot; Stacy said, clutching her stomach.</p>
<p>&quot;That's weird, I feel fine.&quot; Quinn remarked.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it was the salad dressing...&quot; Tiffany said as
she and Stacy bolted as well.</p>
<p>Quinn was left alone, and I could already tell that this plan
was a bust.&nbsp; &quot;Someone - or something - stopped me from eating that
dressing.&quot;</p>
<p>Down the hall, I heard Daria remark to her friend, &quot;I
didn't have it either, but I still feel like I'm going to be sick.&quot;</p>
<p>That made two of us.</p>
<p><center>* * * * *</center></p>
<p>Well, plan A was a bust.&nbsp; It seemed that this was going to
take more than just standing back and letting events run their course.&nbsp; It
was time to try something more direct.</p>
<p>I had noticed that Jake had left a number of tools in his
pockets when he threw his clothes into the laundry.&nbsp; Of course, removing
otherwise lost items from the laundry pile isn't the sort of thing that an angel
generally bothers with, but I thought I'd see if there was anything there that I
could use to my advantage.</p>
<p>What I found was a black roll of electrical tape.&nbsp; Normally
it wouldn't do any damage just sitting in Jake's pocket, but that was before I
got involved.&nbsp; I took the roll and wrapped up Quinn's favorite new jeans
(the ones she had spent three or four hours searching for in three different
malls) to stain them as they went through the wash.&nbsp; It was hard to
do - even though having some clothes wrecked was an incredibly trivial thing
that wouldn't really hurt her, Angels have a powerful instinct to do <u>no</u>
harm.&nbsp; I was fighting everything I had to do what was necessary, and the
only thing that made it possible was keeping the thought firmly in mind that for
her to continue with her delusions about what I was there for would lead to
disaster.</p>
<p>When I got back upstairs, I saw that Helen was reading Quinn's
book.&nbsp; At first I was worried that I'd have another case on my hands, but
it was easy to tell that she wasn't taking it all that seriously.&nbsp; Helen's
a practical woman.&nbsp; I'm glad Jake married her, he needs her.&nbsp; I have
to admit I had some doubts about their relationship at the start, but after
twenty-five years they're doing better than I might ever have hoped.&nbsp; Shows
what I know.</p>
<p>With little else to do, I sat on the couch and read the book
with Helen.&nbsp; It was entertaining enough - some of the stories were
downright ludicrous.&nbsp; I particularly liked the one about the tiny little
high school basketball team that won the state championship with a miracle shot
right at the buzzer, which was contributed to the assistance of Angels.&nbsp;
Never mind that the other team must have been devastated.&nbsp; Okay, for the
record:&nbsp; Angels don't give a flying damn about who wins the Superbowl.&nbsp;
Hope that settles that question.</p>
<p>After a while, Daria came home from her after-school
pizza.&nbsp; &quot;You know,&quot; she said, getting a look at the book her
mother was reading, &quot;the neighbors can see you reading that through the
windows.&quot;</p>
<p>I chuckled, and scooted over on the couch to make room for her
to sit down.</p>
<p>&quot;I wanted to see what your sister's so excited about.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why?&quot; Daria asked with scorn.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Daria, must you be so quick to judge?&quot; Helen
asked, closing the book.</p>
<p>&quot;You're reading a book about cats with wings.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right, some of the stories are a little
farfetched,&quot; Helen admitted.</p>
<p>&quot;Carrying an amputated animal foot for good luck is
farfetched.&nbsp; Celestial middle managers changing the course of human events
is ludicrous.&quot;</p>
<p>I had to agree with her there.&nbsp; You really need to be in
upper management to make a real impact.&nbsp; Of course, someone like Daria in
the right place at the right time can be an even greater force to change
things.&nbsp; All I can do is help her get there.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; Helen said, &quot;Guardian Angels aren't for
you, obviously.&nbsp; But what's the harm in Quinn thinking someone special is
looking out for her?&quot;</p>
<p>Oh God, now I was really starting to feel guilty about the tape
on her jeans.&nbsp; It's for the greater good, I kept reminding myself.</p>
<p>&quot;Like a heavenly personal shopper?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Daria,&nbsp;why does this
bother you so much?&quot; </p>
<p>I sat up and listened.&nbsp;
Getting insight on Daria is hard, even for me.&nbsp; Any opportunity I could get
was worth taking advantage of. </p>
<p>A moment later, I seriously
regretted sitting up and listening as Quinn's shriek ripped through my
ears.&nbsp; Dear lord, that kid can scream.&nbsp; She'd obviously found her
favorite jeans.&nbsp; It's for the greater good, it's for the greater good... </p>
<p>&quot;Someone just mixed Fall and
Spring fashions,&quot; Daria observed.&nbsp; Normally I would have found that
pretty funny, but knowing I was the cause of the distress made it impossible for
me to find any lighter side in it. </p>
<p>&quot;Mom!&nbsp; Mom!!&quot;&nbsp;
Quinn ran down the stairs, jeans in hand.&nbsp; &quot;I took my new jeans out of
the laundry and they have black gunk all over them!&nbsp; How could this
happen??&quot; </p>
<p>Dammit, she was really
upset.&nbsp; I wanted to go over and give her a hug, any kind of reassurance,
but forced myself to stay where I was.&nbsp; She had to learn a lesson. </p>
<p>&quot;Has anyone seen my
electrical tape?&quot; Jake asked, walking in at just the wrong moment as usual. </p>
<p>&quot;I think your Guardian Angel
forgot to check Dad's pants pockets,&quot; Daria suggested with her usual
remarkable insight.&nbsp; If she knew how close to the truth she was, she'd have
been flabbergasted.&nbsp; Of course, &quot;flabbergasted&quot; for Daria
generally manifests itself as her raising two eyebrows instead of one. </p>
<p>&quot;But why?&quot; Quinn
wailed.&nbsp; &quot;Why would my Angel just desert me like this?&quot; </p>
<p>Just rub it in, why don't you? </p>
<p>&quot;Maybe the next book you read
should be, 'When mildly inconvenient things happen to shallow people.'&quot; </p>
<p>Daria had a great way of putting
things in perspective.&nbsp; I started to feel a little better. </p>
<p>&quot;Aw, you can still wear
these!&quot; Jake said, ever the optimist.&nbsp; &quot;There's only a couple of
stains!&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Dad, I'm not Daria!&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Jake,&quot; Helen said,
taking charge as usual, &quot;why don't you tell her you'll replace the jeans
since you're the one who ruined them?&quot; </p>
<p>Jake scowled, but pulled out his
wallet and extracted a twenty.&nbsp; &quot;All right... here.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You can't buy pants for
twenty dollars!&quot; Quinn insisted. </p>
<p>Another twenty. </p>
<p>&quot;Hey,&quot; Daria spoke up,
&quot;why can't I get money for new jeans?&quot; </p>
<p>You don't wear jeans, I thought. </p>
<p>&quot;You don't wear jeans,&quot;
Quinn said. </p>
<p>&quot;Well, then I need money so I
can bribe a dead guy to be my Guardian Angel.&quot; </p>
<p>Helen spoke up.&nbsp; &quot;Jake,
give them each fifty and don't negotiate!&quot; </p>
<p>Jake emptied his wallet into his
daughters' waiting hands. </p>
<p>&quot;So there was a reason for
this after all,&quot; Quinn said, her eyes turned skyward.&nbsp; &quot;Thank
you.&quot; </p>
<p>You know what I said before about
feeling better?&nbsp; Forget I mentioned it. </p>
<p>&quot;There's no commission
involved here, is there?&quot; Daria asked, coincidentally looking right at me. </p>
<p>Real funny, Daria. </p>
<p><center>* * * * *</center> </p>
<p>Obviously, this was going to take
some more direct action.&nbsp; It was vitally important that I straighten Quinn
out and get her off this idea that I, or any supernatural force, was there to
watch and guard her every move.&nbsp; Sooner or later, something would come
along to hurt her that I couldn't stop, and it would be better if that something
were an inconvenience instead of a freight train. </p>
<p>I decided to keep attacking the
problem on a level that would get her attention, but wouldn't do any sort of
lasting harm - namely, her clothes.&nbsp; Naturally she decided to wear her new
jeans to the party that night, and they became my target.&nbsp; I thought about
simply spilling some nail polish on them or something, but it had to be public
or it just wouldn't work.&nbsp; I was going to have to embarrass her.&nbsp; It
hurt me even to think about it, but it had to be done. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, it hadn't escaped my
attention that Daria was starting to feel a little neglected.&nbsp; She didn't
know why, of course, but on some level she was sensing that I was spending far
more time on Quinn than I was on her.&nbsp; There was nothing I could do about
that right at the moment, but I made a promise to myself to make it up to her
later.&nbsp; Fortunately, she was going to the same party that night, so I was
at least able to keep tabs on her easily. </p>
<p>The party itself was a fairly
standard high school affair - loud music, sodas, chips, people hanging out in
cliques.&nbsp; I'd been to dozens of them with Quinn, hated them all, but it's
part of the job so I try not to complain.&nbsp; Upon her arrival (fashionably
late) Quinn's first order of business was to compel one of her many admirers to
get her a soda.&nbsp; That was a habit I'd like to break her of - I mean, more
than half the time she doesn't even drink the damn soda, but aside from that it
would be dangerous for her to let strange guys get her drinks once she got to
college.&nbsp; However, tonight wasn't the night to do it.&nbsp; I had bigger
fish to fry. </p>
<p>I figured that if I just waited
long enough, an opportunity would present itself, and sure enough it did.&nbsp;
While Quinn's friends were having one of their usual idiotic conversations, in
ran Brittany's little brother in full football gear and shaking Brittany's
pompoms.&nbsp; He rounded a corner in the living room and headed straight for
Quinn. </p>
<p>Silently asking her forgiveness, I
lowered Quinn's hand slightly so that - </p>
<p><i><b>SPLAT!!</b></i> </p>
<p>Brian's helmet struck her diet
cola with lemon and splashed it liberally over her front.&nbsp; It was a perfect
bulls-eye.&nbsp; I'd have taken pride in it if I could, but the guilt set in
even faster than the stain. </p>
<p>&quot;My <u>new</u> new
jeans!&quot; Quinn said in despair, looking over the damage. </p>
<p>Sandi, of course, was pleased as
punch.&nbsp; &quot;Gee, Quinn... I hope no one thinks you had an accident.&quot; </p>
<p>Quinn gasped as the implications
hit her. </p>
<p>&quot;Brr...&quot; Tiffany said. </p>
<p>&quot;Yeah!&quot; exclaimed
Stacy.&nbsp; &quot;That's so humiliating, you just want to die!&nbsp; Um... I
imagine.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Maybe your Guardian Angel
better give you a ride home,&quot; Sandi said.&nbsp; &quot;That is, if he hasn't
deserted you.&quot; </p>
<p>Quinn's face fell.&nbsp; &quot;No,
he'd never do that,&quot; she insisted.&nbsp; &quot;He's probably, um, just
testing me.&quot; </p>
<p>I could tell her faith was
shaken.&nbsp; I only hoped it would be enough, but not too much.&nbsp; I wasn't
sure how much more of this unpleasant business I could take. </p>
<p><center>* * * * *</center> </p>
<p>I went to go sit down for a
moment, keeping an ear out for trouble but getting away from the party so I
could gather myself back together.&nbsp; It may seem like a little,
insignificant thing, causing Quinn's jeans to get splashed with soda.&nbsp;
Intellectually, I knew that.&nbsp; But a Guardian Angel's mission is Sacred, in
the highest and most literal sense of the word.&nbsp; We are sworn to protect,
to do only good, to help and not hinder.&nbsp; For me to even cause the
slightest harm was like a blow to the stomach. </p>
<p>I'll try to explain - suppose you
were trapped in a burning building with one of your children, and the child was
pinned under something heavy, and the only way to get him free was to break his
leg.&nbsp; Now, if it was a life-or-death situation, I'm sure you'd do what you
had to do, but it would be excruciatingly hard nonetheless.&nbsp; I'm not saying
that hitting Quinn with a beverage was quite that difficult, but it's difficult
in the same way.&nbsp; Even though I knew it was for her own good, it's hard. </p>
<p>Once I'd had a chance to collect
myself, I went back to the party to see how Quinn was dealing with her
crisis.&nbsp; She had slipped away from her friends with a handful of paper
towels, and was looking for an out-of-the-way place to clean herself up.&nbsp;
She was lucky in that all the attention in the room was on Steve Taylor and his
presentation of a stupid crystal bullhorn to his bubbleheaded daughter, so it
wasn't hard for her to go unnoticed. </p>
<p>Then she sat on the band's sound
equipment. </p>
<p>I knew what was coming, but it was
happening so fast I couldn't stop it.&nbsp; Like I said before, our powers are
strongest when it's a life-or-death situation, and this didn't qualify.&nbsp;
All I could do was grab the attention of one of the band members and turn his
head to see what Quinn was doing. </p>
<p>&quot;Hey!&nbsp; You're leaning on
the mixing board!&quot; he shouted, even as the feedback through the speakers
hit the resounding factor of near-crystal. </p>
<p>Too late! </p>
<p>The bullhorn shattered in
Brittany's hands. </p>
<p>&quot;My bullhorn!&quot; Mr.
Taylor shouted. </p>
<p>Suddenly, all eyes were on Quinn,
stained jeans and all.&nbsp; I felt her humiliation as if it were my own. </p>
<p>&quot;Sorry,&quot; she said
lamely.&nbsp; &quot;I'll buy a new one... I promise...&quot; </p>
<p>Just when I thought things
couldn't get any worse, along came Sandi to pour salt on the wound.&nbsp;
&quot;Some Guardian Angel,&quot; she said.&nbsp; &quot;He didn't even stop you
from destroying that... item.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I... I...&quot; Quinn
couldn't find the words.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Oh!&nbsp; Where's my Angel?&quot; she
squealed, leaving the house in tears. </p>
<p>I hung my head in shame over what
I'd done.&nbsp; I wanted to slap that self-satisfied smirk off Sandi's
face.&nbsp; But even if that were the sort of thing I could ever bring myself to
do, it wouldn't be the right target.&nbsp; This was all my fault. </p>
<p>I followed Quinn out of the party
and walked beside her all the way home, feeling the weight of her anguish with
every step.&nbsp; Her faith was crushed, her beliefs shattered like that tacky
glass bullhorn.&nbsp; I had failed her.&nbsp; </p>
<p><center>* * * * *</center> </p>
<p>That night, I stayed by Quinn's
side for as long as I could, focusing all my power on reassuring and comforting
her.&nbsp; None of it did any good.&nbsp; It was a long while before she was
even able to fall asleep, and when she finally did, her dreams were of sad and
desolate places, where she wandered lost and lonely through a cold world.&nbsp;
All I could do was stay by her side and will her to understand, but it did no
good.</p>
<p>A person like Daria, who has
little confidence in things outside her direct experience, is easy for an Angel
to deal with.&nbsp; &quot;Just because they don't believe, it doesn't mean they
can't receive&quot; - that's an old rule of thumb among Angels.&nbsp; But
there's a world of difference between a lack of faith and a broken faith.&nbsp;
Staying on the ground doesn't hurt; it's when you try to climb and fall that you
suffer.</p>
<p>Her suffering was due to my
actions.&nbsp; There is no greater torture for an Angel to endure.</p>
<p>It was about three o'clock when I
finally had to leave Quinn's bedside.&nbsp; It was Jake, of course, trapped in
another dreadful nightmare from his youth.&nbsp; Quinn's dreams were troubling,
but for the moment, Jake needed me more than she did.&nbsp; I kissed her on the
forehead and wished her the sweetest dreams I could before going to Jake to
offer what comfort I had left to give.</p>
<p>I never did make it back to Quinn
that night.</p>
<p><center>* * * * *</center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next morning, it was all I
could do to get Quinn out of bed before noon, but even once she was up and
dressed, she just went downstairs and dropped in front of the TV.&nbsp; She
wasn't even watching it really, it was just something to keep her conscious mind
occupied while the rest of her sat in despair.&nbsp; I felt just awful, but
there was nothing for the moment that I could do.&nbsp; Sure, she was out of
danger in the sense that she no longer depended on me to get her lipstick on
right, but at what cost had this security come?&nbsp; Too high a price, to be
sure.</p>
<p>We were both sitting there, down
in the dumps, when Daria happened by.</p>
<p>&quot;Um, Quinn?&nbsp; You're
watching an educational program.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's the difference?&quot;
Quinn replied.&nbsp; &quot;My Angel's gone.&quot;</p>
<p>I felt about two inches high.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe he's just stuck in the
engine of a jumbo jet,&quot; Daria offered.</p>
<p>I wish.</p>
<p>&quot;Right,&quot; Quinn
sighed.&nbsp; &quot;You know, I know Guardian Angels sound like a dumb idea, but
once I started believing in them, it felt really nice.&nbsp; Like there was
someone put here just to do things for me.&quot;</p>
<p><font size="2"><i><font face="Verdana">I'm here, Quinn</i><font face="Verdana">,
I thought.&nbsp; But she couldn't hear me.</p>
<p>&quot;You mean, besides the entire
male population of Lawndale High.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's not the same
thing,&quot; Quinn insisted.&nbsp; &quot;Daria, you're smart, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I'm no Brittany
Taylor,&quot; Daria said, &quot;but the occasional electric impulse does shoot
through my brain.&quot;</p>
<p>I almost smiled.&nbsp; Almost.</p>
<p>&quot;So if there are no Guardian
Angels, what do you believe in?&quot;</p>
<p>In spite of my own melancholy, I
sat up and paid attention.&nbsp; This sounded like it might be important.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess I believe in
treating people the way you'd want to be treated,&quot; Daria replied.</p>
<p>&quot;But there's nothing watching
over us?&quot; Quinn pressed.&nbsp; &quot;Nothing keeping track?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, there's the IRS,&quot;
Daria said.&nbsp; &quot;And those guys with the black helicopters.&nbsp; Quinn,
until I see some pretty convincing evidence to the contrary, I think we're on
our own.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But... but... that's so
sad!&quot; Quinn said.</p>
<p>I was inclined to agree.&nbsp; I
dropped onto the couch next to Quinn and shook my head.</p>
<p>&quot;Um, then again,&quot; Daria
continued, &quot;I don't have any proof that there <u>isn't</u> something out
there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what about the
bullhorn?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe the Angel didn't think
that saving an overpriced, undeserved knickknack was the most efficient use of
his time.&quot;</p>
<p>I looked up in astonishment.&nbsp;
Dammit, the kid had a point!&nbsp; What was I beating myself up over?&nbsp; I
glanced over at Quinn, and to my further surprise saw that she was smiling!</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah!&quot; she said.&nbsp;
&quot;Maybe Angels only get involved with really big stuff.&nbsp; He was
probably playing his string thing when the bullhorn broke and didn't even hear
it!&nbsp; That makes sense, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think what makes sense is
to believe whatever makes you feel best,&quot; Daria said.</p>
<p>I felt the heaviness lift from me
like fog in the sunlight.&nbsp; More importantly, I could feel Quinn glowing
with happiness and hope once again.</p>
<p>&quot;You know what?&quot; Quinn
said, &quot;I'm going to stop relying on my Angel so much for little things and
let him do his important stuff, and just know that if I need him for anything
really critical like a complexion crisis or an unanticipated weight gain, he'll
be there!&quot;</p>
<p>Well, Quinn has her priorities, I
guess.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks, Daria!&quot; Quinn
said in conclusion as she left with her head held high and her faith restored.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't mention it,&quot;
Daria said flatly.</p>
<p>&quot;No, Daria, I think I will
mention it,&quot; I said warmly, my arm around her shoulders.&nbsp; &quot;Thank
you.&quot;</p>
<p>She couldn't hear me, not in a
real sense.&nbsp; But somewhere deep inside her, she knew she had done something
good.</p>
<p>It's like I said before... we
Angels have considerable power, but it takes someone like Daria to change the
world.&nbsp; And I'm sure someday she will.&nbsp; After all, if she can restore
the shattered faith of an Angel, who knows what else she might be capable of?</p>
<p><center>* * * * *</center></p>
<p>That night, I went to Daria's side
and eased her mind into a deep and restful sleep.&nbsp; I owed her far more
attention than I'd been giving her of late, and I promised myself that I
wouldn't let her take second place in my heart ever again.&nbsp; Sure, she had
her independent spirit, but she needed me too.&nbsp; Almost as much as I needed
her.</p>
<p>Then I went to Quinn.&nbsp; She
had already gone to sleep, a sweet smile on her face as she dreamed of some new
boy that had caught her eye.&nbsp; I left her to herself - everyone deserves
some moments of privacy.</p>
<p>Then I felt the sharp stroke of
Jake's dreams stab into me again.&nbsp; Gathering up my resolve, I left the
girls to their peaceful slumber and went to Jake's side.&nbsp; He was twitching,
moaning, ducking away from the onslaught of his own subconscious.&nbsp; I reached out and took
his hand, steeling myself for the
onslaught of another nightmare.</p>
<font face="Verdana"><font size="2">
<p>But then... and I'll never know how... it somehow didn't
happen.&nbsp; Instead, Jake squeezed my hand back, the terrifying images fading
from his head into a vision of pricelessly rare happiness from his youth.</p>
<p>&quot;Daddy,&quot; he mumbled in his sleep, and smiled.</p>
<p>Even Angels can cry.</p>
<p><center>* * * * *</center></p>
<p>I knew the nightmares would be back, and I would there to help
him through them.&nbsp; They would always be a part of him.&nbsp; So much
pain... so many regrets.&nbsp; And it was all my
doing, my fault for not understanding.&nbsp; I never gave Jake the support and
love he needed.&nbsp; He hates me, and I can't blame him for it, as I gave him
every reason to.&nbsp; But no matter if it takes an eternity, I will atone for
my sins.</p>
<p>I was never there for my son, but I will always be there for his
family.<br>
