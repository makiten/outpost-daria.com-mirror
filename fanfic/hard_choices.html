</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I'm
going to kill her.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I'm not
being euphemistic here. I am going to go over there, break into her
house, and then I am going to kill Daria Morgendorffer.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">She
deserves it, the fucking bitch. She sat there, she told me she wasn't
interested in him, and the very next thing she does, she's making out
with MY fucking boyfriend. And then, THEN, she has the unmitigated
balls to tell me about it. But what's new about that? She's been
bitching about me dating for almost a whole damn year.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">God, I
wish she'd never come here. I wish I'd never talked to her in that
god damn self-esteem class. I was perfectly...well, maybe not HAPPY,
but I wasn't in the spotlight all the fucking time. The teachers left
me alone, the other idiots at Lawndale High left me alone, Li left me
alone.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Then in
comes &quot;Shit Stirrer&quot; Morgendorffer and WHAM! Suddenly, I'm
in the principal's office more times in two years than I've ever been
in my entire school life. Shit after shit, every damn thing that
rocked her closed little black-and-white world, and she dragged me
into it. And, like an idiot, I went along with it, just because I
thought she was my friend. The one person who wouldn't ever stab me
in the back. The person who actually made me care.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">And
here's little Janey, the big fucking dope.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I
should have known something like this would happen when I joined the
track team. Hell, if I actually had a brain in my god damn head, I
should have known back during Brittany's party in sophomore year when
she gave me crap about going in the laundry room with what's-his-ass.
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">She
doesn't give a damn about anyone but herself. She thinks she does,
but she doesn't. Anytime anyone does something she doesn't like, she
actively works to fuck them over. She does it to the teachers, she
does it to the other kids,  she does it to her family.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">And now
she's done it to me.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Well,
the others may have to take her shit, but I don't. I'm not rolling
over to make her feel better about herself. I gave her so much slack
when I started dating Tom. I knew she was going to have a hard time
without me being around as much. I knew she was going to take it
hard. I knew the chances of her finding someone else she'd be as
close to were almost zero.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">So I
forgave her. When she apologized, when she didn't, when she knew she
was wrong, and even when she still thought she was right. Whether she
asked for it or not, I forgave her. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Because
that's what you do for the people you love.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">What
you DON'T do is jump your best friend's boyfriend who, up until
recently, you professed you couldn't stand and really didn't want to
be around. And you definitely don't do it less than six hours after
you just made up after a fight and reassuring your paranoid best
friend that you weren't interested in her boyfriend at all.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">You do
not do that. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">And you
do not get off without paying for it.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">How
many more people is she going to make miserable just because they
happen to disagree with her? How many lives is she going to ruin
because somebody doesn't meet up to the ridiculously high standards
she's set for humanity? How long is it going to be before someone
makes her pay for all that smug self-righteousness?</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Not
very, I can tell you that. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I'm
going over there. Right now. I'm putting an end to all this bullshit.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I leave
my room and head downstairs. I really don't care if Trent hears me or
not. I'll just say I'm going for a walk. Wouldn't be the first time
I've gone out at three in the morning, especially after all the shit
that's happened over the last couple of days.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I'm out
the front door and over to the Morgendorffer house in ten minutes.
Huh, Jake's car isn't in the driveway. Wonder where he is?</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I
couldn't be that lucky, could I? The parents out of town at yet
another pointless marriage seminar?</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Well,
no sense taking chances. I round the house to the sliding glass door
leading to the kitchen. Oh, Daria, you should never have shown me how
you get in when you forget your keys.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I grab
the flathead screwdriver she hides in one of the oversized planters
in the flowerbed next to the door and use it to jimmy the latch. I
slide the door open quietly. At least Jake keeps the thing well
lubed. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I slip
inside and crouch down behind the counter, listening for any sounds
of movement in the house. Jake's a notoriously light sleeper with a
craving for midnight snacks.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">After a
couple of minutes silence, I'm reasonably certain the household is
asleep. I get up from the counter and make my way into the living
room, rounding the corner by the front door. I wish I had the time to
take off my boots, but if I have to make a hasty exit, I don't want
to be caught without them on.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I creep
slowly upstairs, freezing every so often when I make one of them
creak too loudly. There hasn't been any reaction yet. I'm starting to
wonder if anybody's even home. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I
almost wish that's true.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I make
it to the top of the stairs and figure out where to go from there.
Jake and Helen's room is just past the top of the stairs, while Daria
and Quinn's rooms are down the hall. I see that the door to Jake and
Helen's room is ajar. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I sneak
forward and decide to take a quick look inside. Empty. Well, Daria
did mention that her mom was working on some big case. Maybe she
asked Jake to meet her for an office rendezvous...</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I think
I just threw up a little.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I
swallow the bile and start making my way back down the hall, towards
the two-timing bitch's room. I stop at a door in the hallway and open
it. Yep, just like I thought: linen closet. Oh, and look, a couple of
spare pillows, how convenient.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I take
one of the pillows and make my way down to the two bedroom doors that
face each other at the end of the hall. I twist the knob of the door
on the left slowly and ease the door open a crack.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Quinn
is curled up in the bed, thumb in her mouth, sucking quietly. Well,
that explains one hell of a lot. It also makes my job a hell of a lot
harder. If Daria starts screaming or fighting, that's it. Next on
Sick Sad World: &quot;Reform School Stripdown&quot; starring Jane
Lane.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I'm
going to have to do this quick.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I close
the door to Quinn's room and slowly open the door to Daria's. I slip
inside with the pillow and close it behind me. Daria hasn't closed
her drapes and the moonlight is falling across her bed. She's lying
face down on it, fully dressed, glasses askew, one hand on the floor.
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">You
fucking bitch. I'm up all night turning all this shit over in my
head, trying to figure out how things could have gotten so impossibly
fucked up, and meanwhile, you're over here happily stuck in
dreamland? And why the hell are you dressed?</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I
ponder this. Her clothes are disheveled, she has a serious case of
bed hair, and she hasn't even bothered to take off her boots. It's
almost as if...</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">...she'd
been somewhere else tonight and got back so tired she just collapsed
into bed.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">My
teeth clench and tears form in my eyes. I begin squeezing the pillow
as I imagine my hands closing around her throat and slowly crushing
it. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">She
FUCKED him! She's been with him, and she FUCKED him! That's what
happened. She was probably over there after our little chat. The one
where I told her I was okay with her dating him. The one where I put
her at ease, and gave her the hope that we'd get through this. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Sometimes,
she's the dumbest bimbo who ever lived.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Well,
I'm going to remedy that. Right now.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I
approach the bed and take the pillow in both hands. Just wrap it
around her lying, cheating face and hold it there until she
suffocates. I'd rather she suffer something more painful, but I want
to get this over with and get my life back to where it used to be
before this bitch came into it.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Her
breathing is shallow, slow, labored. Doesn't seem quite right, but
fuck it. She's going to have bigger breathing problems soon enough. I
take a step forward, ready to bring the pillow down...</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">...and
nearly hit my head on the ceiling as a rattling sound startles the
shit out of me.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I drop
the pillow on the floor and freeze, my own breathing now fairly rapid
and my heart thinking that now might be a good time to test how well
my system could handle a coronary. After a minute, I'm calm again and
I look down to see what the hell I kicked when I came over to her.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">A
plastic bottle. She must have had it in her hand. I kneel down and
grab the bottle, noticing a piece of paper underneath her fingertips.
There's some scribbles on it that look like Daria's handwriting.
Well, let's see what the little bitch has to say for herself.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I stand
up, hold the paper in the moonlight and squint to make out the
words...</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">--</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><I>I
betrayed my only friend. I told her I wasn't interested in her
boyfriend, I reassured her that her suspicions were groundless. That
all that was happening is that the two of us were finally starting to
get along.</I></P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><I>And
then I kissed him. And once the shock had worn off...I kissed him
again. </I>
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><I>Keeping
this from her was unthinkable, but the thought of losing her was
unbearable. I spent the night and most of the morning worrying about
which would be more painful to live with.</I></P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><I>As
soon as I saw her, I told her. And I swear I heard her heart break. I
don't know if it was for her relationship with him, or for her
friendship with me. Maybe both. </I>
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><I>She
came to see me earlier. I told her I wasn't going to see him. She
said she didn't mind if I did. That we 'made sense.' I asked if we
were still friends.</I></P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><I>She
tried to give me hope, but she also said that we were the kind of
friends who couldn't stand the sight of each other. She left after
that. I haven't talked to her since. HE tried calling shortly after
that, but I begged off, telling him I wanted to be alone.</I></P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><I>I
don't know if she'll ever talk to me again. And I don't know if I can
handle that.</I></P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><I>So,
I'm going to let fate decide. Quinn went to bed an hour ago and has
to leave early for some idiotic Fashion Club meeting. Mom and Dad are
spending the night in Lakeside after meeting with one of dad's
clients. There's no one here to interfere with me. </I>
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"> <I>I
just did something colossally stupid. Something that will surely be
misinterpreted. But this isn't suicide. It's an experiment.</I></P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><I>If I
wake up tomorrow, I'll take it as a sign that there's still hope.
That she may eventually forgive me. Forgive me for something much
worse than everything else she's forgiven me for. That I haven't
utterly destroyed the best thing that ever happened to me.</I></P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><I>If
not...well, I guess that means I'm getting exactly what I deserve. I
let something other than my brain do my thinking for me, and I've
paid the price.</I></P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><I>I
just don't think the price was high enough. Not for this. I don't
even think not waking up would be a high enough price. If she showed
up with a gun and wanted to shoot me dead, I wouldn't let her.</I></P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><I>Not
because that wouldn't be fair, but because I don't want my shit
tainting her anymore. She's too good for that. She's always been the
better of us. The optimist, the social one, the one who tried to show
me when I was acting like an idiot and that the world doesn't suck as
much as I think.</I></P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><I>I
don't want to ruin her anymore. </I>
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><I>So,
here comes the effects. I probably won't be able to write much more
soon. Just know that I wasn't depressed outside of what's happened
recently, and, if I don't wake up, know that there's no one to blame
but myself for being such a self-centered, inflexible brat. I'm sorry
to everyone who'll be affected by this. But I'm even sorrier that I
let this happen in the first place.</I></P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><I>I
love you, Jane.  </I>
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">--</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">YOU
STUPID FUCKING BITCH! WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?!</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">You say
you love me and you do something like THIS?! Are you out of your god
damn mind? I ought to kick your ass from here to Oakwood! You are not
dropping this shit in my lap, Morgendorffer. Jesus Christ, do you
really think I want you to die on me?!</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Oh God.
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I drop
the pillow as I realize what I've just thought. I was going to kill
her. I was actually going to murder someone. And for what? Just
because of some guy.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Forget
what's wrong with her. What the fuck is wrong with ME?</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Yes,
she's a two-faced bitch. Yes, she betrayed my trust. But being an
asshole doesn't mean she has to die for it.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I
crumple the note in my hand and look at the bottle. Sleepy-Tyme Fall
Asleep Aids. I look back at the floor and spot a ring of cellophane,
a wad of cotton, and an open box. Okay, so she got a fresh bottle.
Let's see how many she took.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">The
bottle's mostly full. According to the box, there's about 70 pills in
here. Looks like...yeah, she downed about ten of them. Could go
either way.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I kneel
down and shake her shoulder. &quot;Daria...Daria, wake up! Open your
eyes, dammit!&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I grab
her, pull her upright, and shake her hard enough for her glasses to
fall off. After a few seconds her eyes open and she peers at me,
blurrily.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Jane?&quot;
she asks. &quot;'s that you?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;You
are a fucking moron, you know that?&quot; I say. She hangs her head.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;I
know. Sorry.&quot; She moves to lie back down on the bed, but I yank
her to her feet. She struggles, but the pills have made her weaker
than usual. Not that it matters. If it ever came to an actual fight,
I'm faster, stronger, and a lot more prone to fighting dirty than she
is.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Come
on.&quot; I throw one of her arms around my shoulders and half-drag
her out into the hallway towards the bathroom. &quot;How long ago did
you take them?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Mmmm?&quot;
she murmurs. Oh, this is going to be such a LOVELY conversation. I
lightly slap her with my free hand.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;The
pills. When did you take them?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;What
time izzit?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Three-thirty.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;'bout
an hour ago...&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Okay,
there's still time. Gonna have to get any of the pills that haven't
dissolved yet out of her system. I kick open the bathroom door, drag
her inside, and dump her on the floor next to the toilet. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Daria?
Daria!&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Hmm?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Oh,
Jesus fucking Christ on a rocket powered pogo stick. I'm gonna have
to do this the hard way. I sit on the floor next to her, throw a leg
across her lap so she can't bolt, and grab the back of her head.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;HEY!&quot;
she yelps.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Shut
up.&quot; I reply. I take my other hand and shove the first two
fingers into her mouth. She bites down reflexively, but I just force
them inside deeper. She starts struggling and I bend her over the
toilet.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Don't
fucking fight me, Morgendorffer.&quot; I snarl. &quot;You brought
this on yourself.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">She
makes a few more grunts of protest. I wrap my arm around the back of
her head and pry her jaw open. I shift my other hand around and shove
the fingers I have in her mouth past her tongue and down her throat.
She tries to bite again, and I thrust my fingers forward when she
opens her mouth.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Bingo.
She starts coughing and hacking. She tries to grab my hand and pull
it out. I change my grip on her hair and pull. HARD. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Puke,
god damn it! PUKE!&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria's
scream is muffled by my fingers and cut off sharply as I shove my
hand deeper into her mouth. The coughing is replaced by gagging and
she suddenly bends over the toilet and begins unleashing an
admittedly impressive pile of vomit into the bowl.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I
really wish I had managed to get my hand out of her mouth quicker.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">While
Daria pukes her guts into the bowl, I slide over to the tub and wash
off my hand. Jesus, it's all over my shirt. God damn it. I look at my
former best friend in disgust. She has her head halfway down the
bowl, her back arching with each heave. Eventually, she stops and
rolls off the bowl and collapses on the floor. There's puke in her
hair, and a rivulet running down her face.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I wish
I had a camera.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I let
her rest for a minute and look into the bowl. There's eight half
dissolved green capsules mixed with  what looks like remains of the
ubiquitous Morgendorffer microwave lasanga. Okay. She'll still be a
zombie for the next few hours, but she'll be waking up at least.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I need
to get out of here. I get to my feet and head for the door.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;...jane...&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I stop
at the door. Oh God, please, not this...don't make me...</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;...jane...hel'
me...pl'z...&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Don't
make me care about her.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Don't
turn around. Don't look at her. Just leave. Just go. Let her explain
what she did to her parents. You don't owe her shit.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;...'m
sorry, Jane...so sorry...please...help me...&quot; Her voice is
hitching. Fuck fuck fuck. I take a step through the door. And then,
she starts crying.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Fuck.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I turn
around, close the door to the bathroom, and turn on the shower. I
kneel back down on the floor and unlace her boots. She makes a few
quizzical noises but I ignore them. Once the boots are off, I reach
up, unzip her jacket and pull it off her.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Jane...wha'z
goin' on?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Shut
up. You want my help, keep your fucking mouth shut.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I
unhook her skirt and toss it aside, then work on getting her shirt
off. Jesus, it's like trying to skin an epileptic eel. Once she's in
her underwear, I grab her under the arms and roll her over the edge
of the tub and under the stream.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Instantly
her eyes bolt open and she opens her mouth to scream. I slap my hand
over her mouth.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;You
scream and so help me I will tell your parents EXACTLY how fucking
stupid you are.&quot; I snarl. I don't bother to see if she
understands me. I wash the puke out of her hair and off her face as
best I can. She's fighting me the whole time, but at least she's not
screaming. The last thing either of us need is Quinn in here.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Once
I've got her as clean as I can, I turn the water off and drag her out
of the tub. I drop the lid of the toilet and sit her down on it. Her
bra and panties are soaked and, of course, she wears boring white
ones. I grab a towel and begin drying her off, ignoring her
shivering. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;'ank
you, Jane.&quot; She mutters, looking up at me through stringy soaked
hair. Her eyes are sunken, glassy, and hollow. I don't think she even
realizes that she's not dreaming.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Shut
up.&quot; I repeat, dropping the towel over her head. I rub her head
a few times with the towel, then stand her up and wrap another one
around her body. I let her sit there and go back out into the
hallway, down to Quinn's room. I crack the door and let out a sigh of
relief when I hear snoring. Jesus, the girl's a damn buzzsaw.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Back
before I hated Daria's guts, I might have told her about it so we
could get it on tape.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I go
back to the bathroom and find Daria passing out on the toilet. I
stand her up and lead her back to her room. I'm tempted to just dump
her on the bed and have done with it. But, given what I came over
here for, it might be better for me if she thinks it was all a
dream...or as much of one as I can convince her.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I look
in her dresser and find her oversized Mark Twain T-shirt. I toss it
on the bed, pull off her sodden socks, stand her up and unhook her
bra.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Wha?&quot;
she murmurs. She crosses her arms over her chest. &quot;No...don'
look. Not pretty.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I force
her arms down and pull off the bra, then peel off her panties. She
tries to fight me on that too, but she's so doped up, there's no real
challenge. I turn to the bed and unfold the shirt. Out of the corner
of my eye, I see her standing there, arms crossed, shivering and
naked.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Pathetic.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I turn
and pull the shirt over her head. This time, she doesn't fight me.
Once the shirt's on, I pull back the covers on her bed and dump her
into it. I pull them back over her. Okay, main problem solved. Let
her wonder where her underwear went. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I turn
to go back to the bathroom and finish the job,but I notice her
glasses on the floor by my foot. I am so tempted just to crush the
damn things and have done with it. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">But,
like an idiot, I don't.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I fold
them and put them on the nightstand. Then I go back to the bathroom,
grab her boots and put them in the hall. I use her clothes to clean
up any stray vomit in the room, wrap them in a towel and leave the
bathroom.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I go
back to Daria's room, and drop her boots next to her bed. I pull the
loose change and cash out of her jacket pockets and leave them next
to her glasses, along with all the other crap I find in there. Then
I, grab the pill bottle, the crumpled note and the box the pills came
in. I give the room a quick once over then turn to go.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">And,
once again, I make to the door and--</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Jane.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I pause
in the doorway, turning my head just enough so she knows I'm
listening. The room is still dark except for the moonlight, and I
hear the bedclothes rustling as she turns to look at me.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;m
sorry, Jane. 'm so sorry. 'm a hear'less bitch.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">So
who's arguing?</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Go
to sleep, Daria.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I
finally get the hell out of there. I stop just long enough to drop
Daria's puke laden clothes in the washer and start it up. I exit back
out the sliding glass door, thankful that it has the kind of lock you
can set before you close the door.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I walk
back home, actutely aware of the drying puke on my own clothes. Once
I'm inside the house, I take off my boots and strip. Yeah, I get
naked in my own foyer. Big fucking deal. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I
through the kitchen, into the laundry room, and dump my clothes in
the washer. I double check to make sure Mom hasn't put clay in there
again to soften it up, then start it up.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I have
a bathrobe hanging on the back of the laundry room door. This isn't
the first time I've had to come home and clean my clothes
immediately. I put on the robe and go back into the kitchen. I raid
the fridge and, miracle of miracles, there's a relatively fresh half
block of cheese in there. I take it out and begin gnawing on it,
making my way back to the living room. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I flop
down on the couch and stare at the pile of mail that's accumulated on
the coffee table. I need to get out of here. Away from this house.
Away from this town.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Away
from that zoned out bitch I just cleaned up.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">As I
wonder what the hell I'm going to do, I spot what looks like a
catalog in the pile of bills, collection notices, and general junk
mail. I pull it out. The cover shows a collection of rustic looking
cabins and buildings on the shores of a sparkling lake. The leaves
are vibrant green, and the mountains in the distance have snow on
their caps. God, what a great looking place.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Hmm.
&quot;Ashfield Arts Community.&quot; Oh, hey! This is that place
Mom's friend from college runs. I leaf through the brochure and get
more excited with every flip of the page. Cafeteria, lectures by
eminent professional artists, &quot;a community of like minded
talents,&quot; and some great hiking trails that would be fantastic
for running. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I have
to go here. It's quiet. It's secluded. It's perfect. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I can
get some work done, clear my head...</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">...maybe
find a new best friend...</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Hrm...they
want a portfolio submitted by...okay. This is doable. I can put it
together today, send it express on Monday, and I should make the
deadline. I wonder if Dad's developing stuff is still in the
downstairs bathroom. I need to make some slides.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">--</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I spend
the weekend getting the portfolio together for Ashfield. Amazing how
much I can get done when I don't have to listen to some prolonged
sarcasm-laden indignation about something. Luckily, making slides is
a breeze for me now. I may not see Dad all that often, but, damn, is
he a good teacher.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">On my
way to school, I stop at the post office and spend the thirty bucks
to ship the slides to Ashfield overnight. I really don't care if I'm
late. The school year's winding down, and the less questions I have
to answer about what's going on between me and Daria the better.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">In
fact, I don't see Daria for most of the day. We finally meet up in
English. I take a seat on the opposite side of the room from her,
noting only that she doesn't seem to remember anything that happened
in her house the other night.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Either
that, or she's too embarassed to want to talk about it. Either way
works for me.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">As soon
as the bell rings, I gather my stuff and head out. I see Daria out of
the corner of my eye tryign to get my attention, but she's waylaid by
O'Neill. She tries to brush him off, but he won't shut up. I'm just
about out the door when he calls me.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Oh,
Jane! I think Daria wants to talk to you.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I stop
at the door, and look back at her, my face just as expressionless as
hers usually is. She has a nervous look on her face. She opens her
mouth, but no words come out. She raises her hand in a kind of
cautious wave.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">I turn
and leave the classroom. I've got things to do.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
