<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Jane.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane was walking through Lawndale High’s corridor. Students
were cleaning out lockers, Daria was catching-up to her. That Jane didn’t want.
After the messy effects with Tom, the last thing Jane wanted was her friend’s
company.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Her friend’s? Jane wasn’t sure that she wanted to stay
friends with Daria. Actually, she was confused. Daria was her number one friend
in LH, literally, and now Jane wasn’t sure that she wanted to go back to being
a “Friendless loser”, to quote Sandi Griffin. But the whole betrayal-over-Tom
thing hurt her feelings too. “I think I'm finally finding out how it feels like
to be a Lane,” Daria spoke from behind Jane, shaking her out of her reverie.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That can't be, since it's only afternoon and you're already
out of bed,” Jane shook her head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I mean the lack of tiresome parental involvement. Mine have
been so busy they completely forgotten to force me in some dumb summer activity.
I'm turning into you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, you've got so much else of mine, you might as well
take my identity,” Jane said, rather bitterly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Take a joke, Daria.” Jane said, even though it was obvious
to both of them that that wasn't a joke. “Anyway, Que Ironico: you don't have
summer plans, I do.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ironico is not a word,” Daria pointed-out. Jane ignored
that, though made a note not to use this word around smarter people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“This old commune mate of my mother's runs an artist's colony.
I've been accepted into their summer program.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That's great,” Daria said in her flattest voice ever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That sounds sincere,” Jane said that in mock-sincere tone
herself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why didn't you say anything?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I didn't want to jinx it. Two months of painting and
sculpting my heart out in a collage town in the middle of nowhere. Starting
this weekend.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Does this collage town have a name, or do you do you just </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>turn left at the kid with the tractor?” Daria asked,
somewhat unhappy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Cheer up Daria. Without me around you'll have that much
more time for your budding social life,” Jane said, knowing that that would
hurt anyone, even Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Allison.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey, Allison!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Allison Markowitz turned around. “Oh goody, it’s the Sandman,”
she said in a flattest tone she could ever use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey! Don't speak of me that way!” snapped Even Miller, his
sandy-coloured hair sticking-up indignantly, like a hedgehog’s prickles. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, how would you like me to speak to you?” Allison said.
“Slowly and without any short words?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Evan seethed. “Look, it’s unfair. You went-out with another
guy every other week, while I just went-out with this girl, and-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You forgot the anecdote. To break a wedding, it’s easier to
kill one woman once, than one man each week.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m sorry, but I’m not up-to-date with your North
Battleford humour.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Score one for you,” Allison almost said. Ever since her
family had moved from Saskatchewan to Michigan, she and Evan Miller were
hanging around each other a lot. However, their relationship wasn’t much, since
Allison was hanging around with each new guy (or girl) about every other week,
and Evan was more of a friend of Allison’s brother than Allison’s boyfriend. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That, however, didn’t mean that he and Allison weren’t above
a roll in the bed, especially when Allison’s parents weren’t around. Allison’s
brother didn't really give a damn about whom Allison was seeing – he was funny
that way. Not that Allison minded that. Her brother was strong enough, and mean
enough, to rearrange her facial features – literally. His type of work did
grant him that sort of physical power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Forget it!” Allison spoke instead. “I'm flying to
Massachusetts this summer, and nothing’s going to stop me! We're through!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Aw, come on, Allison. Even a joy dynamo like you needs some
genuine feelings and stability in your life!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Allison almost snarled. “Only my brother can call me a dynamo,
Evan,” she said. “You are not him. Therefore, adieu! We’ll speak more after
this summer ends.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Jane.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane was moving books from her locker into her backpack,
when Daria walked up to her. “I think we should talk.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ok. We are now talking,” Jane declared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“About the Tom thing.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That I don't want to talk about.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“If you're still upset about it, we should deal with it now.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Especially since we won't be seeing each other all summer.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You don't get it, do you? I don't want to talk about it, I
don't want to think about it. I told you: I'm not mad at you about Tom, now let
it freaking go, ok?” <i>Please do so Daria. I'm</i> really <i>not want to talk
about this “Tom” issue. Please?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Can I at least take you out for a good luck-pizza before
you leap in your big art-adventure?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Tempting, but no.</i> “Daria, I said: Let it go.” Jane
walked off, and Daria didn’t try to follow her this time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Allison.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey, Allison, what are you thinking?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Brother dear, I’m about to go on the Michigan-North
Carolina air flight, and you're finally starting to ask me questions?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“’Tis customary. Mom and grandma are busy, and I was told by
my betters,” Alan Markowitz snorted at that word, indicating his true opinion
of these betters, “that I should indulge more in the enlightening art of
conversation-making.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Cut this out! This is no 19<sup>th</sup> century England or
whatever it is that you’re imitating!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sorry. Seriously though, I've talked with Evan.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I can imagine how <i>that</i> went.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You cut <i>this</i> out! I'm no evil overlord, who kills
all those who displease him.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No, you’re just evil, period.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, what you have, you have,” Alan shrugged. “Seriously
though, Evan’s right. Even a sex dynamo like you must have-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You cut it out! I'm a big girl, I can take care of myself!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Like the time you took care of Brian’s Cardinals?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Allison exhaled. “That was low.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So sorry. Anyways, do try to find someone at your art
colony or whatever you’re going, please?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“If you’re going to start to spew about what the tarot cards
said about my future.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Good. I see I made it stick in your mind.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Allison glared. “<i><u>Good-bye</u></i>, dear brother. See
you this fall.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Have a nice trip.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Bastard.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Jane.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane stood at the front gate of the art colony. A blanket
tied to a gate said: “Ashfield - a community for the arts”. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane looked around. <i>It doesn’t get more primal and
despair-y than this,</i> she thought. <i>Daria would’ve liked it here – if she
was into arts.</i> Then she shook her head, took her suitcase, and so her
mother’s friend Margaret walking over to her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You're Jane?” Marge asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah. Don't you remember me?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, it was so long,” Marge shook her head. “I mean, I
married Frank later, and in the wedding and all…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane groaned. Marge Simmins – or whatever her last name was
now, she got married, after all – was as big as a flake as her parents were.
And it was under <i>her</i> management that this art colony was supposed to
prosper and flourish? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane took a double-take of the surrounding her North Carolinian
country-side. After a six-hour drive, her powers of observation were blunted,
and everything required a double-take – until, at least, Jane took a good
night’s sleep. A ride from Massachusetts to NC took a lot out of a person. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The surrounding view took some of the scanty wind out of
Jane’s sails. Lot of countryside was covered in secondary growth, and a lot of
things were actually somewhat run down. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At that point in time, Jane got aware that Marge was telling
her something. Undergoing a monumental effort, she tuned in. “I got a postcard
from your mother. Boy, do I envy her in Death Valley.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Can you believe there are some people who wouldn't want to
go there in July?” Jane rasped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I know. Here we are.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Marge opened the door. Inside, four girls are sitting on
chairs, ladders and the ground. “I'm not saying fauvism didn't have its place,
but now it looks just like so many black velvet junk at the swap meet,” one of
them said. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That's not fair. You can't evaluate the work outside the context
of its time,” another girl argued.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You can if it's good,” the first girl pressed on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Marge cleared her throat. “Everyone, I'd like you to meet
your new housemate Jane. Jane, Caroline, Jett, Anaïs and Paris.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There were assorted hey's by Jane and other four girls.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Enjoy. I'll see you later,” Marge said and left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Thanks,” said Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nice haircut,” two of the girls said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Thanks, I...”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Colour is not something you just fling around like a dog
marking its territory,” the first girl interrupted the newcomer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane sighed. Apparently, not all here was bliss.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Allison.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hoo-boy!” Allison exclaimed, looking around. “Sweet land of
liberty, this isn’t. More like Australian outback, I'll wager.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Allison was standing in the colony’s parking lot, taking-in
her surroundings. There was some activity going-on around her, not an anthill
bustle, but something approaching a bumblebee’s nest. Nobody had time for
Allison, apparently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Let’s see,” Allison muttered to herself. “What does my
brother dearest do when he’s ignored? He takes his own place where he likes. At
worst, it’ll cause a halt in the flow of things and bring him to his correct
spot in life. Dammit! Now <i>I </i>am speaking in flowery language! I really
need a good lay. Stat.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Excuse me? Why are you talking to yourself?” a young boy –
a couple of years younger than Allison stopped and looked at her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There’s a cardinal behind you,” Allison said flatly. “Hey
kid, do you know to which dorm I should go?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ah, you should ask Marge. She runs things around here.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And where is she?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don’ t know,” the boy shrugged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Then help me find her!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The boy gulped. “Um, okay.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Allison and her guide found the Marge woman near some other
dorm, from which came four or five bright and clear-sounding teenage girl
voices, arguing about fauvism or similar topic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Alan?” Marge turned to Allison’s guide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No, I’m Eric.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, well, Eric, what do you want?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There’s a newcomer here,” Eric started to explain; Allison
didn't heed him, she was listening-in to voices, those clear and bright teenage
girl voices, and inside of her fortified a feeling, that perhaps it was time to
go back to Sapphonics, now that her brother was no longer around to look
disapproving and to hold her on a short leash.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“…and her name is Allison,” Alan-Eric was saying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, thank you, Carl,” Marge said, looking oblivious. “Eh,
why is she smiling?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, I'm just thinking about fauvism,” Allison quickly said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You too? Oh dear. Ever since Vincent had published this article
about Henri Matisse and the man’s use of fauvist techniques, everybody is
simply talking about it, is fauvism worth reviving or not? Mayhaps I should
organize a debate club or something.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Carl here could help,” Allison offered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah… hey! My name’s Eric, not Carl!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, of course. Well, let me show you to your dorm, Edna.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh dear,” Allison groaned. The owner of the colony
obviously had a problem with names.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just perfect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Jane</b>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once Marge left, Jane looked around, and found the other
four girls looking back at her. “Yes?” spoke one of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was then that Jane realized that the atmosphere inside
her dorm wasn’t all-that-friendly. Fauvism was just a fraction of it. And
what’s worse, she knew about what article Marge and others were talking about.
But this was neither here nor there. “So where do I put my bags?” she asked
instead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Over there, near to Caroline,” the girl said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And Caroline <i>is</i>-?” Jane pressed-on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That would be me,” said the girl with a slight German appearance.
“Next to me is Jett, and those two bozos” – the two slightly older girls – “are
Anaïs and Paris.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s their <i>real</i> names?” Jane said incredulously.
The one named Paris almost snickered – a nasty type of snicker, that is. The
one named Anaïs however scowled. “Look who’s talking – Miss Jane <i>Doe</i>
Lane.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, better Jane Doe than a name obviously visualized in
the clouds of opium!” Jane bristled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You take that back you little b**ch!” Anaïs yelled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Actually, she’s right,” the girl named Jett spoke to Anaïs.
“Only somebody as drugged out of your mind as you would agree with Paris that
fauvism’s cool. Fauvism actually sucks!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anaïs looked over to Jett. “No, my dear Jett,” she said in a
catty tone. “Fauvism doesn’t suck. You, however, most certainly do – right
under the swallowing part of your Mexican license!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jett’s eyes bulged, and Paris didn't choose any better time
to say something in Spanish language. The next moment all dissolved into chaos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Allison.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ms. Simmins?” Allison slowly told the older woman. “My
name’s Allison, and I've chartered a cabin here, not a bunk in a dorm,
remember?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Marge looked shortly blank, then nodded. “Oh yes, Allison
March, right?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Markowitz, ma’am.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes-yes, something like that,” Marge said briefly. “You're
cabin is near the Silver Lake. Number 27.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Great,” nodded Allison. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At this moment in time noises started to come from the dorm
next to them. “What’s that?” she asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nothing, just an argument turned bad,” Marge waved her hand
absent-mindedly. “Now Allison, come, you <i>must</i> tell me your views about
fauvism.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Allison inwardly groaned. Just into <i>what</i> she has
gotten herself into to?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Jane</b>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane didn't have a very good night. Her roomies just went on
and on harping about fauvism and various French art tendencies. They didn’t
even bother to learn one another’s names, and Jane didn’t feel pressured to
give them hers, either. She didn't have a good enough sleep, and now she was in
the art colony’s auditorium,
listening to someone who apparently made it. “When I unveiled paper
plate-genocide in 1991, it was enhailed as intrigued, provocative, even
brilliant. And not just by me.” The artist laughed. “No, we all know critics
tend to get carried away, but what was I thinking when I created a work that
seems to have turned of both seminal and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>semiotic?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“’I can't
believe I'm getting away with it’?” Jane muttered. That man was obviously an
idiot. And was the girl next to her looking at her funny? After last night’s
debate turned ugly, Jane was a bit paranoid, and lonely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Allison.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>I can’t
believe he has got away with that!</i> Allison was thinking. <i>Seminal? Semiotic? Is this some sort
of a synonym for ‘idiotic’?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Feeling
bored, Allison looked around. The previous day has taken her toll on her too.
After listening to Marge talk about people often using a different name for
every one of them every time, Allison got stuck in a dorm with a couple of
obviously steadies, and even she knew better than to try and wedge between <i>that</i>
sort of a couple. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unfortunately,
that didn’t solve Allison’s problem: where was she going to get some? Everybody
knew that the best place to get a relationship in the terms of “passionate” and
“fun” would be at an art camp. Especially at one that is run by a director who
can’t remember a name.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unfortunately,
currently Allison was stuck at an auditorium, listening to a very important
jackass in the word of science praise his oats – sorry, art. “Seminal?
Semiotic? What’s he talking about?” Allison muttered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“’I can't
believe I'm getting away with it’?” somebody muttered next to her. Allison
looked and felt something.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The world
stopped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Allison
smiled and fell in love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Jane.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Excuse me,
mister Dotson?” spoke one of Jane’s roomies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The artist
almost smiled. “Please, Paris isn't it? Call me Daniel.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Daniel, I
just want to say I think you're the greatest living artist of our time.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And not
just because I have no taste,” Jane muttered. Obviously, this girl didn't know
much about Gauguin or van Gogh, no matter what she claimed to know of them last
night. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I was
wondering, where do you get your inspiration?” spoke another student, this one
a boy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“My alimony
bills,” a girl whispered to Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane turned
around. The speaker was a couple of years older than her, resembling vaguely
Trent. Maybe it was the tattoos or something like that. And meanwhile the
artist Daniel droned-on. “I don't sit around and wait for inspiration. I grab
it, in the glint of the sun on a frozen peak, in the pain of an arthritic's hobble,
in a lover's whisper in the dark.” For some reason, he looked at Paris when he
said the last line. “So, I'd have to say my inspiration comes from life
itself.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Woa...”
the audience was obviously impressed, and Daniel decided to make it a wrap.
“Well, that's enough for the old windbag's rambling from today. We'll pick up
here tomorrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He walked
off amidst an applause.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane
sighed, and turned back to her new neighbour, to promote their acquaintance. It
was still better than Daniel’s crap. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Allison.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It wouldn’t
be totally honest to say that Allison’s heart had skipped a beat for a moment,
but some internal awkwardness was obviously there. However, Allison was used
over getting awkward situations, and so she managed to say nonchalantly. “Hi,
I'm Allison.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Jane,” the
other girl shook Allison’s hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Our mister
Dotson is really something isn't he?” Allison continued to press her advantage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, he
certainly doesn't let substance get in the way of </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>self-congratulatory
yap,” Jane admitted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“At least
we'll not have to worry about him intimidating us with his talent,” Allison
said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was a pause. “So where are you from?” Jane said. “Not
a local, are you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, I currently leave- I mean, live in Michigan, but I
was born in Canadian prairies.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Lucky you. I lived in a small town in Massachusetts all my
life, and wouldn’t be here, if mom didn't know Marge here.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Marge? The same Marge who called me Edna, Lisa, and a
couple of other names? You sure she didn't get your mom mixed-up with someone
else?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane shrugged. “Far it’ll be for me to look a gift horse in
its’ mouth. I wanted to get away from home this summer, and since I didn't want
to experience Death Canyon with mom and Summer (that’s my oldest sister), my
mother arranged me here via her connections with Marge. You?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I've heard about this place from a couple of my brother’s
friends. They said that it was very good for them and their muse or something?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Their muse? One for two? They share it or something?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Allison shrugged. “Bugger me if I can visualize <i>that</i>
construction, but Sunrise and Dove are like inseparable and everything, so one
muse may be enough for them.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sunrise and Dove? They're what, neo-hippies?” Jane asked,
remembering some tales of Daria’s about her parents’ friends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Conspiracy nuts. They believe that world is coming to an
end, and so all those who use their names in vain get dragged into Hell. Names
have powers, they say.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And do they really look the part?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Allison shrugged. “Dove’s thick enough for five of me, Sunrise
is on depressants or something – you tell me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane almost laughed. “You're funny. Come on, let’s get out
of this cephalid coliseum, and have a bit to eat in my dorm.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sure.” <i>What</i>?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Jane.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Jane and her new friend Allison entered the dorm
(Jane’s roomies were fortuitously absent,) Jane went over to her baggage, and
pulled-out a large-ish bag of provisions that she’d secured beforehand. Living
with Trent made Jane highly conscious of food, and so she didn't go into a
summer-long trip in another state food-less.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Jane turned around, Allison’s face bore the funniest expression
Jane ever saw, if funny meant weird. However that look vanished, and was
replaced with a look of honest purplexion so quickly, so Jane wondered if she
hadn't imagined the whole thing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What’s this?” Allison asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Food. Dig in?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why not go to the colony’s cafeteria or whatever it is
called?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nah. I don't think I want to be involved in another
discussion about fauvism for a while.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But Jane, what about your integrity with the whole? What
about your complexity as a human? What about your feeling of social
belongingness?” <i>I've got to get us into public before I shake her cute
little butt – right after I propose to her, heart and soul.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane blinked. “You know such long words? Wow. I thought you
were like my brother, barely two words between naps. Turns out, you’re like
Daria.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Who’s Daria?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane paused. The whole situation seemed somehow odd and yet
somehow right. Maybe going public was a good idea after all. It would certainly
help her evade the whole messy topic of Daria and Tom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>‘Allison, you sweet-talker, you,” Jane said. “Let’s go
outside and eat.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Allison.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the art
colony’s cafeteria, the members of the camp were eating. On one of the tables
are Anaïs, Paris and another guy, that looked vaguely familiar to Jane and
Allison. Jane and Allison, upon entering, noticed them and went towards,
talking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I can't
believe I let you talk me into this,” Jane said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You can't
eat in your room forever. Why go to an artist's colony if you're not going to
mingle with your fellow artists?” Allison argued.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That's
like saying why go to an penal colony if you're not going to mingle with your
fellow...” Jane began and quickly dropped-off, realizing where she was heading.
“I think I'll stop there.” <i>Still, it’s true enough,</i> Jane thought. <i>Aside
from Allison, everybody here sucks as much as they did back in Lawndale. Still,
I shouldn’t try to embarrass Allison. She’s good company, and it’s highly
unlikely I'll find anyone better here, unless Daria has a creative side of
which I’m unaware.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Come on, I
know they'll warm up to you if you give them a chance,” Allison said, not
believing this one bit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Are we by
any chance conversing across parallel dimensions?” Jane said wryly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I'll bet
you dinner I'm right,” Allison said, mentally saying bye-bye to her food.
Still, all’s fair in love and war…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You're on,
sucker,” Jane smiled. This was going to be the easiest meal won yet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They walked
to a table.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mind if we
join you?” Allison said</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not at
all,” spoke one of the present, whose name was Anaïs, and who was one of Jane’s
roomies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How's
everyone liking the colony so far?” Allison went on making the conversation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I love it,
it's so.. freeing,” Anaïs said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And
Daniel, that man is brilliant,” spoke the guy. Allison and Jane recognized him.
One of Daniel’s male groupies, he was, it seemed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He said my
white on white painting was a stroke of inspiration,” spoke the other girl.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I'll bet
you two have explored all sorts of strokes together,” the guy said. The girl
blushed, while Anaïs laughed. “Oh, well. I suppose genius does have its
prerogatives,” the guy continued, but Jane interrupted him with:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well I
don't know if Daniel's a genius.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No
offence, Jane, but aren't you still in high school? How much can you know about
art at this point?” spoke the blushing girl.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Excuse
me?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Allison was
familiar with Jane only for a short time, but even she by now saw that the
girl, whose name, Allison vaguely, remembered, was Paris, made a <i>faux-pas</i>,
to say lightly. “Paris. We all had to submit a portfolio to be accepted here.
I'd say </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane knows
quite a bit about art,” Allison said, playing white knight, or at least an
art-smart version of Xena.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paris
didn't look convinced one bit, but even she knew better than to pick-up an
argument with Allison. “I'm sure you're right. I apologize. You guys ready to
go?” she turned to her friends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Bye.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“See you
later.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paris and
her friends left. Jane turned towards Allison with visible irritation in her
eyes. “Gee, that was fun, but in the future let's save time and just roll
around on gravel,” she told the older girl.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sorry
about that. I guess I owe you one,” Allison shrugged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane
paused. Somehow, Allison didn't seem to be too upset about losing, or maybe it
was just her. “You owe me dinner,” she reminded her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I know.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Jane.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Something
odd is going-on here,</i>
Jane said silently to herself. “Is it just me, or is Allison’s attitude can
best be described as ‘courting’? And am I talking to myself outloud again?
Great.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Actually, things
were far more mediocre, as far as Jane could see. The art colony such only a
little less than the Lanes’ family reunion (which stank more than a pile of
sea-gull droppings), but no less than Lawndale High. In fact, as time went,
Jane slowly began to think that she didn't have it all bad at the old LH. Li
and her staff may be incompetents when put before Daria, or Upchuck, or Jodie,
or a number of other smart students, but at least they tried to keep their
school in order. Here, Jane and Allison have left the colony’s grounds a couple
of hours ago, and no one tried to stop them, or, for that matter, saw them off.
“Then again, why should I be worried? It’s broad daylight, no maniac or monster
will appear at this hour here,” Jane spoke to herself, waiting for Allison to
appear. “Still, if I was into doing art this summer, I would’ve done more
productive at home. Trent, at least, isn't full of it, as others here.
Although, Allison isn't full of it either.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Come to
think of it, Jane, I’m here. Let’s go.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Go where?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Inside! Into the ““Hungry
Palette”!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Inside “Hungry Palette” all was
pretty-much artwork-oriented. Jane, whose dictionary was rather influenced by
Trent and the Mystik Spiral, decided to classify it as ‘a viprarium, but a
clean one.’ The food was as of a regular diner – soup, sandwiches… Allison took
Jane over to a prepared table, where a bottle of wine was waiting for them a-la
appetizer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Want some?” Allison spoke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Jane paused, then shrugged. “What
the Hell. A single glass wouldn’t hurt.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>And a single glass didn't hurt
indeed! However, it was quickly followed by its’ fellow glasses, and before
long both girls (neither of whom had too good a head for alcohol), were
spilling their guts to each other. “God, I envy you, Jane,” Allison said. “To
have all that talent and focus at your age.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Oh, come on,” Jane said somewhat
drunkenly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“I wish I could be in high school
again, knowing what I know now,” Allison continued to wax poetic. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“A little perspective and you could
sidestep all the torture, huh?” Jane said, a bit testily. She never liked
short-cuts, and after her experience with Evan and the buys’ (and other guys)
of the racing team in school, she liked them even less. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“No,” Allison admitted, but Jane
interrupted her, caught in her own drunken revelation:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Hell, I'd trade places with you in
a minute. You're doing exactly what I want to: Making it on your own as an
artist.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Trying to anyway,” Allison
admitted. Her career was far from solar, even with the fear of her brother’s
wrath pushing her, preventing her from procrastination, and giving her an extra
edge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Hey, you'll do it,” Jane said
firmly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“So will you,” Allison replied,
taking the wine. “A little more?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“You and your future, me and my
so-called carrier. I guess we each have something the other would love to
have,” Allison said, as she filled Jane’s and her drinking glasses. “Here – to
us!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“To us!” Jane echoed. “To us!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><b>Allison.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At that moment in time, soup was brought over. “Not much,”
Jane noticed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey, we’re the hungry artists! We're not supposed to be
choosy!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Some of us aren't so hungry and desperate to chose soup,”
Jane said mock-haughtily. “Some of us like <u>pizza</u>.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Allison’s eyes just skimmed over Jane’s body, and the
younger girl felt once again <i>very</i> peculiar: flustered and hot? <i>Must
be all this alcohol. Or my period went haywire. Or something.</i> “You looking
at my slim and shapely body, hah?” <i>God, that went wrong. Lay off the wine,
Lane.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Aha.” <i>Did she guess my game?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, me and Daria actually like to have pizza every other
day...” <i>Damn.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Who’s Daria?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane paused. Well, now or never. “A friend.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Just a friend?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not just a friend. A real friend. My first true friend, so
to speak. Or at least in the past.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why not now? Left you for a guy?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That doesn't begin to cover it, Alli,” Jane sighed, and
almost sobbing from an alcohol overdose, began to lay her heart out to an
absolute stranger. (Keep in mind that this was her first contact with really
serious alcohol.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By the time she was finished, Allison looked as if she’d been
shocked by a club. “Well, this is very sad Jane, but maybe this Tom fellow
wasn't right for you in the first place?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He wasn’t,” Jane sighed. “It's just that… I didn’t have any
good luck with guys.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But your figure! It’s a knockout!” <i>Oops</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane, however, was gone down too far Memory Lane to notice
Allison’s little slip of the tongue. “Yeah, well, you don't know high school.
If you’re not into sports or into popularity, you’re nothing. And if you got <i>ideas</i>
- you’re a brain. Nobody likes smart chicks. Everybody likes Brittany the
blow-up doll. Life sucks.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don't worry Jane, I’m sure that the right person is waiting
for you,” Allison said in a heartfelt tone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Thanks.” And Jane pitched forwards face first into her dish
of mashed potatoes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Jane.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The dream world released her, Jane Lane, from its’ tenacious
clutches most reluctantly. Jane’s head got filled with chimeras, gargoyles,
sphinxes and griffins – and all amidst a palm rosette design. Lack of sleep
from last night and alcohol overdose from this afternoon did the work of no
less than three soporific pills dissolved in tea. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But all things end, even Jane’s dream. Jane opened her eyes,
and saw that she was back in a dorm, on a bunk bed. Allison was nearby, working
on something with pastels. “Where- where am I?” Jane said, or rather – croaked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“In my cabin,” Allison said. “I didn't think we should go to
yours.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Good idea,” Jane said. Her feud with Paris was in such a
state that if Allison brought Jane over to her cabin, Jane may’ve ended up as
Noah did after the flood – lying naked to the general amusement of the nearby.
Speaking of naked… “You <i>could’ve</i> undressed me, I suppose,” Jane said.
“We're all girls here.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Isn't that the fact.</i> “Sorry Jane, but I wasn’t
thinking too straight herself. And then I saw my pastels, and an idea hit.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Really?” Jane asked, intrigued. “Can I see?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sure!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“These
pastels are great,” Jane said in a while. The sketch actually deposed her as
the fairy tale’s Sleeping Beauty, complete with the medieval get-up and a
crystal coffin in which to lie. “But why’d you chose me?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I told
you, an idea hit.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh yeah.
Well, uh, where am I?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“At my
cabin. Well, it isn't really mine, there’s a couple of others living here,
but-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Weren't we
missed? No, wait, this came out wrong. I mean, did we miss anything?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“In this
chaos carnival? Jane, this place is semi-absurd. You do whatever you want, as
long as it isn't public copulation.” <i>Oops.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well,
chalk one above my high school,” Jane sighed. “Oh well, let’s not be sad.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“As long as
your idea of happiness doesn't end with a bottle, I’m game. Eh, speaking of
bottles, courtesy of “Happy Palette”-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Keep it,”
Jane hastily said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Allison.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was some
time later. Jane and Allison are sitting on the ground going through a
sketchbook of Allison’s. Jane had really liked most of Allison’s sketches, and
was mentally noting to try some of them for herself. Allison, however, was not
too enthusiastic. “Thanks, I wish the gallery-owners felt the same way.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“They're
nuts,” Jane said sincerely. Allison was really onto something here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I knew
you'd get what I'm trying to do. Top that off?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No,” Jane
said with regret, as she closed the book and handed it to Allison. “I'd better
call it a night. I get cranky if I don't get my usual twelve hours.” <i>Of
course, I just slept for three or four, but something is wrong here and it
drives me nuts. Unless I figure out what, I can’t stay.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Allison
paused. <i>Now’s the time. Heads or tails, sink or swim. I got to come out.
Well, technically I did come out, but this is different, oh great. I’m
rumbling.</i> “Come on, It's still early. I'm sure we can find something to do
to amuse ourselves.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane didn't
stop walking for the door. “Well, that's where the whole sleeping part factors
in.” She did a rather fake yawn. “I'll see you tomorrow. I'm exhausted.” <i>Right
after I slept for several hours in your bed. Your nuts, Lane. You're worthy to
keep Paris and Anaïs company.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Allison
grabbed Jane’s arm in fear. “I can't let you walk home in your condition. I'll
have to insist that you lie down.” <i>Smooth, Markowitz, real smooth. Miss Evan
much?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No,
really, I'm fine.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I promise
not to kick you out of bed in the morning. Well, unless you're snoring,”
Allison plunged in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a
second, Jane remained oblivious. “Thanks, but I..” And then realization hit,
just what was wrong here. It was everything and nothing, a Ms. Barch dream. “O,
God.” She slowly backed off. <i>Allison’s gay and</i> been <i>courting</i> <i>me
the whole day. O God. I’m</i> straight, <i>damn it! Hadn't I suffered enough
with Tom, God? Hey, is anybody up there? A damsel in distress down here yelling
for help!</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What's the
matter? I'm not your type?” Allison said with a sinking feeling in her stomach.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Uhm,
Allison? I'm straight,” Jane said, her tongue feeling thick and wooden in her
mouth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah,
right. I don't think so.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I'm not
gay,” Jane insisted fervently. She couldn’t be! No Lane on her side of the
family was, although there were plenty of doubts about Wind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Allison
laughed a laughter of a person who sees his possessions going up in smoke.
“Where have I heard that before? Wait a minute, is this your first time with a
girl? Well, no wonder you're nervous.” She took a step forward. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane,
naturally, took one back. “Allison, read my lips: I like guys.” <i>I</i> do! <i>God,
do you hear me? I'm straight! This isn’t funny! I’m straight! God, do you hear
me? I’m straight!</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“AND
hanging out with bisexuals in their bedrooms after they buy you dinner.” <i>God,
what am I saying? I brought her here! God, what am I saying?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey, I
didn't know you were bi, and the dinner thing was settling a bet.” Jane
replied, sounding shallow in her own ears.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sure,
settling a bet. I'm sorry baby, but I never hit on straight </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>chicks.” <i>Until
now. Maybe you</i> are <i>gay.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Listen,
you've been really nice to my and all, and I really appreciate it, but I'm not
interested in women.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You mean
you're not ready to admit it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane’s
nerve broke. “I got to go.” Jane walked out with as much dignity as she could
muster, feeling Allison’s eyes bore into her back. As soon as she was out of
sight, Jane broke into a run, and got to her cabin in record time, all the time
her thoughts going-on via turmoil in her head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Jane.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey, baby
Lane, where we’ve you been? You’ve been missed so much by Ms. Margaret the
mental pachyderm,” Paris sneered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane didn't
say anything. She just looked into Paris’ eyes and went straight to her bed.
Paris, however, looked as if she was handed a live electric eel. “What’s
wrong?” Anaïs asked her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nothing!
Baby had a tantrum,” Paris snapped, and turned away from Jane. She still hadn't
forgiven the younger woman for last night. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane
sighed. Even her fledgling feud with Paris was <i>way</i> secondary considering
her newest misadventure. <i>I pray to God to heal my heart’s wounds from losing
Tom, and what do I get? Allison. Who's a great artist, and a good friend, and…
has a crush on me. A genuine crush. Why couldn’t she have a penis on top of all
those merits? Then… I would be all over her, or him, or whatever… God, what’s
wrong with me! If she had a penis, I’d get pregnant. Here, I can have all
without a pregnancy, and here I'm bitching about it!.. But I’m not gay! I think
so, and Allison was probably just trying to get into my pants... Yeah, right.
Given the morals and manners in this place, anything short of public copulation
will pass unnoticed. And… and I was unconscious for a while, and there I am –
with my maidenly honour intact. No, I’ve got to set my record straight –
tomorrow.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Allison.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the door slammed behind Jane, Allison slowly got up and
went to her bed. Well, “went” was an exaggeration maybe; it would be more
truthful to say that Allison Markowitz staggered over to her bed and the fell
down into it, completely drained of energy and feelings: Jane Lane was gone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Damn me! I</i> am <i>a sexual dynamo! I can’t wait to get
intimate with whoever I want! And I really liked Jane!.. And I was</i> sure <i>that
she returned my feelings! Or maybe she’s just confused? Anyways, how am I going
to straighten that mess? Maybe… maybe, maybe I should forget all about it and
stuff. Yes, maybe I should just forget…</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Jane.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>It was several days later, and Jane
once again was in the art colony’s hall. 
A few other people were painting – Allison wasn’t among them.
Apparently, Allison was just as avoiding Jane as it was vice versa. <i>Maybe it
was just the wine talking for the both of us,</i> Jane thought, as she glanced
over to Paris, Anaïs and Daniel. Daniel was completely ignoring Paris, and
instead went straight for Anaïs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Excellent! The brushwork is very
confident and I like the strained, almost antagonistic relationship of the
colour. Really, you remind me of myself when I was young.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Oh, Daniel. You're not that old?”
Anaïs chirped. Next to her, Paris quietly seethed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Well, I'm certainly young at
heart.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Not to mention delusional of mind,”
Jane muttered. You certainly couldn't see <i>that</i> blatant display of sexual
courting back in the old LH. Gods, she was missing her school? What was <i>wrong</i>
with her? Jane shook her head and walked away from her now-completed work. It
was a cubic painting of a woman trapped inside a safe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><b>Allison.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Ouch!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Hey?!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Allison?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Jane? Haven't seen you around.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Oh, you know, the solitary artist,”
Jane tried to joke, but realized she couldn’t do it. “Look, I got to be honest.
That whole thing that happened between.. I mean, didn't happen. Well, it kind
of confused me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Me too. Maybe I was hoping a little
too hard and saw something that isn't there.” <i>Oh God. And Daniel is soon
going to be here, and she’ll see us – God why are you doing this to me?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“But you said you never make a
mistake in that.. uhm.. area?” Jane said, feeling oddly disappointed. <i>You're
not gay Lane, stop it!</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“There's a first time for
everything.” <i>Oh yeah.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Allison held-out her hand. “Still
want to be friends?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Allison paused. “Maybe we'll skip
the hug.” And then she and Jane saw Daniel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Uh-oh, don't look now, but it's
Toulouse le Dreck,” the younger girl muttered, as Daniel walked up to Allison.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Ready?” he asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“I'll wait for you in the car,”
Allison replied, instinctively slipping into her average mode – and her brother
wasn’t there to shake her out of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“You're seeing HIM?!” Jane yelled,
feeling strangely offended.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“He's not so bad once you get to
know him,” Allison replied, her excuse shallow in her own ears.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“You said he went through more
students than tubes of paint. You can't possibly think he gives a damn about
you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><i>No, I can’t and I don’t, Jane. But
since you're not there, I got to ease my pain.</i> “Who's looking for romance? I just
want to have a little fun.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“And if it's with someone who can
introduce you to a few gallery owners, that's not so bad either, hey? I think
I'm beginning to see how the art world works.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><i>Okay, I'm not going to let</i> this <i>slide, light of my life or
not.</i> “God, high school. It's all such a big deal with you guys. You take </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>everything so seriously.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Like someone telling you that you
give up gay vibes lust because they're trying to get into your pants?” Jane
indignantly yelled. “You know something, Allison? You can just f*ck off!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Allison’s face turned pale. “For a virgin, you got quite a
store off know, Jane. Or are you-? Have you been and Tom doing it after all?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now it was Jane’s turn to pale. Wordlessly, she slapped the
older girl. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Allison slowly, incredulously even, touched the red spot.
Then she turned around and ran-off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Jane.</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane wordlessly entered her dorm and fell on the bunk. Her
brain hurt. She wanted to be alone. Behind her, the door slammed. Paris and
Anaïs were back, and they weren’t too happy themselves, or at least, Anaïs
wasn’t. Apparently, Allison’s flirtations with Daniel didn't sit well in Jane’s
craw alone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Aw, look at the reject!” she exclaimed, ignoring Paris’
warning look. “What’s the matter? Your lover ditch-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane got up, took-off one of her boots and swung. Anaïs went
down with a THUMP!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ouch!” Paris exclaimed, sitting on her bunk bed, her hands
in the air. “Want to talk about it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes. No. Not to you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why not?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane shrugged. “Because. Why the sudden interest?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paris paused. “’Cause I know her?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You do? From where?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“From Toledo. That’s a city in Ohio. I was seeing the local
historical sites and I ran-in into her and her family.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh? What are they like?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You wouldn't believe me. Allison’s brother looks like one
of those medieval pirates complete with a scarred face, her grandmother used to
prostitute on street corners or so I presume, and her mother’s gay. Completely
gay. And so, the only normal person there was her brother – or half-brother,
whatever. Apparently, Allison is a sexual dynamo and can go through bed-mates
like a razor through wet tissue.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Thanks for the imagery,” Jane sighed. “But it’s not about
Allison alone; I’m there too. I mean… I need to think this out.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Need an audience?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nah, thanks. Not yet. Besides, I think you should do something
about Anaïs.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Me? You hit her! Marge may not be the sharpest shovel in
the barrel, but even she’ll realize that something’s fishy if Anaïs lying-around
like this.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“All right, what do you suggest we do, oh great guru? And by
the way? The guy who made that article about Matisse and fauvism? That’s <i>my</i>
dad.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Allison.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Great,” Allison muttered, falling onto her bed. “I <i>was</i>
looking for empty sex, but <i>that</i> empty? What does Daniel has to occupy
the space between his ears  and to
prevent it turning into a hot-air balloon? Saw-dust?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I'll take it the date didn't went well?” a sarcastic voice
spoke from the corner. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Allison turned around. “Who are you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“A friend of your brother’s.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, you must be Ann,” Allison thoughtfully said. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah, but just call me Paris.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why are you here?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s about Jane.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What about her?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“She decked one of our roommates with a boot across the
mouth,” Paris explained, “just for a hint connecting you, her, and Daniel
Dotson.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And you care about this because-?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don't want to move, period. I know Anaïs, you’d need an
iron spike to take her down for good – and I’m guessing that Jane will use
anything but that to take her down. I do not need to live in a dorm-sized
war-zone!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, you can always move.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Where to? Here? Why won't you let Jane in instead?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You know, you <i>are</i> one of my brother’s friends.
What’s your “codename”? Elaphe?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s irrelevant,” Ann-Paris-Elaphe shook her head.
“Seriously though, what is it between the two of you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don’t know!” Allison wailed. “I thought I loved her and
all, but-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Excuse me?” Jane exclaimed, bursting-in. When Paris left to
supposedly talk to Allison, Jane couldn’t help but follow – her curiosity was
too piqued and all. And when she heard Allison’s <u>ridiculous</u>
claim that she, Allison, loved her, Jane – she couldn't keep quiet no longer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The result was quite interesting: Allison looked like a lightning-struck
tree, Paris just looked placidly at her, rubbing her new rufous-and-tan tattoo
design. “My work here is done,” she placidly said. “Cheerio.” She quickly left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Now I really know that she’s one of my brother’s friends,”
Allison muttered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What’s that supposed to mean?” Jane asked. “Nevermind,” she
hastily interrupted herself. “Allison, what do you mean, you love me?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Jane, have you ever seen somebody who have struck you like
a thunderbolt? You don't know that they know you, and they seem totally
clueless, but-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane’s eyes grew round. “No, no, and no! I mean, yes, I've
seen such things happening, and by now I meant karma.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What about it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nevermind. Just a bit of a family situation that you’ve reminded
me off. Look, Allison I'm not saying that I’m gay, but I’m not saying anything
to counter it either; I’m just saying that maybe…” she paused, thinking, “that
we, uh, won't have to have sex soon? Not that I don't want to, and not that
you’re not attractive, but…” Jane paused. “Why am I lying on your lap?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I'm not complaining,” Allison quickly said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I surmised that,” Jane said, blinking. “I mean- look, I'm
just a kid in some things. Anaïs would probably have something demeaning to
say, but-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Want to move-in with me? Nobody will be complaining.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nah, I can handle Anaïs, Caroline and Jett aren’t against
me, and Paris is seemingly warming-up to me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I should warn you about her,” Allison said. “She’s one of
my brother’s friends, it seems.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh? What about him?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s a long story – are you comfy?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane jerked-up, remembering again her precarious position.
“Karma,” she muttered dejectedly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What about it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Allison, just ignore this comment and tell me about your
brother.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Your wish is my command.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Jane.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was
several days later. Jane was sitting on her bed, which by now looked a lot like
Trent's room, only the records were replaced by drawings. She was spending a
lot of time here, due to the fact that she still wasn't the most sociable
person on campus, despite the assistance of Allison – and Paris.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey.
Call,” yelled Caroline – or Jett. Jane rose an eyebrow and picked-up the phone.
“Hello?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hope you
don't mind that I called,” Daria’s flat voice came from the other end.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Daria!”
Jane exclaimed, with just a hint of a smile tugging at her lips.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How are
things going?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Fine!
Fine, fine, couldn't be better,” Jane quickly said, trying not to give too much
away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sucks,
huh?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Only in a
mind-numbingly pretentious kind of way.” <i>Daria, you may be a genius, but you’re
also a rather old-fashioned type of a girl, yes you are.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Do you
think, uhm, a familiar face might cheer you up?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What do
you mean? Like floating in space over the bed saying my name repeatedly in a
creepy voice?” Jane couldn’t help but make a joke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Jane..”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Look, I
don't really feel like any visitors right now, it's nothing </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>personal.” <i>Other
than my budding sex life, it seems.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Wait..”
Daria now sensed that things were somewhat off in the great tune of Jane’s
life. Well, not great, but at least not mediocre anymore.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don't
want to talk about it, ok? Nothing you could say can change that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was a
pause for a second, then – “I'll pay you,” Daria’s reply came through. That
caused a chuckle, if nothing else.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Trent was
going to stop by on his way to a gig. Maybe you could hitch a ride. They can
always use an extra person to push,” Jane admitted. Apparently, summer in the
Morgendorffers’ home wasn't going smoothly, either. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Thanks.
See you soon.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Guess what I got to say is – ditto.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Allison.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Back in Michigan, the phone rang. “Who is it?” Alan Markowitz’
level voice sounded on the other end.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey brother, Elaphe says high.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Allison, listen. What did you do now?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Fallen in love?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Who’s the lucky guy.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Alan! It’s not a guy!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh. Want to talk to mom then? She’ll probably have lots of
advice.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not now! Later. Besides, you’re the man of the house, at
least technically.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“In short, what’s the problem now?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Look, I kind of owe Elaphe and all, so can you take her on
a date? She’s been dropping all sorts of hints lately that I owe her – a lot,
and that’s sort of the truth…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s definitely Ann. Or, sorry, Paris. Can you put her
on?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“She doesn’t know about this. At least, she isn’t here.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, in this case I'll be over here shortly, and we’ll all
have a talk. A good one.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Allison looked unhappy. “Well, you’re older, do what you
should do. Bye.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Jane.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>It was several days later, at
visitation day. Jane and Daria were looking at Jane's paintings. To an
uninitiated, they looked hideous. But Daria was initiated, and to her they
looked quite tolerable. Jane herself was another story. “Some day the curators
will look back at these and say they're from my &quot;art colony
suck&quot;-period.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Curators?” Daria re-asked her
friend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Criminologists?” Jane joked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“You know, when it comes to art, you
and Link have a lot in common. I'd introduce you, if he didn't loathe every
fibre of my being,” Daria said sadly. Jane, who was initiated into the
Link-situation nodded wisely. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“This Link situation really bothers
you, huh?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Serves me right for breaking my
cardinal rule of trying to reach out to a lost soul.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Any kid who looks to you for
nurturing is more than just lost.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Gee, thanks,” Daria said, clearly
angry. Jane decided that it was time to back-pedal a bit. But then she wouldn’t
be Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Hey. I call them like I see them,”
she said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Call who?” Daria asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane looked vaguely pained. “Believe me, you don't want to
know.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Allison.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Allison nervously sat on the edge of the colony’s compound.
Why was she feeling nervous? “’Cause my brother’s around,” she muttered. “My
brother and his <i>friend</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Allison now fully knew the situation between her brother and
Paris. Paris wanted him, period. Not that she couldn’t symphasize with her
either – her brother was a good enough catch and, apparently, not averse to
Paris’ attentions either. But for Allison herself, Paris was a bit discerning.
She never liked Paris before, and she now disliked her even more. A slight
noise caught her attention and made her turn to the right. A couple of people
were standing there, talking to each other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Driven for the by curiosity, Allison went in that direction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Jane.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Mystik
Spiral’s gig was inside a place called Club Glamour – something that was
obviously a misnomer. Jane could swear that at least half the customers’ she
and Daria had seen on some crime news – a fact that she almost immediately
shared with Daria. “The guys here are a lot better looking in person than on
their wanted posters.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Now I
understand why people go to the bathroom in groups,” Daria agreed. It lessened
the possibility of getting mugged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don't
worry. I promise not to meet a new boyfriend and leave you alone between sets.
I've learned my lesson,” Jane said dryly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oookayyy..
Speaking of Tom, I guess you've heard we broke up,” Daria said uneasily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don't
read the papers, remember?” Jane said, trying to hide her surprise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I thought
Trent might have said something,” Daria was apparently surprised as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Questions?
Comments?” Daria pressed on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Please
tell me you're not trying to get my sympathy after blowing me off for my NOW
ex-boyfriend,” Jane said, deciding to battle with her friend now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You mean
He blew YOU off for ME, although if you recall, that's not the way it
happened.” Daria was armed and ready.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No! I mean
YOU blew ME off for HIM! You wanted to go out with him, regardless what it did
to our friendship,” Jane yelled, finally getting the truth out into the open.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey! You
stopped talking to me, remember? After you broke up with him AND said you
didn't care if I dated him.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And you
believed me?” Jane said incredulously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I'm
confused. What are we fighting about here?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We're
fighting about YOU, Daria Morgendorffer! Being dumb enough to think a boyfriend
is worth screwing up a really good friendship for,” Jane paused and added, in a
more sensitive tone. “A really important friendship.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“.. I'm
sorry if I did that,” Daria finally said with genuine feelings. “Uhm.. I really
missed you this summer.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, I
really missed you too,” Jane admitted. “Only don't ask me to sleep over.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Huh?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nothing,”
Jane shook her head, unwilling to there. “O hey, Trent? I meant to tell you;
you guys have a gig tonight.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You'll
better start soon, or you'll miss you next break,” Daria added.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Unless you
take your next break now,” Jane continued.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“In which
case you'd better take it on stage. They'll never think for looking for you
there,” Daria went on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And while
you're up there, maybe you could play something? O wait, that's what they're
paying you for, never mind,” Jane finished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trent just
stared and said: “You guys are weird.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So what
did you miss most about me? It was it my &quot;joie de vive&quot;, wasn't it?”
Jane asked, turning back to Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“If you
really want to know, it was you damn aura,” Daria replied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Wow, you
did spend the summer with Mr. O'Neill,” Jane said, not thrilled to hear more
about auras and such things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I mean
your aura of confidence. I drifted through summer in a perpetual identity
crisis questioning everything I said and did.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane
blinked. That sounded not unlike her. “That funny, cause I...”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And I kept
thinking about you up here doing your paintings, making your jokes, being Jane
Lane,” Daria continued, ignoring her friend’s interruptions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Being Jane
Lane is what I do best,” Jane said with much more certainty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Precisely.
You know exactly who you are and nobody's ever going to con you into thinking
you don't. I wish I had you around just as a role model.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You know,
you're absolutely right about me,” Jane almost smiled</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Gee, shall
I attempt further heights of ego-inflation?” Daria asked wryly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Please
do,” Jane replied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Meanwhile,
the Mystik Spiral got on the stage, with Trent in the lead: “Hey, we're Mystic
Spiral. And this one's for Daria and Jane.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I hope
it's not &quot;You Are So Beautiful&quot;,” Daria groaned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“O, please,
make it &quot;Close to You&quot;,” Jane sarcastically muttered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And the
Mystik Spiral started to play:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TRENT:  When the aliens come,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>        when the dead-weights hum,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>        when the bombers bomb,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&amp;JESSE:
we'll still be freakin' friends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>        When the whip comes down,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>        when the they nuke the town,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>        when dead clowns can't clown,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&amp;JESSE:
we'll still be freakin' friends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>         Freakin' friends, freakin' friends,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>         till we come to bad ends, we're
freakin' friends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>         Freakin' friends, freakin' friends,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>         till we come to bad ends, we're

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Allison.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well,
Paris?” Alan Markowitz asked flatly. Standing in a jumble of moon-light and
tree-shadows, the tall man looked… well, Allison didn’t want to think how he
looked. At all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well
what?” Paris didn’t flinch. “Why are you here, Alan?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“My sister
called. She said that you were getting busy in her life.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I was merely
fixing it for her.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And for
which we’re extremely grateful. What do you <i>want</i>, Paris?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“When did I
want anything?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ever since
that event with Constantine the Red.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well gee,
I’m sorry Mr. “King Snake”, but don’t you think that you can accuse me, being
more than hip-deep in it yourself-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What’s
hip-deep for a horse, is <i>way</i> over-the-head for a chicken,” Alan
interrupted the girl’s rant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I'm not a
chicken, Al,” Paris shook her head. “But you as a stallion – that has art
possibilities!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You always
were more than a little bit artsy,” Alan said sadly. “I'm going to miss you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paris’ eyes
widened in fear. “No!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“She’s
right,” Allison quickly said, stepping forward. “Back to your old tricks, eh
Alan?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both of the
others turned their heads towards them. “Allison,” Alan shook in his gravely
tone. “This doesn’t concern you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh yes it
does!” Allison snapped. “What’s okay for mom’s girlfriend, isn’t okay for you!
And Paris – if you knew our family as good as you claim to, you should’ve known
better than confronting my brother just like that! I mean, mom told me what he
does to people who piss him off.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan
exclaimed. “Mom has a big mouth.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Can I go?”
Paris said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No,”
brother and sister shook their heads. “What do you <i>exactly</i> want, Paris?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paris
froze, look Alan exactly in the eye and spoke in a new, quiet tone. “My heart
back. Please?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Allison
froze herself, unbelieving what she was hearing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And Alan
could only say: “What?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Jane.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was the
next day. Jane was showing Daria off. “I just couldn't get past all that
upper-crustiness. I felt like the poor cousin in a Henry James novel. You know,
someone to be tolerated till </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>she gets
run over by a horse and buggy.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah, the
Sloanes defiantly come from the land of the muffies, but it's not like they're
jerks or anything. I just ignored the money and concentrated on the incredibly
well-stocked refrigerator.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah.
Look, why don't you just come back with us?” Daria said simply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane froze.
That offer was more than tempting. But – she couldn’t. Not with the whole Allison
thing that was going-on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don't
know. Some kind of dumb-ass notion about seeing this through, I guess. Anyway,
it's just another two weeks, and than we'll back at school.” She paused,
starting to get confused. “... Wait, what's my point?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That life
sucks no matter what. So don't be fooled by location </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>changes,”
Daria said flatly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You really
should write fortune cookies,” Jane replied dryly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Call me
when you get back,” Daria said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“All right
freakin' friend.” Jane started to walk away, then stopped. “Uhm, I don't
believe I'm about to say this, but you should give Tom another shot. He's not a
bad guy and you could use the recreation.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria
couldn't believe her ears. “Uhm, what about the whole &quot;You stabbed me in
the back, how could you?&quot;-thing?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane looked
just a little surprised. “I think I really am over that. As opposed to when I
said I was over it, but I was really still under it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah,
right,” Daria said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Seriously.
Give it some thought on the way back.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don't
think so.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Or,
converse with the band. The choice is yours,” Jane said, wondering what Trent
thought about Tom-Daria pairing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Allison.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey, Allison.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Jane, hi. How’s your friend?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Safely off. Remind me to tell you never to go to this club
– it’s a real dump… Got any family members visiting you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey Jane, Allison,” Paris’ voice, surprisingly soft,
sounded from behind them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two girls turned around. There stood Paris, leaning
against Alan Markowitz’, looking… content. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Have I missed something?” Jane asked the older girl.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“This is my brother,” Allison replied instead</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Really? I thought that this was Odin, the All-Father,” Jane
said wryly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alan snorted bemusedly. “So you’re Jane Lane, hah? Well,
you’re a good kid, so listen to my advice, okay?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sure.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“My sister’s head may not always be on her shoulders, but
her heart’s <i>always</i> in the right place. Try to hang-out to each other,
you two, and maybe, just maybe, you’ll make it work.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Allison groaned and hid her face in her hands. Jane just
stared, feeling startled, to say the least. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It seems that my job here is done,” Alan smiled. “Wish us
luck kids, we’re off to get married. Cheers.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Jane.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>It was a long time later, on a road
in Lawndale Jane and Daria were walking through it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“So, I got through to Link after
all. And all it cost me was a </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>generous period of self-doubt
followed by a bracing sting of self-hatred,” Daria was saying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“See? Not every human is a
manipulative opportunistic letch. Or, at least, that's what I'm told,” Jane
admitted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“You didn't make any friends at that
art colony, did you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“No. Well, except this one girl,
until she got fresh,” Jane lied, knowing that the truth will not be something
to Daria’s liking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Daria abruptly stopped. “You're not
kidding.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“As much as I'd like to gain you
sour perspective on the whole sordid incident, it's going to have to wait. I
think there's someone looking for you,” Jane said quickly, as Tom's car
pulled-up in a new car. “Wow! Nice car. Where's Jeeves?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“I killed him for his uniform,” Tom
said wryly. “How are you doing?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“I'm okay,” Jane said. “She's pretty
okay too.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Yeah, I know that,” Tom said not
feeling too comfortable. “Hey, Daria.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Hey,” Daria replied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Want to go for a ride?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Actually, we were just...” Daria
began, but Jane interrupted:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>“Saying goodbye. I'll call you
later.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Daria didn't have any other choice
but to step into Tom’s car.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Allison.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The phone rang. “Who is it?” she asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, it’s me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Jane, hi!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey. What are the news on the home front?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Depressing. Mom’s not happy that Alan got married, and Mona’s
remarks do not help the situation either.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Um, who’s Mona’s?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mom’s well, technically,-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I see, I guess Paris was right when she described your
family to me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Do you two look the same?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No, mom looks more like an aged-down Willow from Buffy.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You watch that show?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mona sometimes does. She’s not too bad, considering-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Look, I've been thinking. We did have a good time together,
didn't we?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, we made Anaïs happy by leaving her alone with Dotson,
we made Paris and my brother happy, and we weren’t too miserable ourselves. So
yeah, I agree with you. What’s your point?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the other end of the phone line, Allison could feel Jane
steeling yourself for the question. “Jane, you still there?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And on the other end of the phone line Jane replied like on
her last reserves of power: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So what are you doing next summer?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b>The End?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ENDNOTES:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fauvism - a relatively short-lived movement in French
painting (from about 1898 to about 1908) that revolutionized the concept of
colour in modern art. The Fauves rejected the impressionist palette of soft,
shimmering tones in favour of the violent colours used by the
postimpressionists Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh for expressive emphasis.
They achieved a poetic energy through vigorous line, simplified yet dramatic
surface pattern, and intense colour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Matisse, Henri - French
artist, leader of the Fauve group, regarded as one of the great formative
figures in 20th-century art, a master of the use of colour and form to convey
emotional expression.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane’s new acquaintances at the art colony – well, why not?
Allison obviously didn’t awake one day and decide to be gay – obviously she had
to have some reason why to do so. Jane’s dorm mates – I’m not really good at
leaving characters as blanks, so I did my versions of it. Maybe I'll even do
some stories about them – who knows? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My works – this is not a part of my “SLA” continuum, as I've
indicated in the beginning. Though some characters and situations may appear
similar, this is a separate story. </p>
