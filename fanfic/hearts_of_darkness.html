<p><b>Disclaimer/Warning/Whatever:</b> Hm, how to introduce this? Okay,
let me put it this way-- this is a weird story that I just sort of
stumbled on to while I was reading "Heart of Darkness." It plays a lot
on some of the themes of the book, but not all of them. There are also
a number of changes in the plot, and in the characters as well. If
you're expecting a crossover, then you'll be sadly disappointed. If
you're looking for a weird take-off on it, though, this is the right
place. If you read the book, "Heart of Darkness," it might help a
little, but it's not required reading. (If you do read the book, I'll
warn you that there is some language that you may find pretty darn
offensive. Please keep in mind, though, that it's a product of its
time.) Heck, even watching "Apocalypse Now" would help some, as the
movie is also based on the book, but follows it a lot more closely than
I do.
<p><b>Acknowledgments:</b> Thanks to Joseph Conrad (Not William
Conrad, of "Jake and the Fatman" fame) for writing a very interesting
story. It really made me think. Thanks also to the folks who made
"Apocalypse Now" a very interesting interpretation of "Heart of
Darkness."

and that's because there's a lot of narration. Daria's narrative

<p>Roll Into. to Daria in "Hearts of Darkness."
<p>ACT I.
<p>Fade In.
<p>Int. -- Lane House -- Basement -- Sunday Afternoon.
<p>Daria and Trent are standing, facing each other. Each one is looking down, away from each other's eyes.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>I don't know Trent, isn't this kind of a big step?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Trent</b></center><br> <blockquote>Aw, c'mon, Daria,
sometimes you've just got to take a chance on something like this. I
mean, how many opportunities like this come along?</blockquote>
<p>Daria looks up at Trent.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <center><p>(Unsure.)</center><br><blockquote>I don't know. It just seems so... impulsive.</blockquote>
<p>Trent looks up at Daria.
<center><p><b>Trent</b></center><br><center><p>(With some feeling.)</center><br> <blockquote>Yeah,
but isn't part of life about taking chances? You know, nothing
ventured, nothing gained? Sometimes you've gotta try, or you'll always
wonder "What if?" (Beat.) I can't live my life always wondering about
what could have been, Daria, I just <i>can't</i>.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>I guess, but will your friends approve of this? It <i>is</i> kind of sudden and unexpected.</blockquote>
<p>Trent smiles at Daria.
<center><p><b>Trent</b></center><br> <blockquote>Nah, I've
already discussed it with them. They approve. They think it's a
wonderful idea. (Beat.) You know, I've been wanting to do this for some
time now.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><center><p>(Surprised.)</center><br> <blockquote>Really?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Trent</b></center><br><center><p>(Assuring tone.)</center><br> <blockquote>Yeah, I was just afraid, y'know, that things would get, uh, complicated. But I think that this will be a great move for us.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><center><p>(Still a little reluctant.)</center><br> <blockquote>Well,
I just don't want anyone to get hurt. You know what can happen when
these things get out of hand. Someone could really get hurt.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Trent</b></center><br> <blockquote>Well, we'll start
slow, then. You know, sort of ease in to it. It's not like we have to
crank things up all the way. (Leans closer to Daria, smiles
suggestively.) Wanna try and see what happens?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Um, okay.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Trent</b></center><br> <blockquote>Cool, then let's get this thing started. </blockquote>
<p>Trent leans forward towards Daria, then...
<p>ZOOM OUT to show Trent bending down and turning a switch on a
box-like machine. Fog starts to pour out of it and fill the basement.
Trent smiles contentedly as the room starts to fill with fog.
<center><p><b>Trent</b></center><br><center><p>(Cont.)</center><br><blockquote>Man, I've always wanted to have a fog machine.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>You know, you never really struck me as the fog machine type, Trent.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Trent</b></center><br> <blockquote>Hey, like I said,
sometimes you just gotta try something and see if it works. When I
heard that The Band Of Hair was breaking up, I figured we could get
their fog machine cheap. It adds a certain amount of irony to our music.</blockquote>
<p>The room continues to fill with fog at an increasing rate. Daria starts to cough a little.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Yeah, but I thought the idea was not to asphyxiate your fans.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Trent</b></center><br> <blockquote>Whoops, sorry about that.</blockquote>
<p>Trent turns the machine down as Jane and Tom come down the stairs
into the basement. Jane waves her hand in front of her face in an
attempt to disperse the thick fog.
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>Trent, did you burn out another amp again?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Trent</b></center><br> <blockquote>No, we're just checking out the fog machine that I scored off of the former Band of Hair. Let me get a fan going here.</blockquote>
<p>Trent walks over to the back of the basement to get a fan.
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>And here I was,
worried that you were going to try to pull some sort of Hendrix act.
(To Daria.) Hey stranger-- where've you been the past few days?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Tom</b></center><br> <blockquote>Yeah, you missed a
lot of weirdness. It was another Sick Sad World marathon. They even had
a special "Freakiest of the Freaky" episode. You would've enjoyed it.</blockquote>
<p>Trent comes back with a fan on a pole, and plugs it in.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Oh, I saw plenty of weirdness, and plenty of freakiness. I saw enough to last me a for <i>quite</i> a while.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Trent</b></center><br> <blockquote>Well, why don't you tell us about it while we clear all of this fog out?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Okay, but I'll warn you. It's disturbing, even to me.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>Really? I gotta hear this.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Okay, it all
started after school on Wednesday, right before the teacher work-days
started. I was in the parking lot, getting ready to drive the dragon
wagon home, when...</blockquote>
<p>Cross Fade to:
<p>Ext. -- Lawndale High School -- Parking Lot -- Wednesday Afternoon.
<p>Daria is approaching her beat-up station wagon.
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br> <center><p>(OS.)</center><br><blockquote>Dammit! (Beat.) Ow! DAMMIT!</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <center><p>(Narr. VO.)</center><br><blockquote>I should've known better than to look, but I couldn't resist.</blockquote>
<p>Daria turns to see Ms. Barch by Mr. O'Neill's car, hopping on left foot, grimacing in pain.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Ms. Barch? Are you okay?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br> <blockquote>Ah, I kicked
Skinny's car because it wouldn't start, and now I think I've broken my
foot! (Beat.) Um, Daria, could you do me a favor and run me by the
Doc-in-a-box? Because I just <i>know</i> I've broken something.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Um, sure.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <center><p>(Narr. VO.)</center><br><blockquote>Nothing like compounding one mistake with another.</blockquote>
<p>Daria bends down and picks up a ragged, well-worn copy of <i>I'm Ok, You're Ok</i>.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Is this yours, Ms. Barch?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br> <blockquote>No, it must be Skin-- I mean Mr. O'Neill's. I'd recognize it anywhere. He never goes anywhere with that thing.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <center><p>(Narr. VO.)</center><br><blockquote>I
leafed through it quickly, and there were all sorts of strange notes
written in the margins. He must've been writing all over that thing for
20 years.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>What should we do with this?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br> <blockquote>I guess we'll just take it along. I'll see Tim soon enough.</blockquote>
<p>Daria helps Ms. Barch limp over to the car. They get in, and start to head to the Doc-in-a-Box.
<p>Int. -- Car -- Wednesday Late Afternoon -- A Few Seconds Later.
<p>Daria pulls the car out of the parking lot and into traffic.
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br> <center><p>(Cont.)</center><br><blockquote>Thanks again for doing this for me, Daria. I'm not imposing, am I?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><center><p>(A Little Distractedly.)</center><br> <blockquote>No,
it's okay. My parents are away on business, and Quinn's at some sort of
fashion club retreat or something. I'm pretty much on my own for the
weekend.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><center><p>(Narr. VO.)</center><br><blockquote>I should've just kept my mouth shut, but you know how it is when you're concentrating on driving; sometimes you lose your focus.</blockquote>

<p>Int. -- Lawndale UrgentCare 24 -- Waiting Room -- Wednesday Late Afternoon.
<p>Daria is sitting in the waiting room, reading a book called "The
Pleasures of Probability." She looks up as Ms. Barch limps out of the
door of the treatment room into the waiting room. Her right foot is in
a cast, and she is walking with the help of an aluminum cane.
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br> <blockquote>Dammit! That's all I need.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Let me guess, you broke your foot?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>Three bones! Now I can't drive to get those two idiots back! Angela will fire the both of them if I can't get them back in time.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Which idiots?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>Timothy and
Anthony. Anthony was invited to give a paper on history pedagogy at a
convention in Atlantic City. He didn't want to go, but Angela forced
him to. Tim went along for "moral support."</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Moral support?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote><center><p>(Grimaces.)</center><br>You know how Anthony is around casinos.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Oh, yeah. And I'd almost managed to block that memory out, too. So, I take it that they're still there?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>That's just it, we
don't know. They left on Saturday, and were supposed to be back by
Tuesday. Well, anyway, we haven't heard anything from them since they
left, and if we can't get them back here by next Monday, Angela's going
to flip, and then it'll <i>really</i> hit the fan. Fortunately, we've
got those two teacher work-days to find them, but now I can't drive.
(Beat. Slams her fist into her palm.) Dammit!</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>What about the other teachers?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>Them? Forget it.
They all bailed out for the weekend as soon as Angela announced that
she was going to the big "Arms and the Man" weapons convention at an
undisclosed location in Texas.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><center><p>(Narr. VO.)</center><br><blockquote>Have you ever noticed how sometimes Fate seems to force us into situations we'd ordinarily avoid like the plague?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><center><p>(Sighs.)</center><br><blockquote>Alright,
alright, I'll help. Since it's not too far away, I guess I can drive
you up and back. But I'll need gas money. This car drinks gas like it's
nobody's business.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><center><p>(Relieved.)</center><br><blockquote>Thanks, Daria. Don't worry, we'll all make the trip worth your while. (Beat.) <i>Especially</i> Anthony. Oh, he'll owe us, alright. (In an undertone.) Boy, will he ever owe us.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><center><p>(Narr. VO.)</center><br><blockquote>Some bargain. The extra credit was almost worth it. (Beat.) Almost.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Well, we might as well get this over with, then. Do you need anything before we go?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>No, I've already got a bag in Timothy's trunk. We can get it at the school on the way out of town. Do you need anything?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Nope. Let's just get this over with.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>Amen, sister.</blockquote>

<p>Ext. -- On The Road Somewhere Between Lawndale and Atlantic City -- Wednesday Night.
<p>Daria and Ms. Barch are in Daria's station wagon, driving towards Atlantic City.
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>And that was when I found out that that rotten insensitive bastard had been recycling my anniversary presents for the <i>last 10 years!</i></blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Mmm.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>And do you know what the worst part was?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><center><p>(Thought VO.)</center><br><blockquote>That he managed to escape, and I didn't?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><center><p>(Cont. Out Loud.)</center><br><blockquote>No, what?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>He had been using the presents I gave to him as presents for his father's birthday! That cheap bastard!</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Ms. Barch?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>Um, yes?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>If men are so worthless, why are we traveling a few hundred miles to rescue two of them?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><center><p>(Trying to change the topic.)</center><br><blockquote>It's complicated.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>That's okay, we're going to be here for a while.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>It's really complicated.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>It's okay, I'm clever.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>Okay, look, I'll make no bones about it; I don't particularly care for Anthony.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Really? I never would've noticed.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>But I will admit that he's an adequate History teacher. Besides, <i>I</i>
don't want to get stuck having to fill in for him. You know how cheap
Angela is-- she'd make us all cover for him, rather than hire a sub,
let alone a new teacher.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Uh, huh. And Mr. O'Neill fits in how?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>Well, poor Tim is
always trying to help everyone else-- it would be unfair to leave him
there, just because the majority of his gender are knuckle-dragging
morons, incapable of having emotions beyond primitive urges, let alone
being able to express their feelings with some degree of emotional
maturity.</blockquote>
<p>A loud BANG! is heard, and the car starts to wobble a bit.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><center><p>(Sighs.)</center><br><blockquote>Damn. I knew that tire looked a little <i>too</i> worn. Oh, well, that's what I get for being a cheapskate.</blockquote>
<p>Int. -- Lane Basement -- Sunday Afternoon.
<center><p><b>Trent</b></center><br><blockquote>Hey, I thought you said you were going to buy decent tires for the wagon.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>I was, until I found a better use for the money.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br><blockquote>Really? What'd you get?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>A few books I'd been looking for finally turned up at the second-hand store.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br><blockquote>A few books at the
second-hand store shouldn't've kept you from being able to buy tires.
(Beat.) C'mon, out with it, how many did you really buy?</blockquote>
<p>Daria mumbles something.
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br><center><p>(Cont.)</center><br><blockquote>Huh? I didn't hear that.</blockquote>
<p>Daria shrugs.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Alright, I bought 15 books. Happy?</blockquote>
<p>Jane grins.
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br><blockquote>And have you read them all yet?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>No, I still have a couple more to finish. (Beat. Looks at Jane.) Although I <i>have</i> had a few extra free weekends as of late.</blockquote>
<p>Jane and Tom exchange guilty glances.
<center><p><b>Trent</b></center><br><blockquote>Well, listen,
you really need to put some decent tires on that thing, even if it does
butt into "fun time." I thought I taught you better, o heap-driving
apprentice.</blockquote>
<p>Ext. -- The Side of a Lonely Road -- Wednesday Night.
<p>Daria is struggling to try to change the tire, and is getting
frustrated quickly, while Ms. Barch is propped under a tree, off to the
side. As she has been struggling, she's gotten very, very dirty, as
anyone who's ever had to change a tire on the road at night would know.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><center><p>(Narr. VO.)</center><br><blockquote>Believe me, Trent, I learned that lesson the hard way.</blockquote>
<p>As Daria tries to jack the wagon high enough to remove the tire, it
rolls forward, sending the jack and the rear of the car falling to the
ground. Daria throws the tire iron to the ground angrily.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><center><p>(More frustrated than angry.)</center><br><blockquote>Damn! (Beat.) Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn!</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>Daria, do you have an auto club membership?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><center><p>(Still mad, though.)</center><br><blockquote>No.</blockquote>
<p>Ms. Barch starts digging around in her purse.
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>Well, then, use
mine. Just don't forget who you are. Here, take my cell phone, too.
There's no point in you trying to change that thing with that ancient
equipment.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Thanks.</blockquote>
<p>Int. -- In the Car and On the Road Again -- Wednesday Night -- An Hour Later.
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>I've got an idea for a shortcut.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Do you really think we should be pushing our luck like that?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>Well, look at it
this way-- we lost an hour getting that tire fixed, it's already
getting late, and we could both use a break. Besides, it'll cut a few
miles off of the trip.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Okay, I'll bite. What is this magical shortcut?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>The ferry.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>The ferry?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>Well, it'll at least give us a chance to let someone else do a little driving.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Sold. The ferry it is, then.</blockquote>
<p>Ext. -- Ferry Dock (You know, the one in Delaware) -- Night -- Another Hour Later.
<p> As the car pulls up to the dock, the ferry pulls away.
<p>Int. -- Car -- Wednesday Night -- A Few Seconds Later.
<center><p><b>Daria and Barch</b></center><br><center><p>(Together.)</center><br><blockquote>Damn!</blockquote>
<p>After an moment's pause, both start chuckling.
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>With the way my luck has been running today, maybe it's for the best. I bet the damn boat'd sink if we got on it.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Well, I guess I'll take the first watch.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>No, Daria, get some sleep. I'll watch for the next boat.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Okay.</blockquote>
<p>Ext. -- Ferry Dock -- Wednesday Night -- A Couple of Hours Later.
<p>Daria's Car is at the front of a line of cars, waiting to board the ferry as it docks. The gate opens, and the cars drive in.
<p>Cross Fade to:
<p>Ext. -- Ferry -- Wednesday Night -- A Little While Later.
<p>Daria is leaning against the rail along the side of the ship,
looking out at the water. A middle-aged couple, wearing cheap polyester
outfits walks past her, talking.
<center><p><b>Al</b></center><br><blockquote>We'll hit it big this time, Bernice.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Bernice</b></center><br><blockquote>You betcha, Al. We've got it figured out, now. What should we do with the winnings?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Al</b></center><br><blockquote>I was thinking we could always make a down payment on a new Caddy.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Bernice</b></center><br><blockquote>Oooh, I was thinking we could also pick up some of those wonderful Hummels we saw at that really cute little store!</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Al</b></center><br><blockquote>Well, sure, we could do that, too.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><center><p>(Quietly, to herself.)</center><br><blockquote>Or you could always set some money aside for your kids' education, but that might actually be prudent.</blockquote>
<p>As the couple wanders off, Daria looks at them with a slight air of
distaste. A pair of women wander by, one is middle-aged, one is
elderly.
<center><p><b>Marge</b></center><br><center><p>(Loudly, as though her companion is a little hard of hearing.)</center><br><blockquote>Ma, when we get to the hotel, do you want to go to the buffet first, or do you just want to play the slots?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Emma</b></center><br><center><p>(In the quavering voice of someone who is very elderly.)</center><br><blockquote>Oh, the slots, of course! Granny needs a new pair of shoes!</blockquote>
<p>Both laugh and wander off. Daria starts to look annoyed.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><center><p>(Quietly, to herself.)</center><br><blockquote>Or maybe you could set aside a little money to make sure you don't wind up eating Alpo in two years.</blockquote>
<p>Daria walks away from the rail, and into the main cabin of the boat.
<p>Int. -- Ferry Boat Snack Bar -- Wednesday Night -- A Few Minutes Later.
<p>As Daria is standing in line to get something to eat, she
overhears three men talking in front of her. They all have the
downtrodden, sleazy look of frequent gamblers.
<center><p><b>Morty</b></center><br><blockquote>Heh, Joe, didja find any money to bring with you this time?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Joe</b></center><br><blockquote>Of course I did, you knucklehead, r'else I wouldn't be on this damn boat.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Larry</b></center><br><blockquote>You're gonna get it when your missus finds out you raided her cookie jar again, though.</blockquote>
<p>Morty and Larry laugh, while Joe is indifferent to their remarks.
<center><p><b>Joe</b></center><br><blockquote>It's no big deal,
it's not like we needed the money right away, it's just something she's
been setting aside for the future. The way I see it, I'm just investing
the money for her.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Morty</b></center><br><blockquote>Investing? You gotta be kidding, right?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Joe</b></center><br><blockquote>Nah, gambling is just like investing, it's just that the risks and the rewards are a little higher.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Larry</b></center><br><center><p>(Almost chokes in surprise at Joe.)</center><br><blockquote>A
"little" higher? You gotta be kiddin' me! The way you play cards,
you'll be lucky to have two quarters to rub together, let alone to have
enough to "replace" the money you "invested."</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Morty</b></center><br><blockquote>Joey, what are we gonna do with you?</blockquote>
<p>Before anyone else can speak, they approach the counter.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><center><p>(To herself.)</center><br><blockquote>How about dropping Joey in the ocean before he can squander the entire family's savings?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Counter Guy</b></center><br><blockquote>Can I take your orders?</blockquote>
<p>As Daria's VO continues, ZOOM IN on a very-mad-looking Daria waiting
behind the three gamblers. Towards the end, she looks as though she
could spit nails right through them.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><center><p>(Narr. VO. With building feeling.)</center><br><blockquote>It
was disgusting and pathetic at the same time. All everyone on that boat
wanted to talk about was "hitting it big," in Atlantic City, and
"finally cashing in," when the reality that they were facing was that
they'd <i>all</i> be lucky to have two quarters to rub together by the
same time tomorrow night. I mean, casinos sure as hell aren't built on
winners. Maybe if they'd applied that same squandered energy on their
sad attempts to "strike it rich" on improving themselves, they wouldn't
<i>be</i> on a dumpy little boat to New Jersey, leaving their kids with
God-knows-who, doing God-knows-what, instead of doing something
constructive, like <i>reading</i> with them.</blockquote>
<p>Int. -- Lane Basement -- Sunday Afternoon -- A Few Seconds Later.
<p>Jane, Tom, and Trent all look at Daria with raised eyebrows.

<p>As the car heads towards the casinos, Daria starts looking at all of
the various people in various stages of disrepair, in stark contrast to
the flashy new buildings.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><center><p>(Narr. VO.)</center><br><blockquote>The
grotesque tackiness and unbridled despair of the place were palpable.
They had a weight and texture to them all of their own. It was as if
something had enveloped the place as you looked around, as if
everything had been smothered by some sick, distorted, diseased cloud.
A cloud that tainted and tarnished everything it touched.</blockquote>

<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br><blockquote>For O'Neill's class?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Well, no, I guess not for his class. I don't know, it'll be useful for <i>something,</i> if only as another experience to add to the pile. Anyway, where was I? Oh, yeah.</blockquote>

<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>Do we have any
choice? If I know Anthony, he's already gambled away all of his hotel
money, so they're probably out on the street somewhere.</blockquote>
<p>Daria parks the car, and they get out and start wandering near the casinos.

<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Sounds like a good plan to me.</blockquote>
<p>As they're walking around a corner, they see a dejected Mr. O'Neill
loitering near a casino entrance. He looks as if he hasn't slept in a
few days, and hasn't had a chance to bathe or shave, either.
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><center><p>(Shocked by his appearance.)</center><br><blockquote>Timothy? Is that you? My God, what happened to you?</blockquote>
<p>Ms. Barch run-limps towards Mr. O'Neill. Mr. O'Neill starts jumping up and down, gesticulating wildly.
<center><p><b>O'Neill</b></center><br><center><p>(Ecstatically.)</center><br><blockquote>Janet! Daria! You found me! Thank God!</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><center><p>(Narr. VO.)</center><br><blockquote>The
way he was jumping up and down suddenly reminded me of a drawing I did
of him in his class one day-- he was capering just like the Harlequin
that I drew. He resembled him, too-- his clothes looked an absolute
mess. Not that I usually care about such things, it's just that the
image was so clear, it struck me.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><center><p>(Gets a whiff of him.)</center><br><blockquote>Phew! Tim, what happened?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>O'Neill</b></center><br><center><p>(Starts getting upset.)</center><br><blockquote>Oh,
Janet, it was just terrible! He suffered a full relapse! All of his
brilliant ideas, lost to the siren song of the casino! He didn't even
make it to the elevators! And do you know what the worst part is?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>What, Tim?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>O'Neill</b></center><br><center><p>(Starts sobbing uncontrollably.)</center><br><blockquote>I lost my book!</blockquote>
<p>Ms. Barch embraces Mr. O'Neill, and speaks to him in a soothing tone.
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>It's okay, Tim, it's okay. Daria found your book. She even brought it with her.</blockquote>
<p>Mr. O'Neill breaks the embrace and looks at Ms. Barch, his countenance a study in hopefulness.
<center><p><b>O'Neill</b></center><br><blockquote>Really?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Yep, I've got it right here.</blockquote>
<p>Daria rummages around in her backpack and hands him the well-worn
book. Mr. O'Neill takes the book in an almost reverent manner and
quickly turns to a page, reads and smiles to himself.
<center><p><b>O'Neill</b></center><br><blockquote>Oh, thank you, Daria, you have no idea how much this book means to me.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><center><p>(Narr. VO.)</center><br><blockquote>He
treated that book the same way that a child treats a favorite stuffed
animal. It wasn't like he hadn't already read the thing a billion times
over, but it seemed as though he needed physical contact with that book
to reassure himself that he truly was "okay."</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>Okay, Tim, enough reading. Now what happened to you and Anthony?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>I've got an idea-- why don't we go somewhere and get Mr. O'Neill something to eat first, then he can tell us what happened.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>O'Neill</b></center><br><blockquote>Oh, could we? I haven't eaten for a while, actually. Anthony has all of our meal money.</blockquote>

<center><p><b>DeMartino</b></center><br><blockquote>Timothy,
traumatic experiences are EASILY remembered and NEVER FORGOTTEN. Just
ask ANYONE who ever went to MILITARY SCHOOL. (Beat. O'Neill still looks
uncomfortable.) Besides, it was meant as a JOKE.</blockquote>

<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>Oh, Timothy, I
don't think anyone alone could've stopped him from relapsing. (In an
undertone.) Unless, of course, they had some Thorazine on hand. (Normal
tone.) Okay, so he relapsed on the way to the rooms?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>O'Neill</b></center><br><blockquote>Yes, it was
terrible. We made it past the slot machines, past the blackjack,
roulette, craps, and even the keno tables, but then he hit the limit of
his endurance.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>Let me guess-- the poker table was the last straw, wasn't it?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>O'Neill</b></center><br><blockquote>It wasn't so much
the table as the couple from Iowa who stopped in the middle of their
poker game to say "Hi" to him. It was just too much.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>Well, did you try to stop him?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>O'Neill</b></center><br><blockquote>Of course! But
every time I tried to reason with him, he just snarled at me, and
threatened to hurt me. I told him that he was squandering his
opportunity to present his brilliant paper to his colleagues, that he
could help future generations of students, but he just threatened to do
some very nasty things to me and told me to leave him alone.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Where is his paper, anyway?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>O'Neill</b></center><br><center><p>(Searches his pockets.)</center><br><blockquote>Oh, I kept a copy of it with me somewhere. In fact, Anthony threw it at me when I tried to reason with him. Oh, here it is.</blockquote>

<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>So how did you wind up on the street?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>O'Neill</b></center><br><blockquote>He had Security throw me out.</blockquote>
<p>Daria looks up from her reading.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Well, of course. You were interfering with them when they were busy with a victim.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>O'Neill</b></center><br><blockquote>Well, not exactly.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>What do you mean, "not exactly?"</blockquote>
<center><p><b>O'Neill</b></center><br><blockquote>Right before they threw me out on Sunday morning, he had quite a pile of chips in front of him.</blockquote>

<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><center><p>(Narr. VO.)</center><br><blockquote>He
was right. As I was reading Mr. DeMartino's paper, I realized two
things. One was that he really did have some great ideas to improve
teaching methods. I must say that I was very impressed. But the other
thing I realized was that he must've had some spare time to work on it
between losing hands of poker, because he had written "Kill all the
brutes!" at the bottom of the paper in blood red ink. I knew then that
Mr. D. had probably gone completely off the deep end, and you know what
that means.</blockquote>

finally thrown off his water wings in the pool of mental instability,

<p>Int. -- Diner -- Thursday Morning.
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>Well, wherever
he is, he's not going anywhere soon. Tim, we could all use a shower and
some sleep, and you need it more than we do. Let's go grab a couple of
rooms somewhere cheap, and we can all freshen up a little before we
start beating the bushes looking for Anthony.</blockquote>
<p>Mr. O'Neill looks torn, but looks over at Daria, who is nodding off, and looks exhausted.
<center><p><b>O'Neill</b></center><br><blockquote>But will he be okay?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>Frankly, Tim, I
don't give a damn anymore. We've been up all night, we all look like we
could use some sleep, and right now if I saw Anthony, I'd reach down
his throat, rip his lungs out, and beat him over the head with them,
disease or no disease. If he dumped you on the street for four days on
your own, then he can wait 12 hours more in his own personal Hell.</blockquote>
<p>As Ms. Barch says this, Mr. O'Neill looks deflated.
<center><p><b>O'Neill</b></center><br><blockquote>You're right,
Janet, you're right. It's not fair to you or to Daria to put either of
you through any more for now. He'll just have to cope on his own a
little while longer.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><center><p>(Trying to cheer O'Neill a little.)</center><br><blockquote>Look,
Tim, he's a big boy-- he's managed to survive on his own for, what, 46
years now? You can't save all the stray dogs at once. (Beat. Smiles a
little at him.) Although I must admit, that's part of your charm.</blockquote>
<p>Mr. O'Neill blushes a little under his 3-day growth.
<center><p><b>O'Neill</b></center><br><blockquote>Oh, that's nice of you to say, Janet.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>Come on, the sooner we get out of here, the sooner we can get home. Daria and I will take one room, and you can take the other.</blockquote>

<p>Jane winces and cringes as she uses her imagination.
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br><blockquote>Ugggh, you're right. It could've been much worse.</blockquote>

<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>Well, I've got a list of local pawnshops, let's check those out first.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>O'Neill</b></center><br><blockquote>You don't think we should try the casinos first?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>No, knowing him,
he's already burned through his cash, and maxed out his plastic. I bet
he's already tried to sell his cheap watch again.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Well, let's head out then, and start searching.</blockquote>

a number of pawn shops. At each one, they pantomime some of Mr.

height. Each time the pawn broker shakes his head, "Nope."

<center><p><b>Shopkeeper</b></center><br><blockquote>Uh-huh?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>O'Neill</b></center><br><blockquote>Yes, you see, our
friend had a relapse, and we think he may have been around here, trying
to sell some of his things for more gambling money.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Shopkeeper</b></center><br><blockquote>Well, what did he look like?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><center><p>(Knows the description by heart by now.)</center><br><blockquote>He's
6 feet, late 40's, salt and pepper hair, rough voice, bulging eye, and
tends to emphasize words for no apparent reason. He probably hasn't
shaved or bathed in about four days.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Shopkeeper</b></center><br><blockquote>Well, I did
see someone like him, but he was buying, not selling. (Beat.) Are you
sure you want to get him back? He sounded a little crazy, even to
someone like me.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>Yes, well, we have no choice.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Yes, my colleagues and I need him. Did he say where he was going?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Shopkeeper</b></center><br><blockquote>He mumbled
something about going for broke big time. Said he hadn't had a streak
like this since 1978. (Beat. Shopkeeper looks up at the ceiling, trying
to remember.) I think he said something about going to the Slump
Obelisk.</blockquote>

<p>Daria throws a suitcase into the trunk, then gets behind the wheel, as Ms. Barch talks to Mr. O'Neill.
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>Apparently he
hit the jackpot there a few days ago. He walked out of there with quite
a bit of money. The management was just a bit suspicious, so they were
all too happy to see him go. He said something to them about the Slump
Obelisk as well.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Well, I guess that cinches it. Let's go get him, and get out of here.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>O'Neill</b></center><br><blockquote>Shouldn't we have some sort of plan, first?</blockquote>

<p>Daria, Ms. Barch, and Mr. O'Neill look out over the vast sea of flashing lights and gamblers.
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>We'd better

middle. If you spot him, come and get the other two.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>O'Neill</b></center><br><blockquote>Okay.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Roger.</blockquote>
<p>They split up and start searching. As she walks through the casino,
she looks around at the people either feeding the machines or playing
the games.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><center><p>(Narr. VO.)</center><br><blockquote>It
was like watching some sort of unholy feeding frenzy of avarice, to the
accompaniment of bright flashing lights and cheap sound effects,
punctuated by random shouts. It was difficult to tell which were shouts
of glee, and which were howls of frustration. Either way, it was
interesting to watch the line between predators and prey blur
continuously under the uncaring eyes of the security cameras.</blockquote>
<p>Daria looks and catches a glimpse of Mr. DeMartino at one of the
poker tables. She ducks behind a pillar and looks at him from her
unobserved location. He doesn't look too different, except that he
looks a little crazier than before, and he's actually <i>smiling.</i> The reason for the smile is not apparent, at first.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><center><p>(Narr. VO. Cont.)</center><br><blockquote>The
change in him was surprising. At first, I second-guessed my first
thought -- that he had gone off the deep end-- I mean, he was <i>smiling,</i>
so he couldn't've gone off the deep end. But then I got a good look at
him, and then I understood. Yes, he had a big pile of chips in front of
him, and it looked like he had finally hit a winning streak. But there
was one problem-- how could he be enjoying himself when he knew that he
had tossed Mr. O'Neill out on his own? Something was wrong. I went
after Ms. Barch and Mr. O'Neill-- this was probably going to be ugly.</blockquote>

<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>So, you found him playing poker, and winning? Okay, just follow me, and we'll get him out of there.</blockquote>
<p>They walk towards the poker table. Ms. Barch walks up right behind
Mr. DeMartino and waits. As he continues to play for a minute or two,
she finally clears her throat.
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>Well, well, Anthony, fancy finding <i>you</i> here.</blockquote>
<p>At the sound of her voice, Mr. DeMartino jumps.
<center><p><b>DeMartino</b></center><br><center><p>(Surprised.)</center><br><blockquote>Ah, Ms. Barch! Timothy? Daria? What are you doing here?</blockquote>
<p>Ms. Barch starts slapping her cane into her left hand.
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>We're <i>waiting</i> for <i>you</i> to <i>finish your game so we can get the hell out of this sewer!</i> (Beat.) Now, we can either do this the easy way, or the hard way.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Dealer</b></center><br><blockquote>Sir, your bet?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>DeMartino</b></center><br><blockquote>Uh, ah...</blockquote>
<p>Ms. Barch pushes the majority of his chips forward, and looks at Mr. DeMartino with a challenging gleam in her eye.
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>Well, Anthony, you're feeling <i>lucky,</i> aren't you?</blockquote>
<p>Mr. DeMartino just gapes at her in horror. He knows what'll happen if he tries to weasel out.
<center><p><b>Dealer</b></center><br><blockquote>Sir, do you wish to bet that much?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>DeMartino</b></center><br><blockquote>Uh, yes.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Dealer</b></center><br><blockquote>Very well. Does anyone else wish to call?</blockquote>
<p>The other players look at the pile of money riding on the hand and fold.
<center><p><b>Dealer</b></center><br><blockquote>Very well, then, the house calls.</blockquote>
<p>The Dealer puts down a King, a 10, a Jack, a Queen and and Ace. Of spades.
<center><p><b>Dealer</b></center><br><blockquote>Royal flush.</blockquote>
<p>Mr. DeMartino deflates as he puts down three 3s and two 8s. The
dealer scoops up the chips, leaving a few little stacks in front of Mr.
DeMartino.
<center><p><b>Dealer</b></center><br><blockquote>The house wins.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>Alright, Anthony, we leave. Now.</blockquote>
<p>Ms. Barch grabs Mr. DeMartino, while Mr. O'Neill grabs his remaining
chips. As they start to leave, two security guards start to make their
way towards them.
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><center><p>(Whispers in DeMartino's ear.)</center><br><blockquote>We can make this easy or very, <i>very</i> hard. (Beat.) I recommend easy.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Security Guard</b></center><br><blockquote>Sir, is there some kind of problem?</blockquote>
<p>Mr. DeMartino takes one look at Mr. O'Neill, Daria, and finally, Ms.
Barch, and deflates as he starts to realize just what he's done.
<center><p><b>DeMartino</b></center><br><center><p>(Strangely quiet.)</center><br><blockquote>No, no problem at all. We were just leaving.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Security Guard</b></center><br><blockquote>Alright then, sir. Have a nice evening.</blockquote>
<p>Mr. DeMartino grabs a couple of chips from Mr. O'Neill, and hands one to each guard.
<center><p><b>DeMartino</b></center><br><blockquote>Thanks, you too.</blockquote>
<p>As they head towards the cashier, Mr. O'Neill looks over the remaining chips.
<center><p><b>O'Neill</b></center><br><blockquote>Well, Janet, Daria, this should cover all of our expenses rather well. Come on, Anthony, let's go home.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>DeMartino</b></center><br><blockquote>By the way, Timothy, if I may ask, what time is it?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Barch</b></center><br><blockquote>It's 9:30 PM. (Beat.) <i>Thursday</i> night.</blockquote>
<p>Mr. DeMartino looks even more depressed as he realizes how late it
truly is. They lead a dispirited-looking DeMartino out the door of the
casino and towards the car.
<p>Int. -- Car -- Late Thursday Night/Early Friday Morning.
<p>Mr. O'Neill is driving Daria's wagon back home so that she can
get some rest, and so that she can keep an eye on Mr. DeMartino, who
has been very quiet. Slowly ZOOM IN on Daria as she does the VO. She
looks at Mr. DeMartino, and looks on him with some degree of pity as he
sits, hunched in on himself, as close to a fetal position as he can get
in a cluttered station wagon.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><center><p>(Narr. VO.)</center><br><blockquote>It
was kind of sad, really. Not only did he not want to go to Atlantic
City in the first place, but when he came home, he was much worse for
the trip. After we got in the car and started heading out of town, he
was silent for the rest of the trip, save when we left Atlantic City.
He saw the sign that said "We Bet You Had A Great Time!" and he
whispered quietly to himself, "The horror, the horror!" I think I was
the only one who heard him utter those words. I don't know exactly what
he meant, but I do get the general gist of it-- here was a man who had
always been intelligent, and always aware of it. Yet he had never
managed to do anything that he felt was worthwhile with that
intelligence. He had his one big chance to make a difference in his
field, and his one weakness, his love of gambling, not only ruined his
chances to make a name for himself, but he also lost a piece of his
humanity when he realized what he's done not only to Mr. O'Neill, but
also to Ms. Barch and to me. As he saw that sign, I think it all came
crashing down on him at once.</blockquote>
<p>Ext. -- Lawndale -- Early Friday Morning.
<p>The wagon pulls into town, and is headed to drop everyone off at various places.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><center><p>(Narr. VO.)</center><br><blockquote>As
we headed back home, I began to wonder just how many DeMartinos there
are, quietly struggling with powerful personal demons behind those faux
Colonial doors, recently painted houses, neatly trimmed lawns, and
freshly washed garden gnomes, and then I remembered something. (Beat.)
Something important.</blockquote>
<p>Int. -- Lane Basement -- Sunday Afternoon.
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br><blockquote>What?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>This is <i>Lawndale</i> we're talking about.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br><blockquote>True enough. (Beat.) But that still doesn't explain something.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>What?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br><blockquote>If you got home on Friday Morning, where were you Friday Night and Saturday?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>I needed to do two things. One, I needed plenty of sleep.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br><blockquote>Fair enough.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>And two, I needed
some time alone to digest the whole incident, because, let's face it,
it was a very strange trip. (Beat.) Oh, yeah, and I also had to make
sure that no one at my house ever figures out where I went.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Trent</b></center><br><blockquote>Seems logical. Thanks for the story, Daria. It was very unsettling.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Well, you're welcome, I guess.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Tom</b></center><br><blockquote>You're right, though,
it was definitely disturbing. I don't think I'd ever want to know that
much about my teachers, that's for sure.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Tell me about it.
(Looks down at her watch.) Aw, hell, I've gotta go. My folks should be
home soon, and I don't want them to start having some sort of hissy fit
if I'm not there.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br><blockquote>Let me walk you to the door.</blockquote>
<p>Jane and Daria start heading up the stairs. When they get to the door, Jane turns to Daria.
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br><center><p>(Cont.)</center><br><blockquote>Is there anything else I need to know?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>What do you mean?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br><blockquote>Well, I just noticed a few things you <i>didn't</i> say, like why you hate gambling so much.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Let's just say that I have very strong feelings on the matter, and leave it at that.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br><center><p>(Realizing that she shouldn't press.)</center><br><blockquote>Okay, fine, but if you ever feel the need, the door's always open.</blockquote>
<p>Daria opens the door and smiles at Jane.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>I know. Thanks.</blockquote>
<p>Ext. -- Morgendorffer Home Base -- Sunday Afternoon -- A Few Minutes Later.
<p>Daria approaches the front door and walks in.
<p>Int. -- Morgendorffer Living Room -- Sunday Afternoon -- No Time Has Passed.
<p>Daria walks in and closes the door.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><center><p>(Yells.)</center><br><blockquote>I'm home, is anyone else?</blockquote>
<p>Jake walks in from the kitchen, holding what looks suspiciously like a Racing Form. He looks up at Daria and brightens a little.

<center><p><b>Jake</b></center><br><blockquote>Oh, hey, kiddo, how was your weekend?</blockquote>
<p>Daria looks pointedly at Jake and extends her hand. Jake guiltily
hands over the Racing Form. Daria tears it in two, then throws it into
the nearest trash can. She almost smiles.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Oh, you know, Dad, same 'ol, same 'ol. Why don't we sit down, have a cup of coffee, and you can tell me about your weekend?</blockquote>
<p>Fade Out.
<p>Roll Credits to "You Better You Better You Bet" by the Who.
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<p><b>Notes:</b>
<p>This one was a bit of a toughie at first, but once I got it
going, it flowed surprisingly well. This one will probably leave a lot
of folks scratching their heads, so here are a few somewhat useful
notes. If these aren't enough, by all means, email me using the link
above.
<p>Okay, first off, for those of you who haven't already figured
out the "Heart of Darkness" characters that relate to the characters
here, Daria is the Marlow character, Ms. Barch is sort of an
amalgamation of the Manager and the Pilgrims, Mr. O'Neill is sort of
the Russian, Jane, Trent, and Tom are the audience on the ship that
hears Marlow's story, and, of course, Mr. DeMartino is Mr. Kurtz.
(Yeah, I know, DeMartino as Kurtz is kinda obvious.) Atlantic City
serves as a metaphor for the deep jungle, and the staff at the casinos
serve as a metaphor for the angry natives. Instead of Ivory, everyone
lusts after money, but that's not really much of a stretch, either.
<p>Another thing you're probably wondering, if you've read the
book, that is, is why aren't there more parallels to the book? The
answer is simply that if I made too many parallels to the book, the
story wouldn't have any legs of it own to stand on. You don't need to
read the book in order to enjoy the piece, although it does help a
little. Again, I just wanted to make enough allusions to the story in
order to have a little fun at Mr. DeMartino's expense.
<p>One thing you may have noticed-- just as in the book, neither
DeMartino nor Kurtz tell much of their own stories-- their stories are
revealed by eyewitness accounts or stories told by others to the
searching character(s). That's why Daria, Barch, and later, O'Neill
wander all over Atlantic City. You'll also notice that they don't
actually talk to DeMartino until Act III-- same as the book-- you don't
see or hear Kurtz himself until the last third of the book.
<p>Here's something else you may or may not have noticed-- the
scene where Daria wanders through the casino is supposed to echo ever
so slightly the scene in the book where Marlow catches a few glimpses
of the "unspeakable rituals" that went on in Kurtz' camp, right down to
the yells and flickering lights. Neat, huh?
<p>Another thing you may have noticed-- Daria alludes a few times
that perhaps one of her parents could've spent a little less time
playing the ponies, and a little more time reading to his daughter. I'm
not saying that Jake is some sort of compulsive gambler or anything,
but his tendency to play the ponies every now and then irritates Daria.
Maybe he missed a recital of hers or something while he was out at the
track. Either way, now you understand why she reacted the way she did
to him when she got home from Jane's. I think she also realized that if
she gave him an alternative to the Racing Form, it'd be easier for him.
She learned quite a bit from her trip. And just like in "Heart of
Darkness," she doesn't tell her family what <i>really</i> happened-- she doesn't want to disturb them <i>too</i>
much-- besides, they might make her change teachers after they heard
about what happened, and considering the dirt she has on the three of
them, well, that just wouldn't be prudent for her. (Besides, Helen
would go <i>nuts</i> if she ever found out that Daria went to Atlantic City.)
<p>Yes, you can get hurt by a fog machine-- have you ever been slam
dancing in a club with one of those things on? If it gets a little <i>too</i> dark and <i>too</i>
foggy, well, people can get hurt, especially when they misjudge the
slamming distance due to fog. (Slam dancing is pretty much the
forerunner to the mosh pit, only it's not quite as obnoxious.)
<p>Oh, and finally, a note to the 'Shippers-- sorry about pulling
your leg like that in the first scene, but it was vital to the story.
Yeah, that's it, it's vital to the story.
