<h3>Heat is on</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria and Jane were sitting in the Lanes’ garage, chased
there by Mystik Spiral’s music. Well, one could only very loosely apply to what
Mystik Spiral was playing the term “music”, because really it was just noise,
worse than a vulture’s mating song, if they had one, that is. Even Daria wasn’t
sure on that one. But if the vultures had a mating song, then even that would
be better than what Mystik Spiral was playing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Even if the vultures had a mating song, then even that is
probably better than what Mystik Spiral is playing,” Daria told Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“USA doesn’t have vultures, it has condors,” Jane shrugged. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How do you know that?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey! Can't I know American wildlife?” Jane asked
indignantly. Daria just looked-on. “Okay, sheesh! Jodie had a nature awareness
week before you came to Lawndale.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Did it raise <b>your</b> nature awareness, Jane?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, no. But Penny really likes the flying birds design,
so I kind of tricked Jodie into giving me some.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You? Tricked Jodie? Suddenly I don’t know you at all, it
seems.”<br>
”Relax. I am as I am. Now what are we going to do about our problem?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, Trent is your brother, so <b>you</b> kill him. I'll
handle Jesse and the rest, I suppose.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s not what I meant. It’s just the heat that makes it
all so bad.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The heat? Excuse me? Grass is dying on the root, masonry is
melting! Tiffany Blum-Decker’s brain is dead!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Come on, it can’t be that bad!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It is! Even the fashion network has been deactivated due to
the heat excess! The streets of Lawndale are as empty as Tiffany Blum-Decker’s
skull!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Now <b>that’s</b> an exaggeration. Some people are still
valiantly struggling in the face of adversary’s heat!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah. That’s because they were crazy to begin with,” Daria
said sourly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey! Leave Trent alone! You had a crash on him once, remember?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Now that was in your imagination alone, you crazy yenta!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both girls stared at each other with real surprise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Now that was hard,” Jane said. “You better apologize.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I forgive you for bringing-up my crush-over-Trent issue,
Jane,” Daria said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Aw shucks, you mushball. Seriously though, whom did you put
under the “crazy” tab? Share?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“My dad. Even my mom is working at home, but not my dad.
It’s office exclusively for him!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s got to be something grandpa-related,” Daria said.
“God, for somebody who died way before I was born, grandfather Morgendorffer
really screwed-up my dad’s head.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Unlike you, who have been screwing it since you could
talk?” Jane said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s different! I’m working from below, a position of weakness.
Grandfather was working from above, a position of strength. Besides, I at least
have a crazy grandfather. What’s the reason behind your family’s dysfunction?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That was cold, Daria.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I'm sorry, Jane, but I wasn't cold. No one can, not in such
climate.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“True, Daria. It makes our sarcasm degenerate into insults,
like we were mere fashion drones, and not the warriours of cynicism.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Okay, now what brought that on?” Daria said. “Seriously
though, if we’re so smart, why can’t we figure-out a way to keep ourselves
cool?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, us Lanes have an air conditioner right here,” Jane
slapped a small cabinet that flapped-open from the worse. A big metal box-like
contraption fell out of it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That's your air conditioner?” Daria asked with something a
little bit like reverence in her voice. “Yikes!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So tell me, Miss Brain, why doesn't it work?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, so I'm the brain in our pair now, is it so? Then you’re
the muscle, and so I suggest you use a screw driver to unlock its secrets.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Now what the hell I'm doing here?” Jake wondered. “After
all, I was supposed to go to work.” Jake knew at heart that that was an
untruth. He just couldn't stand to stay home anymore. Helen has turned into a
real…witch, half-time work crazy, half-time just slack, Quinn just stayed in
her bed, as exciting as a corpse, while Daria…Daria seemed to have discovered a
hide-out of some sorts, appearing home only some time after sunset, which, in
early July, came mighty late in the day. Smart Daria, Jake realized it last
night, and decided to follow her example. And so he told Helen that he was off
to work, ignored her protests, and found the first more-or-less solid-looking
watering hole, in order to get drunk. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jake didn’t think about his behaviour, the heat seemed to
have fried his neurons as well as most of other Lawndale’s townsfolk. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Jake was sitting at the bar and chugging Guinness, somebody
sat next to him. He glanced sideways. It was just some female, in her early
twenties, whom Jake felt sure he had seen before some place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Did I see you before some place?” he asked her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The young woman shrugged. “Who knows? Are you a fan of
Mystik Spiral?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Are you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, sort of. My name is Monique, I sometimes go out with
their leading guitarist, Trent Lane.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Lane, Lane… Why does this sound so familiar? Ah, I know! He
must be related to Amanda and Vincent Lane.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh. Cool,” the girl shrugged. “Uh, my name is Monique, and
can you buy me a drink? I'm a little bit low on cash, you know.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why not?” Jake agreed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Outside, invisible to the human eye, tiny little vapours
were raising from the ground and the street. Unbeknownst to the humans, but
fully known by Mother Nature, the day was going to get much more hotter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So what’s the problem with our air conditioner?” Jane asked
Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, it is out of its’ place, for one thing. An air
conditioner is usually positioned in a house wall, not in a cabinet.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So we got to do is?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Re-install this air conditioning unit back from wherever it
came from and re-fill the supply of air coolant in it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Is it simple?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s men’s work.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Fat chance of that happening. They’re all so busy playing—“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>BOOM!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Lane house rocked from the sudden explosion. “I suddenly
feel that it is not so,” Daria said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yo! Guys! Are you okay?” Jane shouted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We're okay. The amplifiers are not. They fried.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Then come on down! We have figured-out a way to make Casa
Lane a cooler spot!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Okay!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Back on the Dega street, the locals were dealing with the
heat in the best way they knew – getting wasted. Quite a few of them were out,
OD on alcohol or similar beverages, plus the heat. Surprisingly, Jake was one
of those who seemed to have been relatively untouched by the combo; at least he
was still in a vertical position.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so was Monique. Someway, somehow, she managed to stay
sober enough to listen to Jake’s stories, but she was also drunk enough to
understand only four words out of five, and laugh on the fifth one. That made
Jake’s erratic narrative sound even more disorderly in her ears. But neither
she nor Jake understood that; both were in a sufficient stupor so that neither
of them fully comprehended, what were they doing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Morgendorffers’ house, Quinn Morgendorffer was lying upstairs,
almost completely naked. She was dealing with the heat in her own way, which
was to keep as much as energy as she could by lying stone-still. She felt at
least marginally cooler than her mother, for one thing. For another, she felt
like she was getting the feel of yoga.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>…It had been truly some time ago when Quinn started to do
power yoga. It had been only a fad, in the beginning. But as school ended and
the heat mounted, Quinn’s approach to yoga started to become more serious.
After all, weren’t the guys who practiced it completely unperturbed by <b>anything</b>?
Quinn liked that idea, being unperturbed by anything, so she began to study
yoga techniques in earnest. And now she was trying it in a practical way,
namely, she was trying to reach the nirvana state, in which nothing will bother
her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Downstairs, Quinn’s mother, Helen Morgendorffer, was dealing
with the heat in her own way, namely, by working on her laptop like crazy, in
the literal sense. Her fingers flew faster than the eye could see, her brain
cells were also functioning faster and faster… and then the laptop just
blew-up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>BOOM!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Back upstairs, Quinn, still lying in her trance, scarcely
frowned. She was so out of it, that nothing could perturb her by now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So let met get this straight,” said Nick. “You want us to
stick this huge big box into that hole, then wield it with an acetylene torch,
and then go outside to buy some liquid coolant? This is crazy! Who do you think
you’re dealing with? Jethro?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Who’s Jethro?” Daria asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We went to the school together,” explained Trent, fully
awake for once. “He was weird, man.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What do you mean?” Daria asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“For one thing, he and Ms. Barch couldn’t stand each other,”
Nick said. “It all started when she accused him of being a male chauvinist.
Jethro bristled and told Ms. Barch that she absolutely wrong, that he believed
in equality of the sexes; i.e., if anybody was getting on his nerves, he would
take them and beat them up six ways from Sunday, completely unhindered by such
facts as the sex of the pest. Since he was about as muscular as a gorilla,
nobody of the student body ever found-out otherwise – and lived.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Whoa! Ms. Barch didn't take that lying down, did she?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, she tried a few tricks. But Jethro was too good for
her, you know. That, and the fact that he and Ms. Li seemed to have some sort
of a weird arrangement going-on between themselves.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Which was?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, Jethro did whatever Ms. Li told him to do – and
that’s it. You wanted him to participate, you had to ask Ms. Li to ask him to
do so.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Jodie wasn't pleased, I suppose.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Uh, no. Then there was the nature awareness week. Jethro
brought-over his pets – a couple of snakes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What snakes?” Daria asked with a professional interest. In
Highland, Texas, snakes were seen much often then here in Lawndale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“A cottonmouth and a copperhead,” Jane said. “At least, that
was what I was told by Mack and Jodie. Rattlesnakes, I presume.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria shook her head. “Not quite. They’re related to rattlesnakes,
but have no rattles.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How do you know that?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I'm a Texas gal at heart, remember? We had plenty of snakes
back in my hometown, and plenty of ways of how to treat snake bites, too.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, well, this is Lawndale, New England. Poisonous snakes
are a rarity here, so we kind of get freaked-out,” Trent said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Na-ah, man,” Jesse shook his head. “That was because some
dogs and cats started fighting and the gerbils got loose and took-over the
school basement while nobody was watching.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Really took-over?” Daria asked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Aha. Like a solid carpet of gerbils in the end it was. And
all of that from only a couple of them! It was amazing!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“’Course, the whole school had to be fumigated,” Jane added.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh. Dad told me once how his school got to be fumigated,”
Daria said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh why?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Because some kid accidentally sealed his lunch in the wall
and stayed there for two months until the school re-opened in September. The
opening had to be re-postponed till October!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s harsh, man!” Jane chuckled. “Still, what shall we do
about our air conditioner?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I have no idea.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the bar on the Dega street, Jake and Monique finally took
a break from their “conversation”. “So what do you want to do now?” Jake said,
looking leeringly at Monique. Beer goggles could turn any harpy into a goddess.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You're hot,” Monique giggled. Her ordinary habits
kicked-in. “Want to make-out?” She was pretty spaced-out of it as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sure,” said Jake, by now completely clueless to everything.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So this Jethro guy seems to be pretty cool, overall,” Daria
said. “So why didn't you like him?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Aw, come on, Daria, could you be friends with a guy who
could play “Pop goes the weasel” on a trombone?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I can play it to you on a flute, Lane, so better think of
another argument.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Okay,” nodded Trent. “When Penny was still going to school
and I was just getting started, we had another heat wave like today.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s a regular occurrence, then?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah, once in seven years. Anyways, the weather was as hot
as today, and guess what Jethro was doing?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He wasn't in the house?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah. We asked him once, didn't he feel the heat? He said,
and I quote: “If my life doesn't change soon, when I die I'll end-up in Hell,
so I’m practicing”. End of quote.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Did you know that according to Dante parts of Hell are actually
cold or at least non-fiery?” Daria said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Just wait till you experience the winter that’ll come after
this summer,” Max said. “It’s a cycle, of sorts.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Wonderful,” Daria shook her head. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It gets better. When somebody argued that that might not be
the case, Jethro agreed, saying, that the way his luck was going, he would be
dragged in Hell alive and kicking. You try to be friends with such a guy.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Okay; where <b>is</b> he now?” Daria asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Now that we mention it, we have no idea.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ow, my nose; ow – my face!” Helen Morgendorffer groaned.
“Ow – the back of my head! What did I do with – tried to break a hole in the
wall?” Then she saw the burned-out remains of her laptop. “Ow nuts! My
assignment! Now I'll never get to be a partner of the firm!” she groaned. “I
hate my life!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Peace be with you, Helen,” Quinn replied, finally floating
downstairs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen looked at her youngest child. And the more she looked,
the more she was sure that something was missing. Of course, her new
skull-splintering headache might be involved somehow. “Quinn? What’s the Hell
is going on here?” she asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Writhe peace; peace, writhe,” Quinn replied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Quinn? Are you on something?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“All those suspicions and hard-driven worries – they bother
you,” replied Quinn, “and deny you truth, that refreshing, cold water with the
best flavour in the world!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen groaned. “I don’t have to listen to this, Quinn, you
know?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You may run, but you can't hide from the truth.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Something in Helen’s brain went <span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>click!</span> “This isn't fair!” Helen almost sobbed. “When Dorothy
went out of ‘it’, she ended-up in a wondrous land, full of amusing made-up
characters and with a loyal doggy! I, on the other hand, am still here, in a
sun-sterilized city that is seemingly devoid of live save for my daughter, who
spawns gobbledygook at too young at age!” She paused. “That’s it! I'll go and
see what’s Daria is doing at her friend’s! Hopefully, <i>she</i> won't be doing
no mythical guru act!” She looked triumphantly at Quinn and went forwards.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What will you do? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And what will you find?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Will you rule Nock’ma’ar,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Or your will it will bind?” Quinn sang-out instead. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen slammed the door, and paused. Was Quinn actually
floating a few inches aboveground? Nah, the heat was getting to her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wiping her already sweating brow, Helen Morgendorffer went
forth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The sun beat down on the town of Lawndale mercilessly, like
a furnace of Hell’s, apparently devoted to cleanse the town streets’ of
everything living. And it was doing a good job so far, but not a perfect one,
for there were shadows still, as well as some crazed reflections, glints and
haze – but nothing human. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, at one point in Lawndale the glints and the haze
did something stranger, if not downright unique – they solidified.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Briefly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Into a very tall, very muscular man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With a cold, empty look in his eyes and a mop of scarlet-red
hair on his head. He smiled suddenly, a smile that would do honours to both an
evil goblin and a heartless crocodile, and uttered two words: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Helen Morgendorffer.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then he was gone, dissolving back into sunlight glinting off
the roofs and the haze that was ascending from the steamed pathway, which
drifted forth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And the sun shone forth and down onto the town of Lawndale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Tell me again – where did you find that coolant?” Daria asked
suspiciously Trent. “I thought you hadn't had any!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Me too,” Jane added, looking no less suspicious than Daria.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Look, you remember that our fridge used to leak?” Trent replied.
“Well, mom and Penny were worried that it might pollute the environment, and
dad and Summer were worried that it would be wasted. So me and Wind started to
collect it into bottles till the fridge got fixed and stuff. So here you have
it – left-over coolant.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don’t know,” Jane frowned. “I think it might not be
safe…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I'm sure that it <i>isn’t,</i>” Daria responded. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah, well, we're not going outside – no way no how!” spoke
Nick. “The air conditioning in the Tank is broken down.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I thought the Tank was indestructible?” Daria said wryly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh it is, it is. The air conditioning is just out of tune,
that is all.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But didn’t you say…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The heat’s affected his brain,” Max spoke. “The Tank is indestructible,
but Nick’s head isn’t. Besides, neither Tank nor Nick are heat-proof.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria sighed. “I give-up. Jane – you got the acetylene torch
in proper order, I hope?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Let me go and prop it all up,” Jane said happily. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I think I'll go and help,” Daria said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Aren't you going to supervise the guys’ work?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“They must just put the box A – that’s the air conditioning
unit into the hole B – where it was supposed to be. It's using the torch that’s
going to be tricky, you see?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Good thinking, Daria,” Trent replied, putting the bottle
down next to the ‘hole B’. “Come guys – in an orderly, friendly fashion –
lift-up and insert!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The quartet went forth to work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn was in the Morgendorffer kitchen, looking into the
fridge. “Now where is this orange drink, I’m sure I still had it…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s right over here, Quinn.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh thanks… Hey! Who're you!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That was a good question. A tall woman in a jet-black business
suit was leaning over Morgendorffers’ kitchen table. Contrasting, her skin was
ivory-white – but not elephant-type of ivory, Quinn decided, more like that
ivory nut kind – whereas her eyes were also black. And liquid. Like two
bottomless pools. Or puddles. Finally, the woman had a shiny black hair with
silver-white highlights. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In short, the woman was very, very good-looking, almost
inhumanly so. “So?” Quinn repeated. “Who're you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why do you ask?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You look so weird!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So speaks the girl who floats.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Wha-? Hey, I’m floating! This means, I am dreaming! That
means, that I can just pinch myself and wake-up!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Are you <i>sure</i> that you’re dreaming?” the woman
demanded. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well- Yeah- I mean, I couldn’t have reached that nirvana
place, could I?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The woman smirked slightly. “Oh God! I did, didn’t I? Then
what are you doing here? Who are you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“My name’s Clarisse. I'm an angel.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And what’s an angel doing in the Morgendorffers’ family
kitchen?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Talking to you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was then Quinn felt as Helen felt when she talked to
Quinn. “You better start at the beginning,” she told Clarisse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Certainly. You see, a very nasty warlock has cast a spell
upon your town.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What’s the spell does?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Knocks the whole city unconscious, makes their subconscious
leak into the world. Basically, your whole town is in the process of getting
into the nirvana.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Then why you’re talking to <i>me</i>? You’ve got the whole
town to chose.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Eh… no. You see, I can contact only those who entered this
state on their own, without the spell’s help.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I guess that means me,” Quinn said wryly. “Still, why are
you here?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m not sure, but our sources say that that warlock is
after your mom.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn choked and spat-out orange drink. “Start at
beginning,” she said. “And I mean it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen was walking through the streets of Lawndale. But something
was wrong. Helen was scared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The streets were sunlit and lifeless, as if the hot and
cruel sun had burned-out everything it fell-upon. The houses loomed around her,
covering on half of the street in shadow, leaving the other side openly
sun-lit. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But there was no escape from the heat. Nowhere would Helen
go the heat would light-up. It pursued her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don't be ridiculous!” Helen told herself. “This is just
nerves, imagination… and Quinn. Nothing more.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But there was something else, unfortunately. Helen felt it.
The haze sent miasmas of dust – tiny dust devils – that whispered, <i>hissed</i>
into Helen’s ears. And the houses glared at Helen via their windows like
through the thousands of blind, empty eyes. And the haze and the dust whispered
and whispered into Helen’s ears: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There is no escape. <i>He</i> is coming.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yo! Janey, Daria! The box is in the hole! It’s instilled!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“<i>Installed</i>, Trent,” Daria grumbled. “And I'm not sure
that the torch was such a good idea.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don't worry, amiga!” Jane grinned, positioning herself next
to the unit which was now in the wall. “Let’s wield-tight this sucka!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Jane! Wai-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>BOOM!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Whoa! Guys! Where are we?” Max excitedly spoke a few moments
later. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I daresay that we’re neither in Heaven nor Hell nor in the
mortal world,” Daria said slowly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Everybody stared at her. “What makes you say that?” Jane
said in a small voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What’s the <i>last</i> thing you remember, Jane?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“An explosion. Oh boy. But that doesn't mean anything.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah? Well, we’re somewhere where it is nothing – proof
enough?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What do you mean – it is nothing? Surely there is <i>something</i>…”
Jane’s voice trailed off, as she and the guys took a look of their
surroundings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh God!” Max whispered. “I can’t make neither heads nor
tails in this place! It's all fog!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But we’re standing on something – aren't we?” Jane said desperately.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That doesn't mean anything,” Daria said. The others turned
to look around and almost fell on their butts. “Daria! You and Jesse are
standing on the ceiling!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So can you – it’s easy,” Jesse shrugged. He turned to
Daria. “So do you think we can find musical instruments in here?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen was lost. That was impossible, for hey! – this was <i>Lawndale</i>,
for crying outloud! – but she <i>was</i> lost. And she was sweltering. “Oh, for
a swim in a cold river! Oh, for a good long rain shower!” Helen exhaled,
sitting down on a bench.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>He is coming,</i> the serpentine whispers rattled her
ears once again. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen nervously looked around. Just <b>who</b> was coming?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>I</b>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The sweltering breezes were weaving the haze at the far end
of the street into a solid shape. Into a black-solid shape. And it was
approaching. And it was freaking Helen out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Where will you go?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What will you find?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Will you rule Nock’ma’ar,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Or your will it will bind?” Quinn’s words suddenly sounded
in Helen’s ears.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen grit her teeth, then quickly got up and walked. Walked
to find some help. After all, if she was in the bizarre-land, didn't it mean
that she didn't had to play by the rules no more?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“D<b>a</b>ri<b>a</b>! What have you done? You're supposed to
be the smart one!” Quinn’s wail really carried through the limbo (which it
probably was). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Quinn? What are you doing here? This is a private quarter!”
Daria snapped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Actually, I'm here to get you out,” Quinn replied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You? How? And what are you doing here?” Daria persisted
with the questions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s a good question, Daria, and I’m here to provide the
answers,” a new voice spoke. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Everybody but Quinn stared at the newcomer, the guys almost
drooling. “And who are <b>you</b>?” Daria asked crossly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“She’s Clarisse. An angel.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“An angel, hah? Can we see your wings and halo?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You could, but then my whole cover would be blown.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And why are you undercover?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“’Cause there’s a warlock in town, and he’s out to get mom,”
Quinn explained.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“M-hm. And all of a sudden Clarisse holds the answer to everything.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, I <i>do</i> hold the answer to getting you out of
here,” Clarisse said evenly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Good point,” Daria said. “Let’s go guys – we’ve got to save
our mom and return to the living!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Clarisse sighed. “That's not so simple as you think.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What do you mean we can't be brought back to life by you?”
Jane shrieked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s what I mean!” Clarisse looked defensive at the dead
girl spirit. “Not without permission! If I just snap my fingers and you become
alive, I'm in so much sh*t!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But won’t it help us save our mom?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“As a matter of fact – no. The whole drama is being
played-out in nirvana – the spiritual realm, were no physical body can enter.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Okay. But after we save Mrs. Morgendorffer, you <i>will</i>
give our bodies back?” Daria persisted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Clarisse nodded. “No problem. Of course.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen was once again wondering through the streets. Once
again, heat and haze assaulted her. But now something else was different – the <i>gaze</i>.
Somebody mysterious searched for her, saw her, watched her – and remained unseen.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then there was Quinn’s dopey jingle. “What’s Nock’ma’ar
anyways?” Helen asked outloud. “It’s a stone, or a fountain, or a-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“This is Nock’ma’ar,” a voice spoke into her ear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen paused, and wondered about her turning around and
seeing who it was. Then she thought some more – was it such a good idea? “And
this ‘this’ is what?” she asked instead. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not Lawndale.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen felt as if she was talking to her older daughter,
Daria. Her firstborn daughter was so smart, that what to others was confusing, was
obvious to her. And she used her power of sarcasm to demonstrate that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, Helen told herself, this looks like a conversation with
Daria. Well then, think what would Daria mean by those two phrases.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen thought about it a bit, then suddenly a realization
struck. “I'm not in Lawndale anymore, not exactly!” she exclaimed. “Nock’ma’ar
is this place, wherever this is!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Suddenly the whispering breezes hissed with a special
malice, and Helen saw a shadow fall over the street and her. This was enough
for her – she fled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The shadow leisurely pursued her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So how can we find Mrs. Morgendorffer?” Jane proceeded to
ask Quinn. “What is she doing right now? Running around the nirvana Lawndale
like a sick chick or what?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Using her instincts, Quinn had slipped her a clue,”
Clarisse admitted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why don’t I remember it?” Quinn frowned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Your subconscious took-over,” Clarisse exclaimed. “Ask it –
and the answer will come.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn concentrated. “Ask it, and the answer will come…” she
concentrated and realization hit. “Of course! The city hall’s place!” she
zoomed-off, still levitating.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I better go and catch her,” Daria said in her usual tone of
voice. “Max, Nick – come with me. Jane – you and others try alternate routes to
cover more ground, hmm?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes ma’am!” Jane said primly. “Trent, Jesse – you’re with
me!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Six teenage ghosts zoomed-off; when Clarisse has vanished,
no one noticed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So where <i>am</i> I going?” Helen wondered. “I obviously
need to find something important – or otherwise I’m in trouble. The whole mood
thing – not promising a good thing to me, no. So…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>‘Will you rule Nock’ma’ar,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Or your will it will bind?’</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think the jingle was. And in order to rule something –
say, a town – you need – a city hall! That’s where I'm going!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen zoomed off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The shadow went leisurely through Lawndale. Or Nock’ma’ar.
Or wherever. It knew what it wanted, and it knew how to get it. Suddenly it
paused. Interference. Somebody was interfering with it, of all the colossal
gall! Well, it would soon remedy it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The shadow twitched. Two thin splinters popped out of its’
right side and went careening off into the empty streets…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So Daria – where are we going?” Nick asked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I have no idea,” Daria replied. “But still…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey, look at the sun!” Max suddenly said. “It’s gone! And
it’s <i>cold</i> now!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria paused. The direct sunlight was vanishing, and so the
unnatural heat it brought with it. Now new thing was coming – just-as unnatural
gloominess, and – despair? “Where did that come from?” Daria wondered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“WHOOSH!” Something cold brushed past Daria’s face. On both
sides. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Uh-oh,” Daria said, as she turned around. Her reward was
only the sight of Nick and Max, turning into something else again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, here we are, boys!” Jane said proudly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And here is where?” Trent replied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“<i>Here </i>is the main street of Lawndale!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Lawndale has a main street?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“This one does!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yo guys – what’s this?” Jesse interrupted the argument between
the Lane siblings, pointing at one direction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane and Trent looked there. “Jesse,” Jane said slowly. “You
mean <i>who’s</i> this?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This ‘who’ was a tall man, dressed in clothes so dark that
they appeared purplish. And on top of his head with a mop of red hair. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The man gave a wry smile. “Who're you and what’re you doing
here?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We can ask you the same thing, man,” Trent argued.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ah, but I'm older, boys and girl.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And we don't like your attitude, mister,” Jane snapped
back. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The man stepped menacingly towards them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey, wait a minute, you’re walking!” Trent exclaimed.
“You're not dead or in a trance, aren’t you? Then why are you here?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I see you know some things already,” the man snarled. A missile
made of seemingly black fire appeared in his right hand. “Then take a load of
this!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He fired his missile. The teens scattered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>BOOM! The missile exploded, creating a deep diagonal rift.
And unfortunately, the Lane siblings were on the wrong side of it, with Jesse
on the other side, looking confused. “Jesse, run!” Jane yelled. “You got to
warn the others!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesse zoomed away as fast as he could. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The man turned to the Lanes, who slowly began to move away
from him. “Too late,” the man sneered. He jumped upwards – and suddenly was not
a man any longer, but a great and winged dragon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A dragon with seven toothy heads.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria watched with her usual bland face as Max and Nick
twitched like two puppets on semi-severed strings. It would be even fun to
watch, if they weren't changing into something grotesque – like trolls, or
maybe goblins, or maybe ghouls. “That’s it! Ghouls!” Daria exclaimed. “No
vampires because it’s day, and simple zombies – not my way. Yup, it’s got to be
ghouls!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two angry faces looked at Daria, their mouths full of
razor-sharp teeth and their eyes – nothing more than black beads full of hate.
The pair swung their now-taloned limbs in perfect synchronization, and Daria
frowned. “No you won’t!” she yelled, as she dodged under the swipe, and punched
the pair straight in the throats. “Us Morgendorffers don't go down that
easily!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen run. There was no sun now, but it was not dark.
Rather, she felt as is she was entering the land of perpetual gloom or
something. “What the Hell is going on?” she asked the empty air.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, you mortals always asking, when things aren’t alright;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When it’s early in the morning, you care nothing of night;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But the night is forever there, so you mortals should better
beware!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can’t run and you can’t flee – it’s time you remembered
that nought it for free!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So come on, company – everybody touch each other and fight,
not flee!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen turned around. “Quinn? You again? How did you get here
so fast? Are you playing the role of Glinda here?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mom, you're in trouble,” Quinn groaned. “Somebody is out to
get you, and you must be saved, or we all are doomed!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How do you know that?” Helen groaned. “And furthermore,
while I appreciate you <i>not</i> going all mystical on me, your usual attitude
is not anymore helpful, you know?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I can’t help you mom, you’ve got to help us!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Pressure. Oh goody. I hate my life!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mom, if you don’t succeed you won't have any life! None of
us will!” Quinn wailed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen paled. “Oh boy. Let’s go.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the ground shook, like something big and heavy was
walking on it. “You said it, mom,” Quinn replied, as the duo took-off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesse was running as fast as he could, with the monster’s
footsteps… not behind him. “Where’d he go?” Jesse paused, looking around
warily. “’Course, he can fly and all now, but still, still… I don't like it.”
Suddenly he brightened. “Hey, I think I'm getting the beginnings of a song!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cheered-up somewhat, Jesse ran-on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria looked at Nick and Max. Truth to tell, they weren’t so
formidable – at all. After all, they were <i>Nick and Max</i>. “Anyone using
them as minions must be pretty sloppy or uncaring,” Daria told herself. “Or –
very, very self-confident.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Another one of you kids?” a voice spoke-up behind her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria turned around. The stranger was there, and he was
looking at her. Daria looked back. The sudden silence stretched. And then Daria
spoke. “Do you know – Quinn’s got your hair?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was a pause.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Really? Who are you and who is Quinn?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Your last name isn't Morgendorffer by any chance?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The man looked bland. “So it is. Mathew Morgendorffer it
is.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I'm Daria Morgendorffer. And I daresay we’re related
through Jake.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ah yes. Jake.” The man smiled. “Well I guessed as much. The
two of us – we <i>do</i> look similarly. Well then – hello, granddaughter.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was a briefer pause. “This is all fine and dandy,”
Daria spoke again, “but how did you put the whammy onto the whole town? Are you
a wizard or something?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The older Morgendorffer beamed. “Nay, girl – I'm the
seven-headed dragon of Apocalypse!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And you achieved this enchanting career <i>how</i>?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It was one Christmas Eve. I was visited by an angel-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Called Clarisse? That’s the one who got us onto this
truck.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mathew’s eyes developed a nasty glint. “Still tries to undo
her own work? I'll gnaw on her bones yet, you mark my words!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You know grandpa Mathew?” Daria said, a trifle warily. “I
can see where dad gets his temper and rants. ‘Cause, his rants are about you
mostly.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why am I not surprised?” Mathew sighed. “Jake always hated
me. Just because I didn't approve of his actions.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Please!” Daria hurriedly said. “I'll let you two work it
out somehow – I’m not a family therapist, you know?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, why not? They’re paid a lot of bucks, as I know.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Money can't buy you happiness.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What can, then?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Doing what is right for you? Like, writing fiction.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ah, but a therapist who writes fiction, makes more money
and is probably happier than a writer who doesn’t practice therapy.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s convoluted logic,” Daria shook herself. “No, it’s common
self. But hey – I'm a teen! I'm not supposed to have it!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah, a common teen who’s talking to the dragon of apocalypse,”
Mathew said wryly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Exactly. No common sense. But enough about me – what about
you? Why do you want mom so much?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s a bet I've made,” Mathew shrugged. “See, there’s this
girl, and I really wanted to impress her, and so I've let her talk me into this
bet, which is based around your mom.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Whoa! Way too much information!” Daria quickly said.
“Grandpa Mathew, you're a grandpa! You're not supposed to make bets to impress
girls!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Daria, us Morgendorffer men are suckers for younger women.
Take your own dad for instance – you do <i>not</i> want to know what he’s doing
right now!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Good thinking, grandpa Mathew,” Daria nodded both wisely
and comfortingly. “I do <i>not</i> need this type of information. Now stop
chasing mom so that Clarisse could bring me and my friends back to life – we
kind-of died, you know?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You did <i>what</i>?” Mathew said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Died.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And Clarisse said <i>what</i>?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We save mom, she brings us back to life.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I see,” Mathew snarled. “Somebody is <i>cheating</i>. And I
will have somebody’s bones soon!” In a flash of flame he was gone, and a huge,
seven-headed dragon was standing there. The dragon flapped his wings and
flew-off. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh no you won’t!” Daria yelled and zoomed-off, chasing her
grandfather. She didn't notice the ghouls Nick and Max regaining conscience and
looking around.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Trent, we’re lost,” Jane complained. “First that bloody
dragon pursues us like a hawk hunts hares, and then we get lost!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, Janey, we’ve lost the dragon too.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No, Trent. It got bored and left.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s funny, Janey. I thought we were dealing with a
warlock.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So it’s a warlock that can turn into a dragon. Big deal.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No-no Janey – remember Summer’s book of Bible?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There’s a grammatical error in that sentence somewhere,
Trent, but I'll let it slide. So what about Summer and her bible?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It had pictures.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, duh! Otherwise, you wouldn’t be looking through it!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No-no. There was this one picture – it was Armageddon. Or
Apocalypse. Or whatever. I daresay it uh, it uh, showed a seven-headed dragon.
I think he’s supposed to be leading the forces of Hell or other such key role.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane rolled her eyes. “Trent, this isn’t very funny.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Janey, it’s not funny at all.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Trent – you're serious?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But of course.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Then we're in trouble.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Uh, Janey – we’re already in trouble.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What do you mean?” Jane paused, and looked in Trent’s direction.
There, with light gleaming off their beady black eyes, stood two ghouls,
looking like two demented rodents. “You know something, Trent?” Jane said
calmly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What, Janey?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Let’s <i>run</i>!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesse was walking along, humming the lines of his new song.
It wasn’t a long one, but Jesse didn't mind. He didn't like long songs; he
liked them short and sweet. “Yeah. Short and sweet. I like the sound of that!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Suddenly there was a sound of running and seconds later Jane
and Trent zoomed past Jesse. “What are happening, guys?” Jesse placidly asked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Two ghouls! They are after us!” Jane wheezed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh?” Jesse turned around. Sure enough, there were two
ghouls, running after Jane and Trent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesse’s fists shot out, smashing the ghouls into their
faces, knocking them off their feet. But these were <i>ghouls</i>, they were <i>already</i>
dead, so they got up again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But then, Jesse wasn't alive, either. So he hit them just as
hard as before. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And the ghouls got up again, and got knocked down once
again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then it just turned routine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After a while Jane and Trent turned to each other, finally remembering,
that they, as well as Jesse, were also dead, and that Jesse and the ghouls
could literally go on forever. “Jesse, grab them and hold them instead,” Jane
ordered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesse complied. “Now what, Janey?” Trent asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane thought. “Hmmm…” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the dragon buzzed over their heads. “Follow that
beast!” yelled Jane, and they ran-on, with Jesse still holding the ghouls.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Everybody knows that the undead can’t get tired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well Quinn, I think this is the city hall!” Helen said
cheerfully. “And no big bad shadow-person in sight – hey!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That “hey” came from Trent, Jane, Jesse, and the two ghouls
as they barrelled into Helen and Quinn, knocking them all in a heap. The
septilateret went down in a heap, and fourteen pairs of eyes saw stars. Then
nothing else.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mathew Morgendorffer landed with a flatter of his leathery
wings and regained his human shape in a heartbeat. Then he loudly yelled:
“Azra! Get your shapely ass right here right now!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You called?” the shapely angel Clarisse made an appearance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You!” Daria exclaimed, not waiting to catch her breath (another
benefit of being an undead spirit). “I knew there was something fishy about
you. Who <i>are</i> you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Meet the archangel Azrail,” Mathew Morgendorffer said
primly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The Reaper?!” even Daria gawked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah. Why’s the face, kid?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mmm… Where’s your scythe?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I save it for special occasions. Special <i>business</i>
occasions.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So killing my granddaughter and her friends isn’t one?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Your granddaughter?” Azrail took a double-take of a look.
“Oh my. I do see the family resemblance. You know – Daria, if you’re not
careful, you might end-up like your grandfather Mathew…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah – a seven-headed dragon of Apocalypse that makes bets
with Death,” Daria said wryly. “I doubt that. I think this is pretty much a
one-person thing.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How’d you deduced that?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I found St. John’s on the internet,” Daria shrugged. “Now
how about bringing me and my buds back to life.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not until your grandfather admits that I was right!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not on your life!” Mathew roared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Grandpa, she’s <i>Death</i>. <i>Does</i> she have a life?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mathew snorted. “Good one kid.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Azrail glowered. “Oh yeah. She’s your granddaughter alright.
But seriously though. Admit that I was right or your granddaughter's <i>caput</i>!”
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mathew’s eyes began to glow. Azrail gulped and her already
nut-ivory-white skin began to become even paler. “Mathew. Oh no!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Grandpa! Don't do something that you will regret later!”
Daria spoke-up sharply. “Obviously the lady here feels something bad for you,
otherwise she wouldn't be so stubborn about this point.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Keep out of this, Daria!” Mathew Morgendorffer barked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Or what? You’ll blast me? I'm already dead, <i>hel-lo</i>!
You blast her, and I’m stuck in this fashion along with the others! And I'm not
happy with what you’ve done to Max and Nick there either.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mathew stared at his granddaughter. Daria defiantly stared
back. Then Mathew cracked a suspiciously Mona Lisa smile. He then turned back
to Azrail. “Very well. Sorry Azra… you were right. Happy now?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Now you know,” Azrail began, “there are ways of saying
things-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don't push it!” both Morgendorffers said at the same time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Right,” Azrail quickly nodded. “Okay. Mathew, since both of
us… did stuff, we’ve got to synch. Ready?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mmm-hmm.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The pair snapped their fingers together…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen opened her eyes. “What a positively bloody headache!
What did I do – hit my head on the wall?” She looked around. “Oh no – my
laptop!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was then Quinn came. “Mo-om, you broke my concentration!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Quinn – that yoga stuff – it’s a bunch of crock!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mo-om,” Quinn opened her mouth and closed. “What did you do
to your laptop?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don't ask,” Helen’s voice was low and dangerous, and Quinn
– who wasn't so stupid at all – caught it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Righty then. Want some orange drink? Got it in the fridge.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why not,” Helen shrugged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was then Jake Morgendorffer rushed-in, dishevelled and
wild in the eyes. “Excuse me Helen; got to go; lousy, no-good beer…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen and Quinn looked at each other. “What’s that all
about?” Quinn asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen frowned. “I don’t know, but let’s find out…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Uh, what a crazy dream I had,” Max groaned. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey, look – we’ve fixed the air conditioner!” perked-up
Nick. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Uh, Janey, Daria – was it just a dream or what?” Trent
asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Trent,” Daria sighed tiredly. “Do you really want to think
that we’ve been in some place called – what was is it called?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nock’ma’ar,” Jane said. “And Trent – I like to think that
it was all a big dream – the whole seven-headed dragon and ghouls bit, you
know?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Want to listen to my song?” Jesse spoke-up. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why not?” the others said, firmly putting their
dream-adventure behind them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
