<p>Roll Into. to Daria in "Herroner."
<p>ACT I.
<p>Fade In.
<p>Int. -- Ms. Li's Office. -- Day.<br>
<p>Ms. Li is sitting behind her desk, writing, as the phone rings.<br>
<center><p><b>Li</b></center><br> <blockquote>Yes? Oh, hello,
Superintendent Blank. (Beat.) Yes, I'm aware that our yearly squash
match with Oakwood is coming up. (Beat.) Yes, I know we need to
practice, but I've been so busy with these after-school disciplinary
proceedings-- (Beat.) Why, that's a great idea, sir. (Beat.) Yes, that
should free up plenty of time for practice. How about we meet at the
club daily for the next few weeks? That should give us enough time to
get ready to crush those jerks from Oakwood. I refuse to lose the bet
this year. Just give me until Friday to set this up. I have just the
teacher in mind for this.</blockquote>
<p>Int. -- Mr. DeMartino's Classroom. -- Later that Day.
<p>Mr. D. is leading an interesting discussion...
<center><p><b>DeMartino</b></center><br> <blockquote>Now, can
ANYONE tell us about how the early HISTORY of the Colonial United
States INFLUENCED the development of its system of JURISPRUDENCE?
(Beat.) Kevin?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Kevin</b></center><br> <blockquote>Uh...</blockquote>
<center><p><b>DeMartino</b></center><br> <blockquote>Never mind,
Kevin. It wasn't FAIR of me to call on you, as it's OBVIOUS you have
TOO FEW NEURONS left for me to recklessly ENDANGER them by asking you a
probing QUESTION. A QUESTION that in theory you would know the ANSWER
to if you would EVER bother to read the BOOK! (Calms down.) Now, who
can answer my question? (Beat. Sighs.) Daria?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <center><p>(Sighs.)</center><br> <blockquote>When
the original British colonists settled North America, they brough their
judicial system along with them-- a pre-literate anachronistic system
developed in the late Dark Ages to ensure that the rights of peasants
to own pigs could not be infringed upon, unless, of course, it wasn't
convenient at the time. Since we still live in a pre-literate society,
it's managed to retain some of its usefulness and charm.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>DeMartino</b></center><br> <blockquote>Thank you,
Daria. Now, Class, in order for us to LEARN more about how this
pre-literate judicial system works, Ms. Li has presented us with a
UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY to study it first hand. We will be establishing a
student court system to try violators of school rules. Yes, Daria?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Will the rich students be able to buy their way out?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>DeMartino</b></center><br> <blockquote>No.</blockquote>
<p>Daria turns to Jane.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>So much for making it an accurate simulation of the criminal justice system.</blockquote>
<p>Jane smirks back.
<p>Cut back to DeM.
<center><p><b>DeMartino</b></center><br> <blockquote>In order
to make the selection system as FAIR as possible, or at least as RANDOM
as any ELECTION, I've placed jobs for each of you on these slips of
paper. (Places slips of paper into a hat. Hands hat to Upchuck.) You
will be required to fulfill the duties of your position for the next
THREE weeks.</blockquote>
<p>Cut to Upchuck as he reads a slip of paper, leering at it.
<center><p><b>Upchuck</b></center><br> <blockquote>Judge Rrrrutheimer, at your serrrvice.</blockquote>
<p>Cut to Daria and Jane.
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>Those poor misbehaving cheerleaders. I guess he'll have to spank each and every one of them himself.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>He's such a noble and self-sacrificing soul.</blockquote>
<p>Cut to Mack and Jodie. Jodie grabs the hat, and sticks her hand in.
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <blockquote>I know what it says before I even take it out.</blockquote>
<p>Mack looks at Jodie and raises an eyebrow.
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <center><p>(Cont.)</center><br> <blockquote>(Shows paper to Mack without looking at it.) It says prosecutor, doesn't it?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Mack</b></center><br> <blockquote>Yep.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <blockquote>Why am I always the heavy? (Beat.) What did you get?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Mack</b></center><br> <blockquote>Defense counsel. (Passes hat to Kevin.)</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Kevin</b></center><br> <blockquote>Alright! Mack Daddy! We're on the same team!</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Mack</b></center><br> <blockquote>Don't call me that. You're on defense, too?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Kevin</b></center><br> <blockquote>Yeah, buuut...</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Mack</b></center><br> <blockquote>But what?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Kevin</b></center><br> <blockquote>How can I be on defense if I'm the QB? Shouldn't I be on offense instead?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Mack</b></center><br> <blockquote>There's no offense in court.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Kevin</b></center><br> <blockquote>How do you keep score then?</blockquote>
<p>Mack buries his head in his hands and groans.
<center><p><b>Mack</b></center><br> <blockquote>Why do I ever bother to ask? Why?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Brittany</b></center><br> <blockquote>Ooo! Assistant Prosecutor! We get to work together Jodie! Aren't you excited?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <blockquote>Oooh, yeah.</blockquote>
<p>Cut to Daria and Jane.
Jane grabs the hat.
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>C'mon,
executioner! (Pulls out slip. Shrugs.) Hmph. Bailiff. Close enough, I
guess. I wonder if they'll give me pair of handcuffs, or if I'll have
to use my own. And a billy club. I'd really like to have my own billy
club. (Passes hat to Daria.) Hey, maybe you'll luck into the job.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>I wish. (Pulls out slip.) Judge. (Beat.) Figures.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>Hey, that's almost as good. Besides, haven't you always wanted to sit in judgment of your fellow students?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Well, yeah, but
usually it's in more of a Final Judgment setting. You know, lake of
burning sulfur, that sort of thing. This is almost as good. It actually
might not suck. (Beat.) Too much.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>Hey, now, don't start getting all optimistic on me.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Oh, God. I just realized something.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>What?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>If my mother finds
out, she'll never let me hear the end of it. (Imitates Helen.) Oooh! A
judge! That's fascinating! (Normal voice.) Before you know it, she'll
start pushing me to do stuff like debate. It could get really ugly,
really fast.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>Well, you could always distract her by telling her how much you'd love to start playing the flute again.</blockquote>
<p>Daria shoots Jane a dirty look.
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br><center><p>(Cont.)</center><br><blockquote>Hey, just tryin' to help. </blockquote>
<p>Int. -- Mr. O'Neill's Classroom. -- Same Day.
<p>Quinn and Stacy are seated in the back, whispering to each other as Mr. O'Neill is in the middle of a lecture.
<center><p><b>O'Neill</b></center><br> <blockquote>Well, class,
this has been such a stimulating week of discussion that I'd like to
see what you've learned from listening to your fellow classmates. So,
clear your desks, get out a sheet of paper, and let's have a little
quiz!</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br><center><p>(To herself.)</center><br><blockquote>Oh, no! I didn't even read the stupid book!</blockquote>
<center><p><b>O'Neill</b></center><br> <blockquote>Okay, now I want you to tell me the names of three characters you identified with, and why.</blockquote>
<p>The other students, Stacy included, start writing. Quinn stares at
her paper with a look of dismay. She writes her name on it, then stops
and stares at the blank page.
<p>Cut to a shot of the clock. The second hand is moving.
<p>Cut back to a shot of Quinn. She's getting even more nervous. She starts tapping her pen.
<p>Cut back to a closer shot of the clock. As the second hand is moving, you can hear it ticking louder and louder.
<p>Cut back to CU of Quinn.
<p>Cut to WS of Mr. O'Neill, POV Quinn. Quinn looks up at Mr. O'Neill, who is sitting at his desk, writing something.
<p>Cut back to MS of Quinn. She looks around briefly, and slowly
starts to lean towards Stacy's paper, just as Mr. O'Neill looks up from
his writing. Mr. O'Neill looks at Quinn, and a pained expression
crosses his face.
<p>Int. -- Mr. O'Neill's Classroom. -- 10 minutes later.
<center><p><b>O'Neill</b></center><br> <blockquote>Okay, class, hand in your papers. (Bell rings.) Uh, Quinn, I'd like to see you for a minute after class.</blockquote>
<p>As the students file out, Quinn approaches Mr. O'Neill's desk.
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote>You wanted to see me?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>O'Neill</b></center><br> <blockquote>Quinn, I'm
afraid I have some bad news. During the quiz, I noticed that you were
leaning over towards Stacy and, sadly, looking at her paper. Now I
understand that you're under a lot of pressure these days--</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote>I am!</blockquote>
<center><p><b>O'Neill</b></center><br> <blockquote>but I can't let you neglect your studies like this. I'm afraid that I can't ignore this.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote>Why can't you just give me an F?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>O'Neill</b></center><br> <blockquote>I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to refer this to the new Student Court.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote>But I'm <i>popular!</i></blockquote>
<center><p><b>O'Neill</b></center><br> <blockquote>I'm sorry,
Quinn. The school has a clear policy against cheating. And when we
cheat, aren't we truly only cheating ourselves? Believe me, I hate
having to do this more than you do-- but it's for your own good. You've
got to learn to establish boundaries.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <center><p>(Disgusted.)</center><br><blockquote>Have you been talking to my mother again?</blockquote>
<p>Int. -- Mr. DeMartino's Classroom -- Next Day.
<p>Ms Li is giving the future jurists a lecture...
<center><p><b>Li</b></center><br> <blockquote>Now, as members
of the Student Court, your duty is to make sure that justice is served
for the guilty-- I mean, accused, and make sure that they are punished
accordingly.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Upchuck</b></center><br> <blockquote>Rrrowr!</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Li</b></center><br> <blockquote>And that brings me to
another point-- I expect everyone, especially you judges, to make sure
you don't abuse your positions. I'll review your decisions in a few
weeks, and if I see anything that looks suspicious, you can count on me
to handle it appropriately.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>What if they aren't guilty?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Li</b></center><br> <center><p>(Laughs and snorts.)</center><br> <blockquote>Please,
Ms. Morgendorffer, they wouldn't be here if they weren't guilty. Now,
if you'll excuse me, I have a very important squa-- uh, meeting to
attend to.</blockquote>
<p>Ms. Li walks out of the room.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Well, now, this seems more like the criminal justice system we all know and love.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>What did you expect?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>I dunno, I guess
some little remnant of idealism managed to evade containment, and
allowed me to hope that not everything we're taught has a basis in
hypocrisy.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>Daria, this is the US. Hypocrisy is one of the building blocks of our entire culture-- we couldn't function without it.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>I know, silly me.</blockquote>
<p>Mr. DeMartino walks in.
<center><p><b>DeMartino</b></center><br> <blockquote>Now, I
have the SCHEDULE for the week's court sessions. Daria, you start
hearing cases tomorrow. Charles, you start on Thursday. Now, while it's
not REQUIRED, I'd recommend that you FAMILIARIZE yourself with some of
the priniciples of criminal PROCEDURE, if not for your OWN edification,
then at least for the benefit of your poor CLASSMATES. And if THAT'S
too much for you, then you can ALWAYS use this. (Hands them a pamphlet.)</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>"The Bill of Rights, Your Grenade Launcher, and You, brought to you by your local NRA" Great. This'll really be helpful.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>It's nice to know that Ms. Li has been accepting donations of books again.</blockquote>

<p>Int. -- A Classroom at LHS -- Next Day.
<p>The various accused students are seated in the back of the room
in folding chairs. Two tables have been set up in the front of the
room, facing the (now vacant) teacher's desk. Jodie and Brittany are
seated at one table, and Kevin and Mack are seated at the other. Jane
is standing by the door with an evil smirk on her face as she spots
Quinn in the crowd. Jane also has a pair of handcuffs hanging casually
from her belt.
<p>Cut to outside the door. Daria is standing outside of the door,
wearing a black robe, and not looking very comfortable in it at all.
Jane opens the door slightly so she can talk to her.
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>Ready to go, your Honor?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>No, but I guess that won't stop you now, will it?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>Well, if it makes you feel any better, you do look good in black.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Thanks a lot.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>Relax, you'll do fine. Just remember, <i>you're</i> not the one on trial.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>I'll try to keep that in mind. (Sighs.)  I guess we might as well start the show.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>Oh, by the way, I guess I ought to warn you-- there's a surprise defendant in the audience. Don't let it throw you off.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Really? Who?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>Now, now, be patient.  You'll see in just a second.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Okay, okay, let's get this started, Rusty.</blockquote>
<p>Cut back to original view of room from the back.
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>All rise. Oyez, oyez! The Student Court of Lawndale High School is now in session, Judge Daria Morgendorffer presiding.</blockquote>
<p>The students all rise as Daria walks into the room in her robe and combat boots, of course.
<p>Cut to XCU of Quinn. The look of shock and horror on her face is priceless. (Or would be, if you could see it.)
<p>As Daria walks into the room, she looks over at Quinn and smiles-- a great big smile.
<p>FADE OUT. END ACT I. Run Bumper Music during SLO-MO of Quinn turning to see Daria and that look of shock and horror on her face.
<p>COMMERCIAL BREAK.

<p>ACT II.
<p>FADE IN.
<p>Int. -- A Classroom at LHS -- Same Day. No time has elapsed.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Be seated. Okay, let's hear the first case. Prosecution?</blockquote>
<p>Jodie grabs the first folder off of the top of her stack.
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <blockquote>The school calls the case of Lawndale High v. #030883923.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <center><p>(To Jane in an undertone.)</center><blockquote>Did I miss something? When did we all become numbers?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>I think it was
right before we had the radio transmitters installed in our back
molars. It's an anonymity thing for the student involved. They call em
out by SSN.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Ah. Well, now I know why that number sounds familiar. (To Quinn.) Well, number 030883923, are you coming or not?</blockquote>
<p>Quinn, who is obviously a bit stunned, walks to the defense table. Jodie looks over at Quinn, and her eyebrows shoot up.
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <blockquote>Your honor, can we have a sidebar? (Beat.) Now?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <center><p>(Still Highly Amused.)</center><blockquote>I don't see why not. (To Kevin.) Defense, would you join us?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Kevin</b></center><br> <blockquote>Where?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Mack</b></center><br> <center><p>(To Kevin.)</center><blockquote>At the sidebar.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Kevin</b></center><br> <blockquote>She's taking us to a bar? Cool! I didn't even know she had a fake ID!</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote>Shut up, Kevin. I'll go by myself.</blockquote>
<p>Quinn walks past Kevin and Mack, and meets with Jodie and Daria.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Okay, prosecution, what is it?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <blockquote>Your honor, don't you think that you ought to recuse yourself?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Why?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <blockquote>Well, don't you think that there's a conflict of interest here?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote>Oh, yes, there most certainly is.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>So, does the defendant wish to have a different judge?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote>Oh, yes, the defendant most certainly does.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Well then, I'm sure that Judge Ruttheimer would just <i>love</i> to have you in his courtroom. Shall I schedule your hearing for tomorrow?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote>Uh, never mind.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <blockquote>Are you sure, Quinn?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote>Are you kidding? At least this way I have a chance to save some shred of dignity.</blockquote>
<p>Jane leans over to Daria
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <center><p>(Whispers to Daria.)</center><blockquote>I wouldn't bet on that.</blockquote>
<p>Daria smiles serenely.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Okay, then, let's prepare for a trial in one week from today.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote>Aren't you forgetting something, your honor?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Oh, is there a sale scheduled for that day?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote>The <i>charges</i>?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Oh, yeah. Well, prosecutor, what'd she do?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote><i>Allegedly</i> do.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Wow, Quinn, I am
impressed. Have you been going through mom's briefcase again? You know
she doesn't keep the platinum card there anymore.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote>I've sat through almost as many of those stupid family court sessions as you have. I guess it must rub off or something.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <blockquote>The charge is looking on another student's paper during a pop quiz.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Who was the other student involved?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <blockquote>Stacy Rowe.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Stacy, Quinn? I'm
disappointed. If you're going to cheat, you should at least cheat off
of someone who has a clue. Was Ms. Rowe also charged, counsellor?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <center><p>(Consults her notes.)</center><blockquote>No, your honor, she was unaware.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>No surprise there.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Well, at least that saves us another trial. So, who's the complaining witness?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <blockquote>Mr. O'Neill.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Mr. O'Neill? Hm.
Okay, counsellors, prepare for a trial, Wednesday afternoon. And let me
remind all of you that these proceedings are to be kept strictly
confidential.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Kevin</b></center><br> <blockquote>Huh?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Mack</b></center><br> <blockquote>She means that you're not allowed to talk about the case to anybody.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Kevin</b></center><br> <blockquote>How are we supposed to prepare, then?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <center><p>(To Mack and Kevin.)</center><blockquote>Good luck, counsellors, I think you may need it.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Kevin</b></center><br> <center><p>(Looks around confusedly.)</center><blockquote>Why does she keep talking about counselors? Mrs. Manson isn't here, is she?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Mack</b></center><br> <blockquote>She meant-- never
mind. Thanks, your honor. I think we're going to need it. (Looks over
at Jodie.) Are we ever going to need it.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <center><p>(Bangs her gavel.)</center><blockquote>Okay, next case.</blockquote>
<p>Int. -- Morgendorffer Home Base -- Daria's Room -- That Evening.
<p>Daria is laying down on her bed, reading <i>Crime and Punishment</i>. Someone knocks at the door.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Pirhana feeding is tomorrow. You're early </blockquote>
<p>Quinn opens the door.
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote>What are you talking about? </blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Never mind. What do you want? </blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote>I've been thinking. </blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Congratulations. Does mom know? </blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote>Don't interrupt. I've been thinking that you hearing my case isn't the best idea. </blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>And you think that Upchuck hearing it is better? I'm sure he'd <i>love</i> to punish you in his own special way.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote>Well, isn't it obvious? </blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Isn't what obvious? That O'Neill caught you looking at Stacy's paper? </blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote>See what I mean?
You're already biased against me. You're always complaining that people
aren't fair to you, but you're not being fair to me, just because you
don't like me. </blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Quinn, why ever would you think that your <i>cousin</i>
would be biased against you? (Quinn gives her a dirty look. Daria
sighs.) Okay, look, Quinn, I might be joking a little about your
predicament, but you can believe me that I take the whole thing very
seriously. Believe it or not, I <i>am</i> trying to look out for your
best interests-- you just may not approve of the way that I'm doing it.
You have my promise that I will listen to your case and give you a fair
and just hearing. (Beat.) But if the evidence shows that you cheated,
I'll find you guilty, and no amount of eyelash fluttering or money will
change my mind. Now, you may get off in Ruttheimer's court with just a
spanking, but remember, Ms. Li is going to review all of our decisions
in a few weeks, anyway, so you'd be back at square one, and you'd still
have lost some pride. </blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote>Okay, okay, you're still on the case, just one condition-- not a word to mom. </blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Okay, but on one condition-- not a word to mom about my sudden rise to judicial status, either. </blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote>Deal. </blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Deal. (Quinn walks
to the door.) Oh, and Quinn? (Quinn pauses at the door.) Do yourself a
favor right away and fire Kevin as your defense counsel.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote>Don't worry-- I was already planning to fire Kevin after I got done talking to you. </blockquote>

<p>Int. -- Lawndale High School -- Hallway -- Morning -- A day or two later.
<p>As Quinn and her F.C. friends are talking, Daria and Jane approach from behind Quinn, unnoticed.
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br><blockquote>I'm sorry Sandi, but I can't make that outing to Cashman's next week, I, uh, have some business to attend to.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Sandi</b></center><br><blockquote>Really? Whatever
could keep you from the Pre End of Early Mid Spring Closeout Sale?
You're not doing something like quiz bowl, are you?</blockquote>
<p>Quinn shudders.
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br><center><p>(Grossed out.)</center><br><blockquote>Eww, no! Sandi, how could you even <i>think</i> I could do such a thing? (Beat. Offhand tone.) No, I just have to take care of some nagging little business.</blockquote>
<p>At this point, Daria and Jane stop at a safe eavesdropping distance and listen.
<center><p><b>Sandi</b></center><br><blockquote>What sort of business do you have to attend to?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br><blockquote>Oh, it's nothing I
can't get out of-- it's, well, I got roped into some stupid school
stuff just for the one day, I promise. (Shrugs.) You know how it is
here. What can I say, I'm just popular.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Sandi</b></center><br><center><p>(Suspiciously.)</center><br><blockquote>Okay,
but I don't want you to start making a habit out of this sort of thing.
It could seriously interfere with your more important activities, like
keeping your wardrobe current. (Beat.) And you of all people should
know the importance of <i>that</i>.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br><blockquote>Don't worry, I know my priorities, Sandi.</blockquote>
<p>Daria glowers at Quinn, who doesn't see her. PAN and ZOOM away from Quinn to Daria and Jane.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><center><p>(Bitter.)</center><br><blockquote>And here I was thinking that I was going to go easy on her.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br><blockquote>Yeah, but are you sure you really want to interfere with her shopping? It does give you one benefit, you know.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>And that is...?</blockquote>
<p>Jane shrugs.
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br><blockquote>It keeps her out of the house.</blockquote>
<p>As Daria and Jane turn around a corner, Quinn spots them and tries to get close enough to eavesdrop as well.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Well, if she thinks she can sweet-talk her way out of this one, she's got a nasty surprise awaiting her.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br><blockquote>You're gonna go hard on her?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Well, somebody has to. She's been coddled <i>way</i>
too long. Mom hasn't been able to impress upon her cute little mind
that she can't keep skating through life without taking responsibility
for her actions. (Beat. Sighs.) I guess it falls on me to bring her
back down to earth. Again.</blockquote>
<p>Quinn looks frustrated and walks off.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><center><p>(Cont.)</center><br><blockquote>It's just that like it or not, she <i>is</i> my sister, and I can't just let her wind up as a cocktail waitress, no matter how it might amuse me short-term.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br><blockquote>Wow, you really <i>are</i> worried about her.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>I know, sick isn't it?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br><blockquote>And the best way you can show her you care is to bring her little world crashing down around her. (Beat.) Boy, she's gonna <i>love</i> you.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Mmmph.</blockquote>

<p>Int. -- Daria's Room -- A few days later.
<p>Daria and Jane are sitting down on the bed, watching SSW.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>What a day. I'm exhausted.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>Me, too. My feet hurt from standing for so long.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>My brain hurts from having to hear all of those miserable cases.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>Aw, c'mon, don't you get just a little rush from the power?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>No, just a
headache from all the responsibility. I know one thing's for sure-- I'm
going to have to do some more research if I'm going to get this done
right.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>SSW Announcer</b></center> <blockquote>He showed up in court with his briefs, but left his boxers at home! The nudist jurisprudist, next! On Sick Sad World!</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>Man, I hate reruns. Let's finish that game of Warrior King we started the other night.</blockquote>
<p>Daria shuts off the TV, and she and Jane head over to the computer.
Daria sits at the screen, clicks the mouse a few times, and frowns.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Hm, it seems that I've managed to capture a spy in my own household. </blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>Really? Well, that explains how the barbarians have been managing to know exactly where to pillage.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Well, now that I've captured that spy, it's time to find out who she really is.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>Wow, looks like the traitor is your very own sister.</blockquote>
<p>Cut to MS of Daria's Door from the hallway. It's slightly ajar.
Quinn walks up to the door, but decides to eavesdrop before knocking.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Well, sister or not, she must be dealt with accordingly.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>What're you going to do?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>I don't know. Any suggestions?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>Well, you could
always make an example out of her-- something to make others think
before they try to flout your laws. Hmm, let's see... What are your
options?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>According to this, I can let her go, have her publicly humiliated, or beheaded.</blockquote>
<p>Quinn blanches.
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>Beheaded? Really?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>No, I was kidding. Besides, it'd make me look bad if I had my own sister beheaded. I'll just go for public humiliation.</blockquote>
<p>Quinn runs from the door.
<p>Cut back to MS of Daria and Jane at the Computer.
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>Hm. Looks like it improved your standing with your ring-thanes. Maybe they won't overthrow you for a while now.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Well, if they do, we can always find out just <i>how</i> sqeamish the game designers were. I still have my two-handed battleaxe, and it's still <i>really</i> sharp.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br><blockquote>Yeah, I guess it's tough to overthrow a king when you're in a thousand little pieces.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Well, if they won't support the Clan MacMorgendorffer, then they can always join the Clan McNugget.</blockquote>

<p>Int. -- Sedimentary Rock Country Club -- Indoor Tennis and Squash Courts. -- Same Afternoon.
<p>Jodie is walking off of one of the courts, having just finished
returning a bunch of auto-serves. She grabs her towel, and walks into
the corridor of the indoor complex, heading for the exit. As she walks
up the stairs, she looks down into one of the squash courts and sees
Ms. Li and Supt. Blank playing a very intense squash game. She makes
sure that nobody's around, and gets a little closer to the wall in the
hope of hearing something.
<center><p><b>Li</b></center><br> <center><p> (Punctuated with grunts as she hits the ball.) </center><br> <blockquote>
Herman, you're a genius. By dumping those boring disciplinary hearings
on that silly Student Court, I can free up at least 8 hours a week for
practice. </blockquote>
<center><p><b>Blank</b></center><br> <center><p> (Punctuated with grunts as he hits the ball.) </center><br> <blockquote>
Well, Angela, it's imperative that we win the bet with Oakwood this
year. I refuse to let Tish and Fred win the damn bet again. I could
really use the money this year. Besides, it's a win-win for all of us--
we humiliate Oakwood and win the bet, and the students get to feel
empowered. </blockquote>
<center><p><b>Li</b></center><br> <blockquote> Unless, of course, I have to reverse their decisions.</blockquote>
<p>Both chuckle. Jodie scowls, and walks out of the building.
<p>Int. -- Morgendorffer Family Room -- Later That Day.
<p>Daria is reading a book on criminal procedure that is apparently
so riveting that she's started to nod off. Helen walks in and closes
the door.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Hm? What? I'm up!</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <blockquote>Hi sweetie! Have a good day?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Mom, aren't you home a little early? It's still daylight.</blockquote>
<p>Daria fumbles for a second to try to hide the book, but it's too late. Helen sees the book, and raises her eyebrows.
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <blockquote>Crim Pro? Is one of your friends in trouble again? </blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Would you believe that I'm having trouble sleeping again?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <blockquote>Daria, no insomnia could be <i>that</i> bad.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <center><p>(Sighs.)</center><br> <blockquote>Okay, okay, it's for a class.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <blockquote>Really? What for?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>We're studying the criminal justice system, and I figured this would help.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <blockquote>You need a criminal procedure hornbook for one of your classes? That's a bit odd.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Okay, okay, Ms. Li created a Student Court, and I got stuck being a judge.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <blockquote>A judge? Congratulations, dear!</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>It's no big deal, mom. It's only for the next couple of weeks. Don't think I've suddenly gotten the urge to practice law.</blockquote>
<p>Helen sighs.
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <blockquote>Well, a mother can dream, can't she? (Daria gives her a look that says "Dream all you want.") Do you know how I got that book?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Um, I'm guessing that it wasn't at the bookstore, was it?</blockquote>
<p>Helen sighs nostalgically.
<p>Cross Fade to: (with harp music, of course)
<p>Int. -- Middleton Law School -- 1974.
<p>A young Helen Barksdale is sitting in a sea of fresh young
faces--most of which are male. Meanwhile, prehistoric Professor Barney
Smith enters the classroom-- he looks like he's straight out of "Paper
Chase," wearing a rumpled tweed suit with vest, bowtie, and a sullen,
sour expression.
<center><p><b>Prof. Barney Smith</b></center><br> <blockquote>Now,
let's not waste any time. On to today's lesson, which will continue our
discussion about the right to counsel in state courts. Yesterday, we
discussed the rationale behind the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Betts v. Brady</i>. Now, let us move on to <i>Gideon v. Wainwright</i>. Miss Barksdale, tell us all about it.</blockquote>
<p>Cut to a shot of Helen, who looks surprised-- nay, frozen in the headlights.
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <blockquote>Uhm, uh.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Prof. Barney Smith</b></center><br> <blockquote>What's wrong, girl, cat got your tongue? Or are you just too lazy to prepare for class like a serious student?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <center><p>(OS.)</center><br> <blockquote>I
was petrified-- I knew the case cold, but for some reason, I couldn't
speak. It was the first time I'd ever been called on in law school, and
I had no idea how to react.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Prof. Barney Smith</b></center><br> <center><p>(In a very nasty tone.)</center> <blockquote>If
you can't find your voice Miss Barksdale, might I suggest that you find
something more useful to do with your time, like maybe finding yourself
a rich husband and having a few babies? Because you are obviously <i>squandering</i> a valuable position in the class that some other more deserving student could better use.</blockquote>
<p>Cut back to shot of Helen. It's a slow XCU of her-- she looks
completely mortified-- the other students are grinning, albeit
nervously.
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <center><p>(OS.)</center><br> <blockquote>It was awful. That old bastard had humiliated me in front of <i>everyone</i> in my class. Until then, I'd never felt so small in my entire life. But I got even. (Beat.) Boy, did I get even.</blockquote>
<p>Int. -- Helen and Jake's Pad -- 1974.
<p>Helen is sitting at a rickety kitchen table, studying like a
demon, while Jake is cooking something in a large stew pot. Time
passes. The clock shows 1:00, and it's dark outside. Jake is nowhere to
be found.
<p>Cut to a shot of Helen studying in the law library.
<p>Cut to a shot of Helen studying while Jake is driving the car. She's getting circles under her eyes from all the work.
<p>Cut to a shot of Jake reading Helen flash cards about various cases in a grocery store checkout line.
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <center><p>(OS.)</center><br> <blockquote>I
studied like I'd never studied before. I studied at all hours. Why,
your father even helped me when he wasn't studying for his MBA. But it
was all worth it.</blockquote>
<p>Int. -- Law School -- A Few Months Later (Spring 1975).
<p>Professor Barney Smith is at the podium, about to present the book award for Criminal Procedure.
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <center><p>(OS.)</center><br> <center><p>(Cont.)</center><br> <blockquote>When finals were done, it was time for the book awards for top grades in each class.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Prof. Barney Smith</b></center><br> <blockquote>And
the book award for Criminal Procedure goes to-- (Beat.) (His face turns
beet red, and looks as if a vessel is about to burst.) To-- (He just
looks at Helen in angry disbelief.)</blockquote>
<p>Cut to a shot of Helen, standing up in the audience with an satisfied smile on her face.
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <center><p>(In the more agressive manner of hers we're now familiar with.)</center><blockquote>Helen
Barksdale, I believe. (The professor shoots her a look of pure hatred.
Since he doesn't say it's not her, Helen walks up to the stage to get
her award, shakes his hand, and takes the book from him as he just
looks on in angry stunned disbelief.)</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <center><p>(Cont.)</center><br> <blockquote>Really,
Professor, if you have such difficulty with public speaking, maybe you
should consider finding yourself a rich wife and giving your position
on the faculty to someone more deserving.</blockquote>
<p>Cut Back to the present-day Morgendorffer house. Helen and Daria are
seated on the couch. Daria looks slightly surprised at her mother.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>You didn't really say that to him, did you?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <center><p>(In her aggressive tone.)</center><br> <blockquote>You
bet your sweet-- (Sweetens her tone.) um, of course I did. Learning to
deal with that awful old mysogenistic fossil taught me a lot about
standing up for myself, and fighting for what I believe in. Of course,
I'd've never admitted to anyone that that old jerk taught me anything,
but he taught me quite a lot, actually.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>But didn't you always stand up for what you believe in?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <blockquote>Oh, that was just
showing off in front of my friends. It's easy to talk a good game
around your friends, Daria, but to actually stand up for yourself
against people with power over you? Now that takes courage-- courage I
didn't even know I had until I needed it, and courage I hope to see in
both you and your sister someday.</blockquote>
<p>Cut to CU Daria. She looks away from Helen.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Mmm.</blockquote>
<p>Int. -- Morgendorffer House -- Later That Evening.
<p>As usual, the family is seated at one of their dysfunctional dinners. The phone rings.
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <blockquote> Helloo! (Beat.) Oh, yes, she's right here. Daria, it's Jodie. </blockquote>
<p>Quinn arches an eyebrow, but says nothing. Daria looks at her, shugs, and grabs the phone.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote> Jodie? Hang on a sec-- let me take this upstairs. </blockquote>
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <blockquote> Now that's odd. She doesn't usually take the phone upstairs. Do you know anything about it, Quinn?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote> Um... no. Should I?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <blockquote> Well, I was just wondering. Never mind.</blockquote>
<p>Quinn breathes a sigh of relief.
<p>Int. -- Daria's Room -- A minute later.
<p>Daria walks in the room and closes the door behind her.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote> Okay, what's up? </blockquote>
<p>Daria sits on the edge of her bed. Slide in a split screen of Jodie in her bedroom. (Naturally, it's full of trophies.)
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <blockquote> You'll never believe what I saw this afternoon at the club. </blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote> The masses forcing their way in to take their rightful place at the putting green? </blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <blockquote> No, worse. I saw Ms. Li and Supt. Blank playing squash. </blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote> Mmm-hmm. And this is suspicious because...? </blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <blockquote> Don't you see? She created the whole Student Court thing as a way to dump her job on us. We do her job, <i>and</i> get stuck playing the heavy. </blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote> I'll admit that that sucks, but why should that surprise you?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <blockquote> Yes, but they
have some sort of big game with some people from Oakwood. Apparently
this is a big enough deal that they have some sort of under-the-table
big money bet going. Now can you see why I'm furious?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote> Now I do. I don't suppose there's any way we can foil her evil plan? </blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <blockquote> I was hoping that you had an idea. </blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote> Sorry, fresh out.
Either way, we're screwed. If we let everyone off, she'll just take the
extra time to punish them all herself, and then probably go after us.
If we don't let everyone off, then she still wins-- we look like the
bad guys, and she comes out smelling like a rose. And extortion by
itself won't quite be enough of a lever against her. Damn. This lesson
in the criminal justice system is getting more and more realistic every
hour. Hm. (Beat.) Wait a sec-- let me look something up real quick.
(Daria grabs the Crim Pro book and starts leafing through it.) Ha!
We've got her, Jodie, and there won't be a thing she can do to stop us.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <blockquote>Really? How?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <center><p>(Chuckles to herself.)</center><br> <blockquote>Oh, this is <i>too</i> good. Have you ever heard of something called a deferred prosecution?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <blockquote>No, what is it?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>It's simple. The
defendant agrees to some sort of punishment-- you know, like washing
garbage cans, or something equally unpleasant, like fundraising.
Meanwhile, you as the prosecution agree to drop the charges upon
completion of the tasks. It's a win-win scenario-- evildoers are
punished, but their records remain clean, except for one thing.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <blockquote>Let me guess-- after Ms. Li's squash match, she can just go ahead and prosecute anyway.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Yeah. Such
double-dipping would never be allowed in a real court, but since this
is her kangaroo court, she can do whatever she wants. But I think we've
got a way around even that.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <blockquote>Really?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Yeah, don't worry about it.</blockquote>
<p>FADE OUT. END ACT II. SLO-MO of Quinn walking into Daria's Room, as
Daria is reading "Crime and Punishment" on her bed. RUN BUMPER MUSIC.
<p>ACT III.
<p>FADE IN.
<p>Int. -- Quinn's Room -- Later That Night.
<p>Quinn is tossing and turning in her sleep.
<p>Cross Fade to:
<p>Ext. -- A Square In Paris -- Day -- 1789.
<p>Quinn is standing inside of a rickety cart being pulled by two
mules. She's wearing one of those country milkmaid sort of outfits from
the period. She's holding on to the sides of the cart for dear life.
Surrounding her is an armed guard -- they're keeping the angry mob away
from her. The mob is interestingly enough composed of a number of
familiar faces from Lawndale.
<center><p><b>Mob</b></center><br> <blockquote>Cheater! Cheater! Death to the cheater! Off with her head!</blockquote>
<p>Quinn is terrified of the crowd, and is horrified by their attitude
towards her as the rickety cart heads around the corner to the next
square, where a large guillotine sits. Sandi, Stacy and Tiffany stand
next to it, dressed in their Revolutionary finest. A not-too-mysterious
executioner wears glasses and a black hood. The mob is still yelling.
<center><p><b>Sandi</b></center><br> <blockquote>Shush! (The
mob quiets down.) (Beat.) Now, the Revolutionary Committe on
Infractions has met, and found that Quinn Morgendorffer is guilty of
cheating. (The mob roars.) I said shush! (Beat.) Now, we all know what
the punishment for cheating is, don't we? (The mob roars.)</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <center><p>(Grins as she lifts her hood.)</center><blockquote>Don't worry Quinn, it's nothing to lose your head over.</blockquote>
<p>Daria pulls the handle of the guillotine, and the blade falls and chops a melon in two. She grins evilly at Quinn.
<p> Cut to XCU of a horrified Quinn, mouth agape.
<p>Int. -- Quinn's Room -- No time has passed.
<p>Quinn shoots up out of bed and gasps.

<p>Int. -- Quinn's Room. -- Afternoon. The Next Day.
<p>Quinn is sitting on the bed, leafing through the latest "Waif."
She looks very depressed, for Quinn. Daria enters the room through the
open door.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Well, I'm glad to see that you're preparing for your defense as well as you prepare for class.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <center><p>(Sullenly.)</center><blockquote>What's the use? You're just going to have me humiliated no matter what I do.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>What <i>are</i> you blathering about?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote>I overheard you
talking to your little friend the other day-- you were talking about
humiliating your sister, and then that night you snuck off to talk to
Jodie. What else could you be planning, besides my total and utter
humiliation? </blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <center><p>(Sighs.)</center> <blockquote>Quinn,
you do know that the world doesn't revolve around you, don't you? Jane
and I were finishing up some cheesy computer game, and Jodie needed my
advice on handling her caseload-- something that <i>you</i> may stand to benefit from, if you'd stop acting so paranoid. I <i>told</i> you I'd give you a fair trial, and I meant it.</blockquote>
<p>Quinn grimaces.
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br><blockquote>That doesn't
explain why you told your little friend that you were going to go hard
on me, since apparently mom coddles me too much.</blockquote>
<p>Daria grimaces as she figures out that Quinn overheard her.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br><blockquote>Well, maybe I
was a little peeved at hearing about your number one priority-- keeping
your wardrobe current at the expense of your future.</blockquote>
<p>Quinn's jaw drops a little as she realizes that Daria overheard her discussion.

<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote>Okay, so why are you here now?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Jodie's offering you a deal, called deferred prosecution.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <center><p>(Her eyes narrow.)</center><blockquote>What <i>kind</i> of a deal is this?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>It's a deal that keeps your record clean if you agree to a punishment of sorts.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote>What <i>kind</i> of punishment?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Community service,
8 hours. When you complete it, the charges will be dropped. I'll give
you a list to choose from at the hearing. It'll even give you an alibi
for mom and dad.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br><center><p>(Suspiciously.)</center><br> <blockquote>Really?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Yeah, you can tell them that you feel like "giving back" to the school.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote>Hmm... (Beat.) Okay. What's the catch?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Other than the
work? Only one-- screw up again like that, and the old charges get
reinstated, along with any new ones. And you can bet that you won't get
a judge-- you'll have to deal with Ms. Li. And I doubt that she'll care
<i>how</i> popular you are.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote>That's the only catch? Okay, fine. But one question. Why are you doing this for me?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>I'm not doing anything for you.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote>Yeah, right. C'mon, Daria, this idea reeks of you. What's really going on?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <center><p>(Sighs.)</center><blockquote>Okay,
look, Quinn, you're almost done with your sophomore year. That gives
you two years to get your act together so you may wind up actually
doing something besides dancing for strange men after high school. It's
going to be hard enough for you to pull up your grades, but a mark on
your record for cheating could totally ruin your chances of getting
into any kind of school, let alone college. I know <i>you</i> may not believe it, but I'm worried about you. I <i>am</i> your sister, after all.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote>Oh, please. Don't give me that. You sound just like Mr. O'Neill.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Apparently you
didn't overhear the whole conversation I had with Jane, then. I'm
serious, Quinn. You've got to start thinking about what you want to do
with your life after high school. Even though it sometimes seems like
it, it won't last forever, you know.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote>I know.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Okay, so what do
plan to do after you graduate, and Joey, Jeffy, and Jamie all move on
to stalk college students while you stay here and flip burgers? Or
worse?</blockquote>
<p>Quinn looks down and starts fiddling with the fringe of her bedspread.
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <center><p>(In a small voice.)</center><blockquote>I don't know.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Can I make a suggestion?</blockquote>
<p>Quinn shrugs.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <center><p>(Cont.)</center><blockquote>Start thinking about what you <i>really</i>
want out of life. I'm not talking about money, power, or prestige,
because there aren't very many easy or legal ways to get them. Think
about what makes you <i>happy.</i> (Beat. Smiles a little.) You know,
like a half-off sale at Cashman's kind of happy. (Beat.) You know,
Quinn, you're not stupid. You could make it into college if you really
wanted to.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <center><p>(Smiles sheepishly.)</center><blockquote>Thanks.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>But don't delude
yourself. You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you, and sitting
around reading "Waif" isn't going to get it done.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Quinn</b></center><br> <blockquote>I guess. (Beat.) What about my friends?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>What about them?
What are they doing to help you get your life on track? (Beat.) If
they're really your friends, then they'll support you. And if that
doesn't work, just keep it a secret from them. Just imagine the look on
Sandi's face when she finds out you got into a better college than she
did.</blockquote>
<p>Quinn smiles wickedly.

<p>Int. -- Lawndale High School -- Mr. DeMartino's Classroom/Courtroom -- Afternoon. -- The next day.
<p>Daria is seated behind the desk in her judicial robe.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Okay, let's get this show on the road. First case, prosecution?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <blockquote>The school calls the case of Lawndale High v. #030883923.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Defense?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Mack</b></center><br> <blockquote>We're ready, your Honor.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <blockquote>In this case, the
school is willing to consent to a deferred prosecution, contingent upon
completion of 8 hours of approved community service.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Defense?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Mack</b></center><br> <blockquote>The defense has consented to the prosecution's offer.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Alright then,
defense, here are your options. You can either pick up trash after
football games for the next four weeks, fundraise for the band for two
weeks, or work the AV cart for a day.</blockquote>
<p>Quinn leans over to Mack and whispers in his ear.
<center><p><b>Mack</b></center><br> <blockquote>The defendant agrees to pick up trash after the next four home football games.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>I thought as much. Alright, would both parties please come forward and sign the agreement?</blockquote>

<p>Int. -- Lawndale High School -- Ms. Li's Office -- The next day.
<p>Ms. Li is seated behind her desk, reading through a folder. Someone knocks at the door.
<center><p><b>Li</b></center><br> <blockquote>Come in! Ah, Ms. Morgendorffer, Ms. Landon, have a seat.</blockquote>
<p>Jodie and Daria enter, and take seats opposite Ms. Li's desk.
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>You wanted to see us?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Li</b></center><br> <center><p>(Looks at the folder and frowns.)</center> <blockquote>Yes,
I've been reviewing your records from the student court, and I must say
that I'm rather perplexed. What is this "DP" I see in almost all of the
verdicts?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>The prosecution offered deferred prosecution in a few cases. Most of the students took them up on it.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Li</b></center><br> <blockquote>Did I not tell all of you that I wanted to see justice carried out? We cannot allow rulebreakers and scofflaws to go unpunished!</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <blockquote>But they did get
punished. They agreed to reasonable punishments in exchange for keeping
their records clean. What's wrong with that? </blockquote>
<center><p><b>Li</b></center><br> <blockquote>Ms. Landon, I would think that you above all people would understand the need for disciplne...</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <blockquote>What do you mean? They <i>were</i>
disciplined. There's a whole group of them out picking up garbage,
painting fences, you name it. A few even agreed to help fundraise for
the band. Isn't that punishment enough?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Li</b></center><br> <blockquote>Yes, but accurate records of such transgressions must be kept for future reference.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <blockquote>Do you really want to jeopardize someone's chances of college just because he dropped a gumwrapper?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Li</b></center><br> <blockquote>If he can't read the
sign that says "No Littering," then he doesn't belong in college. Rules
are made to be enforced, no matter the cost. I would think that the two
of you were mature enough to understand your duties as enforcers of the
rules here. Especially you, Ms. Landon.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>What do you mean?
We did enforce the rules. We gave each and every one of them the chance
to either have a trial or make a deal. Most chose to make a deal.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Li</b></center><br> <blockquote>Which is precisely
why I will enter all of these punishments on their records. They have
to learn that there are consequences to their actions.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <blockquote>Hey, we <i>promised</i> them that these punishments wouldn't go on their records.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Li</b></center><br> <blockquote>I didn't.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Are you sure you want to do that? I'd hate to see you <i>squash</i> our valuable learning experience and somehow let the signed deferred prosecution agreements fall into the wrong hands.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <blockquote>You <i>bet</i>ter believe it. I wonder what they would think of us in Oakwood if it got out that we can't keep our word?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>I <i>bet</i> they would think we were a bunch of hypocrites.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <blockquote>I <i>bet</i> you're right.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Li</b></center><br> <center><p>(Angry.)</center><blockquote>Are you girls resorting to extortion?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Why, Ms. Li, we'd never stoop so low. After all, rules are rules. (Beat.) Or should I say <i>laws are laws</i>?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Li</b></center><br> <center><p>(Resigned.)</center><blockquote>Very well, I'll leave it out of their records. This time.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jodie</b></center><br> <blockquote>I'm glad you see it our way. I'm sure the students picking up trash in the parking lot will be relieved.</blockquote>

<p>Int. -- Pizza King -- Later that day.
<p>Daria and Jane are sitting in their usual booth, sharing a pie.
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>I can't believe that nobody wanted to push the AV cart.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>I know, you'd
think that the stigma couldn't be that bad for only one day's work.
What surprised me was how eager everyone was to do anything but help
fundraise for the band.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>Hey, have you seen any of their fundraisers? I've seen episodes of "Animal Maulings on Home Video" that looked like more fun.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>More fun for who? The animals or the people being mauled?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <center><p>(Shudders.)</center> <blockquote>The
people. It took them two weeks to get the smell of rotting fruit out of
the rehearsal hall. And I had a class next door. Yuck. Speaking of
sweet things going bad, how's your sister taking her punishment?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>I'm not sure. She's been surprisingly quiet these last few days. I think she might actually be studying.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>Really? I'd better get moving then.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Why?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>Because Quinn
studying is one of the first signs of the End of the World. I've got to
get my concrete bunker ready. (Beat.) Do her little friends know?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>No, I don't think
so. I think she wants to surprise them with the finished product. You
know her. She wants to be able to show her acceptance letter with the
usual bored indifference she uses to discuss the guys she dates.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>And speaking of feeding people to the dragons, how did your meeting with Ms. Li go?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Predictably. She
threatened us. We blackmailed her. She caved in. Turns out we had the
better dirt, plus we had copies of all of those deferred prosecution
agreements. It would've looked really bad if those "accidentally" got
leaked to the press.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>And thus another lesson in the justice system is taught to the youth of America.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Yeah, it's not who you know, but what you have on them. And make sure you keep a copy, just in case.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Jane</b></center><br> <blockquote>Works for me.</blockquote>

<p>Int. -- Lawndale High School -- Ms. Li's Office -- Later That Day.
<p>Ms. Li grabs a thick folder from the top of her desk. She starts reading it.
<p>Int. -- Lawndale High School -- Hall Outside of Ms. Li's Office -- A Few Seconds Have Elapsed.
<center><p><b>Li</b></center><br> <blockquote>Ruttheimer!!!!</blockquote>

<p>Int. -- Morgendorffer Home Base -- Living Room -- Saturday Afternoon.
<p>Daria is reading <i>An American Tragedy</i> while sitting on the sofa. Helen enters the room.
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <blockquote>Hi, sweetie. How's the judging business?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>I finished up my duty yesterday.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <blockquote>Well, did you learn anything?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Oddly enough, I did. I understand a little better what you meant about courage, mom.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <blockquote>Really? I'd love to hear the details.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>I'd love to give them to you, but you know how it is when you work with minors-- it's privileged.</blockquote>
<p>Helen sighs.
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <blockquote>That's too bad. I was hoping I might be able to finally talk shop with <i>someone</i> in this house.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Mom, don't take it
personally, but it's actually for the best that it's all privileged. It
has to do with something I felt I had to fight for.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <blockquote>Fair enough, dear. (Beat. Smiles.) I don't suppose that this experience has changed your mind about the law?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>No, but it has changed my view about helping people, and fighting for their rights, if that's any consolation.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <blockquote>That's all the consolation I need, Daria. (Beat.) By the way, have you seen Quinn around?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>She was studying a few hours ago, but she's out doing some volunteer work now.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <blockquote>Really? Are you sure?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Yeah. I think she
finally found another use for her head, other than as a rest for bright
and shiny ornaments. (Beat.) I hope it lasts. </blockquote>
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <blockquote>Me, too, Daria,
me, too. I'd hate to think of what we'd do with her if she didn't get
into any sort of college. I keep having this nightmare that she'll wind
up dancing in a bar somewhere.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>I know what you mean. It's scary. Either that, or she'll wind up married at 17.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <blockquote>That's my other nightmare.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Can I ask you a question?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <blockquote>Sure, sweetie.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Do you ever have nightmares about me?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <blockquote>Daria, I'm your
mother. Of course I have nightmares about you. I worry about both of
you. You'll understand when you're a mother. (Beat. Grins.) Especially
if you had a daughter like Quinn.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Hey, that's not fair.</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Helen</b></center><br> <blockquote>What isn't fair?</blockquote>
<center><p><b>Daria</b></center><br> <blockquote>Using my nightmares against me.</blockquote>

<p>Ext. -- Lawndale High School -- The Football Stadium. -- Saturday Afternoon.
<p>Quinn, wearing a lovely orange reflective vest, is picking up
trash with one of those pointed sticks, and placing the garbage in her
shoulder bag.
<p>ZOOM OUT to show Upchuck doing the same.
<p>FADE OUT. ROLL CREDITS to "Whip It" by Devo.
<p>"You've got to whip it!<br>
Into shape.<br>
Shape it up.<br>
Get Straight.<br>Go forward.<br>Move ahead.<br>Try to detect it.<br>It's not too late.<br>To whip it.<br>Whip it good!"<br>
<p>
<p><b>NOTES:</b>
<br>
<br>
<p>Superintendent Blank: An hommage to "The Tick." Or an attempt to hide my inability to come up with a name for him.
<p>Squash: Sounds funnier than racquetball, sounds less painful than handball, and sounds more realistic than Jai-alai.
<p>Hornbook: A big book that covers every miniscule part of an area
of Law. Since laws can vary greatly from state to state, hornbooks
usually deal in broad, general, theoretical terms, sometimes using
examples from different states that represent different points of view,
legally. For example, it would discuss how some states allow
"holographic" (handwritten) wills, while some states do not. If you
could bottle hornbooks, you could put every living thing on Earth to
sleep for 10,000 years. That said, they have their uses.
<p>"Paper Chase:" A TV series popular in the 70s about law
students. Yep, it was about as exciting as you could imagine. John
Houseman played one of the professors, and was later a pitchman for the
investment firm of Smith Barney. (Hence the name Barney Smith.) MST3K
fans: Quick! Who played the "liver-faced 'Paper Chase' guy" in "Warrior
of the Lost World?"
<p>In general: I finally wrote something that comes in at the
right times! Yay! (Hey, that's an Acheievement for me, the writer of
episodes that would work better as mini-series or MOWs.) I wanted to
write something that showed that Daria really does care about her
sister, and that Quinn really does have the ability to change. I guess
I'm just an optimist, but don't let word get out. I also wanted to have
a little fun with a setting that I'm more familiar with-- the Law.
(Even if it was only a student court.) Nope, no Trent again. He may
show up next time, though. He may not. I haven't decided yet. Either
way, don't expect much-- I won't write that kind of stuff. (Or will I?)
