<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A small smile came unbidden to eleven
year-old Daria's lips as soon as she opened the front door of the new
Morgendorffer residence. Succulent aromas filled the house. Her father
evidently had gotten all of his cooking wares unpacked. After several days of
takeout food, Daria would again have another one of her father's mouth-watering
meals. It was as if she was finally coming home after all of the chaos being
uprooted in the middle of the school year moving from Ohio to the D.C. suburbs
upon her mother's appointment as one of the new President's Assistant Attorneys
General. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She dropped her backpack on a
chair and sped for the kitchen. Her father stood before one tiled counter,
humming along with the Bach keyboard concerto that was playing on the radio as
he sliced vegetables. He was informally dressed in slacks and a short-sleeve
shirt opened at the collar but he still looked stylish even with the bright
white apron wrapped around him. A wine glass half filled with a red sat within
easy reach. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey kiddo," he said brightly
when he caught sight of Daria. He hugged her affectionately. "Grab a chair. One
after school snack a la Jake coming right up." &nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A glass of cranberry juice and
a small plate with cheese wedges and stone-ground wheat crackers materialized
before Daria almost as soon as she sat down. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It smells good," Daria said
snagging a cracker. "Please tell me it's what I think it is."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gugelhopf," Jake replied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gugelhopf," Daria repeated in
a dreamy voice. "I love you."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So all it takes to get your
love is some flour and cherries, eh?" Jake chuckled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, but it does keep me around,"
Daria replied. "What do you have planned for the main course?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Coq au Riesling," her father
answered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, French," Daria joked, beginning
out one of the running family gags.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's it, you're out of the
will," Jake laughed, picking up the joke.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I meant Alsatian cuisine, my
favourite," replied Daria through a smile. Her father was very proud of his
Alsatian heritage, which was German, by Jove, not French, as he was quick to
point out. His grandfather, Albrecht Morgendorffer was born and raised near </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>Strasbourg</span><span lang=EN-GB>. He had fought for his beloved
Kaiser during the First World War but found himself suddenly living in the </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>French</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Republic</span><span
lang=EN-GB> after the Treaty of Versailles. He immediately immigrated to </span><span
  lang=EN-GB>America</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake patted his daughter's head
before returning to the vegetables.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How's the new school coming
along?" he asked after a moment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay," Daria blandly replied
biting into some cheese.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake caught the intonation.
When Daria used her monotone voice, things were not copasetic with her. He
carefully laid his knife aside. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the problem, Daria?" he
asked taking a chair across from her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing," she replied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Daria, you have a choice,"
Jake began patiently. "You can tell me what's bothering you or I can tell your
mother that you have a problem and she'll talk to you."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria swallowed. "Mom doesn't
talk. She interrogates. You wouldn't be as cruel as that to me."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your choice, kiddo," Jake firmly
said. "Me or the Morgendorffer Inquisition." &nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria hung her head. "You but I
might hurt your feelings."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When it comes to your peace of
mind, I'll take that chance," Jake assured her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria took a long drink of
juice. "Word got around school today that you are my father."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, honey, I think that
everyone already knew that," Jake chuckled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I mean that they found out
that you're also Jake Morgen," she clarified. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake knitted his brow. "Yeah,
so?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So?" Daria replied. "Geez,
Dad, the knuckle walkers at school might not have read your books but they have
seen the movies made from them even if most of them have been 'R' rated."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, you have a fairly famous
father," Jake said. "That and thirty-five cents will buy you a soda."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fairly famous," Daria exclaimed.
"C'mon, Dad, when it comes to horror, it's Steven King, Dean Koontz, and Jake
Morgen, the big three. You have a Bram Stoker award to prove it."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Granted, I've been successful
but I still don't see the problem," Jake said. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They drove me nuts today with
their stupid questions," a clearly frustrated Daria explained. "Everyone
thought that you must be a psycho, like we had a dungeon in the cellar and
mummified bodies in the attic."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is an occupational hazard
I'm afraid," Jake replied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I kept telling them that
you're a good man but they didn't believe me," Daria said with rising anger. "The
slack-jawed, mouth-breathing, brain-dead, inbred drool monkeys!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake chuckled over his
daughter's language. "Daria, it's not worth getting lathered over. People may have
their preconceptions but once we're settled in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Lawndale</span><span
lang=EN-GB> and they get to know us that will change. In a few months, after
some PTA meetings and chance encounters in the mall and the like, they'll be
embarrassed over their own foolishness for ever thinking that sort of thing. By
that time, your mother will probably carry more notoriety." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hardly, Dad," Daria
countered.&nbsp; "There aren't any policy wonks in middle school. Mom could become
the Attorney General and she'll still be just a lawyer. You're the guy who
wrote <u>Scrambled Eggs and Severed Heads.</u>" </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You may be right," Jake
conceded. "But still, getting bothered by ill-informed comments is a waste. Let
them slide off your back and continue on your merry way."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'll try," Daria sighed. "It's
just..."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's just what?" Jake asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria steeled herself before
looking her father in the eye. "It has bothered me for a long time, Dad. You're
the sweetest, gentlest man alive, polite to strangers, kind to animals, a
caring loving father yet you are able to write such nightmare-inducing books. I
cannot reconcile the two facts. I guess that makes me as stupid as my idiot
classmates." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You're far from stupid,
kiddo," Jake said as he stood. He checked on the cake in the oven. Satisfied
with its progress, he grabbed his glass of wine and sat back down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You're probably old enough to
understand," Jake said seriously after taking a sip. "I know that you're
definitely smart enough." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's an ominous beginning,"
Daria responded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake smiled. "You have to immediately
seize your audience's attention. I'm sure you remember meeting Sue Grafton last
year."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," replied Daria
energetically. "She was funny. I liked her."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I liked her also," Jake said.
"But do you recall how she got started writing the Kinsey Milhone books?" </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria nodded. "She said that
when she was getting divorced, she was coming up with all of these ways to
murder her husband. Instead of actually doing it, she began to put the plots
into the alphabet mysteries."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's right," said Jake. "And
my story is similar. You said that I was a caring, loving father. That means
the world to me, Daria. I have tried very hard to be that sort of parent, the type
of dad that I didn't have."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria had her curiosity piqued.
She never knew either of her grandfathers. Both died when she was still a
toddler. Helen often spoke of her father, always in tones of love and respect
and with regret over the pain that she caused him by the choices she made as a
young woman. Jake, on the other hand never mentioned his father. What few
questions Daria had ever asked about him received only the vaguest of answers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your family was
dysfunctional?" Daria asked&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Daria, it was abusive,"
Jake replied sadly. "I never heard a kind word from my father or the tiniest
expression of love. The easiest days I had were the ones where Mad Dog was
indifferent to my existence. Other days were nothing but barrages of ridicule.
He belittled me continuously.&nbsp; To say that I developed a warped self-image
would have been putting it mildly."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's horrible," Daria said aghast.
"Why didn't your mother stop him?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mom thought, still thinks in
fact, that a wife submits to her husband, no matter what," Jake replied. "She
literally could not have defied Mad Dog anymore then she could have breathed
underwater." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She should have done
something," Daria said insistently. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but don't be so harsh on
either of them," Jake said. "Mom could not move beyond her upbringing and Dad...
the thing to remember, Daria, we're talking about a man who fought across </span><span
 lang=EN-GB>North Africa</span><span lang=EN-GB> and </span><span lang=EN-GB>Europe</span><span
lang=EN-GB> in WW II and then spent another eighteen months in combat during
the Korean War. He experienced things you and I cannot begin to imagine.
Unfortunately, he did not find a healthy way to deal with those experiences. He
turned them inward and they twisted what was by all accounts a good decent boy
into a bitter, angry man. Grandfather tried to talk to him many, many times. As
someone who had seen the elephant, he knew what Dad went through but Dad
wouldn't listen to him and you can't help someone who won't let you."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But still, he had no excuse
taking his problems out on you," Daria said. "You were lucky to have turned out
okay." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake chuckled ruefully. "Honey,
luck had little if anything to do with that happening. I was one messed up kid,
timid, no self-esteem, and prone to sudden, angry outbursts. &nbsp;I managed to get
kicked out of three schools. It's a wonder I ever graduated. Eventually, I
discovered drugs which, needless to say, expedited my downward spiral."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria frowned at the healthy,
intelligent, confident man that sat across the table from her. She believed
that her father telling her the truth but she could not picture him as he
described himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what happened?" she asked.
"Did mom turn you around?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That would be the romantic
answer but no," Jake replied. "Frankly, when I hooked up with your mother, she
was not in much better shape then I was but what she did do was stick with me even
with my problems and talked me into giving college a try."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what happened?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake smiled at the eagerness of
his daughter to hear his story. "When we were at Middleton, Helen and I met a
girl named Quinn Hughes..."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quinn?" Daria interrupted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, your sister is named
after her," Jake divulged. "She...let's just say that her life had been a
nightmare at best but she was rebuilding herself through counselling. She
convinced your mother and me to give it a go. Smartest thing we ever did. It
gave us the tools we needed to climb out of the pit that we were in."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake gestured with his wine
glass. "Mister Hamilton the counsellor was not married to any one psychological
school. He believed in using many different methods as he saw fit. The most
pertinent one to our discussion was using arts and crafts as an outlet for the
negative feelings. Didn't you ever wonder why your mother knits so much? It's
an odd hobby for a feminist." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria glanced down at the green
sweater that she was wearing, one of several that her mother had made for her. The
clacking of Helen's knitting needles was a sound that Daria could recall from
her earliest memories. It was so commonplace that she indeed had never paused
to reflect upon it. Daria looked up as her father continued. "After a few
disastrous attempts at pottery, painting, and woodworking, I stumbled upon
writing and that was the winning ticket. It was so cathartic. The anger, pain,
and fear just flowed from me."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Like the physical meaning of
cathartic," Daria deadpanned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake laughed heartily. "Very
much so.&nbsp; Mister Hamilton was very pleased with how open I was willing to be on
paper. After I started writing, we were really able to make some great strides
in screwing my head on straight."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But where was the leap from
something written for therapy to writing horror novels?" Daria asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake sipped at his wine.
"Mister Hamilton thought that my ramblings showed a modicum of talent so he
conned me into showing some of it to one of my English professors, Doctor Barry.
Between her proofreading and advice and the encouragement of your mother, Mr
Hamilton, and Quinn, I cobbled together </span><u><span lang=EN-GB>Demon Drive</span></u><u><span
lang=EN-GB>.</span></u><span lang=EN-GB> The rest, as they say, is history." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That explains why you wrote one
horrorfest," Daria said. "But you've written fourteen of them now." <u>&nbsp;</u></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake tossed off the rest of his
wine as he gathered his thoughts. Daria was too intelligent to be satisfied
with simple platitudes and he was too honest to try to fob off some half-truths
on her but putting his worries into a paradigm she would understand was difficult.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You were pretty badly bitten
when you were four, as I recall," he finally said. "How do you feel about dogs,
now?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl hesitated before
answering. "They're all right, I suppose."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yet when a large dog comes
bounding at you, there's that twinge of fear, isn't there, even when you know absolutely
that the dog is friendly," Jake said kindly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria waggled her head, a
veneer of discomfort on her face. "Yes, there is. I don't run away but its
there." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her father nodded sagely. "Our
experiences shape us. People talk of conquering fear but the reality is that it
remains, lurking in the dark corners, ever ready to stampede through our minds,
if we let it. The key, of course, is not allowing it free rein. You stand your
ground when a dog approaches and I keep writing horror. We both face the pain
of the past so it cannot ruin the present."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So you write because you're
afraid of...what?" Daria asked. "Becoming that messed-up kid again?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake tossed up a hand. "I write
for many reasons. I like telling a story. I enjoy the technical challenges of
the art. I like not being a nine to fiver. The money is good, good enough to
allow me to be a stay-at-home dad but, yes, part of it is to keep what I was at
bay. I like the man I am. I shutter to think what I might have been, otherwise."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria bobbed her head slowly.
"I understand," she said softly. "The drool monkeys wouldn't, but I think that
I do."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good, Daria, I'm glad that I
could ease your mind on the matter," her father replied. "But now two things. First,
if you have a problem, please come to me. Like I said, that is the kind of
father that want to be for you."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And the dreaded second?" Daria
asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stop using terms like drool
monkeys and knuckle walkers to describe your classmates," Jake said seriously. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good grief, Dad, you would not
believe how stupid some of them are," Daria complained. "You ought to have
heard some of their questions and comments today."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I've likely already heard them
all, Kiddo," Jake calmly replied. "As for the brainpower of your classmates;
the fact is, Daria, you are going to meet very few people in your life that are
going to be as bright as you are but it is the height of arrogance and a sure
road to a lonely life to dismiss people because they are not your intellectual
equal. Very soon, you will know quite a bit more then I do. Are you going to
turn your back on me, at that point?" </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, of course not!" Daria
exclaimed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then make allowances for
others also," Jake said. "You may be surprised by what they bring to the table;
by how much they can enrich your life in ways that you didn't expect." &nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'll try," Daria agreed
grudgingly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Any of your classmates stand
out from the rest?" Jake asked. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daria drained her cranberry
juice as she mulled the question. "Jodie and Jane are bearable, I suppose."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Both pretty smart, too,"
guessed Jake. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Jodie is," Daria replied. "I'm
not sure yet about Jane. She's rather weird. She spends most of her time in
class doodling. Some of her drawings are funny, though. Jodie and I nearly got
in trouble today in Social Studies for giggling at one of them."&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake arched his eyebrows. It
must have been a very good doodle to get his normally stoic daughter to giggle
and for her to actually own up to doing so.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We should be completely
settled in by next week," said Jake thoughtfully. "Why don't we set up
something for that Saturday for the three of you? Maybe, bowling and pizza? If
it helps, you can have them stress to their parents who your mother is instead
of who I am."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To her surprise, Daria found
the idea of spending time with some girls her age outside of school appealing
even exciting. She beamed as she hopped off her chair. She scampered around the
table to hug her father. "That would be great, but I am not going to hide the
fact that you're my dad. You're the greatest dad in the world and if anyone
doesn't believe that they can take a long walk off a short pier." </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The latent fears deep within
Jake's psyche receded even deeper as he returned his daughter's hug.</span></p>
