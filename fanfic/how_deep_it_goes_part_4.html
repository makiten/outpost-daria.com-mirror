<P>"I know it is a hopeless enterprise to discuss the fundamental values. If someone for instance put forward the elimination of mankind from the face of the earth as a goal, then one can not with logical reasoning prove that such a standpoint is untenable."</P>

<P>-Albert Einstein</P>

<P>"The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all. Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity. For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool. Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit."</P>

Daria paused and pondered. Would she go on or not? What would be best for Jane? Daria actually knew the answer to that one - she had been on both sides of the fence. She had been oblivious to the meaninglessness, and later she had seen it. She didn't wish for Jane to have to go through that... it was something she didn't wish for even her worst enemy. "No, wait. I'll take that back." She thought. "It would actually feel real good to see Quinn in that position." She almost shook with disgust. No one could be further away from existential angst than Quinn - she didn't even realise the meaninglessness of her stockpile of nail polish. On the other hand Jane had been right - for some reason it felt much better to talk about these things than just dwelling on them by yourself. No, she would let Jane decide for herself how much deeper she wanted to go...<BR>
-"Are you <B>sure</B> you want me to comment on that?"<BR>
-"I guess I'm just too curious to say no... or is that masochistic?"<BR>
-"Okay then. Even if we assume there is a God, that doesn't help us very much. In order for God to solve the problem of meaninglessness, we would need to <B>know</B> who he is, and <B>know</B> what he has meant with our lives while creating us. If we don't know this, there <B>might still be</B> a meaning of life, but we would have no clue as to what it was. It would be like entering an orienteering without a map."<BR>
-"Okay, but what if this God <B>has</B> somehow let mankind know him and his will?"<BR>
-"You're talking about established religions?"<BR>
-"Yeah."<BR>
-"Well, then the problem is that I still don't know which established religion to chose. There are far too many of them and none of them can be tested since all of them make claims that stand outside the scientific sphere of influence."<BR>
-"Well, what if we assume that there is <B>something</B> to <B>all</B> religions?"<BR>
Daria sighed deeply, and Jane immediately realised she had said something stupid.<BR><BR>

-"Hey, I'm not a philosopher. I'm just asking questions from the top of my head."<BR>
-"Okay, okay... It's not that stupid a question; I'm just getting a bit tired. Do you have anything to drink in this place, by the way? My throat is dry like a desert."<BR>
-"Sure."<BR>
Jane got up and headed for the kitchen.<BR>
-"WHAT DO YOU WANT?" She shouted when reaching her destination.<BR>
-"ANYTHING BUT COFFEE."<BR>
-"ROGER!"<BR>
A minute later she was back with two cold sodas. She threw one to Daria, who fumbled the catch and almost dropped her can to the floor.<BR>
-"Graceful as usual."<BR>
-"Thanks." Daria replied with a voice that was even drier than her throat.<BR>
-"Where were we?"<BR>
-"Right here. We've been sitting here for over an hour."<BR>
-"Your sarcastic wit is killing me."<BR>
-"Happy to be of service." Daria said and emptied half of the can in one sweep.<BR>
-"I think you were about to explain to me why it's pointless to look to the religions for a universal truth of some sort. Or was it something even more depressing?"<BR>
-"No, that was it... Uh-oh. Carbon dioxide alert."<BR>
-"Huh?"<BR><BR>

Daria didn't really think belching contests were funny, and she tried to let out the gas discreetly. Unfortunately half a can of soda contains plenty of carbon dioxide, and a big portion of it found its way to her nose, causing a loud coughing attack. Jane tried not to laugh. Daria looked pretty ridiculous when she grimaced like that, but she didn't like to be reminded of it.<BR>
-"I <B>hate</B> when that happens..." Daria assumed Jane was holding back a witty comment of some kind, and she decided to quickly return to the subject in order to be spared from it. "Anyway - to assume that all religions have <B>something</B> to say to us, unfortunately gets us nowhere. If we want to assume this we can choose one out of two possibilities. The first possibility is that <B>all religions describe a different part of the same metaphysical truth</B>."<BR>
-"Meta-physi-what?"<BR>
-"Metaphysical - <B>spiritual</B> if you want. The problem with this becomes apparent when we look more closely at different religions. The problem is that <B>all</B> religions try to explain <B>all</B> of the metaphysics. It would for example be completely impossible to combine the Hindu thought of the Brahma with the Allah of the Muslims. Those who claim otherwise have misunderstood either concept - or both. These concepts completely contradict each other... and that brings us to down to option two: <B>We could assume that some religions have got some parts right, while other religions have other parts to contribute with</B>. Unfortunately at this point we're just as helpless as we would be if we tried to chose a single particular religion - after all how would we know which parts to pick from where?"<BR>
-"Of course. How could I have missed that?" Jane said with more than a hint of irony in her voice. It was not that she thought Daria to be wrong - it was just that this way of thinking - dissecting every thought into particles and analysing each was something she just wasn't familiar with, and wasn't quite sure how to relate to.<BR>
-"Yeah, how could you?"<BR>
-"Do you realise what we've just done?"<BR>
-"What?"<BR>
-"We've spent almost an entire evening talking about stuff that I thought only people with no lives whatsoever bothered themselves with."<BR>
-"We have lives?" Daria asked with mock surprise.<BR>
Jane opened her mouth as if to say something, but then suddenly cut herself off.<BR>
-"I was going to ask: 'Well do we?' but you'd just use that as an excuse for yet another hour of depressing philosophy, wouldn't you?"<BR>
Daria didn't answer. She just smiled an arch smile.<BR><BR>

<P>Sunday morning almost taunted Daria with its beauty. There was considerable warmth in the sun, and the birds loudly announced that this was going to be a beautiful day. How wrong they were. Daria checked her watch: 9 a.m. The service would be at eleven. That left her just enough time to take a shower, get dressed, have some breakfast and get over to church - all without having to rush. She looked out the window at the clear blue sky with the occasional cloud which looked almost like cotton candy. What disharmony when compared to the darkness within her. She had felt a little better after the talk she had had with Jane, but next morning she had found two blankets on top of her. Her ordinary blanket and also one made of anxiety. The latter had lain upon her all day and while completely invisible to the outside observer it weighed as if it had been made of lead.</P>

She took the shower by routine - trying to think as little about what she did as possible. She did everything by routine nowadays. Thinking hurt. She felt like she was lying on a bed made out of crushed glass and the more she moved the more she got cut. She put on her bathrobe and slippers, and headed downstairs to the kitchen. She hoped that Quinn would still be asleep and that she wouldn't have to face her. As soon as she entered she reminded herself for the forty-seventh time this week that hope is futile. She went over to the cupboard, picked up a box of cereals and ripped it open.<BR>
-"There <B>was</B> an already opened box in case you didn't notice."<BR>
Daria felt like hitting her mother to whom the voice belonged. WHO GAVE A DAMN!? It was just <B>cereals</B>! How the <B>hell</B> could people take so much interest in so many <B>completely</B> irrelevant things? Instead she just answered with as dry a voice as possible:<BR>
-"Oh... Gee... Will the world end now?"<BR>
-"Come on Daria. I just want you to be a little more perceptive. One day you'll be running a household of your own you know."<BR>
The rage started to boil within Daria. PERCEPTIVENESS!? How dared she talk to her about perceptiveness? If <B>she</B> had been the <B>least</B> bit perceptive herself she would have realised how pointless and futile all her achievements in the law firm were. <B>She</B> was the one who didn't have a clue, and she was now admonishing <B>her</B> BECAUSE OF A STUPID BOX OF CEREALS!!! Still, Daria knew, there would be no use in blowing up at her - she would <B>completely</B> misinterpret the signal.<BR>
-"Oh, yes. Make mental note: Two opened boxes of cereal are the works of the Devil - avoid at all costs." She finally replied hoping that the message would get through.<BR>
-"Daria I'm serious here. In order to run a household you need to be <B>organised</B>. You'll never get anywhere in life if you never learn to take responsibility with the smaller things. It's the details that make perfect you know."<BR>
Hope is futile. That was forty-eight times. Daria felt that life itself was playing a sarcastic joke on her. "I'm serious." her mother had said. What a joke! <B>She was a joke</B>, and there she stood claiming to be serious. A thousand thoughts rushed through Daria's head - most of them involving physical violence. WHY COULDN'T HELEN GRASP THE SIMPLE FACT THAT SHE DIDN'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT THE CEREAL BOX?! Instead she just stood there repeatedly trying to shove her incredible wisdom and insight down Daria's throat. "I wonder if this is how computers feel when the user just won't believe that the floppy disk is damaged, and keeps hitting retry?" She thought.<BR>
-"Of course - and you're living proof of that." She finally answered. A mistake, she would soon realise.<BR>
-"<B>And just what is that supposed to mean!?</B>"<BR>
-"Why don't you figure that out?"<BR>
-"THAT'S IT! One more word out of you, and you're grounded for a week!"<BR><BR>

<P>Daria knew better than to say anything. She knew that it would get her nothing but the satisfaction of spending all of next week in this house. Instead she swallowed her anger and ate breakfast in silence, spending most of the time picturing Helen's slow death at her hands. She wondered what it would feel like to actually strangle a person to death. How hard would she fight back? Would her face turn blue before she lost consciousness? Would there be any interesting crushing sounds from cartilage or something like that? She quickly finished her breakfast and left the kitchen as quickly as possible.</P>

<P>Daria's wardrobe wasn't exactly a sight for sore eyes. In fact it would probably have taken less than five minutes to catalogue every item in it - including the stuff in the sock drawer. She wasn't even sure how one was supposed to dress for an occasion like this, but she decided that anything plain and black would probably do. She dressed quickly. She wanted to get out of this house inhabited by people she couldn't stand, before she went crazy.</P>

<P>The church was just a few minutes walk away and since Daria had left the house earlier than planned she walked quite slowly. She looked at the trees growing beside the road. The sun shone through the foliage and left fine barely visible rays in the now already dissipating morning mist. Daria stopped and looked. It really was beautiful - too bad it was pointless, just as everything else. Mother Nature should know better than to waste sights like this on people who couldn't appreciate them. Daria walked through the cemetery slowly. She looked in the direction she knew the grave was - and of course it was still there. A hole in the ground with a pile of dirt next to it: It seemed - and it was - very final. Daria looked around at the vast rows of crosses and headstones. "Here lies a lot of nice people." She thought. "Nice, because they all have something in common - they're dead." That was more than she could say about her family, which was constantly annoying her.</P>

<P>People only saw death as a problem - they never saw it as what Jodie had seen, and Daria too had begun to see: The Solution. People were scared when they heard that there were enough nuclear weapons on this planet to obliterate all life on it fifty times over. They never saw the potential of it: No more sorrow, no more injustice, no more evil, no more human suffering. All the problems could be solved with one swift stroke. People feared death. Could there be anything more foolish. Death was the only completely certain event in one's life. If one feared death one had the options of either walking through life in constant fear, or walking through life in foolish denial. And how much more horrifying would the hospital bed not feel after a life in denial? What lies would one tell oneself when Death was so close that one could feel Him breathing down one's neck? No, he who didn't think about death didn't think about life - and he who didn't think about life was hardly thinking at all.</P>

<P>She entered the church and took a seat pretty far in the back. The air was still cool inside and Daria actually shivered a little. The coffin was already in place. Daria noted that the lid was on - apparently Jodie's parents didn't want to turn any more attention to <B>how</B> she had died. Typical. They probably realised who were to blame and now they just wanted to cover it up as efficiently as possible. Daria was actually surprised that she cared. The action of Jodie's parents was of course just as irrelevant as everything else in this universe, yet she felt indignation because of it. Well, people weren't guided by logic alone... Why would she be any different? She tried to get her mind off all of it and to think about Jodie instead - and much to her own surprise she felt nothing when she did. Not even a week ago she had felt immense sadness. Now there was just a big nothing inside her soul. Perhaps her emotions were following her mind after all; they were just lagging behind a bit...</P>

<P>Just at that moment the bells of the church started pounding out their rich vibrating sound. Ask not for whom the bell tolls... it tolls for thee. The phrase suddenly made more sense to Daria than it ever had before. It was hopeless. No matter where she was or what she did everything seemed to scream to her "It doesn't matter!" She felt like she was running a gauntlet where every single thing she passed reminded her of her own nothingness. She didn't know how much longer she could take it, but there was seemingly no end to this run. She looked at the coffin again - if it only were her lying inside it. If it only were her they would cover with dirt.</P>

<P>The organ started playing a tune. Daria didn't recognise it, but the music definitely matched her mood - it was probably the most depressing psalm in the book. She wondered if this kind of music was available on CD. It would be great to have on a sunny day like this. After the music was over the priest ascended the pulpit and started talking. Daria didn't really feel like listening to what he had to say. His words felt empty. Empty hope, and empty promises meant as consolation for the people in the benches. He spoke of the sorrow that everyone felt... Sorrow, Daria thought. A week ago she had felt sorrow too, but now? Wasn't mourning just a pathetic excuse to pity yourself? Why did one in fact mourn? For the sake of the one who had died? Why would one have any reason to do that? The dead were dead, and the dead felt nothing. Why was that something to mourn? No, to mourn was in fact to feel pity for oneself. To think about all the pleasant moments one had had with the deceased, and mourn the fact that these memories would not be continued. Or to just pity oneself because of the "Memento Mori" that this event whispered into one's ear. How pathetic. But was that really the whole truth? Had she not in fact experienced something else too a week ago? It was hard to tell and Daria didn't like the thought of using emotional "argumentation" against logical such.</P>

<P>The priest stopped talking, stepped down from the pulpit and went over to the coffin. It would seem he was going to go through with the blessing already - apparently Jodie's parents had requested a brief ceremony. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust - it summed it all up pretty well. Daria looked around the church at the other people in it. She was willing to bet that no more than half of them had <B>really</B> believed in anything the priest had said about God and eternal life. What did the other half do to preserve their world view? What prevented them from seeing the emptiness of it all? What enabled them to go home after this service and go on with their lives as if not much had happened? Did they just erect a huge mental blockade toward all of it, or what? She just couldn't figure out <B>how people were thinking</B> - if they were...</P>

<P>Six men stood up, and went over to the coffin. The ceremony was all but finished and it was time to carry Jodie to her final resting-place. The organ started playing Chopin's well-known funeral march and if the atmosphere in the church hadn't been gloomy before, it definitely was now. The men picked up the coffin and slowly carried it away. After the coffin was out in the sunlight, the rest of the people quietly joined the procession. Daria too joined sheepishly trying not to look at the other people. She didn't know why she didn't want to see them - she just didn't.</P>

<P>The distance to the grave was not too great, but neither was the pace of the procession and so it took almost ten minutes to get there. When finally reaching the spot Daria decided to stay at some distance away, leaving the "front row" if one could call it that, on an occasion like this, to the family members and closer relatives. It was then that she noticed she was standing next to someone she didn't know. It was an old man, maybe sixty to seventy years old. He definitely had no connection to Lawndale High, and he didn't look like he was family either - he was white. He was dressed in a way that seemed - although very respectful and thus completely compatible with the situation - quite warm for the weather. He too seemed to let everyone else get close as if he felt he didn't quite belong here. In his hand he was holding a hat that he apparently would have used to cover his almost completely bald scalp with, had he not been paying respects. His face was almost expressionless and his eyes were focused at the grave. Daria could not help but wonder who this person was.</P>

<P>The lowering of the coffin also went faster than Daria had expected. The priest held another short speech, but Daria didn't hear most of it because she was too far away. After that a temporary lid was placed on top of the grave and the relatives placed their flowers on top of it. Mr. O'Neill was also there delivering a wreath on the behalf of Lawndale High. Daria gave it a brief glance and it made her feel sick. It was blue and yellow - the official colours of the school. It had obviously been chosen by Ms. Li. Daria thought it looked more like a misplaced advertising sign than a sign of actual respect. But it was only to be expected, wasn't it? If nothing was sacred - and why would anything be - would it not be foolish to expect people to behave as if it was? People slowly started to leave. Most of them were heading for the parish house where there would be a memorial ceremony, but Daria wasn't going there - it was strictly for the family. Instead she started to slowly head back home.</P>
