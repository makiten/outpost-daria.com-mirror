-"This is a tricky one." Lex said. "And the reason it's tricky is that there is so little in the Bible about this subject, and so much tradition - if not to say superstition surrounding it. The Bible <B>does</B> speak about a lake of fire, but that could very well be a metaphor for all we know - of course it's not a metaphor for anything <B>nice</B>, but still. There are in fact only two things we get to know for certain: First - There <B>will</B> be a judgement of some sort, and there will be at least two possible outcomes to that judgement. Second - We get to know what to do so that we can be certain that we're on the safe side when that judgement comes. If you give me free hands and let me <B>speculate</B> around this subject for a while I hope it might explain a thing or two..."<BR>
-"Be my guest."<BR>
-"Okay. I believe that the people going to hell will be in hell, simply because they can't be allowed into heaven. Heaven will be heaven because there the stage has finally been reached where people <B>do</B> indeed agree on one moral, <B>and</B> the love of God will be present in such a way that everyone will actually be able to <B>be</B> moral in the true sense of the word. Therefore if one wants to go there one must <B>be willing</B> to live one's life the way God has intended it. As I've already explained - any amount of force used will pollute the moral, and a little leaven leavens the whole lump. Therefore, if you brought persons from hell into heaven they would simply bring hell with them. I also seriously suspect that if a person in hell got a chance to peek into heaven he would be bored to death, because he simply wouldn't get what was going on or where all the joy was coming from."<BR>
-"Are you saying that there is that much difference between people?"<BR>
-"No, but there <B>might</B> be in the future. I'm currently human, but what I'm going to become once on the other side is not yet certain - only God knows."<BR>
-"And the people going to hell <B>won't</B> be changed?"<BR>
-"You're asking me questions I have no answers to. I'm just <B>speculating</B> now. Don't forget that. Anyway, I believe that in the end everyone will get exactly what he or she wants. Those who have spent their lives chasing foolish and pointless things will go to a place where they can continue their foolish pursuits - together with other people who <B>also</B> want to be king of the mountain, and <B>that</B> I believe will make hell, hell."<BR>
-"So hell is other people?"<BR>
-"I believe so. I also believe that Heaven is other people."<BR>
-"But still... is this kind of 'apartheid' really fair?"<BR>
-"Hell will be very fair. Heaven won't be."<BR>
-"What?!"<BR>
-"The people in hell will get exactly what they deserve. The people in heaven will get something much better than they deserve - even the people in heaven would deserve to be in hell. That's the entire idea of grace. Have you ever thought about it: Whenever you forgive someone a transgression he or she has committed toward you, you thwart justice. It's also easy to realise the significance of forgiveness by looking at a metaphor - marriage. Let's first look at a married couple where both parties are demanding justice from each other. Whose turn was it to do the dishes today? Whose turn to walk the dog? But what about yesterday when it was raining - it was much worse to walk the dog then! That's not fair! These people will constantly be at each other's throats - it's almost like getting a preview of hell. On the other hand, we have the couple where both do their best to look after the other one's interests, and both are ready to forgive the other for the inevitable inconveniences that come with a relationship - I sincerely doubt one can get any closer to heaven, while still here on Earth. I believe that heaven and hell are two different sides of the same thing just as in this example."<BR>
-"So you're saying forgiveness a from of injustice that's okay since <B>I'm</B> the only one who 'lose' my rights, and <B>I'm</B> the one to take the initiative?"<BR>
-"Absolutely true - and the same thing goes for God. When he forgives us, he gives us a better faith than we deserve."<BR>
-"Okay, but couldn't he just forgive <B>everyone</B>?"<BR>
-"No, because while God <B>wants</B> the death of no sinner, he still is who he is, and a part of that means being righteous. After all a judge who just turned a blind eye to everything wouldn't be much of a judge."<BR>
-"In my opinion a judge who turned a blind eye to just <B>some</B> things would be even worse."<BR>
-"True, but God doesn't turn a blind eye to anything."<BR>
-"Then how...?"<BR>
-"He condemns the sin, but if the sinner, in Christ, is dead to the sin, the sinner will be unaffected by the judgement."<BR>
-"Huh?"<BR>
-"I realise this is very hard to understand, especially for people living in such an individualistic culture as our own, but the point is that <B>people who have realised their own inability to live up to the required moral standards still have the option of letting someone else live up to the moral standards for them</B>. Those who don't give a damn about moral standards will have to face the consequences. Those who decide that 'I'll do as well as I possibly can, and that'll have to do.' will also be in for a nasty surprise when they realise how far away from making the mark they really were. Only perfection is satisfactory in front of God."<BR>
-"<B>Let someone else</B> do it? Are you saying I can just turn the whole business over to Jesus, then kick back, relax and do whatever I want?"<BR>
-"Yes and no. A Christian <B>is</B> indeed freed from the law, <B>but only because he has already realised it is good and worth following</B>. This is how God works - when people don't care about moral he gives them the law. When/If they start to care he waits... When they realise they can't handle it by themselves and are ready to accept his alternative he says: 'Good, now you don't need the law any more.' This is because of the same reason that I've already explained: That coercion or demand actually harms the moral. The person will hopefully continue to try to be moral carried by the momentum of realising that the law is good, and when he fails there is grace to make up for it - after all he is dead to the law. Only if he decides to ditch the whole thing - kick back and do whatever he wants - only then can God dig out the old stone tablets again..."<BR>
-"I think I have a headache." This discussion was really trying the limits of Daria's comprehension, and it slowly started to seem that the "main processor" was having trouble with "input overflow". It would take days just to digest all these thoughts.<BR>
-"Don't worry about it. As I already said: The role of the law is probably the hardest part of Christianity to comprehend. In fact, it was my position on this that caused ninety percent of the conflicts I've had with fellow theologians."<BR><BR>

-"Well, thank you for a very refreshing discussion." Daria said, and slowly got out of her chair. "But I'm afraid it's getting late and I'd better get going before anyone starts wondering where I'm am." Normally this would not be that much of a concern to her, but she already pictured the scene in her mind:<BR>
-Her mother starting to wonder how a funeral could take this long.<BR>
-Her mother calling Jane to ask if she had come over.<BR>
-Jane putting two and two together - only in this case it would end up five.<BR>
-Both the Lanes and the Morgendorffers looking for her, hoping to find her before "it was too late".<BR>
-A long stay in a padded cell that wasn't her room.<BR><BR>

-"The pleasure was all mine Miss... Oh, dear... I believe you never introduced yourself."<BR>
-"Morgendorffer. Daria Morgendorffer."<BR>
-"Well in that care, take care Miss Morgendorffer."<BR>
-"Thank you. I will."<BR>
-"And you <B>really</B> have to taste their buns some day."<BR>
-"If you say so." Daria replied and exceptionally allowed herself a smile for no other particular reason than being nice to someone.<BR><BR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">***</P>

<P>When Daria got home it turned out she had been worried without cause. Her mother had received a call from her boss and was already at work, and her father had fallen asleep in the couch. Quinn was the only one who, in theory, could have noticed her absence but that was about as likely as her suddenly growing wings (they would after all <B>totally</B> clash with her wardrobe). She never noticed Daria anyway, and <B>should</B> Daria in fact have disappeared she would most likely have thrown a party.</P>

<P>Daria changed to her normal clothes, and slumped over on the bed. She lay there staring into the ceiling thinking about the discussion she had just had - to think that there was so much she had missed... She had been so certain that she had thought of every conceivable detail, but there had in fact been huge gaping holes in her philosophy. Not that she really minded - her philosophy had given her little more than a deathwish and the cheap satisfaction of feeling smarter than others. Needless to say, the latter had been almost completely devoured by the former. All of last week she had been telling herself that hope was futile, and now for the first time there actually seemed to be a gleam of it. She was lying on her back, but for the first time in almost a week it didn't feel like she had an elephant sitting on her.</P>

<P>She thought about all the thinking she had done. It was amazing how far she had come... but to what end? If the meaning of life really was about relations then what did she really know that any kindergarten pupil didn't? This was something that most people did completely automatically (except maybe the God-part of it). She thought she knew what Lex would have said. Most likely it would have been something on the lines of: "Of course - despite his fall, man was still created into the image of God." Then he would probably go into a long explanation on why it would <B>have</B> to be simple and end it all with saying that the kingdom of Heaven belonged to the children. Then a thought struck her - these were only theories after all. Even though they seemed to form a logical unity, she still had nothing with which to prove them correct. How incredibly annoying! The <B>only</B> piece of information in this universe <B>she really wanted</B> - and it was out of reach... or was that out of sight? She still felt a little suspicious toward Lex' claim that one could ask God for knowledge... She finally pushed the thought aside and thought about the other things that had been said. She would return to this topic later.</P>

<P>The hopeless situation of mankind had seemed to play a very central role in his philosophy, yet he somehow was still talking about love all the time. How did that make sense? Was that in fact the reason why life could be such a pest sometimes? She didn't like people very much... never really had. Perhaps this philosophy wasn't so uplifting after all? She suddenly remembered something Dostoyevsky had said through the character of Ivan Karamazov. She couldn't recall it word by word, but it was something about that beggars would do wisely in just putting in ads in the newspaper instead of begging in the streets. The idea was that it was so much easier to love a person from a distance... It was a pretty smart and cynical way of describing a situation she recognised all too well. Not more than a year ago she had actually considered skipping college and moving to Canada and get a job as a forest ranger, or something. She had heard that they could be completely isolated for almost six months straight. No, she knew what Dostoyevsky meant. People were a lot easier to stand when you didn't have to be around them.</P>

<P>This was the problem: To love thy neighbour although thy neighbour sucked. That was probably the key to why life was never so good as one would hope for. On the one hand you were dependent of people, on the other hand people were all more or less corrupted. Wasn't it in fact strange that the world wasn't an even worse place than it was? Daria sighed and put on some soft music. She felt she could use it. "Strange" She thought. "It would appear that there were two different forces pulling the will of each human being in different directions." There was the simple egotistical force that strove toward a state of "getting as much out of the situation as possible". This force was responsible for everything between shoplifting and warfare throughout human history. It "wanted it all, and it wanted it now". Oddly enough this force was also often responsible for people being able to get along. The simple reason was that the force was trying to acquire maximal happiness - and that did not usually include a whole lot of conflict. Daria began to see a pattern form. All too many human relations were like warfare - the other people were merely obstacles on or tools for one's own way to happiness. The people standing before oneself in the line in the supermarket were merely obstacles, and the only reason that one wouldn't shamelessly pass the entire line was that the protests raised by the other's would make the whole thing "cost more than it was worth". <B>Now</B> she started to understand what Lex meant with the difference between being moral and acting moral. A person <B>acting</B> moral was just acting the way he did because of the terror balance in a cold war on the personal level. He was acting the way he did, not because he cared about the others but because he believed that his actions would grant himself the greatest benefit.</P>

<P>Then there was that other voice - a tiny whisper, seldom heard. A voice that urged to care about the others instead of yourself. But how could a person who lived according to this voice survive in a world like this? All the people who were prepared to grab whatever they could get their hands on would immediately notice this person as weak prey and start abusing the kindness. That person would be like a nation that started a single-handed disarmament in the middle of a raging war - it would be insanity. That was when she came to think of something the priest - the other priest - had said during the funeral. It was something about a corn of wheat having to fall into the ground and die, lest it abide alone. At the time she had thought that that was pretty hollow consolation indeed. To be given the choice of being alone or dying was very much a situation of "damned if you do, damned if you don't" even though she realised that the dying was just a metaphor. It did make sense, though - the egotistical lifestyle was perfectly designed for loneliness, which Daria knew from experience wasn't always all that fun and glamorous. The second one could very well be compared to dying - at least in a world like this. "So that's it?" She pondered. "Life sucked because there were no good alternatives?" She sighed deeply, removed her glasses (it wasn't like she needed them for thinking) and turned over in her bed. The music that was playing slowly affected Daria's mood and she felt she was getting sleepy. She wondered if she should just turn in early, checked her watch and decided it was still too early.</P>

<P>When she woke up it was already morning. It took her a while to orientate herself, but then she realised that she had fallen asleep after all and slept in her clothes, boots and all, all night and that she had a foul taste in her mouth, indicating bad breath. Then she checked the time, and suddenly sprung to life. It was Monday morning, and she would be late if she didn't leave the house within two minutes. A very quick brushing of the teeth was the only luxury she could allow herself. While performing this she noticed that her hair was mussed up pretty bad. Damn! Jane would get a real laugh out of this. Daria often joked about Jane's slow starts in the morning, and she wasn't likely to let an easy chance at revenge like this pass her by.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">***</P>

Jane hadn't let it pass her by. She had never said a single word, but when Daria had burst into the classroom at the very last minute she had allowed herself a very wide sneer. Daria had just shot her a glare that could have killed an ox. That was her right, just as sneering was Jane's under these circumstances. Now they were just walking home from school...<BR>
-"You still seemed pretty out of it today." Jane carefully started. "And your entry today, wasn't really <B>you</B>. You weren't thinking about the meaning of life again, were you?"<BR>
She was obviously worried about Daria. She hadn't understood everything Daria had told her, but she <B>had</B> understood that Daria was going through a crisis similar to Jodie's, and she knew all too well what had happened to Jodie. This was also the reason she had tried <B>not</B> to think about any of the things Daria had said. She somehow realised that <B>really</B> understanding those thoughts would have been very depressing - even more so than what she had actually experienced during the conversation.<BR>
-"Not again. Still." Daria corrected. She couldn't resist the temptation of keeping Jane on tenterhooks a few seconds longer... And besides, it was true.<BR>
-"You have <B>absolutely</B> no idea how much I wish you hadn't said that." Jane replied with a voice that was unusually dark and dejected for her.<BR>
-"It's not as bad as you might think. I had a very interesting discussion with someone yesterday."<BR>
-"Oh? About what?"<BR>
-"The meaning of life. What else?" Daria said in a casual voice, well aware of how geeky it sounded.<BR>
-"Oh, yes of course. What else would you talk about?" Jane replied, with just the amount of irony that Daria had expected. "And how did that discussion differ from the one you had with me?"<BR>
-"The counterpart of this discussion was actually intelligent." Daria said with an innocent voice, she knew would earn her a deep frown from Jane. She got it too...<BR>
-"Well thanks a bunch."<BR>
-"Anything for a friend" Daria replied with a smirk. Then she too got serious. "No, seriously. The guy was very smart."<BR>
-"Guy? Who are we talking about here?"<BR>
-"No one you know. In fact I can't really say I know him either. We both were at Jodie's funeral, and we happened to meet on a cafe later. We started... No, actually <B>he</B> started talking, the discussion went deeper, became more serious... and that's it."<BR>
-"Mmm-hmm." Jane hummed with a mocking suspicion in her voice. "And what did this guy <B>look</B> like." She really like teasing Daria with that. It always got a reaction. Besides, she had already realised that Daria's situation was no longer as bad as she first had feared.<BR>
-"The <B>guy</B> looked like a seventy year old retired priest, which was precisely what he was." Daria replied with a dry voice and a slight frown.<BR>
-"Oooh." This time Jane played the "mock surprise"-card. "I always knew older men were your thing but <B>this</B>?" At this point Jane was faced with the decision of whether to stop here and get away with a death glare, and an accurate description of how to get to a certain hotter place that wasn't a tropical holiday-paradise, or whether to top it all off with a long whistle, and risk getting strangled. She chose the former and noticed by the intensity of Daria's death glare that she had chosen wisely.<BR>
-"<B>Very funny</B>." Daria hissed through clenched teeth.<BR>
-"Okay, okay." Jane said in a "calm down, I was just kidding"-manner. "From what you said I got the impression this discussion was less depressing than the one we had..."<BR>
-"I guess you could say that."<BR>
-"Feel like talking about it?"<BR>
-"I feel like taking a walk. If you want to come along we can talk too."<BR><BR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">***</P>

<P>-"Okay." Jane said and sat down on a small rock that happened to have a relatively flat surface. "We've walked for an hour already, and I hope you don't mind." Just like with the last explanation she had had a lot of trouble following Daria, and for the first time in her life she actually was grateful that she wasn't <B>too</B> smart. She still had only a very vague picture of what Daria had been through but she was quite certain that she didn't want to go through something similar herself. The only thing that was really obvious to Jane was that there had previously been an atmosphere of complete and utter hopelessness over Daria, and that atmosphere was - if not completely gone, at least dissipating. This was a bigger relief to Jane than she would ever dare admit to Daria. After the second conversation they had had, Jane had in fact been so scared that Daria might kill herself that she had actually seriously considered contacting someone. The reason she finally had decided not to was simply because she had realised that she would have lost Daria either way. Daria would never have forgiven her for breaking a confidence like the one she had been entrusted with. Of course Daria had never said that it was a confidence, but among friends technicalities like that didn't count.</P>

-"No." Daria replied. "I don't mind at all. In fact I was about to take that same seat as you just did, so now I'll have to find a replacement."<BR>
Daria found a rock that wasn't as good as the one Jane was sitting on, but that would have to do.<BR>
-"So what are we doing here on Lovers' lane anyway. There's nothing here but an abandoned quarry behind us, and Lawndale in front of us."<BR>
-"If put into perspective, the town could be a quarry too."<BR>
-"Huh?"<BR>
Daria leaned back against a larger rock behind her back and looked out over the little suburban town. She tried to relax, and do nothing more than exist. She felt a slight breeze playing with her long brown hair and the sun gently warmed her legs since they weren't shaded by the rock behind her. The noises from the town seemed strangely distant and muffled, and the most notable sound was the croaking of a large crow that was sitting on the roofridge of the nearby station house. She looked at her friend who was expecting an answer. Daria let out a contented sigh. She knew that she could sit here for hours.<BR>
-"To look out over the town, calm your mind, think about the people there..." She finally replied. "It's a lot easier to like people from a distance, you know..."<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

<P>Whew! That story was a pain to write. I wrote everything from scratch in twelve days (not counting proof-reading, minor corrections etc.(*)) and I feel my brain is slowly overheating. I have <I>never</I>, and I mean never written so much in so little time before. I usually write whenever I feel like it, but when I started writing this story I realised I have to be more disciplined than normally if I were to ever finish it, so I set a five-pages-per-day-minimum limit for myself. I soon realised that five pages per day was more than it sounded, but I made it almost every day anyway. The disadvantages of writing in a language that's not your native one become even more obvious when writing prose than when writing script. <I>At best</I> you get 80% of the quality at 300% of the time. You constantly find yourself searching your mind (and your dictionary) for the "right" word or idiomatic expression to use in a certain situation.</P>

<P>(*): A gracious bow, and a tip o' the hat to Steven Galloway for beta-reading this fic.</P>

<P>The reason I wrote this was simply that I wanted to write something thought-provoking, and preferably about an important issue - not just some philosophical subtleties. "What is the meaning of life?" is IMHO the only <I>really</I> important question in this universe (along with the questions that spawn out of this one). I took four years thinking about it, and although I wouldn't want to go through that again for anything in the world, I wouldn't say the time was a complete waste either. Now on to some questions I suspect some of you might have about this story.</P>

<B><P>Why a "Daria" fanfic? There is after all so much dialogue in this that you could have used almost any characters you wanted to.</P>
</B>
<P>Well, I have several reasons and I'll just share the two most important with you: First of all I think the show deserves it. It has set out to be (and it has succeeded to become) one of the "deeper" TV-shows of today. This fanfic is my tribute to that aspect of the show (hence the name of the story), where I try to take up questions that can't be discussed in 21 minutes worth of air time on a TV-show.</P>

<P>Second: This subject is kind of sensitive, and I think that the world of Daria fans is one of the few crowds I can actually reach. People here seem intelligent enough to at least not misunderstand me <I>completely</I>, and civilised enough not to flame my ass to a crisp even if they would happen not to agree with me. (Let's just say I have some previous negative experiences with both of these phenomena...)</P>

<B><P>Didn't Daria's depression move kind of fast? I've heard that these things usually take a lot more time.</P>
</B>
<P>Yes, I'm aware of that, but for the sake of the story (and to spare you from even more and longer tedious ramblings about how it feels to have a deathwish) I compressed the timeframe <I>a lot</I>. I'm aware of how silly it looks that Daria is confused about these questions one day, and less than a week later she seems to have tons of thoughts on everything. A more realistic time would have been anything from a year to as much as five years, possibly even more... but if you want a more realistic version of it, just read the scene where Daria is lying on her bed thinking about how the image of the Grim Reaper no longer scares her, but in fact seems inviting, over and over again and picture it going on for a year... :-P Like I said: I don't think anyone would have wanted to read such a story.</P>

<B><P>Wasn't Daria acting a bit out of character?</P>
</B>
<P>That depends on your point of view. Remember that the time frame of this is still highly accelerated. Existential angst easily causes a person to "act out of character" in real life as well, effectively choking almost any "normal" emotions.</P>

<B><P>Did you make Daria an agnostic just because it made the story easier to write?</P>
</B>
<P>Yes. It was the only way I could think of that would allow me to bring up the issues I wanted to bring up in any form of logical order.</P>

<B><P>What's up with Jane? One second she seems to get Daria's explanations - the next she seems out of it. What's the big idea? Does she have variable intelligence?</P>
</B>
<P>To be perfectly honest: I did that to get the dialogue to go where I wanted it. But it's not <I>quite</I> as unrealistic as it may seem... I have personally experienced similar situations when trying to grasp something difficult. One can almost feel the neural synapses trying to establish a connection, but not <I>quite</I> making it. You <I>think</I> you've got it, you can actually see some kind of pattern - and then it's all suddenly gone and you have to try again. Yet, I apologize to all Jane-fans if I made her seem dumber than she is.</P>

<B><P>Do you consider yourself a philosopher? You didn't seem quite familiar with all the elements surrounding philosophical debate. Have you studied theology?</P>
</B>
<P>That depends on your definition of a philosopher. (An unworldly geek who mumbles lots of logical stuff without practical application?) :-) But it's true that I haven't read a lot of philosophy, and I certainly haven't studied it. I tried to read it at one time but I was quite disappointed of the way many philosophers hide their ideas behind solid walls of jargon and rethorics. After spending lots of time to analyse just a few sentences one may often notice that the thought behind it is surprisingly banal. That's also a point with this fic. I've tried to bring forth the ideas in a way that should be as easy as possible to follow and without using too many "big" words. In other words - when it comes to philosophy I'm a total amateur - I, like Daria in this fic, started to think about these things, not because I wanted to but because I had understood the question and couldn't un-understand it. As for the theology part - no I haven't read any of that either, just the Bible. I still hope that won't be critical since I expect the audience to consist of mostly amateurs as well, and the "specialists" often have an incredible ability to talk over people's heads. (I hope I've managed to avoid that - at least I've tried to.)</P>

<B><P>There are a couple of things I didn't quite get. Can I ask you about something...?</P>
</B>
<P>Well, if you feel you must, but I'm not nearly as bright as I would want to be, and I don't have half the answers I'd like to have. The fic you've just read contains about four to five years worth of thinking so... The truth is I'm pretty slow to catch on, and if you ask a difficult question from me you might have to wait four or five years for an answer, possibly even longer. :-P</P>

<B><P>Did you really come up with that all by yourself?</P>
</B>
<P>Of course not. Nothing is new under the sun, and I do not believe that I have said anything that hasn't been said before. I have borrowed thoughts from a lot of different sources, and even the stuff I <I>have</I> thought of myself has also been thought of before. (That's part of the reason I have all those quotes there.) But in the end you're just going to have to use you're own head, and I merely hope that this story can work as some sort of catalyst for your brain activity.</P>

<P>There is one source, though that I have ripped off so mercilessly that it would almost be plagiarism not to mention him: Sven Reichmann. You probably haven't heard of him since he's not widely known outside of Scandinavia, but for instance the thought experiment of "Who would lose their jobs, should man be righteous?" was almost directly borrowed out of one of his books, and plenty of stuff from chapter 5 was based on his ideas.</P>

<P>Oh, yeah. I also ripped off some of my previous work, but it's not like anyone would notice. That'll probably never be published in English anyway - or published at all for that matter. :-)</P>

<B><P>Are you saying that Heavy Metal music can cause people to commit suicide, or what was that Metallica-reference about?</P>
</B>
<P>Absolutely not. I truly believe that no sane person would ever commit suicide based on a song they've heard. People who are depressed, OTOH often listen to Heavy Metal because the lyrics are often dark and the music suits the mood. People who believe otherwise have IMHO got the cause mixed up with the effect. The reason I used this song was that I further wanted people to understand how I thought Jodie felt: Like a puppet.</P>

<B><P>What was this thing about tolerance? And what about that example you used about racists? Are you saying racism is okay?</P>
</B>
<P>The only reason I'm answering this question is that there <I>might</I> be a chance that someone's paranoia could be awakened if they just skimmed through the text and noticed that particular passage. No. Racism is not okay, neither is intolerance. I only used these examples to illustrate one of the built-in problems of <I>any</I> moral code. If you didn't get this then read the passage again. (If racism was okay, it would in fact have been totally useless for the example.)</P>

<B><P>Are you trying to start some sort of debate with this story?</P>
</B>
<P>AAAAAGH!!! NO!!! Have mercy! I have seen where "debates" of this kind usually go. They tend to go from debate to trench warfare in approximately a nanosecond or so, both when it comes to civilised behaviour and locked positions on both sides. Furthermore I'm positively convinced that debates are a complete waste of time, because people never enter a debate to listen to what others have to say. They enter in order to make their own voice heard. The "winner" of the debate is also usually the one who can shout the loudest. (I was thinking of taking this up in the story, but I wanted to spare you from Hegel and his "dialectic logic".) <I>Please don't start any debates because of this story.</P>
</I>
<B><P>Is this a self-biographic story?</P>
</B>
<P>Well, partly. But I <I>am not</I> any single one of the particular characters. There is some of me in Jodie, some in Daria, some in "Lex" but I am none of them even on a metaphorical level. (This was part of the reason I made Lex an old man - I didn't want anyone to think he was a Mary Jane/Sue character.)</P>

<B><P>Are you <I>sure</I> you weren't trying to make anyone convert when writing this...? It seems a little suspicious.</P>
</B>
<P>I <I>could</I> of course tell you I would <I>not</I> be pleased to hear that someone had come to see things the way I see them because of this story, but I don't think I'd look good with a three-foot-long nose. But isn't the purpose of <I>every</I> more or less philosophical text to present a subject so convincingly that the people who read it become convinced? If no, then what <I>is</I> the point with them? If yes, then what have I done wrong? It is still my belief though, that when it comes to matters like this God himself is the only one who can truly convince, so this story was written for the purpose of getting you to stop and think about the meaning of life. It was also written for the purpose of clearing up what I see as some very common misunderstandings regarding Christian faith, and to explain why the subject of moral is so much harder than it first seems. That's my story and I'll stick with it. :-) Besides I warned about this in the caveat at the beginning - I didn't force the horse to the water, and I'm definitely not going to make it drink.</P>

<P>Also, if you think that I've done something new and/or unfair in "smuggling" in some philosophy into a story - think again. Philosophy has influenced culture for as long as it has existed. The only thing I've done differently is to be obvious/honest about it. Philosophy and the spirit of the times is influencing (either directly or indirectly) practically every cultural event, every book and every TV-show out there, believe it or not. Let's take a quick example: Have you ever watched sci-fi on TV? I knew you had. Have you ever noticed that most sci-fi shows that somehow want to incorporate an element of religion often choose not to talk about "God", but instead to talk about "The Universe" as if the universe was a someone, not a something. (If you don't know what I'm talking about, you should watch some Babylon 5.) This way they may add an element of "mysticism" or whatever you want to call it without taking a stand in favour of any religion - very politically correct. It's a solution in perfect harmony with the spirit of our times (and culture). It's also a piece of philosophy hidden in the culture surrounding us. It's a manifestation of the modern western paradigm that states that there exists no absolute truth on the metaphysical level. This, in turn, is based on the philosophic legacy of a German philosopher named Hegel - and that, I'm willing to bet, most of you didn't know. Just because someone has never read any philosophy doesn't mean that that person isn't influenced by it - philosophy is all around us in the form of self-certainties and the less we know about the philosophy behind these the less likely we are to be able to see through them. Just like in Huxley's Brave New World, enough repetitions make a truth. :-( In this fic I've been much more open about the philosophical elements than most people are, and if you think that's unfair I just don't know what to say...</P>

<P>This is also what I meant when I said that "The first victim of tolerance is truth." Tolerance (in practice) states that there is no such thing as absolute truth on the metaphysical level. (If such a thing existed, then it would naturally be morally unacceptable to negotiate about that truth in the name of tolerance.) The only problem is that the phrase "There is no such thing as absolute truth on the metaphysical level." is a metaphysical statement in itself, and in order for it to be valid, the phrase itself must be an absolute truth. Ooops. (Of course we don't act like there are no metaphysical truths - we only do that when it's convenient for us, but that's a whole different story...)</P>

<B><P>There is this one thing about your theology...</P>
</B>
<P>If you're a Christian who don't agree with me on my theology - then fine. You don't have to. Just know that what I presented in this text was just the bits and pieces that I felt most vital, and because of the nature of the story I didn't bother to go any deeper with the theology than I thought absolutely necessary. I could have made this story twice as long. I could also have been charged with homicide for slaying people with boredom. [...the insane theological fanfic author! Coming up next on Sick Sad World!] Oh... and as for my theories on heaven and hell - they were <I>theories</I> and nothing more.</P>

<B><P>Isn't this stupid postscript going to end soon?</P>
</B>
<P>Yes. Just let me say that I hope you liked the story, and if you didn't, well don't worry. I'm not likely to write another one like this. Now I'm done. Right after these brief messages:</P>
