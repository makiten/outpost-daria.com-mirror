plundered the entire Treasury?  </FONT>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jane - They're comin' with me. We'll

wonderful. I'm so happy for you! You and Erin both. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - Ah, you'd better take a
voyage. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jane - Why? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - My mom just got a seagull
from my Aunt Rita. This shan't be pretty. </FONT>

Little Erin is getting married. <I>(low voice)</I>  At the Windsor
Hills Isle on Leeville Island. </FONT>

Rita back at least a dozen dubloons! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Helen - Not Rita. Mother. Nothing but
the best for her favorite pirate granddaughter. </FONT>
</P>

legendary buried treasure! </FONT>

Bridesmaids? </FONT>

the Chambers-Danielson wedding. </FONT>

of Blackbeard himself! </FONT>
</P>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Saleslady - Nature didn't see fit to

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - I feel as if I've drunk too
much rum. Be that a problem for ye? </FONT>

Daria with a pin)</I> </FONT>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(on the open sea; it's the day of

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jake - I don't know why you didn't
let me bring my shovels and pick axes. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Helen - Jake, we're here to see my
family, not to find treasure the likes of which ye have nary seen! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jake - Who's escorting your sister to
this, anyway? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Helen - Well, she dumped the pirate
sculptor, the cannoning instructor was blown to kingdom come, and I
believe that Bruno has been transported to the Australian wastes. So
I don't know... </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jake - That Rita sure knows how to
pick 'em. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Helen &ndash; (sardonic) Arr. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(Jake turns into the port for
Windsor Hills; the venue looks just as high-class and expensive as
you'd expect)</I> </FONT>

</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - <I>(crooks finger)</I>
Redrum! Redrum! I could really do with some red rum!</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jake - This will cost your mother a
chest! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Helen - Well, what else should she
spend her money on? Something boring, like extra cannonballs and
masts for her other granddaughters? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jake - <I>(chuckles, then sobers)</I>
Hey... </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Helen - I just keep telling myself
that Erin hasn't had the advantages our seafarin' girls have had. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn <I>(to Daria)</I> - Advantages?
</FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria &ndash; I have not the
faintest. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Mack - You know, if the girls see us,
we're going to die. They'll think we be needing extra assistance! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Kevin - Are you kidding? They <I>want</I>
us to come, bro. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Mack &ndash; What the hell do you
mean? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Kevin - They knew that if they
invited us to a pirate expo, there's no way we'd go near the place. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Mack - Then why are we here? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Kevin - Debauchery. Debauchery, me
hearty. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Mack &ndash; I told you not to call
me that! </FONT>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Rita &ndash; Jake, how are ye? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jake &ndash; Aye, not too--. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Rita - Oh, the girls look fearsome,
just the way you want them. But Daria, why didn't you get the same
outfit as the other pirate bridesmaids? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - I did. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Helen - I'm sorry about the rehearsal
dinner, Rita. I was busy yesterday arguing why we weren't near the SS
Target when it was mysteriously sunk by cannon fire, and by the time
we were ready to set sail... </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Rita - Everyone, this is Paul, my
buccaneer beau. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Paul &ndash; Ahoy there me matey! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jake - Paul Meyerson? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Paul - Jake? Jake and I were in the
Junior Treasure Seeker Society together. You bring your sextant? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(Jake grumbles)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - Dad, what was that you said
about knowing how to pick the nugget of gold? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jake - Oh, Daria... (insincere) How
you amuse us!</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(a speed boat comes flying up the
dock)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn - Wow, who's that? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - Aunt Amy? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(Amy gets out of boat and hands a
map to her valet attendant)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Amy &ndash; A few dents are to only
be expected, but lose the maps and you're to be left for the sharks. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Rita - Amy, how delightful.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Helen &ndash; Arr! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Rita -- I thought you weren't coming.
</FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Amy - I wasn't, but I thought if you
two could put aside the memory of the Barksdale War of '87 and its
bitter fighting, then so can I... for a day. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Helen - Oh, Amy, why do you say such
utterly absurd things? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Amy &ndash; So the seagulls can hear
'em! <I>(passes between Helen and Rita)</I> So, Jake. You're still
with Helen, huh? Shows the fortitude I expect in my crew. I'd ask ye
to join, but you know, the war... And finally, Roger. How's your
beloved cannon firing? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Helen - Amy, Roger died when his
cannon was blown back onto him. This is Paul. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Amy - Oh, sorry. Paul, how fare ye? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Paul &ndash; Poor Roger. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - And he be luckier than I.
(grumbles)</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Helen - Girls. How many times do I
have to tell ye both that pirates aren't envious?</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Amy - Hey, what's the point of death
at sea if you can't find a little humor in it? Dar, I like your way
of thinkin'! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Rita - Now, Amy, I don't know where
we're going to seat you... <I>(leads Amy into building)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Helen - I need some rum!</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria &ndash; I asked first you know.

this cruel morn? </FONT>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(his laughter dies as he follows
Helen inside)</I> </FONT>

huddled together and talking, while a young man with a very bored
expression is leaning on one of the tent poles)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Bridesmaid #1 - Oh, it can't rain on
Brian and Erin's wedding. It just can't! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Bridesmaid #2 - That would be so
awful. I'd rather be taken prisoner by a rival crew!</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Luhrman - On the contrary. Rain is
the ancient way of the sea. Every couple should be so lucky. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(Daria and Quinn approach the
gathered pirate bridesmaids)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Bridesmaid #3 - Oh, don't you see? A
little rain won't spoil the happiest day of Brian and Erin's life.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Bridesmaid #2 &ndash; Until they
discover a really big treasure hoard. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>(they notice Quinn and Daria)</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Bridesmaid #3 - You must be Erin's
cousin. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Quinn - I am. But Daria's, um, her
navigator third removed... </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Bridesmaid #3 - What? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - Actually, I'm a drifting
pirate. The Morgendorffers were kind enough to take me in after my
real family was made to walk the plank. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Bridesmaid #3 - Oh. Well, how come
you didn't get the same outfit as the rest of us? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - I did. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(Mack and Kevin are in the stands;
Kevin, holding a goblet, is fast asleep)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Mack - Wake up! If you were at sea,
you've have surely been boarded by now! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Kevin - What? Huh? <I>(spills soda on
his pants)</I> Arrr! <I>(stands up)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Mack - I think you're blowing our
cover. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Brittany - Kevin, what are you doing
here? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Kevin - Surprise! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Brittany - Ooooh! <I>(walks away)</I>
</FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(at the wedding)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(Erin and Brian are taking their
vows in front of the pirate minister, flanked by the bridesmaids and
groomsmen; Daria, bored to tears, is reduced to looking back at the
crowd)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Minister - And as we share the
pleasure of this lovely young couple, Brian and Erin, we are
compelled to ask, what is love? Yes, love, like a tiny diamond ring;
which was discovered in the mines of the Congo, and only after
twisting and turning and being buried thousand of miles away, is
found and creates that great wealth of love which is its destiny.
<I>(Amy sticks out her tongue, causing Daria to chuckle, which causes
all of the bridesmaids -- except Quinn, who's spacing out with joy
over the whole ceremony -- to glare at her)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - <I>(points to Quinn)</I> It
was her. Make her walk the plank!</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(the reception is in full swing;
Jake and Paul have cozied up to the bar)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Paul - So the Captain said to me,
&quot;Why don't you just replace and run the entire ship?&quot; And
here I was, 29 years old. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jake &ndash; Yarr! So, how'd you meet
Rita? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Paul - Well, you know, we both love
the sea. We are pirates you know! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jake - And she's a little dinghy! I'm
kidding, of course. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Paul - Well, let's face it. Rita's a
uneven keel, of course, but she's a tiger in the bedroom. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(Jake looks over at Helen, who's
imploring the waiter to pour more grog into her glass)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jake - Yeah, well, I guess it run
through her family line!</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(at the head table, Daria and
Luhrman are sitting with the bridesmaids)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(Luhrman mumbles something)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - Mmm-hmm. What did you say? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Luhrman &ndash; Nothing that would
help you find riches. Forget it. Would you like another diet rum? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria &ndash; Nah.... </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Luhrman - Or shall we just split a
barrel of rotgut? <I>(Daria stares at him)</I> Be assured that I
don't intend any kind of injurious behavior!</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - You're from a far-off isle,
are you?</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Luhrman &ndash; Aye.  </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(Erin and Brian approach the
table)</I> </FONT>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin - Daria, thar you be! I can't
believe I didn't get to see you before the wedding! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - <I>(flatly)</I> It was a
lovely ceremony. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin - Oh, but you haven't met Brian.
Isn't he marvelous? He works for Long John Silver. <I>(whispers)</I>
Plunderin'!</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Brian - Erin! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin - I know, I know, I'm not
supposed to say anything, but isn't it exciting? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Brian - If our treasure hoard is
discovered by another crew, you can bet there's a woman at the bottom
of it. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Brian - The little girl's room? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - Yeah, the little girl's room.
I'm going to powder my parrot and check the seams on my trim.

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Minister - A wild, rolling, surging
ocean of love, on which we, as mere individuals, have no
control...unless we find it. Do you see what I say? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - Ahoy, Quinn. Ahoy hoy,
Farrrr-ther. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Minister - I'm a minister, not a
pirate priest! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - The important thing is, you

look too thrilled about things, either. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - Oh, no. I'm overjoyed to be
at this big family event. Day to day life on the sea isn't
humiliating enough. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Amy - Let's see, you be in seafarin'
college now?</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - Still pirate school, alas. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Amy - I have some vague recollections
of pirate school, but these days, you all signed a peace treaty
right? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria &ndash; Yeah, and they won't
let me carry my sword. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Amy - That's only because those
stinking landlubbers force us!</FONT></P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Minister - Love thy neighbors, love

</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(in the bathroom)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Amy - Hmm. I thought when I hit
thirty I would stop feeling out of place at these things. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - <I>You</I> feel out of place?
</FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Amy - You didn't notice my sisters
are so busy competing with each other that I don't even register on
their port or starboard? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - Yeah, but I thought ye were
above that! I mean, you're kind of... </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Amy - Cool? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - Um... </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Amy - I know, you can't say that to
me. Law of the junior pirates. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria &ndash; Glad ye respect it! . </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Amy - When I was young, with Helen
and Rita warring all the time, all they left for me to do was to
supply the cannonballs. Then, one day, I found myself running my own
ship with my own point of view, and feeling no particular obligation
to listen to anyone else's B.S without getting the urge to plunder
them! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - So it actually worked out for
thee. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Amy &ndash; Arrr! Unless I have to
see my fleabitten sisters at a wedding, yeah. Sailing the seven seas.
It's a great way to deal. <I>(puts on eyeglass like Daria's)</I> But,
you wouldn't know that, would you? </FONT>

</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Bridesmaid #3 - Not even the pirate
pep squad? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - Not even they. I'll be honest
with ye, Daphne: I just can't find the time. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Bridesmaid #1 - How come? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - Well, first of all, there's
my work. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Bridesmaid #2 - What do you do? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria &ndash; Being a pirate! What do
you take me for---a scholar? I oughta tie you to the mast of my ship!</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Bridesmaid #3 - Really? Wow. </FONT>
</P>

yar? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jake &ndash; Yar. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Rita - I'm just so sorry Mom couldn't
be here. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Helen - Don't worry, she'll get to
live it all when she has to sell half her hard-earned hoard when the
bill arrives. Jake, how about getting me another glass of grog? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jake - Gee honey, maybe you
shouldn't... </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Helen - Jake, no one tells the first
female pirate lawyer when she can have a bleedin' drink! I'd really
like some more grog! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jake - Right. <I>(leaves)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Helen &ndash; Thank ye!</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Rita - Helen, you're not bitter?. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Helen &ndash; Narr! Why would I,
Helen, be bitter? Your perfidious relatives deserve the best. You
always have. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Rita - Oh, so I should be have to
drift from wedding to wedding forever because I made a few bad
decisions? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Amy &ndash; Siblings ahoy! What are
you two arguin' about now? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Helen - Arguing? We're not doin' any
arguing!</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Amy - Still mad because the Captain
gave Rita a galleon and all he got ye was a rotting rowboat?  Lead to
war, as I recall---</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Rita - Amy, the things you remember. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Helen - It was a compact ship. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(at the head table)</I> </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - So, it turns out that you
could go through training and you could be up there working near
Treasure Island in under three months. Now I'm just waiting for my
brew. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Bridesmaid #1 - Wow. Is that true? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - <I>(sighs)</I> No, it be
untrue. I just made it up as my way of debauchin' ya! Also, I'm not
an exotic dancer, I don't eat seals, and I wasn't abducted by the
undersea fish people, contemptible though they be!</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Bridesmaid #1 &ndash; Eep!. </FONT>

</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Helen - No, my little party's just
beginning. Waiter! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jake - Here, I'll get you some coffee
and wedding cake. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Helen - Oh, Rita would love that,
seeing me balloon up right in front of her. She'd use it as an
opportunity to launch a new armada! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jake - Helen, ar, your loud voice
echoes through the hall--. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Helen - Oh, <I>no</I>! We don't want
a <I>scene</I>, do we? We don't want to spoil the <I>lovely pirate</I>
wedding that <I>lovely</I> Mother spent so much <I>lovely</I> loot

</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin - Oh, you know perfectly well
what's going on, Mother. Your rusty sailor friend is making a scene! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Paul - What do you mean pathetic? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Jake - Look in the clear blue coastal
water! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Helen - <I>(stands, swaying)</I> I
just want to say my piece, Rita. You may be the pretty one, you may
be the one Captain Mother loves, but I worked my damn butt off
through pirate law school while you were living it up in the
Caribbean! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Erin - Aunt Helen! Please! </FONT>

</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3><I>(at the head table, Daria and Amy
see the fight shift into full gear)</I> </FONT>
</P>

ugly. I suggest we flee while the chance still awaits us! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - Really? </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Amy - Let's go find a port that
serves cheese fries. You eat, I'll watch. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria <I>(to Luhrman)</I> - I'm, uh,
taking off. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Luhrman - Oh, sure, leave me to the
contemptible dogs. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - You can come if you want. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Luhrman - No, I'd rather sit and see
the carnage unfold.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Amy - Just Amy. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=3>Daria - Amy, is pirate life always
tawdry, stupid, and humiliating, or is it just a phase? </FONT>
</P>

caught in any more Barksdale Wars that is. <I>(looks inside)</I>
