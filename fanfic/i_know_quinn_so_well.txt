I KNOW QUINN SO WELL
Author's note:What do a cynic like Daria and a somewhat stuck up fashion
honcho like Sandi have in common? They may be of different worlds,and with
different ways of life,but they've got one thing in common----their love/hate
relationship with Quinn. With that in mind,I figured I'd come up with the
perfect parody in mind--I Know Him So Well,sung by Elaine Page and Barbara
Dickson,from the musicalChess.(remember One Night In Bangkok,sung by Murray
Head?) First the disclaimer,that Daria( not to mention Beavis & Butt Head) is
the trademark of MTV and Viacom,while the original I Know Him So Well is a
trademark of 3 Knights Ltd.,whatever you like it or not.OK, now that we dealt
with that,let's read on.........

Sandi:
When I started the Lawndale High Fashion Club
I hoped it would lead to all that fame
I first began with hirin' Tiffany
Then came Stacy Rowe--oh what a shame
Lookin' back on when Quinn first joined up that day
I thought she'd just give me------so much hell
but she was pert an' pretty just like me.
Now at least I know I know her well.
Wasn't she sweet?

Daria:
Oh,so sweet

Sandi:
Wasn't she kind?

Daria:
Oh,so kind

Sandi:
Yet she was shallow

Sandi & Daria:
And so refined

Sandi:
But in the end,I know Quinn's truly a friend to me--oh,can't they all see?

Daria:
She needs her fantasy an' fashions

Sandi:
I know Quinn so well.

Daria:
I knew Quinn before I went to Highland High,
dealin' with ol' Beavis an' Butt Head
Me an' Quinn would fight till I made her cry
Nowadays it's somethin' that I dread.
Lookin' back on when she called me her
cousin
(Sandi:Lookin' back,I've could've been a
diva somehow)
These days now,I love her,I can tell
(Sandi:I was just The Fashion Club
President)
But MTV wants me to tease her
(Sandi:Still at least I know Quinn well)

Daria & Sandi:
Still at least I know I know Quinn well.

Daria:
Wasn't she sweet?

Sandi:
Oh,so sweet.

Daria:
Wasn't she kind?

Sandi:
Oh,so kind.

Daria:
Yet she was shallow

Daria & Sandi:
And so refined
During those days,with The
3 J's,on a wing and a prayer,
she'd date them at Chez Pierre.

Daria:
Wasn't Quinn sweet?
Wasn't Quinn kind?

Sandi:
Yet she was shallow

Daria & Sandi:
And so refined

Sandi:
But in the end,I know Quinn's truly a friend to me--oh,can't they all see?

Daria:
She needs her fantasy an' fashions

Sandi:
I know Quinn so well......

Daria:
It took time to understand Quinn.

Sandi & Daria:
I know Quinn so well...........

OWARI (THE END)
