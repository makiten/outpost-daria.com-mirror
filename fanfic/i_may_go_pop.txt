I MAY GO POP

By M Man


(This episode was inspired by the revelation in Cafe Disaffecto that Daria
played the flute for a while in grade school.  It takes place during season
#1 when Daria still had a crush on Trent)


OPENING THEME - played on a flute (!)

La la la la la

Got to get off

Excuse me!  Excuse me!

Daria in "I May Go Pop"

SEGMENT 1 OF "I MAY GO POP"

(Kitchen at Lane residence.  Jane is working on an abstract sculpture at the
kitchen table.  Daria is sitting at the table reading "The Sea Wolf" by Jack
London.  Sounds of Mystik Spiral practicing a song come faintly from the
basement)

Jane:  Do you think music soothes the savage beast?

Daria:  "The Sea Wolf" isn't about a savage beast.  It's about the captain
of a seal-hunting ship.  Then again he was sort of ...

Jane:  No, I wasn't talking about your book.  I was talking about Trent.

(Mystik Spiral's music stops)

Daria:  Are you asking me if I think Trent's music soothes savage beasts, or
are you asking me if I think Trent IS a savage beast?

(before she can reply, Trent walks in)

Trent:  Hey, Janey.  Hey, Daria.

Daria:  (nervous around Trent) Hi, Trent.  New song?

Trent:  Yeah.  It doesn't sound right, though.  I think the melody needs
a higher-pitched sound.

Daria:  Can't Jesse sing falsetto?

Trent:  (coughs and laughs)  You're funny, Daria.  No, I meant the
accompaniment.  We need another instrument.  Something like a flute ...

Jane:  Hey!  You play the flute, Daria!  Now you can join Mystik Spiral!

Daria:  (annoyed) Shut up.

Trent:  I didn't know you play the flute, Daria.

Daria:  (still annoyed)  I don't.  I took lessons for a while in grade
school.  I wasn't any good at it.  And I don't even have a flute any more.
My Dad ran over my flute in the driveway years ago.  Broken beyond repair.

Trent:  Too bad, Daria.  You could have been really cool in Mystik Spiral.

Daria: (blushes slightly).  Uh, thanks.

(Trent turns to leave)

Trent:  (to himself)  Hmmm.  Falsetto .... ?

(Trent goes back downstairs)

Jane:  Come on, Daria.  That was your chance to break into show biz!  Buy
a flute!  Rent a flute!  Steal a flute!

Daria:  (firmly)  I will never play the flute again.

Jane:  Um, so what happened back there in grade school?

Daria:  I don't want to talk about it.

Jane:  I could keep Trent bugging you forever about joining Mystik Spiral,
or you could tell me ...

Daria:  (sigh)  You really want to hear about it?

Jane:  Of course!

Daria:  (big sigh) It all started after I took this test ...

(FLASHBACK to Morgendorffer home in Highland.  Jake, Helen, third-grader
Daria and second-grader Quinn are at the dinner table.  Jake's reading the
newspaper.  Meat loaf and mashed potatoes are on the plates.)

Jake:  (looking at the newspaper) If Calvin does so poorly in school, how is
it that he can spell "transmogrifier"?

Helen:  I don't know, Jake.  I got a call from ...

Jake:  And how does the transmogrifier turn Hobbes into a frog?

Helen:  He's just IMAGINING it, Jake, now about that call ...

Jake:  (angry)  Boy, I wish I'd had a transmogrifier when I was that age!
I'd have transmogrified my Dad into a ... !!!

Helen:  (scooping mashed potatoes from a serving bowl onto Jake's plate
and cutting him off)  Have some more mashed potatoes, Jake.  You can make a
transmogrifier out of them.

Jake:  Thanks!!  (begins to form the potatoes into a box shape)

Helen:  I was saying I got a call about a test Daria took at school last
week.

Quinn:  I took the same test, Mom!

Helen:  It seems Daria has qualified for advanced placement.

Daria:  I'm already in the Accelerated Reading Program.

Quinn:  Yeah, she's already a brain!

Helen:  This was about music.

Daria, Quinn and Jake:  Music?

Helen:  It seems you're musically gifted, Daria.

Daria:  How would they know?  I've never played an instrument.  I don't
remember anything about music on that test.

Helen:  Nevertheless, they say they can tell that you definitely have the
ability to play an instrument, even though you won't be old enough for
elementary band for a couple of years or so.

Daria:  Mom, I'd rather not ...

Helen:  Just TRY it, Daria!  All you do is read ALL the time!

Daria:  So now I'll be reading music instead of books?  

Helen: (sigh)

(SCENE - a small music practice room at Highland Elementary School.
A larger music room with tiers for a concert band is visible through
sound-proof windows.  There are no people in the larger room.

Daria and a another girl, Lisa, are both holding flutes, sitting across from
their instructor, Mrs. Beeman, a music teacher about 30 years old.

Daria and Lisa are facing the window.  Mrs Beeman is facing the girls.)

Beeman:  OK, girls, now hold the flute as I showed you.

(both girls hold the flute in the proper playing position)

Now, Lisa, blow across the mouthpiece.

(Lisa produces a reedy and weak but steady tone)

OK for a first try.  Now, Daria.

(Daria produces a loud squeak.  She blushes slightly.  Lisa cringes at
the sound.)

Daria:  (weakly) Sorry.

Beeman: Turn the flute a little toward yourself, Daria, and try again.  Don't
blow so hard.

(Daria produces a tone much like Lisa's this time)

That's better!  Now, girls, I'm going to show you how to finger three notes
today.  That will be enough for you to practice some simple tunes before
next lesson ...

(Grade-school-aged Beavis and Butt-head appear in the large music room,
looking through the window at Daria.  Both are making faces at Daria while
pursing their lips and holding up their hands and moving their fingers as
though they're playing flutes.

Daria smiles and starts to giggle at them.  Mrs. Beeman notices and
looks behind her.  She sees B&B.  She gets up and opens the door.)

Beeman: (shouting at B&B)  Hey, you two!  Get out of here!

(to Daria)  Friends of yours, Daria?

Daria:  Classmates.

Beeman:  They'll have to stay out of the music room during practice.  Unless
they play instruments?

Daria:  (smiling to herself) Not likely.

(Morgendorffer house in Highland.  Jake and Helen in the living room.  Jake
is reading the newspaper.  The sound of Daria playing "Mary Had a Little
Lamb" is heard from another room.  Daria is playing slowly and haltingly,
with a lot of mistakes.)

Helen:  (frowning)  I though they said she was musically gifted.

Jake:  (still looking at the newspaper) Why does Beetle Bailey never get
promoted to Corporal?

Helen:  (annoyed)  Jake, will you listen to me?!

Jake:  Huh?  (enthusiastically) Yeah, doesn't Daria sound great?

Helen:  (angry)  No, Jake, she doesn't!

Jake:  (surprised)  She doesn't?  (attention drifting again)  They tried to
make me into a bugler in military school.  (angry)  I always wanted Dad to
buy me a guitar, but noooo ...

Helen:  (resignedly)  Oh, forget it, Jake! (grimaces as she continues to
listen to Daria's flute-playing.)

SEGMENT 2 OF "I MAY GO POP"

(SCENE - Present-day Lawndale.  Jane's bedroom.  Daria and Jane are sitting
in front of the TV, a remote control between them.  The TV is not on.)

Jane:  So these boyfriends of yours - what did you say their names were ...?

Daria:  They were NOT my boyfriends, and I DIDN'T say what their names were.

Jane:  (teasing)  Oooh.  A touchy subject!

Daria:  (with a faraway look, as if she's remembering)  If you'd known those
two, you wouldn't even joke about them.  Making faces during my music lesson
was about the mildest thing they ever did.

Jane:  OK, so you started taking flute lessons.  Why are you so adamant
now that you won't play the flute?

Daria:  (picks up the remote)  Let's watch TV.

Jane:  I see.  Changing the subject.

(Daria turns on the TV)

TV:  (Sick Sad World Theme and announcer)  She lost her concert gown, but she
still made beautiful music!  The Nudist Flutist - next on Sick Sad World!

Daria:  (very deadpan and sarcastic)  Nudist flutist.  Of course.  To
celebrate Let's-pick-on-Daria-about-her-flute-Day.

(Daria switches to another channel)

TV:  And now, the Highbrow Channel proudly presents Mozart's
"The Magic Flute".

Daria:  ARGGHHH!

(switches to another channel)

TV:  (sound of dramatic background music used for football highlights)

Jane:  The Pigskin Channel?  Since when are you a football fan?

Daria:  Since I realized football has nothing to do with flutes.

TV:  And now, the Pigskin Channel presents:  Legends of the Game.
Tonight, the Life and Legend of Doug Flutie!

Daria:  (exploding) Argghhh!  FLUTIE?  They named a football player after a
FLUTE???

Jane:  Actually, I don't think ...

(Daria switches off the TV and puts down the remote)

Daria: (downcast) I guess I know when I'm beat.  It's my day to talk about
flutes.

Jane:  Specifically about your grade-school lessons.  So what happened next?

Daria:  Well, we had a recital scheduled ...

(SCENE - Highland Elementary.  Third-grade Daria, Lisa and Mrs Beeman in the
practice room as before)

Beeman:  Well, girls, you've only been taking lessons a short while,
but since you're both gifted, I think you can both be ready to participate
in our recital next month.  I'll give you simple tunes, of course.

(Hands a piece of sheet music to Lisa)

Lisa, you're going to play "London Bridge is Falling Down".

Lisa:  Isn't that a bit childish?

Beeman:  You have to start with simple tunes, Lisa.

(Hands a piece of sheet music to Daria)

And Daria, you're going to play "Pop Goes the Weasel".

Daria:  Excuse me?  That's REALLY childish.

Beeman:  As I told Lisa, you have to start simple.  You'll find these
tunes challenging enough.

(Scene - Morgendorffer home in Highland.  Quinn's bedroom.  Quinn is
playing with Barbie dolls along with her three second-grade friends Mandy,
Lacey and T'ai Li - who bear an uncanny resemblance to Sandi, Stacy and
Tiffany of the present-day Fashion Club.

Coming from another room, the sound of Daria practicing "Pop Goes the Weasel"
can be heard.  Daria is playing the tune very badly.

Lacey holds up her Barbie doll.  The doll has on a plaid dress and ankle
socks.)

Lacey:  Isn't this new outfit really cute?

Mandy:  Uh, Lacey, no offense, but ankle socks are soooo first-grade.

T'ai Li:  Yahhh,  Firrrst graaade.

Lacey:  (Cringing) Sorry!

(Helen enters the room)

Helen:  What would you girls like to drink?  Mandy?

Mandy:  Diet Coke, please, Mrs. Morgendorffer.

Helen:  Lacey?

Lacey:  Uh, diet orange, if that's okay?

Helen:  T'ai Li?

T'ai Li:  Dieeet Pepsiiii.

Helen:  Quinn?

Quinn:  Diet lemon-lime!

(Helen leaves to get drinks)

Quinn:  (holding up Ken doll)  Who do you think Ken looks like?
Donnie, Davey or Derek?

(Morgendorffer living room.  Daria's playing of "Pop Goes the Weasel" can
still be heard.  Jake is reading the newspaper.  Helen is carrying a trayful
of soft drinks for Quinn and her friends.  She stops to talk to Jake.)

Helen:  Jake, do you think there's something wrong with second-graders
all asking for DIET sodas?

Jake:  No?  (Helen frowns)  Uh, yes?  Maybe?

Helen:  Oh, forget it, Jake.  I'm starting to think we made a mistake
encouraging Daria to take music lessons.

Jake:  We did?  Oh, yeah, we did!!

Helen:  (angry)  Jake, don't you pay attention to anything??!!

(walks out with the drinks)

Jake: (returning to the newspaper) (to himself)  Why doesn't Snoopy ever fall
off his doghouse?

(Helen returns to Quinn's bedroom with the drinks.  The girls are still
playing with their Barbie dolls.  Helen starts passing out the drinks.
"Pop Goes the Weasel" can still be heard.  Daria continues to play
badly.)

Quinn:  Mom, can't Daria practice somewhere else?  We're trying to
do something serious here!

Helen:  Now, Quinn, your sister is gifted in music and ...

Quinn:  It sure doesn't SOUND like it!

Helen:  (as though she doesn't quite believe it)  Give her some time, Quinn.
Just give her some time.

(Helen leaves)

Quinn: (to the other girls)  If we ever move away from here, I'm telling
everyone at my new school that Daria's my cousin!

Mandy:  Good idea, Quinn.

Lacey:  Yeah, Quinn.  Good idea!

T'ai Li:  Yahhh.  Cousinnnn.

(Scene - Daria's bedroom in Highland - continuing to play "Pop Goes the
Weasel".  She has a music stand in front of her.  She continues to play
badly, grimacing while she plays.  Then Daria stops playing)

Daria:  (to herself)  Who am I kidding?  Musically gifted?  Me?

(sigh)  Pop Goes the *Weasel*?

(another big sigh)  *I* may go pop!!

SEGMENT 3 OF "I MAY GO POP"

(SCENE - Present-day Lawndale.  Jane's bedroom.  Jane is painting at an
easel.  Daria is stretched out, laying on Jane's bed.)

Jane:  Hmmm.  So, at this point, you're suspecting you're not really a
gifted musician?

Daria:  Or any kind of a musician.

Jane:  Come on, Daria, you were, what?, eight years old?
So you didn't play in the recital?

Daria:  Oh, yeah.  I played.  Do we have to talk about this?

Jane:  I think Trent's still looking for a flutist.

Trent:  Or a falsetto-ist.  (Sigh)  OK.  You've heard this much.  I guess
I can tell you the rest  ....

(BACK to Highland Elementary.  Daria and Lisa are in the practice room with
Mrs Beeman.  Daria is playing the last notes of "Pop Goes the Weasel", a
little haltingly, but much better than before.  She finishes.)

Beeman:  Well, Daria, I had my doubts, but I think you've got it.  A little
polishing and you'll be ready for the recital next Saturday.

Daria:  Do you have any polish?

Beeman:  Uh, pardon me?

Daria:  Sorry.  Bad joke.  You really think I'm ready for a recital?

Beeman:  Yes, I do, Daria.  I've heard some of the other kids in this
accelerated program - clarinetists, trombonists, trumpeters.  You're
not the absolute best, but I think you're better than most.

Daria:  (sarcastic) That's encouraging.  Are these people really so gifted
if most of them are worse than I am?

Beeman:  It all takes lots of practice, Daria.  Even for the gifted.  You're
all still beginners.

(SCENE - Recital time.  Highland Elementary.  The tiers in the large music
room are filled with folding chairs for the audience, forming an
amphitheater.  There's a seat in front, facing the audience, for the
performers.  The audience is full.  Quinn, Jake, Helen, and Daria are seated
together (in that order).  Up front, a hefty boy about Daria's age is playing
"Stars and Stripes Forever" on a trumpet.)

Daria: (in a very low voice, singing along)  Be kind to your web-footed
friends, for a duck may be somebody's mother ...

(Helen elbows Daria and holds a finger to her mouth, signalling for Daria
to be quiet.  Daria smirks but stops singing.

The boy finishes the song.  The audience applauds.  Mrs Beeman gets up from
a front-row seat and stands before the audience.)

Mrs Beeman:  Thank you, Morton.  That was very good.

(Morton takes a bow and returns to his seat.)

And now, one of our promising flutists, Daria Morgendorffer, will play "Pop
Goes the Weasel"!

(At the very back of the audience, we see Beavis and Butt-head sneaking in,
keeping their heads down so they can hide behind the last row.

Daria gets up and sits in front of the audience.  She start to play.  Rather
well.)

"All around the cobbler's bench, the monkey chased the weasel.  The monkey
thought 'twas all in fun.  POP!..."

(At this point Beavis "pops" up behind the audience, making a face, then
quickly hides behind the back row again.  Daria sees him and smiles slightly
but keeps playing.)

"...goes the weasel.  Johnny's got the whooping cough and Mary's got the
measles.  That's the way the money goes.  POP! ..."

(Now Butt-head quickly "pops" up behind the audience, then hides again.
Daria is now starting to giggle and it's affecting her playing.  Some of the
audience turn around to see what she's laughing at.  Mrs Beeman turns around
too.)

"...goes the weasel.  A penny for a spool of thread, a penny for a needle.
That's the way the money goes.  POP! ... "

(Both Beavis and Butt-head pop up this time.  Now the audience is laughing.
Daria is laughing so hard she has to stop playing.)

Mrs Beeman:  (At B&B, furiously) You two again!!  You'll be suspended for
this!!  I'll ...

(Beavis and Butt-head run away, laughing uncontrollably.  Then we see Daria
still laughing at the front of the room, and Mrs Beeman fuming.)


(BACK to present-day Lawndale.  Daria and Jane are in the same positions
we last saw them in, in Jane's bedroom.)

Jane:  So the boys-with-no-names ruined your recital.  Did Helen throw a fit?

Daria:  Well, she didn't blame *me*.  She knew what those two little monsters
were like.  But Mrs Beeman seemed to think that maybe I'd put them up to it.

Jane:  So you were kicked out of flute lessons?

Daria:  Worse.  Mrs. Beeman decided that since I hadn't successfully
completed "Pop Goes the Weasel", I'd have to play it at the next recital in
six months.

Jane:  Sooo ...

Daria:  Yeah.  I had to practice the SAME song for six MORE months if I
wanted to continue, or rather, if my mother wanted me to continue.  She
threatened to take away my television privileges if I quit ...

Jane:  Cruel and unusual punishment!!!

Daria:  ... so I continued to play the last month of the school year.  Mom,
Dad and Quinn were starting to go insane listening to "Pop Goes the Weasel"
over and over again, not that I felt any better about it than they did.
Nobody complained when I stopped playing over the summer.  But when I started
fourth grade, Mom insisted I take lessons from Mrs. Beeman again.  After
another month of "Pop Goes the Weasel", Mom went to Mrs. Beeman and tried to
get her to assign me a different recital piece.  Mrs Beeman refused to do
that, so Mom told me I could stop until she found me another flute teacher.
But I never heard her mention it again.

Jane:  So why did the flute end up in the driveway a year later for your
father to run over?  (pause)  You didn't leave it there on purpose, did
you?

Daria:  Since I was in fifth grade at the time, I'll take the fifth
amendment.

Jane:  As is your constitutional right!  Well, thanks for the story, Daria.
Now won't you tell me the names of the two boys who went "pop"?

Daria:  You ask me that again and I may exercise my second amendment rights.

Jane:  Still touchy about those two?  OK.

(Trent enters the room.)

Trent: Hey!  Janey!  Daria!  Jesse's doing a great falsetto!

Jane and Daria:  You're kidding!

Trent:  Want to come downstairs and listen?

Jane and Daria: NO!!!!!!

Trent:  (after a pause)  You two are weird!

(Trent leaves.)

Jane:  Maybe we should go see.  Jesse singing falsetto?  My mind boggles.

Daria:  I think mine just went pop.

END OF FANFIC "I MAY GO POP"

******

Notes by M Man:

The title, obviously, was inspired both by the Daria theme song and by
the title of Daria's recital piece.

Altering the opening theme (by playing it on a flute) is not unprecedented.
The theme was altered for episode #307 (Daria!) and played calliope-style.

For those not familiar with "Calvin and Hobbes", it was a comic strip that
ran from 1985 to 1995.  It featured a perpetually six-year-old boy with a
stuffed tiger and a very vivid imagination.  He had a cardboard box which
he called a "Transmogrifier", on which he drew "controls" with crayons.  In
his imagination, this machine could turn any being or object into any other
being or object.  The Highland events of "I May Go Pop" take place in the
early '90s, when "Calvin and Hobbes" was still running.

Lisa, in case you're wondering, is the name of an old girlfriend of mine.
Yes, she played the flute.

"Beetle Bailey" is a military-inspired comic strip.  The title character
is a perpetual private in the US Army.

The Magic Flute is the actual title of a Mozart opera.

The surname of pro quarterback Doug Flutie, as far as I know, is not derived
from the name of any musical instrument.  But I could be wrong :-)

The Pigskin Channel has been mentioned in several Daria episodes - most
notably "The Lab Brat".

The inspiration for Mandy, Lacey, T'ai Li, Davey, Donnie and Derek came from
the episode "Camp Fear", in which it is implied that Quinn has always
fallen in with a group of friends similar to those she has in Lawndale.

Despite a common ancestry and name,  T'ai Li is not related to Angela Li.
Don't go there.

Need I mention that Snoopy was Charlie Brown's dog in the late, great
comic strip Peanuts?  Or that Snoopy always slept on top of his doghouse,
never inside?  As with "Calvin and Hobbes", "Peanuts" was still running
in the early '90s, when Daria was a third-grader.

The lyrics of "Pop Goes the Weasel" are not there to imply that anyone was
singing during Daria's recital.  They're only there to enable the reader
to follow where Daria is in the song when B&B pull their shenanigans.

If you don't know who Beavis and Butt-head are - well, to those who
understand, no explanation is necessary; to those who don't, no explanation
is possible. :-)

There are three references to the US Constitution.  All pertain to the
first ten amendments, known as the "Bill of Rights".  Amendment 8 states,
among other things, that "cruel and unusual punishments" shall not be
inflicted.  The Fifth Amendment states that no person "shall be compelled
in any criminal case to be a witness against himself" (the act of refusing
to incriminate youself is colloquially called "taking the fifth"). The
hotly-debated Second Amendment guarantees the right to "keep and bear arms".
I hope this constitutional explanation is informative for non-American
readers and completely superfluous for American readers. :-(

"Be Kind to Your Web-Footed Friends" is a humorous campfire song sung to the
tune of John Philip Sousa's patriotic march "Stars and Stripes Forever".

The "Nudist Flutist" was a supposed girlfriend of Dick Martin, co-host of
the 1960s comedy "Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In".
