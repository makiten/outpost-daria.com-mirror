"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;All
right, Jacob - what do you think of this?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sitting at a
prep counter in the kitchen of Chez Pierre - Lawndale's four-star restaurant
(and frequent stomping grounds of one Quinn Morgendorffer, fledgling man-magnet
and trophy-wife-in-training), Jake Morgendorffer looked up from the laptop
computer he was working at to see a sliver of raw fish on a saucer... held aloft
by the sexiest female hand in recorded history. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>He took the sliver of fish and sniffed it gently. &quot;You
used one of the older blades to slice this... I can just barely smell the tang of
the metal on the tuna.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Jake slid the sliver into his mouth, allowing the
gourmet-quality tuna to practically dissolve upon his tongue. &quot;You can
taste the metal. You wouldn't dare serve this tuna to any true
aficionado.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Lauriel de la Ribas, the head chef and star attraction of Chez
Pierre, walked around the counter from her cutting board, placing a second
sliver of tuna on the saucer. &quot;VERY good. Now, try this...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Jake sniffed, then took in the scent of the tuna with a deep
breath. &quot;You sliced this with the bone knife - and used red wine to mute
the tuna's natural scent...&quot; He tasted the tuna, and a look of pure pleasure
moved across his face like sunlight. &quot;Italian wine... no... something from the
Simi Valley?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I like to experiment, &quot; Lauriel said, the light
playing off her large, dark, anime-class eyes as she placed the saucer down.
&quot;How would you cook this, Jacob?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I'd slice the tuna into steaks and smoke them over an
open fire with flavored chips and fresh herbs,&quot; Jake said, turning back to
his laptop. &quot;I think that apple chips would add a complexity that your
guests would enjoy - maybe a touch of coriander...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;You like to take chances and experiment in the kitchen
just as much as I do,&quot; Lauriel laughed, and not for the first time, Jake
looked up at her with an appreciative gaze Lauriel knew was only partly
directed at her physicality. She was used to the stares of men, but not as used
to the gazes of men who respected her skills as a chef (as amateur chef Jake
certainly did). In his case, however, she felt that she could get used to it...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>As for Jake - Lauriel was, quite simply, the most beautiful
woman he had ever met. She was in her mid-thirties, of Spanish descent, and
towered over Jake at a solid six-foot-three, with a slender, softly curved form
that could elicit envy from Seven of Nine. Her other physical features - a
complexion of flawless bronze, light-streaked ebony hair (naturally shaggy and
nearly waist-long) tied back into a bouncy ponytail, a gentle smile capable of
removing intelligent thought from almost any man - made Lauriel and her
fledgling cable cooking program a ratings success... and removed almost any
chance of her having any true female friends, not to mention making her a
target for every prowling wannabe playboy in sight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When Lauriel
came to Jake to hire him as a consultant - she needed help preparing her show
for a national scale, as she was being scouted by the Food Network - the
subject of them being able to work together without 'losing sight of the ball'
came up in conversation. Jake put her fears to rest right away: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;If I sat here and told you that I didn't think you were
a very pretty girl, you'd call me a liar and walk right out of here. The point
is - I'm not here to hit on women, I'm here to make money by helping you make
money. If anything else happens - it'll cost us money. I can do the math. I'd
rather make money than make advances that'll cost me an account and wouldn't be
welcomed anyway.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>&quot;Besides,&quot;</i>
he said, <i>&quot;I'm married. I take that seriously - but more importantly, so
does my wife. If I cheated on her - I'm afraid of what I'd wake up and find
next to me in bed!&quot;<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It had taken
five months of hard work - not to mention nearly firing Jake twice before she
realized his business style was unusual (but for the people she'd been dealing
with in television, right on the money), but it had been worth it for Lauriel.
Besides the success of her program 'North of the Border', she had also gained a
good friend in Jake...<i><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Yes,
but you get paid to experiment - I get 'the look' whenever I suggest preparing
anything other than 'Microwave Masters'-brand family-size lasagna, &quot; Jake
said, shaking his head. &quot;Oh, look, girls - Jake's about to remove the
flavor from the food.' It gets annoying sometimes, trying to show Helen and the
kids that there's more to the culinary arts than just labeling things as 'fuel
for the body' and 'fuel for the body that tastes good.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;You get
off easy - I get 'Hey, senorita, how's about moving those jalapenos over
here?&quot; or &quot;Just what else on the menu's good and hot?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;You
wanna tag off? You can have my kids, and the jerks can watch my rear as I walk
away! Oh, but you'd have to sleep with my wife - and now I won't be able to get
THAT image out of my head with a block and tackle...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;As
though you'd want to, &quot; Lauriel smirked, popping open a bottle of water.
&quot; Keep it up, Idea Boy. The idiots will never know what type of meat I
serve them, and I'll save a bundle on consulting fees.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Draining half
the bottle, Lauriel recapped it and turned to Jake. &quot;Let me ask you
something, Jacob. I've been a pain in the butt for you on occasion over the
past few months. Why didn't you cut my account loose? Despite the little speech
you gave me in our first meeting, you're not Mr. 'Greed Is Good, Greed
Works.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Simple
- I still plan to have my way with you,&quot; Jake said, his deadpan answer an
exact replica of Daria's trademark delivery. &quot;The truth is, I understand
where your frustrations were coming from, and I didn't take it
personally.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Why
not?&quot;<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I could
tell that you're not really not like that. You're nervous and a little scared
about being a beautiful, successful woman in a field traditionally dominated by
men, Lauriel. Sometimes, you don't take well to anything unusual or different,
because you had to take 'by the book' as a way of life - otherwise, you'll get
accused of sleeping your way up the ladder.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Jake reached for a small bowl filled with fresh orange slices,
and ate several<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>before he continued on. &quot;I can understand that - I've
dealt with it before. Good Lord -have I dealt with it before. You see, the
trick was to get you past the 'pain in the ass' stage to a position where you
can trust me to be there for you. I figured that once I did that, we could work
together to get some work done. Basically, it's like being a mother, a boss and
a best friend all at the same time.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Oh,

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;You
have a truly warped sense of humor, lady,&quot; Jake shot back, but not
unkindly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;One
day, I might just show you,&quot; she teased. &quot;Do you have any idea what I
can do with slaked ice, spiked rubber boots and a melon baller?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

one eye in an exaggerated manner. &quot;Are you trying to seduce me, Lady de la
Ribas?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

have to <u>wonder</u> about it, Jacob, then the answer is no.&quot; Lauriel
said, fluttering her eyelashes in the same exaggerated fashion just as a
bone-thin man bounced into the kitchen, his overmoussed hair rock-steady as he
moved with a dramatic flair common to those people who believe they're born to
be on the stage or the screen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Sorry to interrupt your sexually-charged moment of
honest and quiet reflections on the state of your relationship,&quot; Victor
Phillipe huffed, the television-version French accent he spoke in making Jake
wince. &quot;However, we are starting to receive guests for this evening's
closed dinner party. The Sloanes do wish to see you beforehand - I believe that
they want you to -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

their young prize stallion off to the stable and let him prance upon my wild
oats,&quot; Lauriel said. &quot;I've said it before, you phony little frog - I
don't mingle or hop on a pedestal for the guests unless <i><u>I</u></i> want
to. Through my creations, I provide these individuals with a singularly unique
experience in world-class culinary gratification; one that assures that they
more than get their money's worth. And you know what? Because I AM that good at
what I do, I don't screw my guests AND I don't have to - in any fashion
whatsoever. Bring me another message or invitation like that, and I'll snap
your damned head off.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Victor gave
the two of them a truly disapproving look. &quot;While we French understand the
lure of l'amour, we also understand why discretion should be a married man's
intention.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

huffed once again as he turned and left. &quot;A nation full of fools like him,
and they still thought banning absinthe was a good idea,&quot; Lauriel growled.
&quot;Jerk. He's been giving the owners an earful of 'the chef's got her latest
boy-toy with her today'. Like he hasn't tried time and again.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a wall rack. &quot;However, he and the guys won't be back for hours, so you'll

do well in his class. I could really use that when I go off to school - that

playing celebrity headshrinker for a few years had been a big help with
location, too, he thought, if not with the assignment in and of itself. He
wasn't 'JUST another teacher'. Most of the other instructors at Lawndale High
School had to make do with apartments or small homes; he luxuriated in a
split-level domicile that could have doubled for an executive's weekend getaway
home. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Having my own money helps. Oh, not that Uncle Sammy doesn't
kick in more than his share by giving me two checks - one REALLY big one as a
civilian contractor, and the other for still wearing the dress blues. Even if
I'm officially just a reserve officer... even that doesn't matter, because that's
one of the great things about America. If you live in a certain area, dress in
a specific manner appropriate with that area, and spend money accordingly -
then no one really questions where it comes from or who you really are. Thank
God for the almighty dollar.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Besides, knowing that a psychologist was a neighbor tended to
keep the unusually curious Lawndalians at arm's length. After all, he might
write another book someday, because the one he did before did so well, and
because it was his doctoral thesis, he might want to use something fresher this
time... Nevertheless, he still had more than his share of invites to parties,
barbecues and dinners. He'd go from time to time, and someone would inevitably
ask about his profession - and beat around the bush about some slip of the
tongue, some imagined mental problem, or if a dream about playing in a water
fountain with an acquaintance of the same sex meant that they were repressing
homosexual tendencies. Kyle had learned long ago how to handle those with a
gentle hand. However, he had no problem with setting a particularly obnoxious
or annoying person back on their haunches:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>'So, tell me, Doctor,&quot; sneered the woman, a particularly
attractive Nordic blonde model whose imperious attitude somehow STILL failed to
detract from her physical perfection. &quot;It's quite obvious that, when you
look around the room, that Jatan and I are the most beautiful and desirable
women in sight.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Kyle looked away from the woman to cast an examining eye upon
the willowy beauty a few steps away, with flawless, glistening skin of a dark,
rich chocolate hue and slightly catlike eyes of sparkling jade. He gave her a
half-smile, and turned back to the lovely Icelandic woman with slight scorn in
his tone.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Mock all you want, but you know that you want me. Every
man here wants to sleep with both of us - and most of the women, too. There
isn't a single man here who wouldn't kill to have one or both of use on his
arm. Some might say that I have problems with my ego - what do you say?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kyle caught
his reflection in the window. He was African-American, about average in
appearance - six-foot-one, just over two hundred pounds, fit but not a fitness
freak, with his hair cut neat and short. He had almond-brown eyes, a couple of
shades darker than his skin color, which held a noticeable sharpness in them
that fluctuated from the fluid concentration of a scholar, to the watchful
glare of a predator, waiting for prey to appear...<span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Two young women, both uncomfortably beautiful, drove past in a
BMW roadster with the top down as he turned towards the street, and they waved
at him as they passed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Excellent pickings in the hunting grounds this season</span></i><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>, he thought to himself. <i>It's
almost a shame I don't have time to really get out and wander amongst the local
villagers. Although - that one with the short black hair... I'll be sure to try
to meet up with HER again, if the chance arises.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>And that thought sputtered for a moment as he remembered his
disastrous meetings with the local African-American unity coalition, a number
of years back. Being such a small portion of the Lawndale landscape, the
African-American population was determined to make certain that they were
noticed - and with Kyle's arrival, they felt (even though he wasn't going to be
a full-time resident) that he would become a strong, and vocal, member of their
group -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Maybe he could have handled himself better - but regardless,
the meeting had gone terribly, and most of the affluent African-Americans in
town would have little to do with him from that point on. Maybe he should have
tried to put in some time with one of the local groups, or done some weekend
work with the Lawndale Urban League's T.S.T.M. (Tomorrow's Scientists,
Technicians and Managers) Program, or just made one hell of a donation to the
unity coalition. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Maybe he shouldn't have gotten pissed off when someone called
him 'Oreo!' because he had gone out a couple of times with Leah O'Dell, a Ph.D.
in literature from Belfast who was teaching Irish and Welsh folklore at
Middleton. It wasn't anything serious - hell, they hadn't even driven in the
same cars - but some tongues just have to wag, and he wasn't in any mood that
night to give the comment the attention it deserved (which, he admitted later,
was none). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Maybe he shouldn't have stood up angrily and said, &quot;This
is just a chocolate-covered 'Peyton Place', and you're all Lawndale County
hypocrites! Lift every voice and sing about THAT!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>He shouldn't have gotten angry about that, but that little
bastard had hit a sore spot for him. He didn't date much growing up - okay, try
'at all'. Boy, did his brothers all give him hell for that, and Kyle still
seethed when he remembered his father's asinine remarks about he must be a
faggot - if he's not, then he'd get out of those books and into some girl's
pants every once in a while! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

kids weren't any better. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Hey, Kyle. You don't like watermelon, you can't play
basketball, you don't watch 'Soul Train' or read 'Jet' or 'Ebony' - what kind
of black person are you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>If there was one thing Kyle Armalin truly hated, it was being
told - and especially by other people of his race - what constituted 'the Black
experience'. He despised growing up in the malaise-filled, courtesy-deprived,
lower-middle class area of a small city in Ohio that lived for sports, the
weekend and any good dollop of filthy, hurtful gossip. He hated the mindset of
the school district, which downplayed 'learning' as opposed to 'education',
which the local 'conformity camps' (his term for the schools) provided in
abundance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>He hated being alone all the time. He hated how he'd have to
buy sack lunches. He did, though, opting to eat a ham salad sandwich, a small
handful of carrot sticks, an apple and sip a carton of milk in places like a
bathroom stall or out on the bleachers of the baseball field. That way, he
wouldn't have to search for an empty table to eat at by himself, because no one
would offer him a seat. That way, he wouldn't feel the all-too-familiar
sensation of burning shame and frustration, because he hated the snickers and
outright laughter that would follow him as he would wander about the huge
cafeteria, sometimes having to stand against a wall and eat there... He hated
not being able to find out-of-the-way places to just be alone and not feel
lonely for a few moments, and hated the way he was constantly browbeaten into
doing things he didn't care for or want to do, just to make everyone around him
happy... or to at least shut their mouths about 'the weird things he was into...' <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Like reading.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>But Kyle absolutely, truly and without hesitation loathed the
people who always said 'It you don't do (insert your choice here) - then you're
not a real Black person!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Kyle grew to abhor everything around him, shutting himself off
from anything resembling social interaction, and he was learning how to lash
out at the people around him. The final straw began to bend when he turned
eleven, and he began to study martial arts. The more difficult (and deadlier)
forms held his attention longer and more effectively, and he was a horrifically
fast learner - he gained his black belt rating in Isshinryu Karate in just
under a year, and a brown belt in tae kwon do about five months later. He had
also begun to fiddle with the truly devastating facets of the form known as
ninjitsu...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Things really got out of hand during the middle of his
sophomore year, just before Thanksgiving. He was riding his bicycle into a
local hangout, and accidentally scratched the paint on a car belonging to a
cheerleader girlfriend of a varsity football player. Words were exchanged - the
kids didn't really care for the sullen bookworm who didn't seem to want to
socialize, and Kyle certainly didn't care for any of them... Like water running
downhill, blows were certain to be exchanged.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Except that Kyle decided on that day that, like the passage
said, it was better to give than to receive. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>He was tired, and he wasn't happy, and he was lonely. He was
so alienated from (and shunned by) his peers that he hadn't had an actual
conversation with someone his own age in over three weeks; the instructors in
his school avoided him because he was incredibly intelligent but made no effort
to show his skills in class. He simply turned in his assignments (some so well
done that some teachers would keep them as examples of how the work should be
done), and just sit back in their classes, saying nothing...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Nobody ever thought of reaching out to him. After all, there
were other smart students, who weren't so WEIRD, and were prettier, or more
vivacious, or just more fun to be around. After all, who would you rather have
in your class - HIM, or that unbelievably beautiful blonde, the one who's
barely five feet tall, but already wears a 36C cup, has a face that fuels
fantasies for a week AND already has a serious taste for college-level calculus
and trig? Oh - don't forget that she turns seventeen two days before Christmas...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>That was the day that he simply lashed out. It was coming,
without a doubt. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>The final tally was fourteen football players, four
cheerleaders (Kyle wasn't a sexist) as well as five adults and eight teens who
wanted in on the fun and learned the hard way to mind their own damn business.
The least severe of the injuries to the opposition included a sprained back,
two sharply bruised noses, and a few broken fingers. Kyle himself only suffered
a black eye, and being sucker-punched was when he flipped the 'on' switch that
left blood smears, vomit, teeth and the remains of voided bladders in a hellish
circle surrounding the spot where he had placed his bicycle. In less than four
minutes, Kyle had effectively decapitated the Fort Christian high school
football team, solidified a high ranking on EVERYONE's 'don't fuck with' list
in the area, and provided the owners of the eatery with a story that they told
to customers until they retired....<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>All he had wanted was a large order of steak fries.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>It was about that time that the Professor came into his life.
The courts and his family were only too eager to turn Kyle over to the erudite
gentleman in the wheelchair, and after three years with him, Kyle had learned
many lessons about himself and others. Enough to let the anger go; enough to
choose a course of helping out others - to give something back, but in his way.
That course led him to the U.S. Naval Academy and to the U. S. Marine Corps...
and to other, more discreet organizations...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Surprisingly, it also let him to teaching. Not that he
disliked teachers, but the ones he had were of the 'We're here to EDUCATE you -
do as we say!' variety. He always figured that it was a way of passing on what
the Professor gave him; it also made him slightly happy to think that several
teachers were whirling in their graves at the thought of him in front of a
classroom of impressionable teens. Piss on all of you, and let maggots
gang-bang in your rotted ears.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>As for that girl, the Professor would say, 'If you want to, go
talk to her. But do it because <u>you</u> want to talk to <u>her</u>. Once you
understand that, you won't worry about things like that anymore.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Well, I already made my decision in that area. Thank you, sir,</span></i><span

flipped through the sheaf of papers. <i>Thank you for everything.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

wonder if I'll find anyone worthwhile. I wonder if the kids will learn
anything, or try to... I wonder if I'll be able to complete the assignment on
schedule.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

wants to be part of a group - but whose people skills will soon atrophy through
lack of use to such a level that even someone who simply approaches you in a
forceful manner will be seen as threatening,&quot; Helen fired back. She
noticed the way Jane glanced away so Daria couldn't see her expression, but
chose not to use it against her daughter... <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

exchanged whimsical glances. &quot;-Or in a sanitarium. If you're REALLY
unconcerned about being around other people - you could end up in a dirty
apartment off a fourth-floor freight elevator, sharing your two rooms and a
bath with sixteen cats, a plain mattress and box spring, four dresses from a

understand why you guys think the 'Big M's' food's will be so horrible,&quot;
Jane queried, looking at the downcast and sullen expressions at the table as
Jake focused his attention back to the stove. &quot;It doesn't smell bad-&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

dear, Jake's cooking is like sex in the 1950's,&quot; Helen said, momentarily
forgetting her audience as she sipped her coffee. &quot;It fills you up and

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Did I
mention how they're looking for the next makeover - not to mention 'the
Makeover of the Year,&quot; Helen purred, her eyes now catlike slits.
&quot;First - a COMPLETE bedroom makeover. Then, an all-expenses paid, two-week
trip to L.A. for a $50,000 shopping spree in Beverly Hills with the stars of
the WB Network show 'Charmed' - as well as a walk-on role on the show. There's
an intensive one-day motivational workshop with Anthony Robbins, workout
sessions with Richard Simmons, and complete hairstyling, body massage and
facial sessions followed by a photo shoot with photographers and stylists from
'Vogue' and 'Val' magazines - so you can appear on the covers! You'll also have
appearances on 'Hollywood Squares', 'The Tonight Show', 'Politically
Incorrect', and 'Street Smarts - and a lunch date with Jason-Shane Scott and
David Fumero from the ABC soap opera 'One Life To Live!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jane
unconsciously moved a couple of inches away from Daria, whose face was
beginning to lose all color, while Quinn listened to the description of the
'Makeover of the Year' - her face flushed with what could only be labeled as
desire. &quot;Then there's the highlight of your trip to L.A. - a dinner date
and private concert with 'O-Town'. 'Entertainment Tonight' and several teen
magazines'll tape it all - COMPLETE media coverage... Did I mention the new VW
Beetle you'll get, color-coordinated to match your wardrobe, or the $25,000 in
spending money you'll receive?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

lights in the room went dim...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Daria helped
Jane up off the floor, then turned baleful eyes upon her mother.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;You've

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Helen's face didn't give away a smidgen of emotion - or even
remotely attest to the fact that she'd already entered Daria in the competition
- OR that she was ALREADY in the contest's semifinals. The owner of the
magazine - 'Val' herself - had actually called upon finding out about the
entry, saying that she was looking forward to redeeming herself by getting a
chance to rehabilitate the girl she had made notorious nationwide as 'D - the
Anti-Teen'...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;However, I've always been told that a healthy appetite
is a sign of a healthy teenager.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At that
moment, Daria was firmly convinced that it was a drop of her mother's blood that
the 'Titanic' had rammed into. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I'm not getting out of this one, am I?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Not even if you had Houdini, Johnnie Cochran and Bill
Clinton on retainer and speed-dial, dear,&quot; Helen replied. &quot;Dig in -
and don't be shy.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;You guys play rough at the dinner table,&quot; Jane
said, leaning in quietly towards Daria. &quot;Is the food that bad when your
dad cooks?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I have Calista Flockhart's figure for a reason.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Not having enough sense to put down moldy books in order
to eat a good dinner?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Keep talking and you're next meal's going to be served
through a straw.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;You'll have to do better than threaten me with three
square meals a day, &quot; Jane smiled, looking up as Jake brought a steaming
platter to the table. &quot;Hey, what's this?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I was inspired by 'Iron Chef!&quot; Jake exclaimed,
lifting the cover to reveal large vegetables in a thick sauce. &quot;This is
'Twice-Flavored Vegetables In Lobster', with a thickened sauce of butter, white
wine, pressed-lobster broth and fresh herbs, and warm bread chunks for
dipping!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;COOL!&quot; Jane exclaimed, her expression the only
positive one on a female face at the table. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;It's 'twice-flavored in lobster' because I first steamed
the vegetables using lobster broth instead of water, and then I baked them in
chopped lobster parts!&quot; Jake said, hyped up because of the response Jane
gave him. &quot;The vegetables absorb the flavor of the lobsters, but it's a
vegetable-only dish!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Jake...&quot; Helen said slowly, putting down her coffee
cup, &quot;How much did this cost...? It sounds like it was very expensive, and
we can't afford to waste money on your - your experiments in trying to cook
like every overblown, overhyped 'Galloping Gourmet' who managed to get someone
to point a camera at him...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Dad - all this butter? I mean, with all of this oil,
this will just RUIN my complexion!&quot; Quinn sputtered. &quot;And asparagus?
Nobody eats asparagus - and they're so large - and they're WHITE! These can't
be any good; after all, everyone KNOWS that all asparagus are tiny and green -
And these hunks of bread? Eating all of that bread - that's just an invitation
to end up with a waist like Camryn Manheim - Did you see the THING she wore to
the Emmys! She looked like the fat lady in one of those cartoons where Bugs
Bunny wears the hat with the horns and gets hit by lightning!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I used ten lobsters, honey - but that's how many you
need for the recipe, and, c'mon, just taste it! I know you love lobsters -
that's why I made it -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;If I eat a serving, the bad things from 'Val' will go
away,&quot; Daria droned. &quot;For every bite, I take a step away from Leslie
Bibb and her perfect smile. Each sip of sauce is a moment further from colors
with funny fruit names...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;My God, Jake - that's almost a thousand dollars!&quot;
Helen exploded. &quot;How could you be so stupid as to waste good money on your
silly chef fantasies when we have two children that we need to take care of!
They need clothing, books for school, a roof over their head and they don't
need to worry about if we'll lose the house because you wasted the bill money -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Not to mention the money Quinn'll need for deep analysis
and rehabilitation once she has to go from Cashman's to K-Mart,&quot; Daria
interjected.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Mom, if Dad spent all our money on lobster, does this
mean that I have to take back my new clothes? Because if we don't have any more
money for food, that's okay, because I'd rather still look good, and everybody
knows that the best models don't eat much anyway.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;That's because they're usually on IV's in the intensive
care unit for drug overdoses,&quot; Daria verbally lobbed towards her sister.
&quot;They're much, much better to be around afterwards - after all, 'heroin
chic' means 'you no need eat or speak'.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;MOM!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Daria, stop harassing your sister,&quot; Helen growled.
&quot;Jake, are you so lost and out of touch with everything that you'd think
that this was even remotely a good idea? How could you even fathom that I would
for one moment think that this was in any way something that I would want you
to do at all, let alone do because you'd think I'd like it -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Jane was oblivious to the free-for-all rants; she was enjoying
Jake's dinner immensely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;This is great, Mr. Morgendorffer,&quot; she finally
managed to say - after her plate was cleaned, and she had vacuumed Daria's
portion away. &quot;Can I have some more?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>The silence in the room would have terrified a demon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;You know, Lauriel thought that it would turn out
well,&quot; Jake said, the verbal morass from Helen and the girls disappearing
as he moved over to her and doled out another serving. &quot;So - what do you
like about it, specifically?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;It's just so crunchy!&quot; Jane exclaimed, watching as
Jake ladled a helping of sauce over the vegetables. &quot;You've made it so you
brought out the taste of the veggies, but the lobster's right there, too! The
herbs really build on the flavor of everything... oh, man - this is good! I wish
I had told Trent - he'd really love this... Could you pass the bread,
Quinn?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Shocked, Quinn wordlessly passed the basket of warm bread
chunks to Jane as Jake turned to Helen. &quot;By the way - Lauriel thought that
you'd enjoy the lobster for our celebration,&quot; he said, no trace of
vindication about him as he focused in on his wife. &quot;She received word
that her show's going to be picked up by the Food Network - and the lobster was
a gift for all of the help I've given her with the program.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;What happened to cold, hard cash?&quot; Daria blurted
out - and was instantly regretful as she saw the hurt look on Jake's face... and
the sharp glance from Helen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Funny you should mention that,&quot; Jake continued,
pulling a check from his jacket and tossing it onto the table. &quot;That's the
initial payment from Lauriel's.... Ms. de la Ribas' company account.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Holy Mother of God,&quot; Jane said, her eyes going wide
as she saw the amount of the check. &quot;Now that's a nice chunk of
change.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;What? Let me see - &quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Be quiet, Quinn,&quot; Helen snipped, scooping the check
up - and swallowing hard as she saw the amount. &quot;Oh, my.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot; She'll make the balance in about three weeks - when we
set up in the backyard for the video shoot, &quot; Jake continued. &quot;That's
the big news - 'North of the Border' will shoot the very first program to air
on the Food Network here, at OUR HOUSE!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;What?&quot; Quinn blurted out, excitement and pride in
her voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;What?&quot; Daria blurted out, disbelief and horror in
her voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;WHAT?&quot; Helen bellowed, her amazement and regret evaporating
into anger and snippiness over the perceived invasion of her territory.
&quot;You agreed to let people come into our home - people who you haven't even
had the decency to introduce me to-&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;But Lauriel's asked you out to lunch and to Chez Pierre
for dinner so she could meet you at least six times-!&quot; Jake tried to
interject, but Helen on a rant was like a Republican on the topic of Clinton
and Lewinsky; let the morality avalanche proceed!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;-And use it as some sort of open air concert for cooking
for some manless, half-talented bimbo who doesn't realize that she should be at
home cooking for her own husband and family, rather than for the myriad of
fools out there across the country who have to watch the television to find out
how to cook their food, and you have the absolute gall to do this - on your OWN
initiative! - without even talking to me about it? I can't believe that you did
this! Why didn't you ASK first?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;And if she realized just how many times she crossed the
Neutral Zone on that trip in the Galaxy-class 'U.S.S. Hypocrisy', she'd blow
herself up,&quot; Daria droned as she leaned in on Jane. &quot;You actually
like my dad's cooking?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Let's just say that I thought writers were more
observant,&quot; her friend replied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I'm going to be on TV?&quot; Quinn asked no one in
particular. &quot;This calls for an emergency meeting of the Fashion Club -
we'll have to put a Special Trendsetter Alert Bulletin out on our website for
our fans, and we'll DEFINITLY have to drill with the candidates, so that they
don't embarrass us on camera - Dad? Do you have any idea what you or Miss Ribas
will be wearing - and if she needs help, tell her that we'll be glad to
coordinate a wardrobe and give her a makeover, as long as we get an on-screen
credit on the show AND she definitely has to have us up front and mention us on
the air-&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Dad, I'm going to be really busy that night - I've got a
very important project that I've got to finish for school, and I won't have
time to be part of the studio audience,&quot; Daria said offhandedly. &quot;I'm
very sorry, but I think that Quinn and her friends'll more than make up for my
not being around -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I didn't say which day, Daria -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I'll be busy with the project every day.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I didn't say at what time.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I'll be operating 24/7 at school, Dad - I'll only have
time to come home to eat, and take showers, and sleep -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;You know,&quot; Jake said, as though he were talking to
himself, &quot;Sometimes I think about how nice it would be if I did something
special, like other men, and how proud they must be, having families that
support them as they try to reach those goals.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Jane looked up from her plate, one eyebrow cocked as her gaze
swept over Helen and the girls - who had the good sense to look ashamed.
&quot;I always thought how nice it would be if my family supported me in my
dreams, and not in a 'Look, Homer's going to screw up -it's our job to watch
over him!' sort of way...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>The kitchen was silent for a long time; Helen sank back into
her seat as Daria coughed nervously and Quinn pulled at a strand of hair.
&quot;I'll be there to cheer you on,&quot; Daria said, looking up from her
plate. &quot;I won't make fun of anyone during the show.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Really, honey? Thanks!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Rah, rah. Go, Dad.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;ALL RIGHT!&quot; Quinn blurted out. &quot;She doesn't
have to thank us on air or put us up front - but we have to have some good
shots during the show AND I'm not budging on the on-air fashion credit. That's
in the Fashion Club by-laws, and we'll have to get a waiver from the
union...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Jake turned hopeful eyes onto his wife, who stared deep into
her reflection on the kitchen table. &quot;Would it have been that difficult
for you to at least call me before you said 'yes'?&quot; Helen sighed, and she
lifted her head to see the puppy-dog expression on Jake's face. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Fine. Let's have the cooking show film here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Thanks, Helen!&quot; Jake cried out, hugging his wife.
&quot;I'm going to call Lauriel and give her the news!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Jake disappeared into the living room, and Helen looked over
at Daria. &quot;What have we done?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;The supreme sacrifice, Mom,&quot; Daria shot back.
&quot;We've given up a night of our lives so that someone we care about can
make a fool of himself in front of all America and still get paid incredibly
well. All in all - not a bad trade.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;When you think about it in that manner - I have to agree
with you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>The two Morgendorffer women shared a smirk. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;This is the most strange family,&quot; Jane said,
finishing off a huge chunk of bread and digging into another serving of
veggies. &quot;God, I LOVE vegetables! I am going to be SO regular for the next
couple of days -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Jane suddenly found herself alone in the kitchen. &quot;Say,
since I'm already here and I'm spending the night - can I have a beer?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Hello,
Daria,&quot; Jodie Landon said, catching up to Daria and Jane as they walked
out through the cafeteria doors and into a student-infested hallway of Lawndale
High School. &quot;Jane, you don't look well.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;She
learned not to take a fine American beer with her gourmet dinner,&quot; Daria
deadpanned. &quot;My dad cooked last night - celebration over a big account he
landed that's really coming together.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Hey,
that's right - my parents were talking about your dad the other day. They said
that he finally got his 'pet cigars.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Don't
remind me,&quot; Daria said, recalling how low her father had been after he
lost a major client (who wanted to market novelty cigars for eccentric pet
owners) - and how he had been even lower after he found that Andrew Landon had
made a small fortune by developing the idea for the client. She shuddered,
recalling that was when he really threw himself into his gourmet-cooking trip...
&quot;Dad's work with the cook finally paid off - he said that she's going onto
the Food Network.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Yeah -
the prettiest cook since Miss May 1992 played patticake in her 'Playmate Video
Review,&quot; Michael Jordan 'Mack' Mackenzie drawled, sliding up to kiss Jodie
on the cheek. &quot;She's straight-out cute, and, man, can she make a shrimp
salad - Owww!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;That's
for not having enough sense to wait until I was gone to say that,&quot; Jodie
smiled, watching as Mack rubbed the spot where she pinched his arm. &quot;Yes,
she's very beautiful - she could easily be a model if she wanted. I think that
a lot of women around town would be glad if she just packed up and went to New
York or somewhere...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Oh, we can't have that,&quot; Charles Ruttheimer III
rumbled from behind, and the four teens turned to see their carrot-haired
classmate pivot away slightly from his locker and into their conversation.
&quot;An exquisitely-formed creature such as the divine Lady de la Ribas should
be revered here in our midst as the perfect desert flower which she is, rather
than wishing that she be swept away from our view as the first rays of morning
light brush away the gentle whispers of a particularly pleasant dream.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>He sighed, his eyes misted in reverie. &quot;I shall never
look at shrimp salad the same way ever again.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Boy, I wish I had a pair of those,&quot; Jodie said,
glancing down at Daria and Jane's boots. &quot;Getting deep down here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Real
deep,&quot; Jane agreed, &quot;but hey - at least Daria's not his favorite
target of lust anymore.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Oh,
fear not, sweet and fair Daria,&quot; said Charles - or 'Upchuck', as he was
known to the student population of Lawndale High, as he came around and snaked
an arm around Daria's waist. &quot;The sweet, sculpted beauty that I know as
your angelic face shall always grace my amorous heart, but for every valley of
fragrant, blooming stems that are the women within our community, there must be
a Psyche, a maiden with a face that reminds us that the gods do exist. Know
that I will, and that in fact I must return to seek true love in the wonder of
your arms, but for a chance to stand even a single moment in the fond gaze of a
Lauriel - she who is female transcendent, a modern Andromeda that could never
be possessed by any poor, simple mortal, let alone one such as me - is a quest
worthy of the greatest hero.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Okay,
fertilizer stocks just crashed through the basement floor,&quot; Daria said,
her eyebrows raised nonetheless by the extemporaneous prose as she removed his
arm, &quot;and you get to join them.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upchuck let
out a sharp cry of pain as Daria took his feet out from beneath him with a
sharp sweep of her right foot and dropped him right on his bottom! &quot;Maybe
the cold concrete'll cool him off,&quot; she smirked, as Upchuck started to
lift himself from the floor. &quot;Let's get out of here before Bad Prose Boy
gets to the next verse.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As they
started away, Mack looked over his shoulder. &quot;You know, he's going to score
big-time when he hits college,&quot; he observed. &quot;He's got a line of bull
that's going to be Death itself on those co-eds.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;You
don't really think that girls will fall for that, do you?&quot; Jane asked.
&quot;Even those drones from the Fashion Borg don't buy into his
pseudo-poetry!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;All I
know is that girls want someone to tell them that they're pretty, and if you
can do the poetry thing too, then nine times out of ten -the deal is <u>closed</u>!&quot;
the young man said. &quot;Hey, I didn't make up the rules -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;No,
you're just going to die by them,&quot; Jodie said, tossing the Evil Eye at him
grenade-style. &quot;That's a load of bull.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I don't
think so - I mean, if there was a girl here at Lawndale who looked like Ms. de
la Ribas, guys with girlfriends would have to do all sorts of mushy stuff to
prove that they weren't thinking about her,&quot; Mack shot back. &quot;And if
you could make the other girls think that you wanted THEM rather than the
super-hot girl, you'd start racking 'em up -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Hey,
I've got an idea,&quot; Jane suddenly piped in, cutting Mack off and saving his
life from the beating Jodie looked like she was about to deliver Fed-Ex.
&quot;Let's talk about how all of you are going to help me pass that Sociology
seminar!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I've
got a better idea,&quot; Daria said. &quot;Let's just go to class.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

don't you want to take the seminar?&quot; Mack asked, concern in his voice.
&quot;After all, you and Jodie are probably going to ace it, leaving us
jocks-&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>He pulled Jane close to himself. &quot;...To squeak by with our

picked up that 'keep going until you win!' attitude from Man Ray and
Dali,&quot; Mack joked, &quot;the one you use to keep pushing Daria towards
your brother - Owww! &quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

around here talks FAR too much,&quot; Jodie said, stuffing a Chewy Granola bar
into Mack's mouth. &quot;Here - 'Chewy stops the chatter.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

if you don't get the point after the Wookie rips your arms off,&quot; Jane
joined in, trying not to notice the five-alarm blush that covered Daria's face,
neck and ears. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

you're a athlete - even if you don't wear anyone's school colors or a letter
shirt,&quot; Mack pointed out gently, stopping to chew the granola bar.
&quot;There's no shame in that - it just means you've got it in you to compete
and win. It also means that we have to hang out with the brains - if we're nice
to them, they'll give us jobs when we're older...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

what I have to put up with, Daria?&quot; Jodie sighed. &quot;All this just to have
someone around to open pickle jars, defend my honor, and buy 'bunny baskets'
for me on Easter. Don't worry - you'll get one soon enough, and then we can
talk about problems with our tripods.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

back across Daria's face; Mack stopped as the three young women kept on.
&quot;Hey, wait a moment - what's a tripod? I'm not a - oh, yeah, real funny.

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Excuse
me,&quot; Daria asked, raising her hand. &quot;If you're a psychologist, then
why are you teaching a sociology course?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

Kyle shot back. &quot;Don't anyone go running to Naomi Wolf or Anita Hill just
yet, though - that was a <u>joke</u>. Don't worry, my master's work was in
sociology... can't have America's youth being given any less than the best when
it comes to their educational system, right? Anyway - for the next thirty-one
days, I'm going to screw with your tiny little minds. In case no one told you -
you're now my lab rats. You just won't be fed here at school, but considering
the food I've seen here, that's not a problem. Thanks for volunteering. &quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Finally
- truth in advertising,&quot; Daria sighed, and was awarded with smirks from
both Jane and Jodie. &quot;And I always wondered what happened to Mengele's
'how-to' books...&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Some of you - those with extraordinary taste and
intellect - will come to believe that the theme to 'Jesus Christ, Superstar'
should play whenever I enter a room,&quot; he continued, allowing a bit of
humor into his voice. &quot;Those enlightened individuals, however, will only
receive 'C's in this class.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Kyle stood up and let the smile disappear from his face, an
action that gave Jane a start and made Daria suddenly uneasy. &quot;And now -
we open Door Number Three. There's something that I think all of you should
know. I'm not going to ask you to do anything as silly or as embarrassing as
now standing up and telling me who you are and all about yourself. This is for
two reasons. One - if you're worth remembering, I'll learn your name or I
already have it, and Two - by the end of this course, most of you will probably
be gone anyway.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Well, this one's got a new attitude, &quot; Daria
observed softly. &quot;And yet another 'tough love' type hits the Utah Beach of
education - Lawndale High.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Only because of young men and women such as yourself,
Miss Morgendorffer, &quot; Kyle said, his voice casual as he popped open a can
of root beer and took a drink. &quot;I understand that you don't give a rat's
ass about 'school spirit' or for your fellow students in general - and that's
your boggle - but I do care about their morale. Even more importantly, I've
been paid to attempt to impart knowledge to them - and that's why I think that
you and I are going to have a problem. Just because you're more jaded than a
jewel collection from the Ming Dynasty gives you no right to make others feel
worthless... but that's a discussion for another time. For right now, however,
you can either remain silent or leave.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Without a
single word, Daria stood up, gathered her books and started towards the door.
&quot;And, Miss Morgendorffer?&quot; Kyle called out, not even bothering to
look in her direction. &quot;Part of the problem or part of the solution. It's
your choice as to how you'll be seen by others - and as you make your choices...
let them be made of your own free will. &quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Daria went
through the door - and was visibly startled as the sight of most of the LHS
faculty greeted her, laughing and checking tickets as Mrs. Bennett clicked her
stopwatch. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;One minute, fourteen seconds!&quot; the economics
teacher called out, a huge grin on her face. &quot;As she walked out, she
didn't hesitate - AND didn't give him any back talk or parting shots!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;YES!&quot;
Mr. DeMartino cried out, his voice carrying through the hall. &quot;Like the
saying goes - 'Know Thy Enemy'! Pay up, suckers! Pay up - ALL of you! Big
Daddy's going courting, and he's gonna fill his pantry - to-night!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Standing off
to one side, Daria watched with a sickening sensation in her stomach as several
teachers looked at her with facial expressions ranging from outright pity to
contempt and disgust. As she observed quietly, Mrs. Bennett counted off money
from a wad of bills large enough to choke Monica Lewinsky, and other teachers
grudgingly plopped bills into Mr. DeMartino's quivering hands.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>She began to walk off - and then glanced up to see Kyle
smirking at her before turning back to his class. &quot;Let's talk about your
assignments for this class, including the main project...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Morgendorffer Consulting, how can I help you?&quot; Horizon Bridger said,
brushing back a wayward strand of her close-cropped, whitish-blonde hair from
her eyes as she picked up the telephone receiver. &quot;Yes, Mr. Gupty - Mr.
Morgendorffer has received your suggestions list for the new sets, and we're
waiting to hear from the local distributor on whether he can get those... no,
they've already told us that they're not willing to drop their prices on the
flatscreen monitors for the backdrop. No - they say that they can only provide a
36-inch screen at that price, even if they receive on-screen credit... yes, sir.
Mr. Morgendorffer's already informed them that we'll have to find someone else
if they can't get the five-foot flatscreen, or if they don't come down another
ten percent on two 36-inch screens. Yes, the HDTV-capable ones.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

twentysomething looked up, smiled and waved as Helen walked into the office.
&quot;They've agreed to call back by Thursday with their new prices. Oh, and I
was in touch with Angela Li, the principal at Lawndale High School. She said
she's willing to listen to a proposal for the program - yes, 'The Trials of
Teen Marriage'. She said that if we can give her time to tell about the low
teen pregnancy rates at LHS &amp; how teenage pregnancy, even if they marry, is
a bad thing - she started ranting about 'how teen parents bring nothing but
dishonor and tarnished glory to Lawndale High'. I'll tell Mr. Morgendorffer
that you'd like to come in on Friday - I'll see about that. I'll tell him that
you called. Yes, and you, too.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

skirt as she stood and came around the desk to shake Helen's hand. &quot;From
Middleton College - I'm a Business Administration major. I'll be here
off-and-on for the next year; thirty hours a week in the office during school,
and full-time during the breaks and summer session.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

know, I thought that I'd probably be bored out of my skull here,&quot; the
young woman said, turning in a graceful half-circle as she scooped a number of
files off her desk and walked over to an open file cabinet, &quot;but with the
entertainment and television accounts that we have or who've inquired about
coming on-board, I've barely got time to breathe!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

going over to a large chart on the far wall. &quot;Full ride on tuition and

just mentioned it when I interviewed for the internship back in
September,&quot; Horizon assured her, now very aware of the 'pissed-off jealous
tiger' look Helen was burning in her general direction. &quot;You know, he
talked about his dad being mad at him for doing the 'summer of love' thing -
and I said that it wasn't nearly as bad as when my parents started getting mail
addressed to 'H. Elizabeth Bridger'. They thought I was ashamed of my name, and
wouldn't give me any of my letters until I promised to use my first name - at
least for official school documents.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

has to say, 'Horizon' is the hot hippie chick that gets hit on by all the guys

Stacy. Dr. Armalin's class is a place where REAL learning takes place, and not
necessarily out of a book,&quot; Sandi replied sagely, noticing Quinn turning a
bright shade of red. &quot;Oh, don't worry, Quinn - some people just simply
aren't ready for the challenges and the pure mental exertion that this class

Quinn,&quot; she calmly continued. &quot;You have to simply accept that some of
us are meant to be leaders, and the universe gives them the paths they need to

followers. This is not a bad thing. The world needs people like you, Quinn. The

homes and offices that people like me will live in and govern from! You'll grow
and cook the food for my dinner, you'll make sure I receive all my messages...
you'll attend to my children as though they were your very own, and announce
the 'Blue-Light Specials' that my employees will use to enhance their family
budget. This is why I can still associate with someone like you, Quinn... because
good assistants are so VERY hard to find - and at the end of the day, we will <u>always</u>

going on over there... and in the back of your husband's SUV...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

number of other men &amp; women, walked out of the kitchen area. &quot;Look
who's prowling about the neighborhood...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Linda stopped their snarling long enough to take a glance in the direction
Michelle pointed - and their faces fell as they saw Lauriel, dressed simply in
a burgundy-colored silk blouse and matching slacks that STILL made her the

not that attractive,&quot; Linda said, but the fire had gone out of her voice.
&quot;She's dressed like a common secretary, and she should wear better shoes,
maybe some heels - but she knows that she'd look like a redwood tree in
October... exactly what shade of hair color is that supposed to be, and for God's
sake, get a real haircut instead of that ten-dollar 'weedwhacked' perm she's
got! With all that hair flying all over the place, she looks like the girl in
the cage from 'Planet Of The Apes'... probably has the same IQ, too.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

predator in her territory. &quot;That bitch came to Andrew with her proposal. I
told him that he'd sign with her on Tuesday - and Wednesday, they would find
him floating off the shore. This is not a joke. I am not trying to play.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

happened to look in their direction, and started over. &quot;Here she comes

as she reached the table. &quot;I'm Lauriel de la Ribas. Your husband's been

Lauriel's hand in her own and held it for a brief moment; she felt her face
flush slightly as she looked into the taller woman's eyes and felt the
impossibly soft, gentle touch of Lauriel's fingertips, just barely brushing
against hers as she brought her hand away... She was suddenly very glad that she
hadn't stood up to meet Lauriel, and even moreso that she had chosen to wear
one of her braziers with a touch of padding: <i>If she can have an effect like
this even on other women - and I know I'm straight! - what chance does any man,
let alone one like Jake, have against a woman like this? Poor, poor Helen...<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

Jake,&quot; Anthony DeMartino said, tossing darts at a photo of Kevin Thomphson
as he spoke over the phone in the Teachers' Lounge at Lawndale High. &quot;I'm
over at the school, finishing up some lesson plans for the next few days. Wanna

Daria had let him take the <u>entire faculty</u> of Lawndale High School for
over two thousand dollars. Jake's a good man, but betting on his baby girl's
attitude problems - not to mention the other ones she wouldn't admit she had -
were definitely not the way to get on his good side. Better to let sleeping
dogs lie... <o:p></o:p></span></p>

not to think about how Angela would be pissed off about the gambling -

invite her to go up the coast this weekend to the Peterson Inn. They should
have restocked that green tea Angela enjoys so much by now, and I'll run down

slipped a gear or two... &quot;Who's Lauriel? Isn't she that cook or something
you've been working for?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

been helping her get her show ready to go national,&quot; Jake told him.
&quot;I'm sorry - I thought I had already asked you. Lauriel's a bit lonely
around here - she doesn't have many friends, and I told her I'd see if you'd
like to go out with her...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

hesitated; he'd been seeing Claire Defoe, the Arts &amp; Crafts instructor at
LHS on-and-off for a couple of years (if you call sleeping with someone seeing
them), and he didn't want to hurt her feelings. He'd figured out, though, that
he wasn't going to marry Claire or even have a normal relationship with her. It
wasn't good policy to become involved with someone you work that closely with,
especially if he became the principal after Angela was promoted... or incarcerated...
or if it came out that he'd sampled her exotic wares on occasion. too... <o:p></o:p></span></p>

that I'd enjoy your friend's company for dinner, Jake. Find out when she'd like
to go out, and tell me all about the lady's likes and dislikes...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

she's a basket case for the romantic stuff,&quot; Jake told him, &quot;but
you've got to be respectful of her. Treat her like a piece of meat and you're
history, but if you can make a nice, Silhouette romance-type gesture - say, you
pick a flower for her while you're walking down the street, or have a bouquet

phone down and glanced up towards the stairwell. Helen was acting strangely -
she didn't make one derogatory comment about his cooking the entire night, and
she asked (not ordered, but actually and POLITELY asked) that he wait
downstairs while she worked on something in their bedroom. She also palmed a
twenty off on both of the girls and sent them packing for the night to their
friends' houses - must have a real doozy of a deposition to prep for tomorrow
morning... Oh, well, might as well finish off my drink and get the blankets for
the couch -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I think Mom's met the cook Dad's been working
with,&quot; Daria said, lifting her head from a hardcover copy of 'Without
Remorse' as Jane hovered over her easel and canvas, working on a 'Conan'-style
four-color of Daria and herself as post-apocalyptic 'Road Warrior'-meets
-'Zena' barbarian women. &quot;This evening, she slipped me and the Red Menace
a few bucks each and showed us to the door. I think she's going off on another
legal marathon to ignore the fact that Dad being somewhat competent in some
area bothers her a bit.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;What makes you think she didn't put you in the airlock
just so she and your dad could star in 'The Beast with Two Backs?&quot; Jane
asked, putting a second red streak beneath a tire to resemble a smear of blood
under the wheels of the car. This one would be freaky. Daria with 'Cleopatra
2525' defense gauntlets, flying and blasting away at a death-beam-shooting,
giant half-robot, half-demon Mr. DeMartino while she herself stood on the hood
of a beaten-up Ford Pinto drawn by four cybernetic dachshunds. She was waving a
chainsaw and rifle like Bruce Campbell in 'Army of Darkness', laughing as they
chased down the Fashion Club and the Gupty family... Funny, her drawing in Ted
Dewitt-Clinton as a 'Joxer' clone and Mack as Iolaus... nice swords, though...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;When Mom's put out about Dad, she works and becomes even
more of a law computer. Even if she was bothered, she'd never do anything soap
opera-like, like the 'seducing him in the living room with candles' schtick.
Her attitude's more like 'Put your hands on my man and I'll put my hands on
your throat. Mom doesn't get jealous - she gets her hands dirty.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

every now and then, and he's got at least forty tapes with the show!&quot; Jane
said, painting a torn-off Upchuck head being spit out of a cyber-wiener dog's
mouth. &quot;There's even a fan club for the people who watch 'North of the
Border'. They call themselves 'Border Crossers'.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Okay - level ten 'geek alert'...&quot; Daria sniffed.
&quot;What's the show about, anyway?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Your dad's been working with her for how long and you
don't even know what her show's about?&quot; Jane laughed. &quot;Sometimes, you
are the worst! Her show's about highlighting food from all over the country:
'Each country has it's own trademark cuisine except America. America's a collection
of all cultures and tastes.' So she goes all over the country and invites
people to Lawndale from all over, and then goes into her kitchen here and makes
those dishes that collectively makes up 'neo-American Cuisine.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;And you actually watch this,&quot; Daria said, raising
an eyebrow as she looked up at Jane's painting. &quot;Why lowjack the wiener
dogs?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;It just seems right,&quot; Jane shrugged. &quot;Hey,
let's get Chinese - lots of crab rangoon, okay?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Okay,&quot; Daria agreed, rolling over as Trent Lane
walked in through the open door, a couple of bags of takeout in hand.
&quot;Hey, Trent. What's in the bags?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Hey, Daria,&quot; the slender, handsome musician echoed,
handing one of the bags off to her. &quot;The guys and I went out for Greek
food. We got you some gyros and these potato things - I don't know what they
call them in Greek.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Jane scooted over and looked down in the bag. &quot;They call
them fries, you smeg blot,&quot; she said, hoisting her own bag away from him.
&quot;Sit down there and look at Daria - I need to use your noggin for a
minute.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Trent smiled kindly at his sister (and missed the scowl Daria
lashed out with) as he walked over to her canvas. &quot;Wicked,&quot; he said,
looking it over. &quot;What's the inspiration?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;This seminar I'm taking with Daria,&quot; she said,
digging into the bag. &quot;Cool! Real roast beast and flavorings!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Sorry, Daria. Max got hungry on the way back. He's into
condiments. It's a personal problem,&quot; Trent shrugged, turning back to his
younger sister. &quot;What kind of seminar?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;The one you took back in your sophomore year - the same
professor's teaching it, too!&quot; Jane gushed. &quot;It's too cool - I heard
that we'll be doing the whole underground shelter and 'rebuild the Earth' thing
in the class, like the 'Dylan Hunt' movies that Gene Roddenberry did in the
'70's! I'm going to come up with some cool name and be like Tina Turner in
'Thunderdome'...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Kyle's teaching the class, hmn?&quot; Trent said, his eyes darkening slightly.
&quot;Underground stuff -that's that Greek letter-thing... Hey, don't take all of
the stuff in the class too seriously. It's just more schoolwork, when you look
right at it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

sure - that's why you had cheerleaders and all the REALLY pretty girls in
school chasing after you for the rest of the year!&quot; Jane teased him.
&quot;Don't want your little sister to grow up and have all the eligible men
realizing what a catch I am, is that it?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

tell those guys to remember that I've got three friends, a van and a
shovel,&quot; Trent smiled, heading for the door. &quot;We can take care of the
body.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I know
a body you need to take care of - five-foot-four, brown hair &amp; eyes, cute
but really shy...&quot; Jane ducked as a pillow went flying past her head.
&quot;See? She's trying to hurt your sister - better give her the tickle
torture. She'll love that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jane never
expected the return voyage of the pillow via Trent's backhand and took a
faceful of goose down, missing the momentary, soulful glance that Trent tossed
in Daria's direction - and Daria caught a piece of, bringing a blush and a
gentle smile to her face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

mouth - and then seeing the looks on the two faces in front of her. &quot;Wait
a moment - what'd I miss?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Nothing
- you caught the pillow like a champ,&quot; Trent said, giving Daria a wink as
he reached over and kissed Jane on the cheek. &quot;See you later, favorite
little sister.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

dug into their dinner, unaware that Trent stood motionless outside the door
listening to them. &quot;Gotta make a trip over to that school if she gets too
into Doc Kyle's number,&quot; he said to himself softly. &quot;The doc's trip
can get way intense, and take Jane places she doesn't need to go.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

to close and lock the bedroom door. Helen knew that one surefire way to catch
her husband's attention was with the <u>really</u> sexy, uber-'Victoria's
Secret'-type of lingerie; she found that out years ago, when she picked up the
'red onionskin' lingerie in a Paris boutique during an overseas trip several
years ago. (Actually, she got it as a gift from one of her former classmates
from law school, who picked it up as a gift for Helen during a night they spent

from Helen's eyes. &quot;The rest of it can wait.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

their own tiny, blissful moment of forever, Jake and Helen, together in one
another's arms and in the whispering touch of the emotions the music brought
forth, Helen giving herself over to the sweet security of the strong,
comforting arms that enfolded about her. <i>I could live in this moment for the
rest of my life</i>, she thought, marveling once again at the grace Jake
possessed as he danced<i>. He's always been such a good dancer - why don't we
go out that much anymore, so I can feel this good more often... oh, God, Jake, I
feel just so right when you hold me like this - when you touch me like this...
it's times like this that make it all come together for me. No outside world,
no one else, no cares that go beyond our bedroom, and you're there, Jake, to
take control, because you're my man, and you know exactly how to take care of
me...<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

her head from where she rested upon Jake's chest, a heated, yet mischievous
gleam rising from within. &quot;I think I need to work upon an apology,
Jake,&quot; she said, easing her husband back down upon the bed. &quot;Oh, and
I believe I owe your new intern an apology as well. She'll get hers
tomorrow.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

her head and bit off the top button of his shirt: it was a silly thing to do,
but Jake liked it when she was aggressive in bed and she planned to make him
very happy tonight. &quot;You'll get yours right now.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

I'm working on tonight is a bit more rounded off, Mr. Morgendorffer,&quot;
Helen replied crisply. &quot;You need to come out of these clothes - right
now.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

still thrown off a bit by his wife's sudden downshift into Bond-girl mode, but
that didn't last long; Helen definitely knew how to push her man's buttons and
get him up &amp; running. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

fifteen minutes later, Helen collapsed back upon the pillows, her breath
returning in short, sharp gasps as she brushed sweat-moistened bangs of hair
away from her eyes. <i>My God in Heaven</i>, she thought, lifting herself up and
over to gently place her lips upon her husbands, <i>he is still so damned
incredible at this. You were always great in bed; that's probably because
