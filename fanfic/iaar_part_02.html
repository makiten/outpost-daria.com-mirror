to 'Lion Tales', the Lawndale High TV newsmagazine,&quot; the voice on the
television said, a series of surprisingly professional graphics appearing on
the television screen. &quot;And now, live from LHS-TV's Studio One - Tori
Jericho.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the attractive Fashion Club member, her butter-blonde hair falling down across
her shoulders in thin, stylish ringlets, appeared on the TV screen. &quot;Hi.
I'm Tori Jericho, and I'm here to keep you up to date on Lawndale High news,
sports events and other items of interest.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

entire school is abuzz with the news that Doctor Kyle Armalin is back at
Lawndale High, and twenty-five lucky students have been selected for the
'Special Projects in Sociology' seminar. The seminar, which runs for five weeks,
is held once each year and is taught by a number of noted educators, including
Dr. Armalin. Among the students selected for the seminar was junior class
member Michael Jordan Mackenzie...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

heard a lot about the freedom and the creativity that the Doctor allows in his
classes, and the assignments are supposed to allow you to really find out what
kind of person you are,&quot; Mack's image said, obviously filmed in the
parking lot. &quot;I'm looking forward to the experience.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

everybody,&quot; Jodie said tiredly, plopping down next to Jane and Daria at a
cafeteria table. &quot;What's up?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

smirked. &quot;Don Henley's prophecies are coming true.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I know
- I had to give up doing both 'Lion Tales' and 'LHS Today' so I could take the
seminar,&quot; Jodie sighed, referring to the daily news show broadcast live
from the LHS campus. &quot;Oh, well. Gotta have priorities - and I'll be booked
up solid next year, so I have to take it now.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

went on the air weekly on cable access, locally on UHF Channel 79 - and for the
big events, on satellite uplink - another way Ms. Li constantly strove to show
that Lawndale High (under her guiding hands) was no less than the best high
school in the state of Texas. If nothing else, though, working on the two shows
was considered by most universities - and more than a few actual television
affiliates - as actual work experience in the field, and more than a few LHS
students took advantage of that to begin careers directly out of school. There
was actually a correspondent working for the British Sky News Service - a real
up-and-comer through the ranks, who had gotten her start with two years of
maintaining transmitter equipment and her senior year on-air at 'Lion Tales'.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Besides
- after a few weeks of her on the air, everyone'll beg you to go back!&quot;
Jane said. &quot;Besides a pretty face, a great body, excellent clothes, and a
natural on-air rapport - what else does she have? Hey - we all know she
sucks!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Yes, we
do - the question for now is what,&quot; Jodie smirked, gallows humor evident
as she opened a large bag of chips - which made both Jane and Daria pull back
sharply, instant horror and disgust on their faces. &quot;If I'd known that
they'd put 'Blond Ambition' on the screen instead of under the director's desk
- what's wrong?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Something
with your nose,&quot; Jane said pointedly. &quot;What ARE those?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Jean-Claude
Dupres' Hellfire-Roasted', soul-burning, Cajun-barbecue-flavored 'Bayou Boiler
Chips', straight from Louisiana,&quot; Jodie all but announced, holding the bag
out - making Jane's eyes water and Daria's glasses fog over. &quot;They come in
different flavors and seven levels of spiciness: tame, mild, medium, savory,
fiery, volcano and 'HELL!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

had to drag us into the pit of sulfur and brimstone right along with you,&quot;
Jane muttered. &quot;Man, one thing I can't stand is the really hot, funky
food! Penny's into it - comes from being down in tortilla and banana-land all
of these years ... you practically can't breathe in a kitchen she's been cooking
in.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I LOVE
the hot stuff - and Andrea got a few bags for me when her family went to visit
their relatives near New Orleans a couple of weeks ago,&quot; Jodie smiled
happily. &quot;God, I love these chips - and you practically just can't get
these things outside of the state!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;And
everybody breathes a sigh of relief,&quot; Daria shot back, wincing as she
watched Jodie crunch down on a thick, dark, spice-coated chip and all but faint
with pleasure. &quot;You want a cigarette with those? A leather hood with
zippers? How about a condom?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Hey,
look - it's another Fashion Borg!&quot; Jane said, noticing that Sandi was now
on the television.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Well,
as President of the Fashion Club, it is important for me to expand my horizons
and my perceptions of others,&quot; Sandi's image spoke. &quot;I feel that by
taking this seminar, I will be able to gain a better idea on how to help others
in society by finding out how and why they do the things they do. This, in
turn, will allow me to understand the way they dress themselves the way they do
- and once we can understand that, we can help them to improve their manners
and style of dress and therefore, help them improve their society. After all,
if we all dress if a fashionable manner and act in a fashionable manner, we
will all eventually begin to think and behave in a fashionable manner - just
like everyone else. Once that happens, we'll have world peace.&quot;<span

Orwell is spinning in his grave like the last tornado in 'Twister', Daria said,
turning her head from the television. &quot;World domination through the use of
natural fibers. '1984' - the Fashion Club way.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;And
think of some of the great political books that could come out of a world ruled
by the Fashion Club,&quot; Jodie said. &quot;How about 'The Little Red Dress
Book?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

not forget 'The Art of War-drobe,&quot; Daria shot back. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Jane caught another whiff of the Sarin-chips Jodie gulped down
like a crazed ferret on a giant meatball, and drained an entire glass of soda -
ice and all - before wiping at her eyes with a handful of pocket-size tissues.
&quot;Downwind, Jodie - please.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I can't believe they let that idiot have air time, even
on the boob tube,&quot; Daria said, changing the subject as a pinpoint of anger
momentarily flashed in Jodie's eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;That's
just what you'd call it now,&quot; Jodie echoed, looking up and noticing how
tight Tori's sweater fit across her chest. &quot;Oh, yeah - the guys are
definitely watching to find out about the next mandatory school fundraiser, and
breaking news about Mr. DeMartino snogging Ms. Defoe in the bomb shelter 'til the
blessed olive oil runs out...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

been sipping at the sarcastic wine again,&quot; Jane spoke out, finishing off
her burrito. &quot;What's this about Ms. Defoe and DeMartino?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Didn't
you hear? A couple of nights ago, I heard that some of the Glee Club kids were
practicing late, and they saw them going into the nurse's office! They didn't
get to see much because the security guards came and chased them out - but it
looked like they were in the mood to play doctor...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I
didn't think you gossiped, Jodie,&quot; Daria said, looking mildly disappointed
at the second girl.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I'm not
- I've seen them together before,&quot; Jodie replied defensively.
&quot;Remember, I'm the so-called 'good kid'. They slip up around me all the
time, because 'I won't do anything to hurt the proud reputation of 'good ol'
Lawndale High!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

guess - bad time at Student Council last night?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;The
Fashion Club was there - slutting around like dogs in heat and getting the boys
so worked up that they couldn't use their damned brains,&quot; came Jodie's
morose response. &quot;You should have seen Sandi - and the piece of cloth she
almost wore...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Daria and
Jane's eyebrows rose. &quot;It would be an insult to actual dresses to call
what she wore that,&quot; Jodie hissed. &quot;She must have shaved for a day in
order to put that thing on. To make a long story short - the Fashion Club got
their financial allotment increased by a third for next year. There's all sorts
of worthwhile programs and other things that could really put that money to
good use, but we're going to pay for those girls to play 'Who Wants To Dress
Like A Teen 'Ho'?' Sometimes, I really wonder if it's all worth it...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Not
giving in to your urge to beat Sandi and the rest of them into the middle of
their senior year?&quot; Jane laughed. &quot;You can't do that, Jodie. Daria
has dibs.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Not all
of them, Jane,&quot; Daria cut in. &quot;Just Quinn. Remember - she's a
red-haired step-child.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I'd
just like to give Sandi what she deserves,&quot; Jodie said, pulling crusts off
her sandwich. &quot;Sometimes, I have dreams where I'm a black panther and
she's an impala or antelope or whatever, and I get to chase her down, lock my
jaws around her neck and choke the hell out of her.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

up from the guest spot at the radio console as Warren Bing and Stanley 'The
Spatula Man' Jones slithered and bounced into the Z-93 FM studio booth, both
carrying 'Burger Barn' bags of food and wearing hot neon-rainbow colored
'Mental In The Morning!' T-shirts that could probably be seen from orbit.
&quot;So where's that severely S-S-S-Smoking lady chef - get her in here so she

Warren sighed, shaking his head. Unlike the terminally- and perpetually uncouth
'Spatula Man', 'Bing' and 'Warren' were two different personas. He and Jake had
met through Jake's working with Lauriel - Warren was also an aspiring chef with
a natural inclination towards game animals and foraged vegetables &amp; grains.
It was a talent that Lauriel was helping to develop after she had judged his
contest-winning dish of stone-baked duckling in cornhusks with baby potatoes,
wild onions and dressing made from a patch of prairie wheat-grains in a local
cook-off. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

buddies. &quot;Don't take it personally.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

gonna ask that you turn it down for this interview, okay?&quot; Jake asked.
&quot;Yes, she's a beautiful woman - but when you only focus on that, it makes
her look like less of a professional and more like the 'Vanna White' of the
cooking world. She's really looking to try and build her rep, so ixnay on the

exercises which you'll have at various times during the duration, you'll also
have a class project - a group exercise which will compose seventy percent of
your total grade.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the covered blackboard, and lifted the extended drop-down maps that covered it.
&quot;One subject which has consistently held the interest of everyone, from
military scientists to TV sitcom writers, is the closed/isolated social
construct - a group of individuals who, for whatever reason, have no choice but
to live with one another and share experience and existence for an indefinite
period of time. It's a subject that we've seen in many forms, from 'The Lord of
the Flies', to 'Gilligan's island' to 'Star Trek: Voyager' - to the television
equivalent of breaking open the Seventh Seal which you all know as 'Survivor'.
Because of this, all of you should not only be somewhat familiar with the
concept, but have some ideas on what's needed to make such a group functional
and, perhaps, even effective and productive in some fashion.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

form of the closed/isolated social construct usually studied - and used quite
often in literature and entertainment - is the 'lifepod' construct,&quot; the
teacher continued. &quot;This is a group of diverse individuals brought
together for the purpose of saving them from an event capable of destroying
life on a massive scale and eradicating civilization itself, with the premise
that they will be used as 'seed stock' to continue the species and the
representative culture that it came from. Think of a 'time capsule', but with

scenario,&quot; Dr. Armalin announced. &quot;You'll be broken up into groups in
order to design a shelter to place a number of people within in order to let
them survive a period of... as Robert Heinlein so quaintly put it, 'cultural
disorder.' You'll design all facets of the shelter - basic design elements and
construction, supply and maintenance, armaments, transport and whatever else
you deem necessary to the shelter. You'll also have to worry about things such
as financing the project, mission security, post-containment operations, and so
on. During the first two weeks of the project, you'll undergo the construction
phase of your shelter - and trust me when I say that I'll throw roadblocks in
your way. Sometime during the third week, you'll send your assigned 'seeds'
into containment, where they will stay for x number of days in order to ride
out 'The Event.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

gets into civilian attire, we'll divide the class up into three groups. Now,
only six persons will be allowed into your shelter, so you have to make some
hard choices and really pay attention to who the others in your group are.
You'll have to choose your 'seeds' on the basis of current and perceived future
abilities and worth, NOT personality OR popularity - and any shelter that looks
like it's holding the cast of an Aaron Spelling teen drama will earn that group
an automatic 'F' for the course.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

&quot;Oh, come on! You've never wanted to be in something like 'Planet Earth'

sci-fi show on CBS back in the '70's - Mom and Dad bought a Beta deck so they
could tape it every Saturday morning. It was like 'Damnation Alley,' but for
kids', Jane told Jodie. &quot;No nuclear war, cool explosions or armored
man-eating cockroaches, but they did have a cooler vehicle, laser cannons and a

of the class size, there will be nine people in Group Three,&quot; Dr.

Taylor, Morgendorffer, Thomphson and Dewitt-Clinton.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Say, Daria,&quot; Jane shot back, a smirk growing across
her face, &quot;I caught the order in which he read those names off. Doesn't
that make you 'Seven of Nine?' Trent'll just love seeing you in that catsuit
and heels. Make sure you wear the brown one.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

boot?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Dr. Armalin, &quot; Jodie asked, raising her hand,
&quot;we're supposed to build this thing because of some disaster. What kind of
disaster occurred, sir?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Use your imagination, Miss Landon,&quot; the doctor
quipped. &quot;Who knows what could have happened? Perhaps there was a civil
war instigated by combined elements of militia groups and breakaway elements of
the military... maybe a small asteroid hit the Earth a la 'Deep Impact.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

&quot;Maybe Miss Morgendorffer's dreams for mankind became reality... or,
perhaps, she simply unleashed her inner Vogon, and read some poetry at the
planet.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Daria felt her face flushing crimson over scarlet as waves of
laughter from the class poured over her. &quot;You've got the rest of the
period to work on the project,&quot; Dr. Armalin said, holding up a folder from
a stack on his desk. &quot;Here's your project folder with the necessary
information for the project simulation. If any of you are familiar with
role-playing games, some of this information will seem very familiar, and
you'll probably have an easier time in the start-up and development stages.
Everyone should pick up one of these folders, and then you should get together
with your group to start your planning. I recommend that you develop your
characters first; that'll tell you the type of talents and resources you'll
have to work with - but even more importantly, it'll tell you what you don't
have, what you need and what goals you should focus on.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Has anyone ever really gone overboard with their project
- I mean, in terms of doing extra stuff?&quot; Jane asked, drawing a very
curious look from Daria as she spoke.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Oh,
yes,&quot; Kyle told her. &quot;The third time I taught the seminar was at a
junior college in central Illinois - you've probably never heard of it. One
group actually got permission to use a lounge area - it was reserved for the
school's role-playing game club - and actually redid it to serve as the
shelter!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;So,
what did they do?&quot; Jodie asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Well,
they took it seriously. They had brought MRE's - that's 'Meals, Ready to Eat',
or the meals that American troops take into the field to eat - in as their
primary food source. For the occasional change in their diets, the group
jury-rigged up a decent hydroponics garden for fresh vegetables and fruits, and
they also worked with some engineering students and the College of Life
Sciences to come up with a self-contained environmental-control system that
tied into the hydroponics garden to purify the air in the shelter. Did I
mention that the students set up the room so that it was environmentally
separate from the rest of the college?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;You let
them do all of that?&quot; Ted asked, his eyes wide.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I
didn't know what they had done until it was all over,&quot; Kyle said. &quot;If
you go over the top and it works, people don't mention the outrageous lengths
you've gone to as such. If you succeed, you're 'incredibly motivated and able
to overcome the odds through unconventional thinking.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

yet!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Rah,

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;You
know, if I thought it would do any good, I'd tell you that you need to go off
to a place like New Orleans or Fire Island and get laid 'Blue Lagoon'-style,
with some six-foot-six dark-haired beach god and island drums beating in the
background for a week or two,&quot; Jane retorted. &quot;If I thought it would
loosen you up, I'd say 'Go Cinemax!' and tell you to go for the tiny
platinum-blonde beach bunny with the huge blue moon-eyes and the 36C cup -
hell, <u>I'd</u> have sex with you if I thought it would do any good!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

but you'd steal cab fare out of my purse while I was asleep, and a couple of
months later, I'd see how you took what happened and made it into an art show
just so you could get a grant from the NEA.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the two of you cut it out?&quot; Jodie whispered as she leaned in towards them.
&quot;Charles heard what you said, and I swear he nearly passed out and snapped
his desk in half - from the bottom, if you get my meaning!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

also had a small magnetically powered generator, electronic equipment, a
video-game console and a television/VCR/DVD combo unit for entertainment - you
name it, these kids either had it or came up with logical reasons why they
couldn't,&quot; Kyle continued. &quot;Their environmental system also had a
flash-distillery and a molecular-level repurification system to provide them
with clean water and fuel from their own waste products! They designed a
micro-shower that was quite effective, used a magnetic stove - and put together
one SERIOUS electrical-field array as a security system!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Griffin - in the 1980's, two engineering students at an East Coast university
whose name escapes me at the moment collected or surmised information on atomic
weapons development, then used that data to construct an actual working
device,&quot; Kyle told the young woman, whose eyes went wide as he spoke.
&quot;All those two students needed was plastic explosives, some weapons-grade
radioactive material, and they would have had a functional nuclear device capable
of leveling a city... and they got their information off the Internet and
through the Freedom of Information Act. If you're serious about a project and
are willing to put in the work - like they did - you can do anything.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;And then, to prove that it wasn't just
smoke-and-mirrors, the lifepod group sealed themselves in for a full school
week. The administration wasn't happy with that - they thought that it was just
for show - but for five full days, no one could have or did get into that room
with anything short of military action. I didn't give that group 'A's - they
TOOK their grades.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;That must have been something to see,&quot; Jodie said.
&quot;Do we have to do something like that?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Don't worry - I don't expect you guys to be THAT over
the top. I do, however, expect you to give me your best efforts possible.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Dr. Armalin picked up his briefcase and started for the door
when Brittany squeaked, &quot;Doctor Armalin, you're not leaving us here alone,
are you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;You're almost an adult, Miss Taylor,&quot; he replied,
his gaze sweeping across the class. &quot;You all are. It really doesn't say
much for me or any of you if I need to sit and watch over you while you work on
an assignment that all of you should be quite capable of at least beginning
without any help. It also doesn't say much about all of you if you feel that
you should coop yourselves up in a classroom to work on this - unless, of
course, you feel that you can work more effectively in a classroom environment.
I'll see you all in class tomorrow. Good day, Miss Taylor.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

12:45, Angela, and I teach history in a high school,&quot; Anthony DeMartino
said, looking out the window of the somewhat comfortable office as Principal
Angela Li turned the dials on her wall safe and brought out a bottle of
amber-colored liquor. &quot;I could have used a drink three hours ago.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Indeed,&quot;
the stately Asian woman said, bringing out two crystal tumblers and returning
to her desk. &quot;I wanted to ask you for two reasons. First - to join me for
a celebratory draught, to celebrate your incredible good fortune.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;A
letter arrived for you today, from the superintendent of the district,&quot;
Angela said, pouring a generous dollop of Glenmorangie single-malt scotch into
a tumbler and extending it to him before pouring herself one as well. &quot;Mr.
DeMartino - Anthony - it gives me great pleasure to inform you that you are now
the new Assistant Principal of Lawndale High School.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;If it
wasn't for the fact that I knew Dr. Armalin had both Thomphson and Taylor in
the seminar, I might be concerned by that,&quot; Angela said, after the sound
of the Doctor's scream had passed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;If it
wasn't for those two being in there right now - I'd say the universe doesn't
want me to take this job,&quot; Anthony agreed, &quot;assuming I accept. I'm
not really all that interested in administration, Angela, MBA to the contrary.
I like dealing with the kids. Most of them. I'm not interested in giving up
teaching.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;You
won't have to, but I'm afraid that you will lose teaching hours
regardless,&quot; Angela retorted. &quot;Your additional duties will leave no
other option than cutting back on some of your classes. I've been thinking of
asking the Doctor if he'd be interested in taking over those classes, and
coming aboard full-time.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Angela,
I only ask that you tell me in advance when you're planning to have that
conversation - so I can be out of the building,&quot; Anthony laughed.
&quot;You've tried this before. Accept that the kid's not going to do this
full-time and keep driving. Back to me, though - what else is in it for
me?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

fifteen-percent increase in salary - apparently, they passed a special
appropriations measure to finance your new position - and an office of your
own, as well as a personal parking space and access codes for the schools'

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Placing her
tumbler down on the desktop, Angela came over and faced down the man who stood
a good head over her. &quot;Which brings us to number two. I would prefer to
not see my new assistant principal 'playing doctor' with my arts and crafts
instructor after hours in the nurses' office again. We have cameras in there,
too.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;You

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Remember
that,&quot; she said, opening her desk and tossing him three tiny digital
videotapes. &quot;Those will come out of your salary. The footage from the
overhead camera shot is especially... energetic.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Thank
you,&quot; he said, sliding the tapes into his pocket and raising his glass in
a toast. &quot;I can promise you, as your new Assistant Principal, that I'll
never do anything like that in the nurses' office again.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Agreed,&quot;
Angela echoed, raising her glass as well. &quot;That's what your new office is
for.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They finished
their drinks. &quot;Say, I don't understand something - how the hell did
Thomphson and Taylor get into that seminar anyway? I thought it was an advanced
study for the better students?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Miss
Taylor actually scored high enough in several areas to be considered for
this,&quot; Angela told him, &quot;and as for Mr. Thomphson... he needed
something extra for his transcript besides 'A's in Phys Ed. Dr. Armalin
understands that through this opportunity, the boy is to bring honor, and
glory, to Lawndale High.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;So you
told Kyle he could really screw with his mind - as long as the boy gets a 'C'
in the class.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;And if
he gets a 'B' - honestly - the Doctor gets a $10,000 bonus at the end of the
school year.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;And if
Thomphson gets an 'A'?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

happens - the good Doctor will be spending a week at the Playboy Manor,&quot;

started over to the cafeteria table where the other members of their group had
gathered. &quot;Hey, are those hot chips?&quot; Sandi asked, the lone person
not to draw back as Jodie pulled open her 'bag o' crunchy Hell-farts', as Jane
had taken to calling the fiery, fragrant chips - but not in the presence of
Jodie. &quot;Can I have some?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Why,
sure, Sandi,&quot; Jodie said, &quot;if you really think you can handle one.
They are really hot, and I don't want you-&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ONE! I was eating mashed jalapenos instead of pablum as a baby!&quot; Sandi
huffed, taking SERIOUS offense at the implication that SHE couldn't do anything
that Jodie could do - that is, if she really wanted to... &quot;I can eat those
bland things and probably not notice it!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Okay,&quot;
Jodie said, picking out an especially large and spice-coated chip.
&quot;Because I'm a nice person -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

THAT!&quot; Sandi barked, swiping the chip, chomping down and sending it into
oblivion before Andrea could rise from her seat. &quot;You see? That's not even
remotely as hot as -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With Jodie's
recent foray into the 'burn your ass-hairs off' section of the EM spectrum (not
to mention snack aisle), Jane had taken to getting gallon-size pitchers of ice
water placed at any table Jodie was spending any time at. Sandi was fortunate
in that Jane had thought to get three pitchers for the group; without delay, a
single repentant glance or word of impetuous denial, Sandi grabbed at the first
pitcher and emptied it without a drop being spilled. As the table's occupants
watched with a mixture of mirth and amazement, Sandi finished the first pitcher
and downed two-thirds of the second pitcher's contents before putting the
container down and sitting back in her seat. She was sweating profusely, and
her complexion was now the bright-red shade of a really bad sunburn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

worry - all that water should dilute it,&quot; Andrea said, her Goth-style
makeup adding a slight chill to her interestingly attractive facial features -
a touch androgynous, if one looked very closely.<i> I hope, she also thought to
herself.</i> &quot;Before we start up, there's something you all should know.
Upchuck is going to try and steal Ted away for the group he's in.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sandi both spun around from their spots at the cafeteria table the nine
students of Group Three sat at to look across the room at Group One, where
Upchuck sat. For his part, Upchuck ('Little Charles' to a select few, including
one Stacy 'Nibblet' Rowe - and it would have stunned EVERYONE to know that they
had been dating for the past year) glanced over at them in return, and turned
back to his conversation with his group...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

don't want to work with him - he's entirely too rude and disrespectful to the

take him to a meeting of the 'Promise Keepers' and show him how real men
interact with the fairer sex!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

at Ted the way she'd look at roadkill, then continued after a moment of
internal dissention - which didn't go unnoticed. &quot;I heard him talking with
that Rowe girl, Griffin,&quot; Andrea directed towards Sandi. &quot;Upchuck
said that he's got some stuff about the Doctor's other classes and the way he
grades, so they're going to - I think he said, 'do an end run around the
Doctor'. Something about backstops, backstairs. I don't know.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

guess we're down to eight now,&quot; Jodie sighed, watching as Upchuck spoke to
an excited Ted and then moved over to make room for him at the table. &quot;So,
we're supposed to use these conversion tables to determine what talents we
have, yada, yada, yada. First things first. We need to decide where we'll place
the shelter.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Wrong,
Jodie, &quot;Sandi interrupted. &quot;First, we should nominate Brittany as our
chief of security. I remember how she handled her business out in the woods,
and she can probably kick anybody's ass here. Besides, she can cut Kevin off if
he tells anybody where we're putting the shelter.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

her mouth as if to speak, but then nodded. &quot;Not bad, Sandi. Anybody else
got any nominations for security chief?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I was
thinking of Mack,&quot; Jane said, getting a strange look from Daria. &quot;His
dad's a corporate security expert, so he probably knows all about how you'd put
together security for a place like this.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

them both,&quot; Sandi said. &quot;They should be able to keep Kevin from
opening his mouth. We also need to think about buying materials through 'dummy'
companies - that way, it'll be harder to trace things back to the
project.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

as she took out her Dictaphone and turned it on. &quot;Good idea, Sandi. I
think we need to begin by cordoning off the entire area for a five-mile area,
and putting all sorts of monitors out to watch out for people. Brittany, what
do we want out there?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Well,
we'll have a combination of active and passive sensors, Jodie,&quot; Brittany
said, sipping a diet soda. &quot;We start with a network of ultrasensitive
bioscanners that'll detect the electromagnetic signal put out by the human
heart and brain about the area, as well as motion detectors, thermal-imaging
panoramic video cameras, weight-specific vibration detectors set for human-norm
weight levels and low-power UV laser-grids - if something breaks a beam, we'll
know they're there AND they can't see the beam without special equipment!
You'll also need to put scent-detectors on the laser-grid emitters - people try
to use mirrors to defeat the beams, but if we cue the scent-detectors to track
for human scents OR just for soap, you'll get them as soon as they get
close!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;We'll go ahead and electrify the fences - and run armed
patrols along the perimeter every thirty minutes, but stagger the start of each
period so that any intruder can't figure out any pattern to patrol times,&quot;
the bubbly cheerleader continued. &quot;We should also just go ahead and use
dogs, because they'll catch any bad guys that manage to defeat our tech and
they'll have better instincts on if something's wrong on the perimeter! One
more thing - we need to have a security strike unit on three-minute standby at
all times in case of hostile incursion or in case someone on staff breaks
containment during the construction phase! They'll need to be heavily armed,
and I recommend that they act in two groups: a unit in helicopters to quickly
locate and pin the intruders down, and a fast-moving ground unit in Humvees to
sanitize the area!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

bigoted. It's wrong, and you should apologize to Mack and Jodie. Second - in

for the way she just killed two birds with one stone - he saw how Jodie had
turned towards Sandi, and was surprised that she hadn't snapped and flattened
the girl long before. The debacle of Linda Griffin's buying her daughter a
Student Council seat and the resulting blowup the two had in the 'Class Land'
group house (may <u>that</u> abortion be buried and forever forgotten) had
stoked Jodie's underlying anger towards Sandi like a furnace at a German

one. You'd think that with Jodie as his girl, he'd smile more often - but then,
she'd never seen Jodie treat Mack the way he did her... you know, like someone
you really cared about like that... <i>And you know, the Kevin thing's getting a

six-foot-four and built like a bulldozer,&quot; Jake told her. &quot;He lied
about his age, of course, and they sent him to the South Pacific with a
flame-thrower and an attitude. He got the name 'Mad Dog' because - well, one
time, his unit was pinned down by heavy fire coming out of a dense area of the
jungle, so he managed to sneak out of the ambush. The others in his unit thought
he was a coward and ran away, but he was moving around and through the jungle

six of the enemy - apparently, they had the same thought he did about making
their way behind. They start shooting, he flames them as he gets hit - and his
tank gets nicked. One of the bad guys - I don't know, he must've thought about
getting a brand-new flame-thrower from the U.S. Marines was a good idea. So -

running - in total fear of something coming behind them... and that's when they
see Dad charging after the soldiers, literally foaming at the mouth and yelling
incoherently at the top of his voice! He actually ran through the flames, with
the flame-thrower in one hand, the sword in the other - and the belt still
tight around his neck, looking for all the world like a broken leash!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

really bothered the platoon CO - he had Dad checked out for mental problems.
Meanwhile, the big-shots are looking over the combat area: it turns out that
the bad guys had the firepower to wipe out the entire unit and then move in to
do serious damage to the landing craft on the beach about five miles away. If
that wasn't enough to make them go nice with Dad, checking his flame-thrower
and finding his makeshift repairs -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Jake said. &quot;The nickname 'Mad Dog' stuck almost immediately... and then they
stuck him behind a desk for the next three years - except for promotional
tours. They found out about his age but they couldn't put him back into action
- so he waited, went into Recon, and zoomed through jump school. When he turned
nineteen, he got married - and when Korea happened, he volunteered. I was born

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;It was
okay, I guess - being the son of 'Mad Dog' - until they sent me to Buxton
Ridge. I hated he place,&quot; Jake reflected. &quot;There was one nice thing
about military school, though: there was a cook there. Albert Horstmeyer. He
was career Army - thirty-five years running mess halls and dining rooms on
three continents, and even Presidents ate his food. He would tell me
stories...&quot; Lauriel smiled as she saw the content, warm look the memories
brought over him. &quot;I learned all sorts of things about cooking and food
from him. 'Gunny Horse-Meat' - they called him that out of backhanded respect,
because he could feed men a good meal with anything he got his hands on... Gunny
showed me that wearing a uniform and serving your country didn't have to mean
killing everything in sight, or being a 'big hero'... it could just mean making
the lives of the people around you a bit better, even if it's just for a single
meal. I guess that's why I always try to cook for my girls...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

over and hugged him, and for once, he didn't resist as she put her arms around

understand,&quot; Jake said, brushing the hair away from Lauriel's eyes.
&quot;When I lost that 'pet cigars' account a year or so back, I felt so empty;
like I wasn't worth anything. That's why I started cooking again. With
everything from Helen and her career to the girls to my business on the fritz,
I needed something to make me feel good again, like those times I had in the
mess hall at Buxton Ridge. And then, when I got a chance to work with you, and
all the time we've had together...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A sudden,
uncomfortable feeling came over the both of them, and Lauriel pulled away from
his touch as she stood up. &quot;I, ah, think that we should go back and edit
our lunches.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

exited the room quickly and quietly, each acutely aware of the other's personal
space as Jake allowed Lauriel to go ahead of him out the door. Neither gave a
second thought to the still insensate form of Vance, alone and prone on the
small bed behind them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Oh, I'm
so happy for you!&quot; Stacy cried out, wrapping her arms around him in a hug.
&quot;Everyone's going to be so impressed by what you're going to do - oh, it's
going to be so wonderful!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

Stacy...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;No,&quot;
he replied, putting a single finger to her lips. &quot;You are such a special
girl, Stacy Rowe. You should have guys running up to you and begging to do
anything you want. You shouldn't have to be around vain, empty-headed things
like Quinn Morgendorffer and Sandi Griffin and play their lapdog, constantly
telling them how smart and witty and pretty they are! Unlike you, not one of
them has a depth and a personality that makes their beauty even more
divine.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was
moments like this that made Stacy feel like a princess in a Greco-Roman mythic
tale. A witty, godlike creature in love with her, a wonderful, divine presence
that literally swept her off her feet each and every time he cast a gaze in her
direction, or spoke to her with words of love and admiration. This, she
thought, she could enjoy for a lifetime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>She remembered how she was within the beginnings of a
relationship with Ted Dewitt-Clinton, but that ended when he would constantly
make disparaging remarks about Charles. One day, tired of the Sandi-esque
tirade of Ted's about Charles and his attitudes towards women, Stacy turned to
him and asked him, &quot;Do you know Charles, Ted? Do you know him as a person?
If you don't, then how can you say all of these things about him?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ted
challenged her to live up to her own words. She did - after breaking up with
him - and sought out Charles ('Upchuck' at the time, she remembered with a
passing sense of shame). She wanted to find out why he was like he was - or if
he really was like that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He was. Oh,
without a doubt, he was... but it was a family thing, she discovered. The
Ruttheimers was a family with a tradition of lasciviousness to shame the
Borgias, the Martin Sheen family, or any extended clan created by Aaron
Spelling or Jackie Collins. Lotharios and Valentinos filled the male ranks for
generations, while Mata Hari, Catherine the Great and Erica Kane might just as
well have been female Ruttheimers. Sexuality and sensuality was the order of
the day in the Clan Ruttheimer... which also disguised the fact that Ruttheimers
were also all-but-undisputed masters of whatever area they chose to enter.
Charles' father was a computer guru of the first order; his twin older sisters
were, respectively, a noted music critic and an Olympic-class martial artist
&amp; fencer. And Charles? He could not only make a computer dance like his
father, but his skills as an artist were such that they could put Jane Lane -
Lawndale High's best - on notice that there was a new gunslinger in town. Stacy
still gasped in awe every time she went into Charles' room and saw some of his
works - the fractal image of a black hole in space, the reproduction of the
'nude, swirling demons' image from 'The Devil's Advocate', but with the faces
and figures of some of their fellow students from LHS - and a museum-quality
portrait of Charles' parents. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Stacy cringed
inwardly as she thought of them. Charles the Second was a nice man and had no
problems with their dating - but his <i><u>mother</u></i>... <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Bronwyn Ruttheimer had married into the clan, and she was an
intelligent, statuesque Irish inferno that had absolutely no love for Stacy
whatsoever. None. Period. The end. She wanted Stacy GONE. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>She tried to talk to her, but Bronwyn was adamant in her
belief that Stacy would one day meet someone else, turn on her 'Little Charles'
and hurt him. Stacy wanted Bronwyn to understand that SHE understood, that she
wouldn't hurt Charles like that, that she was coming to understand what being a
Ruttheimer really meant... and, she discovered one night, as she was drifting off
to sleep, that she wouldn't mind becoming part of that legacy... <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She knew,
though, that any chance of that meant someday going head-to-head with Bronwyn.
That meant becoming tougher than she was now, stronger - it meant having some
friends who were strong enough to stand up to Bronwyn, too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But that was
in the future. For right now, dealing with <u>her</u> Ruttheimer and his innate
drives came first...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;That
doesn't keep you from still hitting on Daria Morgendorffer,&quot; Stacy pointed
out, a sharpened point of actual jealously easing through her with painful
slowness. &quot;How do you think it makes me feel when I hear about or see you
worming your way up to one of those girls -?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;If I
didn't still make passes at them on occasion, they would wonder why I
stopped,&quot; Upchuck told her. &quot;They would start prying, and then they
would find out about us. I don't want them to know until I've finished - that
way, I'll be able to give you what you deserve. You should be able to walk
proudly on your own... and walk with whoever you want.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I
am,&quot; Stacy said, kissing the tip of his finger. &quot;I'm going to walk
down these halls with you. I don't care about what any of the others in the
Fashion Club think about us, Charles. I want everyone to know how I feel.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

they'll always make fun of you - because of me... 'Upchuck,&quot; he objected.
&quot;They've always made fun of me. I don't care, because I know what I am and
to hell with what any of them think... but not to you, Stacy. They're not going
to hurt you because of me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

big tears appeared in her eyes. &quot;You don't have to prove anything to me
-&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

I'm going to walk hand-in-hand with you down the halls of this school, and no

not repeat it,&quot; Angela growled, her voice unnaturally low. &quot;Now, back
to the case of Miss Morgendorffer. You decided to take it upon yourself to take
this course of action without consulting me -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

call you for help unzipping my pants either - although, if you're so inclined,
I think that we could work something -&quot; He let a huge grin cross his face,
countering the Siberian-grade stare Angela projected at him. &quot;You see,
that's the problem here at Lawndale High. The people who're having all the sex
aren't the ones who need it!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

leaned forward from the wall he was holding up. &quot;Yeah. I'm finished. Now,
I'll listen to anything sensible that you have to say.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Angela almost
hyperventilated at the man's comment, but quickly composed herself.
&quot;Doctor, I have been watching Miss Morgendorffer since her arrival here
two years ago - and aside from a number of... quirks, she has been a beacon of
academic progress and achievement! I personally recommended her for your
seminar because I felt she would come out of it as a superior pupil!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;There's
only one problem with your idea, Ms. Li - the child doesn't want it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Excuse
me?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Ms. Li,
Daria's an incredible student, but she doesn't want to be here,&quot; the
Doctor said, walking over and sitting down on top of Li's desk. &quot;Your
academic environment is slightly next to useless for bringing out the
potentials of a mind like hers, and when you factor in the excess baggage she
has from home, her so-called social life and God knows what else, she's a
walking time bomb running hot and loose in your nitroglycerine factory. You blew
your shot with Morgendorffer. If it wasn't for the few friends she has, you'd
have lost her at least a year ago.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Why, I
- you, you can't say that about my school!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I just
did - and you know that I'm right,&quot; he said, looking her directly in the
eye. &quot;Your hardcore, 'Stalag 17' approach to education may work for all
those kids who need for someone to watch over them and keep them on the
straight and narrow, but for a Daria Morgendorffer, this is barely 'Stalag 13'!
You need to get her into some program that'll not only challenge her mental
abilities and gifts, but may actually offer an environment that'll allow her to
open up and face whatever's wrong with her! You know she needs that, and even
if I did keep her in my program, it's not really geared for a girl like her. If
she really wanted to, she could ace the coursework without a sweat - but she
wouldn't enjoy it, and THAT'S one of the important parts of the program... that
the kids not only learn, but enjoy doing it&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>The Doctor stood up and began to walk across the room.
&quot;Ms. Li -for some reason, Daria simply doesn't enjoy life. She sees all of
this as a curse, and she'd ruin the joy of the course for the rest of the
students. What she needs is an environment where she can't simply say, 'I don't
have to bother with this because this is stupid.&quot; She needs to be among
young men and women with similar intellect - similar skills, abilities, perhaps
interests; other kids who'll look her in the eye and say, 'So, you think you're
better than us? Prove it!' - or they'll sit back and tell her, 'You think
you've suffered before? Before we're done with you, you're going to beg to be
back with those Lawndale High hicks!&quot; She needs an environment that'll
provide experiences and challenges that will force her to grow beyond her shell
and her comfort zone, one that'll force her to rise above and beyond what she
is now - and in the process, begin to mature into an actual person.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Ms. Li sat silently as the Doctor turned back. &quot;And if
she doesn't get it soon, it's going to be too late. The type of woman she could
possibly become... is not the type of person I want to think about.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;You have valid points,&quot; Angela finally said.
&quot;But the fact remains, sir, that Daria does not wish to attend Grove Hills
- or any other preparatory academy, either.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;She will,&quot; the Doctor said quietly. &quot;She
will.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Angela's eyebrows raised slowly. &quot;Indeed. You have a way
with... altering a person's path - not that it's always successful...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;DO NOT blame me for Trent Lane. He had - HAS - a
frightening potential... and I'm not the one responsible for that asinine stunt
in the bookstore. If people had listened to me, he wouldn't be wasting away
doing a piss-poor Cobain impression on any crappy stage that'll have him and
screwing all the local scrags.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>There was a moment of silence. &quot;I would appreciate it in
the future if you would keep me informed of what you're doing,&quot; Angela
sighed. &quot;For example, I had a meeting earlier with young Mr. Ruttheimer -
something about the assignment in your class. You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, do you? Or, should I say - would you like to?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;News to me, more or less,&quot; the Doctor said,
&quot;and no - I wouldn't want to know. In every class, some kid in my class
tries to do an end run around my primary assignment. This time, I think it's
this Ruttheimer kid. Let's see what he's got to offer: did I ever tell you
about the time...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kyle smiled
as he leaned back in his chair, almost relishing the images of communal looks of
discomfort throughout the class from the day before - and the choruses of
mumbles and groans almost made him laugh out loud, especially as he recalled
the young faces before him. Sitting on the desk before him were the results of
a specialized test battery he had surprised the students in his seminar with
three days earlier - the 'Pop Quiz', as it was called by the instructors in the
program.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>As the seminar teaching syllabus recommended, Kyle always
sprang 'the Pop Quiz' on the kids in his seminar at about a week and a half to
two weeks into the program. It gave him an idea on who to focus on - and
ensured that all but the chronically idiotic would score at least a 'C' in the
course. Got to keep the parents and administrators happy, so we can keep coming
back to the schools...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>For his part, Kyle always considered the test battery as
someone's own personal tribute to the supersecret training simulation made
famous in 'Star Trek'. He actually marveled at the fact that, after the six
years he had been running the seminars at schools in the Midwest (and over
twenty years of being given out by instructors in 'The Program' - 'Project Fast
Forward' had been operating since 1979, when it began in several schools in
Central Illinois), no one had ever spilled the secret about 'the Pop Quiz'. It
was a test that, in conjunction with the school administration, was given at
the beginning of the day - as it was almost as difficult as the ACT or SAT
testing, and took almost four hours to complete. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There were
several reasons for 'The Pop Quiz'; unknown to the students, each was given a
set of situations, questions and problems specifically designed and tailored
for each individual student to create and foster optimum levels of mental
stress and personal discomfort. Creating subconscious messages within the
student did this; messages that questioned, made insinuations towards or raised
doubt about the environment and home life the student was raised in, as well as
certain closely held beliefs, attitudes, desires and even fears.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Lane's quiz, for example, prefaced almost everything to convey
subliminal images and messages about the positive benefits and advantages of
stereotypical American family values and lifestyles - the 'nuclear family' - in
respect to the negatives of any other family grouping or structures. It also
generated images and messages about the intolerance and general antipathy
society held towards the 'starving artist', touched upon the blatantly selfish
and morally vacant nature of individuals who criminally chose their own needs
for artistic expression above the needs of their offspring, and how persons who
subjugated their desires to 'explore their muses' in order to obtain financial
and personal success and acclaim were not only destined for greater things - but
were, in fact, more honest &amp; in touch with themselves, as well as having a
more focused and insightful worldview. Coming from a bohemian, 'latchkey child'
upbringing and yet being subjected to a concentrated dosage of stimuli which
suggested that her lifestyle wasn't conducive to her becoming an 'upstanding,
successful member of society', Lane would gradually exhibit greater levels of
stress and discomfort during the test - which would certainly factor into how
she would view the stated situations and complete the questions<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of the
things the test measured was how far off their normal behavioral patterns the
kids would go after being subjected to these unconscious levels of stress;
another was the 'default factor'- the near-instinctual set of behaviors that
each individual would fall back upon in times of stress. Very similar to the
'fight-or-flight' response in almost all beings (including humans), the
'default factor' was something that could be altered or supplemented by
training. The intensity of the training, and the relative age and intelligence
of the subject, were primary considerations involved in the alteration of a
person's DFI (Default Factor Index). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Young,
above-average OR below-average intelligence, and positive responses to very
intense training and indoctrination. Those were the elements for a 'perfect'
DFI rating of 15 (on a scale of 0 to 30), and DFI ratings of 12 to 17 were
considered as 'viable for consideration of recruitment'. Anyone with a DFI
rating below five would NEVER change - they simply didn't have the mental
faculties for even short-term shiftover (the term used to describe DFI
alterations). DFI values between 19 to 23 were considered average, and a good
70%to 80% of all those tested scored in this range. Over 25 - well, in about
half of those cases, their minds would accept new skills and training, but that
training almost never seemed to become second nature in stress situations,
particularly combat - except in one specific area. In those cases, the person
had an almost-genetic predisposition towards specific areas - 'savant' was the
perfect term for them, and they were practically useless for anything else. The
remainder of those DFI-25 and over, well, those persons were just too damned
smart (not to mention 'quirky', 'eccentric' or just down and outright
'strange') and for them to be of any use, their special talents or skills had
to be identified and reinforced as soon as possible. Overall, those persons
tended to become 'specialists' in one area or another, possessed of the ability
to make fundamental advances within their area of expertise ... if found and
trained soon enough. Too long, and... Kyle shuddered, thinking once again of
Trent Lane - the only 30 he had ever heard of since the program began. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

martial arts skills, well before kickboxing gained favor with women and
'Tae-Bo' reared its ugly head? She bore watching... Griffin - 17. Same as Taylor
- better keep an eye on her... and NOT for that. Ruttheimer - 26. He had heard

Big surprise. Her parents had beaten her into mental submission so long ago that
all she WOULD be good for is learning new things to please whoever was around.
Not really worth looking further into, but she might make one hell of an
effective diplomat someday... see if she's got some language skills, and make a
call or two for the child. Mackenzie - 20. He really wasn't a consideration.
Thomphson - 6. Another surprise... thought he wouldn't go higher than 4. Guess
that's why he's the QB - Woo-hoo. Hecuba-Thorne - 21. Statistically average.
Dewitt-Clinton - 24. See? Home schooling works - if you want to make a superior
intellect, bereft of basic social skills, that'll spend the rest of his or her
