<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>So, this
must be how a gazelle feels when it's about to die,</i> Sandi allowed, her eyes
half-closed from lack of air and burning from the droplets of sweat and tiny
bits of dirt and grass inside her eyelids. Her limbs seemed to be detached,
unwilling to obey her commands, and cold fire began to slowly move up from the base
of her spine as her lungs seemed to fill to bursting with thousands of tiny,
sharpened, burning needles...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And then,
there was the crushing sensation around her neck, filled with sharpness; it was
almost as if she could feel the blood stop on its own and flow out through the
wounds on her neck - were there wounds? <i>What happened, and I can't die now -
I actually have a clue about what I can do... I don't have to fight to be in a
spotlight with Quinn or my mother - I don't have to be in a spotlight at all! I
can make my own light...</i> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The pain grew
sharper, even more intense as it flowed out through her body and back again,
and there was no more air for Sandi to breathe, and no energy for her to try,
even if the pressure hadn't increased around her neck like a slow vise turning,
and turning...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>&quot;Good
God, Jodie - LET HER GO!&quot;<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sound of
flesh impacting across flesh reverberated through Sandi and for the briefest of
moments, for a split-second, she had regained control-<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And the pain
began again, as though she was being braided on the wheel an inch at a time.
This time, somehow, Sandi turned into the pain, turning into the liquid agony
as a boat turns into the wave: <i>It's pain. Does it matter if it's in your
head or through your stomach or if it comes across your back from an extension
cord or when your grandmother says you're an ugly little girl? If it's pain,
you can lock it away - lock it in one of those tiny little boxes I've got
somewhere in the back of my mind, where no one will <u>ever</u> see -<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Or I can
turn it around. I can turn it back; I can let it go back the way it came - with
interest. Remember that, Sam, when you tried to burn my hair? I wonder if that
old pervert remembers - or if he's too busy breathing through the hole in his
neck: and you're going to remember, too...<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sandi would
never remember the vicious, instinctive manner in which she sent the pain
through; she only knew that she had somehow turned it back, and the force of
doing so sent her tumbling out of the world of burning, piercing pain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>I remember now...</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Images poured
back into the young woman's mind like flood waters through a burst dam: how she
went outside to get a breath of fresh air - clean air, she corrected herself,
feeling as though she had been left with a slight sheen of pure filth coating
her body. I went over the line - as they see it, she told herself, but I did
the right thing. They know I did, otherwise they would have said something!
They know that it had to be said - and maybe Daria doesn't deserve to be flamed
that way, but there isn't a person who knows her who could argue that she
didn't bring it upon herself -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And that's
when she saw Jodie. In slow motion - the way the human perception engages when
in primal situations; 'fight or flight', in this case. She saw her through the
glass doors at the front entrance, and something within her snapped as Jodie's
eyes came up and connected with her own.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Sandi knew that she was no coward. She wasn't a brawler by any
means, and fighting simply messed up one's clothes and looks - if the other
person fought like a girl. But at that moment, Something inside her snapped
free of its bindings and said, in a voice as clearly as that of Tiffany or
Stacy (who she would forever believe had actually spoken those words of warning
to her):<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Run, Sandi.
Now. Don't stop to talk or try to reason. Run. You're going to die if you
don't...<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And Sandi
took off running, catapulting forward with such velocity that Coach Morris -
who had witnessed the entire event - made a promise to herself: <i>If that
child manages to survive the day, I'll be DAMNED if I don't get her into a
Lawndale High track uniform!<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sandi ran -
but she wasn't an athlete, and she was tired, and the adrenal burst that fear
gave her was beginning to wear thin...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>*****<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jodie didn't
hear the sound of Mack beside her as she walked down the hallway. She didn't
hear the words he used to attempt to calm and console her, no could she hear
the extraneous noises and voices that made up the background noise of Lawndale
High...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>When I
find her... please, let her run,</i> Jodie thought, the smile on her face sending
students and more than a few adults moving out of her way with, if not speed,
then with haste. <i>Let her run just a bit - the kill always tastes better when
it's taken as game. And don't let her trip over a rock, or a patch or air or
something. I'm going to run her down and beat on her the way she did Daria. I'm
going to let these bastards around here live the clich&eacute; as I act black and slap
fire from her rancid tollbooth ass! Oh, please fight back, just a little -<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And then,
through the glass of the front doors, she saw Sandi, talking to two of those
Fashion Club - <i>No, I won't go that far down in the gutter with my language,
not even on them. I'm going to put you in check, bitch!<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In that
moment, Jodie recalled a quotation from Homer she had read long ago: <i>'There
are no compacts between lions and men, and wolves and lambs have no concord.</i>'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two pairs of

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mack would
later regret that he moved too slowly to stop Jodie from taking off after her:
he didn't understand that he had about as much chance of stopping her as of
turning back the time of day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sandi ran at
full speed for the better part of a block and a half; Jodie pursued her with
the extreme myopia reserved for Terminators locked onto their targets. Sandi
was fast, agile and had a head start, but she was beginning to tire...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jodie
launched herself through the air at Sandi's neck, bringing the both of them
down in a small, fenced-off vacant lot. &quot;Time to go, Griffin,&quot; Jodie
spoke tonelessly, her vise-grip hands locked around Sandi's neck as she began
to apply pressure. &quot;When you hit the ninth ring of Hell, say 'wuzzup' to
the big guy from me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A small crowd
of teen onlookers had already gathered by the time Mack, Kevin and Brittany,
driving in Kevin's Jeep, got to the lot; Sandi was beginning to turn blue, her
legs and arms flopping about as Jodie calmly applied more pressure around her
neck...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Good
God, Jodie - LET HER GO!&quot; Mack shouted at the top of his lungs, racing in
and grabbing at Jodie's hands when her head turned slowly, her eyes met his -
and he realized that whatever or whoever he knew as Jodie Landon was currently
running with the 'OUT TO LUNCH' sign in the window. Hauling back, he slapped
Jodie as hard as he could -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-And promptly
found himself on his back, wincing in pain from the all-out blow to the solar
plexus that he had never even seen coming in! &quot;Jodie...&quot; he gasped,
looking over to where his girlfriend actually yawned as she continued to
throttle Sandi - and his eyes widened as a hard, sharp kick flashed out from
Sandi, sending Jodie flying a good six feet through the air and into a nearby
tangle of kids!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jodie managed
to pick herself up, grasping at her side where she had been kicked, and she
looked over to Sandi. &quot;What was I doing...?&quot; she said, allowing
Brittany to help her up as Kevin hauled Mack to his feet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Oh, Jodie, you didn't know what you were doing!&quot;
Brittany wailed, glancing over to where Tiffany and Stacy were helping a now
pale-skinned Sandi up. &quot;It was like you were going crazy, or something!
You were really trying to hurt her, but you couldn't do something like that,
but I SAW you, and -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;What in
the blessed blue blazes of Hell's going on here?&quot; Ms. Li bellowed out over
a bullhorn, dismounting from the LHS 'detention' bus (actually, an old
transport bus from the Department of Corrections painted in Lions
'blue-'n-gold') with a number of LHS security guards stampeding off the bus in
full riot gear. &quot;Guards - secure this area! Nobody's going ANYWHERE until
I find out what's going on!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Naturally,
everyone scattered. Disappearing like alley rats through a crack, the Fashion
Club slipped through holes in the dilapidated old plank fence, while Mack,
Jodie in his arms as he fought his way through the rushing crowd and leaped
into the back of Kevin's Jeep, where Brittany and Kevin already had the engine
revving. &quot;Go! Go! Go!&quot; Mack yelled, holding on as Kevin dropped his
foot on the gas like an anvil, and left a streak of rubber in the street forty
feet long.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thirty
seconds later, there wasn't a teenager to be found in plain sight. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

it, Principal Li,&quot; a videocamera-wielding security type said as he paraded
off the bus. &quot;Three videocameras providing coverage of the disturbance
from separate angles to ensure maximum coverage and identifiability of the
suspects - just like in training. In fact, this was probably easier.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Right,&quot;
Angela harumphed. &quot;Get those tapes edited down and have video captures of
every student identified on my desk by noon tomorrow. I'm not about to have any
gang activity anywhere near my school! Right? Right! Check the area for
anything left behind that can ID someone, and then - let's move out!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

pulling over to the side of the road. &quot;Mack, how is she, man?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

felt how Jodie's skin had suddenly become cold and clammy, and her body went
into a series of spasmodic fits. &quot;Don't think! Put your foot on the gas

in! What the hell have you done, Daria? Backpedal, Daria, back it off...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

tentacles that was Upchuck's gaze as it came slithering across her body, moving
up and then back down her legs with a cold, almost slimy feel... no, wait, that
was the napkin she wiped her face with earlier. She pulled it off her leg,
tossed it into a nearby trash can and looked up to see Upchuck busy flipping
through pages in his project folder. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Group One (Upchuck's group) now had sixteen people in it - almost half the
class. Dr. Armalin had inquired about the defections from the other groups,
reminding them that only six could go into the group shelter, but had only
gotten wry smiles from the teens. He relented, noticing the teens looking up at
him like a pack of panthers gazing up at a deer on a rocky ledge...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Daria shot him a harsh gaze, set on 'full metal jacket', as she followed his
gaze to her legs. &quot;It seems that your fellows don't have the...
appreciation... for your special qualities that I do. Join us, Daria. With your
intellect and pristine physical perfection, you could be...&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Upchuck said, almost as if by nature, and Daria felt a warm spot appear within
herself. At least with him, the world was still the same. &quot;I have to write
that down. Consider the offer, my dear. It won't last long.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

as the four new teenagers walked across the cafeteria, and she could SWEAR that
the 'Theme from V.I.P.' started to play in the background as they seemed to
walk in slow motion. <i>I have got to consider medication...<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first one
was a downy, athletic WASP of a teen-queen dream with way-long, platinum blonde
hair, intelligent brown eyes and a tiny, perfect nose that any girl in the
Fashion Club would have sold her soul for. She was dressed in a lush,
parchment-hued angora sweater that refused to hide her endowments, with a
matching virgin-wool full-length skirt and suede boots; a tiny platinum necklace
with a hanging topaz stone and tiny, matching earrings completed the look. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second
teen was a Latino, and younger than the others - probably fourteen, or even
thirteen. He was, however, very attractive to look at - perhaps the most
attractive of the foursome - and he was still on the border between being a
'cute kid' and a 'handsome young man', quite tall, but still boy-thin. He wore
cutting-edge urban gear - the latest in 'FUBU' athletic wear, Oakley
sun-shields EXACTLY like the pair James Marsden wore in 'X-Men', and 'Vince
Carter' footwear. He also had a DVD-Audio recorder/player attached to a
custom-made carrier attached to his left leg, a PDA and an iridium cell phone
(capable of satellite phone calls to ANYWHERE on the planet) in a similar rig on
his right, as well as a ultraslim digital camcorder in a flattened
shoulder-holster rig and a quartet of 'Charms Blow-Pops' in his front jacket
pocket. His hair was perfectly slicked back and styled, and the beginnings of a
lady-killer legend were visible whenever he flashed his perfect smile...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Italian, and Daria was sure that wherever she went, there was no way that this
girl was going to EVER escape being noticed. She was tiny - even shorter than
Daria was - but made up for it with a porcelain complexion, a custom-designed
face and a slender, curved figure (contours, not proportion) that male
comic-book readers and artists dream about at night. Her glossy, night-black
hair was cut short; combined with large, oak-brown eyes and naturally full,
pouty lips, Daria wondered how Upchuck was able to look at her and not pass out
from lack of blood to what stood in for his brain. The look was even further
enhanced by the young woman's attire; a body-hugging set of crimson &amp;
eggplant-hued leather pants and matching bolero-style jacket, set off by a hot
mustard-colored satin half-top and Maria Taylor sandals of the same color. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The final
member of the foursome was an African-American, and apparently a fan of the
movie 'Shaft', by the way he dressed. He was just as tall as the Latino
street-tech, but easily as big - and as handsome- as Mack, with the shaved-head
look many young Black men favored. He was a walking ad for Armani, as he wore a
three-quarters-length black leather jacket like the one worn by Samuel L.
Jackson in the movie. He also wore the black monochromatic shirt, tie and
slacks of the Regis Philbin Collection, tiny, stylish Armani sunglasses, and a
pair of black Gucci glove-leather loafers that looked so comfortable that they
had to be real.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;To quote Errol Flynn: 'What a pity her manners don't

Upchuck replied, and Daria suddenly felt as if she were upon a stage in the middle
of a county fair auction. &quot;This... delectable excursion into the joy that is
woman, my friends, is the fair Daria Morgendorffer. Like Harvard, diamonds and
James Bond - there is no substitute.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Is she always like this?&quot; Leda sighed, she and the
four other teenagers gathered around and looking down at a now unconscious
Daria, who lay out on the cafeteria floor. &quot;You know - someone could have
TRIED to catch her.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Oh, yeah - I catch her, she says I felt her up, and the
next thing you know, there's lawsuits, court costs, we end up featured on MSNBC
and Naomi Wolf gets pimp-slapped by Eminem over us during the first segment on
'Politically Incorrect!&quot; Antonio shot back. &quot;Look on the bright side
- she can always sue the school.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Is
someone going to check her out?&quot; David Allen asked. &quot;She could have
hurt herself.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Daria's
got a head like a bank vault,&quot; Upchuck tossed in. &quot;She'll be all
right.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Nah,&quot;
Upchuck returned. &quot;After the way she got chewed by Sandi Griffin today,
she could probably use a rest.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;You know, she does have a pretty face,&quot; Juneau
observed, glancing down at the insensate form. &quot;You could do a lot with
her features - you know, I don't think she's ever used makeup! Look at her skin
- really nice, although a touch of moisturizer wouldn't exactly kill her...&quot;
She looked her over again. &quot;She really isn't that bad-looking at
all...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Yeah, she's a 'plain hot dog,&quot; Antonio agreed.
&quot;She'll look good if somebody dressed her up, but she's not bad as is.
What do you think, David Allen?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;That
the Fashion Club here at Lawndale High is a bunch of fascists or idiots,&quot;
David Allen remarked, tossing a glance in Upchuck's direction. &quot;Man, LC -
you called it right on this one. I know you're steamed because your dad won't
let you go there - I won't even bring up your <u>mom</u> and her art kick - but
would it have been too much to tell this girl that at Grove Hills - WE'RE the
good guys?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;And
miss a moment like this? Perish the thought!&quot; Upchuck laughed. &quot;I
wanted to see you revealed in all your glory!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Let
them marvel at our splendor,&quot; Antonio remarked. &quot;Durga the Hutt. Can
we get something to eat now, somewhere? This is a cafeteria!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Let's
let our friend Little Charles take us somewhere,&quot; Leda said, curling her
tongue in a manner that would have impressed a Bond girl. &quot;Consider it a
token of gratitude for this light-hearted moment with his friend.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Ah, my
dear, but in the words of Josef Stalin, 'Gratitude is a disease of dogs,&quot;
Upchuck smirked as Leda snaked an arm seductively around him. &quot;And your
world-class charms hold power over me no longer, my sinful little canole. I
have a girl in my life.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;What?
When did this happen?&quot; Juneau said, genuinely surprised and pleased by the
announcement. &quot;One word, LC - details!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Of
course, but first, I want to take you down to our pool. Let me show you how I'm
going to get a recommendation to Harvard, along with college hours from my work
here,&quot; the young man said, leaning back to let Leda walk slightly ahead of
him - and receiving a scowl from Juneau in return. &quot;Do any of you take the
opportunity to watch the UPN Network on Wednesday nights?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The five
students headed for the doorway, leaving Daria unconscious on the floor.
&quot;And one more thing, LC?&quot; David Allen said. &quot;Tell someone about
the girl...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

this is one reason why I can deal with a chick like Daria hanging around,&quot;
Jesse Moreno yawned, chugging an entire two-liter bottle of cola down in several
gulps as he watched the overhead TV. &quot;She's a brainy type who can get into
the weird and strange stuff... must be why she hangs around always looking at
you, Trent.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Go
finger your own guitar,&quot; Trent replied, a slight smirk on his face as he
turned from the 'Sick, Sad World - The Soundtrack' video display in the foyer
area of 'Thrash Into Cash', the newest music store in Cranberry Commons. Trent
loved coming into this place - a mom-and-pop shop that understood what the 21<sup>st</sup>
Century was all about, and was here to do something about it. 'T-I-C' had one
of the most widespread collections of music that Trent had ever seen (from
first-generation, pre-gangsta rap to 1930's no-shit, 'nothing's ever gone right
for me' Mississippi delta blues, and from taped baleen whale mating sounds -
great for having nasty sex to - to the latest in first disks from college, bar
and house bands all over the country). It also had one kick-ass music exchange
for everything all the way back to old-school vinyl and 8-tracks, and a serious
rep for being a place where you could find excellent music gear for prices a
starting band could handle. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The thing
that Trent really liked about ''T-I-C' was 'Thursday T-I-C.Net'. On the second
and fourth Thursday of each month, the owners would let bands come into the
studio and do a gig, which they sent off live on the Internet - and allowed the
bands to get instant feedback. The Boys of Spiral hadn't gotten their invite
yet, but they knew that it was coming...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Know

already saw the necklace, man,&quot; Jesse said, and laughed at the expression
on Trent's face. &quot;So that's why you couldn't buy the new guitar, or go
down with us to Florida...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

That's a NICE necklace. How long did you save up?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;About a
year or so,&quot; Trent admitted, and cringed as he saw the huge smile on
Jesse's face. &quot;Stop it, man.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Not
making fun of you. Just glad you admit what everybody else already knew - that
you've always had something for her,&quot; Jesse jibed. &quot;You two'll be
good together... and she's gonna love the necklace - all chicks like having even
just a little bit of jewelry...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;That's
why I got that one,&quot; Trent said, the image of the necklace about Daria's
sleek, elegant neck at the forefront of his mind. &quot;She's not a fashion
freak, but it's simple, and it's pretty. I talked to Jane - this morning - and
from what she said, it's something she'd actually wear.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Yeah.
She's not a slave to the Man's dress code like her sister, but she can have
something nice.&quot; Jesse let his smile grow larger. &quot;And she'll be glad
to wear it, because her man bought it for her.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

through and around him. &quot;Sounds real good...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

trashcan as Trent turned to run his hands over an acoustic guitar. &quot;And
who's - WHOA...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

head, Trent glanced around - and was just as starstruck as his friend as they
saw Lauriel walking into a store with Quinn, her hair loose and flowing, her
every movement unconsciously and sensuously feline...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

there goes Reason Number Two,&quot; Trent said, hormones running savage
roughshod over emotion and true love as he watched the way Lauriel's angora
sweater dress seemed to mold itself to her form as she moved. &quot;Oh,
man...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

suddenly, totally stopped in mid-step to the sound of another THUMP! As his

college boy who totaled out his dad's BMW because I was wearing a little skirt

Stacy's my friend,&quot; Quinn allowed, &quot;the others are fellow members.
Sandi got to take this big-time special seminar that they have every year, and
the other girls must've decided to wait for her and get a ride out here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

don't sound like you care that much for Sandi,&quot; Lauriel noticed aloud,
slipping into a navy-blue v-neck sweater. &quot;I noticed that this
morning.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;It's
kind of like sibling rivalry. She was like, 'most popular girl' when we moved
here, but the boys just like talking to me and helping me out more than they do
her! It's not like I encourage it - much - but she's the one with the 'Why her
and not me?' thing going on!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Quinn took up
another handful of popcorn. &quot;Also, Sandi's a real 'popularity by any means
necessary' type. Stacy's been seeing this guy who's basically the kiss of death
for any girl who wants to be popular at Lawndale, and if 'Herr President' finds
out, she'll sink them both so no one'll think she approves in any way at
all!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

looked over the doors of the changing booth with a skeptical gaze. &quot;And
you're all for them being together, Quinn...?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

how it feels when popularity gets in the way of being with someone you really
like,&quot; Quinn said quietly. &quot;I had a tutor, and I liked him... Look,
Stacy and Upchuck - I mean, Charles, they deserve to be happy, and it's not
fair that they have to basically stay on his family's estate whenever they want
to spend time together!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Ruttheimer the Third - my 'Official Number One Fan,&quot; Lauriel sighed.
&quot;He's been to EVERY open taping we've had, and put up the first 'North of
the Border' fan site on the web. He's harmless, but really annoying on
occasion. He has a girlfriend, hmn?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;And
devoted, too, Stacy's just as devoted to him - that's why I couldn't stab her
in the back by not supporting her. She deserves to be happy.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I
understand,&quot; Lauriel replied. &quot;Whenever I've had a friend, they
always end up turning on me. My sophomore year in college was really bad. My
roommate was from a really rich family in the Chicago suburbs - I think they
owned the suburb, come to think of it.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Sounds

-that was her name - was spoiled rotten, mean-spirited and jealous to the core.
She could always find a guy because of her money, and because she looked like a
life-size 'Barbie' doll - never mind that her nickname up and down Greek Row
was 'Psycho Jenn.' Guys never believed it - until she saw them even look at
another girl.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

brought a new boyfriend - a new bedwarmer, if you want to be rude - to our dorm
one night without telling me,&quot; Lauriel continued. &quot;They had been out
at the bars, the poor boy had to use the bathroom, and ran right in on me in
the shower!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Why did
he head for the shower?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Think
about it, Quinn. You're a nineteen-year old boy, you've been up all night
playing 'drain-the-keg', it's a hundred-twenty-five if the campus police see
you cut loose next to a wall, and you've spent all night with a girl who's
actually going home with you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;But she

smiled and Quinn looked mildly impressed as the woman left. &quot;Now, this is
service,&quot; the older woman smiled. &quot;Coming here is the only real
luxury I indulge in. You should come in one day and try the whirlpool, or have
lunch in the arboretum. They have a lemon meringue pie that'll make you think
you're already on the good side of the Pearly Gates, and their 'Lasagna
Extraordainaire...&quot; Lauriel sighed. &quot;When I get married, I want THAT
for the wedding dinner.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

turned around just as he rips the curtain open and was about to cut loose - and
he froze up. He couldn't go. He was just standing there, with his fly open and
he's all ready to go - and he looks me dead in the eye... and then his eyes
dropped down.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

did you do?&quot;<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I decked him.&quot;
Lauriel shrugged, stepping from the booth in a burnt-orange sweater and a
matching pair of corduroy slacks. &quot;What do you think?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;That
you're going to have people wondering how your stomach could possibly be that
firm and that flat,&quot; Quinn said. &quot;Next. You decked him?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;His
eyes were still open, and he had a silly little grin on his face when I finally
got a robe on and went back in. Jenn's screaming, he's still out cold - with
that silly little grin! - and that's when our suitemates came in through their
side of the bathroom. It made the school paper.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;He came
back a week later to ask me out. I said yes - just a movie, nothing serious,
and besides, I figured I owed him one for the right cross I gave him. Jeanette
said okay at first - she had already moved on to another guy - but she freaked
out and tried to burn the room down with us in it later that night,&quot; she
sighed. &quot;She's probably still in the hospital over in Europe...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

We ended up together for the next three years, until he went into the Air
Force,&quot; she replied. &quot;He flies for British Airways now, and he's
married with four kids. Lainie - that's his wife - is a doll, but none of his
daughters can stand me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Because
they don't realize something that Lainie does; that I'm Colin's friend and
Lainie is his wife. He likes me, but he loves her - and that's it.&quot; She
sighed sadly. &quot;I don't get to visit as much as I'd like...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;No. I
don't.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Quinn stood
up, and walked over to the door of the booth. &quot;Look, I know that somebody
like you doesn't need a sixteen-year old hovering around you and everything,
but if you'd like a friend who won't slam you because of your looks - what I
mean, is, I don't have that many real friends, either, and...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

&quot;Instead of playing it down, maybe we should crank it up, show it off, be
proud of what you've got! That way, you've got the whole 'I can wear what I
want because it's just part of what I am' thing down that a lot of Southern

except when we're doing something outdoors - for our seafood show, I wore a

started off making a shrimp salad, and between the ice for the shrimp and the
weather - it was a touch colder than I'd thought it would be... well, I happened
to catch a glimpse of myself in a reflector about halfway through the show and

silent for a moment; Erin reached down, finished off her glass of wine and
moved to refill it as Kyle sat down on the floor, took a bite of his sandwich

off in mid-sentence by a sudden banging on the door! &quot;I wonder who that

it going, Kyle?&quot; Hanley hissed, coming through the front door like a rhino
and throttling Kyle against it with one hand. &quot;Been a while. I've got a
kid in my ICU who's coming off like she's on a Prinean high. You still playing
chickenhawk for the Feds and that 'Fast Forward' boggle?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

as a knee shot knocked the wind out of him, and a sharp flip and toss sent him
sprawling into the living room! &quot;I'd been planning to stop by for a
visit,&quot; Kyle continued, rubbing his throat as he walked back in, &quot;but
I've been busy. Want something to drink?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

he said, tossing a cross gaze at Kyle. &quot;So - I guess you've moved over
from chickenhawk to vulture.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Erin snapped, holding out her hand as Kyle took a determined step forward.
&quot;You obviously came here to talk about some of that 'shadow crap' all of
you were in, so talk. I'm going for a walk.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

It'll give you a more realistic expectation of the business - that is, without
the good guys always winning part.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

smile to cross his face as Erin disappeared through the door. &quot;Even if she
wasn't Texas royalty, that would've kept you from putting a ring on her finger.
You would've had MORE than a chance if you'd told them you played second-string
at Annapolis - they look at ballplayers like gods down here - or let someone
know that you flew jets for a year or so. You actually put a hurting on the
Gray in an 'Army-Navy' game, and with that and the kind of respect gold wings
get, even Grandma Barksdale would -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

said that some girl was suffering from Prinean rejection,&quot; Kyle cut him
off sharply, getting back to the matter at hand. &quot;Vomiting, low body
temperature, high BP and heart rate, spiked EEG?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Spikes
like the damned Himalayas,&quot; Hanley confirmed, &quot;and shallow, rapid
respiration. Temperature down to 90.5 before I left - and grand mal seizures
that could snap an elephant's back. Heart rate was up to 178 b.p.m. - but we
brought it down with Anestazine.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

what I caught before I came over, Jodie's been the most restrained person
around since Regis during the Kathie Lee years,&quot; Hanley told him.
&quot;Today, however, she watched one girl read the riot act to another, got up
a few minutes later, chased the girl down and tried to strangle her while
showing all the emotion of someone stepping on an ant.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

making her body turn on itself. Now I need to know how much of the stuff you've

&quot;Oh, right. Your 'seminar.' I've heard about it. Which scenario are you
using on the poor kids?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;It
does, but Omega/Extended has a higher psychological deconstruction index - and
also allows for an immediate subject reintegration into the social structure if
things start to go south fast. With the kid we've got, we definitely needed
that escape hatch.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

not unstable - and no one asked you,&quot; Kyle pointed out as he finished his
root beer. &quot;She simply doesn't have the proper focus for her mindset - and
we can help her with that. If she starts to have problems, I can always 'Jenny
Lindsky' her back into the good graces of her classmates. It helps that we
almost recruited the boy she's got a crush on a few years ago - we can
manipulate them together. If I have no other choice whatsoever. If I'm ordered
to.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that's going to open up next month - she's getting married and moving to
Alaska. They're always looking for good people here, and I could put in a word

else but his recruiting quota,&quot; Kyle replied. &quot;At least I try to take
only the ones who we really could be doing a favor by recruiting, not just to
prepare kids to wear a uniform.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

you should have gotten your general's stars instead of nearly getting thrown
into the military's personal dumpster up north, Kyle,&quot; Hanley told him.
&quot;You should have played the game - and you should have done everything
possible to keep Erin in your life, so she could give you an anchor to reality.
You could use a 'Mrs. Armalin' to keep you grounded - and if you took the time
to be a couple again, she might still fit the bill.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Wait a minute here, 'Doctor Feelgood'- when have you EVER gone without? I seem
to recall that hot little redhead from William and Mary who practically lived
to please you during your internship, and the month before you went to
Savannah, there was that biker chick with the cat-eyes who used you like a salt
lick 24/7! Hell, I can't even THINK of a time when you didn't have women
waiting around every single corner waiting to jump you - even the ones who shot
at us STILL wanted to take YOU alive for 'questioning!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A smile
fought valiantly to keep from appearing on Hanley's face. &quot;Like I said -
'lately.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Don't give me smoke about 'lately' - Erin's been here a

up, Kyle. You know good and well that if you wanted to meet women, you wouldn't
have any problem, in or out of the dress blues - and with your decorations, you
could probably feel safe talking to admiral's daughters. We both know that you
haven't tried meeting women because you've still been hung up on Erin - even

his head as he walked back to his friend. &quot;One more thing. You believe in
getting information like a frat-boy believes in getting laid, so tell me
something: Why is it that the young woman you've been sent to shadow-recruit
just so happens to be the first cousin of a woman you've always had feelings
for - and YOU didn't know anything about it beforehand? I won't even mention
how both are members of a family that, for all intents and purposes, told you
to leave their women alone, get out of Texas, don't EVER come back - and has
the cash flow and the pull to make that an actual threat?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Mexican food,&quot; he said, handing a package of four sealed medicinal vials
over to Hanley. &quot;If you're right - about everything - then somebody else

subsonic 'hydra-shock' rounds, &quot;then someone's going to send a cleaner
down here after they burn my op - and they'll come looking for you after they
