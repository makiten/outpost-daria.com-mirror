hello, all my fans out there on the 'Net,&quot; Upchuck growled, his face
visible on a video screen. &quot;This is Charles Ruttheimer the Third, and for
those of you who've been so insightful to log on, we've got a special LIVE

tall, slightly overweight boy with longish, dirty-blond hair, pointed a digital
videocamera at Upchuck, and checked his wireless modem to make sure that he was
online. &quot;That's right - tonight, we're here in my hometown of Lawndale,
where we're fortunate enough to be on hand for the taping of the first 'North
of the Border' episode to be seen nationally! That's right, all you 'Border
Crossers' out there - our favorite kitchen accessory, Lauriel de la Ribas, is
moving her show off Texas cable access and into the bright lights of success in
syndication on the Food Network!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

looked across the street to where a number of cars and vans, including a couple
of microwave trucks from the local network affiliate stations, were parked in
the general area around the Morgendorffer home. A respectable crowd was
gathered outside the house, and individuals kept darting in &amp; out of the
house and through the milling throngs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

I know that all of you watching out there would just LOVE to be here tonight,
but don't worry - as the Official Number One Fan of 'NOTB', I'll be here to let
you know about EVERYTHING that happens tonight - including, I hope, a chance to
interview the lovely Lauriel IN PERSON - up close and personal, we hope.

ticket for view. &quot;Because of the interest in this event, there was a
contest held by 'Z-93FM' for the chance to be invited into the home of Jacob
Morgendorffer, the enterprising consultant whose marketing and media savvy has
brought Lauriel to the very edge of national fame and success - and who has
graciously allowed his home to serve as the site for tonight's excursion into
culinary bliss! Two lucky winners each won two tickets to attend this taping -
and the lucky winners will also have the opportunity to taste the succulent
dishes that I'm sure are in the making! Incidentally, I've also learned that
Mr. Morgendorffer is also an amateur gourmet of some renown, who has a special
affinity for savory French dishes and a real talent with seafood! Perhaps we'll
also get a chance to see Mr. Morgendorffer display his talents as well
tonight!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

automatic weapon as he advanced on Lauriel and Quinn. &quot;We're here with the
host of 'North of the Border', 'the Queen of neo-American cuisine' - the one

cutting in between Charles and the women. &quot;Right now, Ms. de la Ribas has
several important things that she has to go over before we begin in twenty
minutes. If you and your cameraman will follow me, I'll escort you inside to
the spot we have for you. Mr. Morgendorffer also wanted to speak to you about your
request for your school project - and if you'd like, we've arranged for you to
have exclusive behind-the-scenes footage for your webcast...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Charles,&quot; Jake said, shaking Upchuck's hand as the young man and Clark
walked into the Morgendorffer backyard. &quot;I'm glad you could come tonight.
I've wanted to tell you that your web site's been a really big help in
promoting the show, and Miss de la Ribas will be more than happy to cooperate
with you in any way that she can. Oh, yes - I've got some other news that I
think you'll be happy with.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the three
walked across the large yard, Upchuck and his cameraman saw how the
Morgendorffer backyard was now wired for light and sound. Large, comfortable
pieces of lawn furniture were strategically placed around the area, and two
large 'supergrills' - basically, electrically-powered portable kitchens
complete with heating pads for pots and skillets, a built-in fryer, and a huge
grilling section - were set up near the rear of the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;They've
really gone all out for Miss de la Ribas,&quot; Upchuck mused, watching as a
number of production assistants set up glasses for soft drinks and wines around
the chairs. &quot;Hey - seating chart?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;That
was drawn up long ago,&quot; Jake smiled, stopping next to a table filled with
fresh fruits and vegetables. &quot;Would either of you like a slice of mango,
or how about some cooled white grapes? Lauriel really loves her grapes...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;That's
something to put in the next update,&quot; Upchuck said, helping himself to a
handful of grapes as Clark wandered off to interview guests. &quot;What's
that?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Here's
a copy of the reworked specs for the device,&quot; Jake said, unlocking a
briefcase Horizon brought over and handing Upchuck a heavy sheaf of papers from
inside. &quot;I've made all the arrangements. The construction began on-site
five days ago - we received the clearance from the School Board on
Monday.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I saw
it this afternoon - excellent work,&quot; Upchuck said. &quot;Make sure that
the crew gets an extra five percent for a bonus, and give them a party
somewhere - stick the charges on the bill. They really went overboard on
getting EVERYTHING right - all the way down to the color of the sphere and the
duplicate control surfaces.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I'll tell them that you're happy,&quot; Jake replied.
&quot;We'll hold off on the final stage work and the installation of the power
source until you give the order - are you sure you want to wait that
long?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;It'll
add a lot more realism - especially if it doesn't work or some other problem
comes up,&quot; Upchuck told him. &quot;This is a nice upgrade on the
stabilizers... it disengages at thirty seconds, hmn? That's good... It's more true
to life, and that's important for this project. Have you spoken to the various
agencies?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;It was
a lot easier, having RADIAL resources to help out,&quot; the older man informed
him, referring to Ruttheimer Advanced Development and Integrated Adaptation
Logistics - the cybernetics research and development company Upchuck's father
had founded, &quot;and getting permission to offer promotional consideration.
I've gotten a couple of samples: NSA, U.S. Navy - you specifically requested a
DARPA tag, right?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

into his briefcase and handed Upchuck a small black wallet. &quot;Yeah, they
are that realistic,&quot; the reply came in response to Upchuck's raised
eyebrows and unspoken question. &quot;Your dad pulled SERIOUS strings to help
out with this, Charles. You should be sure to thank him.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

will,&quot; Upchuck said, handing the item back. &quot;I need one more, though.
Special Agent, FBI - the name's Jane Lane. I'll also send you the measurements
for the suit and the helmet tomorrow, after we get them.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

She's in your project? That's great!&quot; Jake said. &quot;She's such a great
kid - say, is Daria in your little project? She hasn't said much - well, she
doesn't say much to ol' Jake anyway...&quot; Jake seemed to drift off for a
moment...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

worry, Mr. Morgendorffer - she's just been a bit busy at school lately,&quot;
Upchuck assured him. He didn't need to hear about how Daria had gotten reamed
in school today... <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;You and
your dad are spending a lot of money on this, Charles,&quot; Jake asked,
closing and locking the briefcase. &quot;Mind telling me just why you're going
all-out on this? After all - it IS only a school project...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

sir, it isn't,&quot; Upchuck said, looking Jake directly in the eye in a manner
that made Jake straighten up just a touch, as though he were speaking with an
actual client - which, he realized with a start, he was... &quot;For the past
three years, everyone at that school has looked down at me. They've ridiculed
me, made fun of me - they call me 'Upchuck'. Forget that I'm in the number two
spot in the race for valedictorian next year - and I didn't get that with my
dad's money, either. He wanted me to go to a regular high school so 'I'd learn
how to deal with regular people and make a name without his name backing me
up.' Fine. I'll do that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upchuck took
a breath. &quot;That doesn't mean that I have to be abused day in and day out
by jocks, burnouts, and girls who act like they can't walk down the same
hallway I've walked through because I'm not good enough - forget that those
same women'll be clawing over each other to talk to me six years from now, when
we're all out of college and they're looking for that meal ticket with deep
pockets. I got into this class on my own, I'm going to kick ass on this project
- and when it's over, there's not going to be a single person in that school
who's going to be able to turn their nose up at me when I go by. But you know
what, sir? I'm not going to give a damn if they do, because when it's all said
and done - I did this. I'm the one who came up with the idea and brought it all
together. Just once, and right in their faces - 'Upchuck' did it right.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

understand that,&quot; Jake said, the words far too familiar to him as he
extended his hand to the young man. &quot;Mr. Ruttheimer - we'll get it done.
That's a promise.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

huge, doelike eyes. &quot;I'll go and get set up...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the yard and saw several of the guests beginning to enter &amp; find their
seats. &quot;This is one of those moments I've wanted all my life.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

You've been there to listen to me whine and complain, and I -&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

&quot;T want to thank you for just that, Jacob,&quot; she said. &quot;You've

complexion slightly flushed. &quot;I want you to be happy, Lauriel. I'm glad
that your professional life is coming together, and now, I want you to be happy
as a person. I want you to have what I have - a relationship that really means
something, with someone who's worth all the trouble that he's going to bring

national for about a year, so they'd be sure your ratings were good enough to
keep you on the air a while,&quot; Jake agreed. &quot;With 'Maxim' - I'm

carefully. &quot;Someday, when I'm old and wrinkled, I'm going to bring this
out to shut the mouths of my smart-aleck granddaughters who think that they
have to tell me about what it's like to be young and attractive. 'You think
you're so pretty - well, I suppose you have one of THESE, too! No? Well, then
you need to take off all of that makeup and those clothes - it's NOT going to

like to spend some time helping out at your office - especially if you're

time all day, Jane was not only calm, but also happy. Listening to Ted and the
plan that Upchuck had put together - oh, yeah, she was getting HER 'A' in this
course. The plan was just so damned crazy that it WOULD work - and the real
kicker was that she was the key... Upchuck was a lot of things, but
forward-thinking? Able to see a use for a girl that didn't involve Jello and
being off one's feet? Able to actually convince Barth not to kill him long
enough to listen to his plan - and then get her involved as an active,
enthusiastic participant? And HE was the one who specifically said that she,
'plain-Jane' Lane, was the best choice for the chair? If this worked out even
halfway as well as Ted said it would, Jane promised herself, the word 'Upchuck'
would be heading back to 'verb' status in her dictionary on a <u>permanent</u>
basis...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And Ted -
puppy-dog Ted, he had come out running to look for her. Now, that was funny... or
maybe not. Daria had said that he had a lot more going on than met the eye, and
that necklace that he had made for her - Jane admitted that it was an excellent
piece of work, something that could easily get a few hundred bucks if it went
up for sale, and far better than most of her mother's works. Truth be told,
that is. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

went back to the tangle she and Ted were in earlier, and she caught herself
sighing at the memory of the young man lying beneath her. He was a bit of the
immature kid - no, that wasn't fair. Home schooling had deprived Ted
Dewitt-Clinton of several years of developing social skills - not that he
didn't have any, but he simply didn't understand yet that you just didn't wear
your heart and your innocence out for everyone to see... and to stomp or spit on.
No, there went Ted, just rolling headlong into everything in sight, bouncing
right up to the mouth of the dragon like the little French baby mouse in the
'Tom &amp; Jerry' cartoons: <i>'Hello, Monsieur Pussycat?' </i>He didn't really
think that there would be people who'd like to smash him right in the face just
for being himself - although I don't want to be around to see that ballroom
blitz, Jane shuddered, remembering how easily Ted had tossed Kevin around once
before in a friendly demonstration of tae-kwon-do. He was just so innocent, so
friendly, and so damned cuddly -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

found herself breathing hard and flushed at the thought of the bright-eyed,
blond-haired teenager - and she immediately put him out of her mind. <i>No, I
am not going to start acting like some bimbo with a crush on him - jeez, he had
some build on him under those Garanimals he was wearing, and okay, I could
probably have grabbed something else, but excellent development in the gluteus

fences first. This time, if she wants to be friends - SHE has to make the first

Styrofoam cooler that sat on the table in front of him. &quot;I just want to

handfuls of rock dust into their eyes! Moving swiftly, she did a couple of

this out,&quot; Daria calmly remarked, brutally ramming a pair of pens deep
into the juncture between the smart-mouthed rider's legs, twisting them in with
all of her strength as a high-pitched scream exploded from the man's lips! He
fell as Daria spun about - and a banshee's wail washed over her as she thrust a
second pair deep into the abdomen of the third rider, who cleared his eyes and
tried to attack from behind! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

rider grabbed at the pens - and bellows of pain shot from his mouth as Daria
kicked him in the groin as hard as she could, again and again, even after he
fell to the ground! A savage duo of kicks to the head rendered him silent - and
soon after, his soon-to-be-sexless friend received a vicious two-shot to the
noggin as well... after Daria visibly tired herself out kicking and stomping him
and the others into a museum-quality collector's edition of all-over bruises.
She looked down to see blood on her boots: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

minutes later, Daria was over $1,700 dollars richer and the proud possessor of
a collection of gaudy - albeit pricey -jewelry, and a seriously high-tech
lighter - the coherent-light type that could light a fire in a hurricane. They
also carried some surprisingly high-quality knives, including a springlock-release
blade that the user wore on his forearm and flicked out with a specific motion,
and Mr. Johnny Wadd-less was packing a bigger-than-life, holy mother of God!
Colt Anaconda .357 magnum revolver with a six-inch barrel and Teflon-coated,
'cop-killer' rounds. It was one HELL of a good gun - <i>thanks a lot for the
firepower, you prick! </i>She also now had a VERY nice leather jacket - just
slightly large for her, but it was very comfortable, and with the belts and
straps on it, she could make it a better fit. It was amazing, how the
springlock was all but invisible under the sleeve of the jacket - and felt so
comfortable on her arm...<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

dialing 911.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Lauriel said, moving behind the counter. &quot;We'll also serve that up with a seven-layer

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This was one
of the things Jake really loved about his job. Granted, he wasn't a television
producer (but maybe someday; it really did have some interesting moments), but
he loved the energy that came off the people as they made seemingly
split-second decisions as the events on screen unfolded. He marveled that
everything that went on was according to a schedule that he helped put
together, and that if they decided that the show was going to be fifty-eight
minutes and forty-five seconds long - well, when that show went out over the
airwaves, by God, it was fifty-eight minutes and forty-five seconds long.
Exactly. Not a second more or less. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was a
little like a drug, he thought - being competent and effective. To be that
accurate, and to make sure that everyone around you was like that, too - the
things that you could get done when everyone was in sync with the common goal...
you could get anything done, Jake realized. You certainly could get something
as simple as getting a cooking show made: that wasn't to say that 'NOTB' was
simple - there were a number of complex elements to be dealt with, and food was
food, which meant that a production or technical delay could result in a ruined
dish, which meant that you had to shoot that over... You could actually achieve
something!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I like doing
this! Jake said to himself, leaning back and to the side, past Wendy's forest
of hair to see the preview monitors... and truth to be told, to get a better
glimpse of her silhouette. Born and raised on a farm in the north of the
British Isles, Wendy was nearly always uncomfortable with the climate in this
part of the U.S. - especially in the spring and (thrice-damned) summer. Because
of this, the straightforward little redhead practically lived in T-shirts and
light slacks or jeans - and almost never wore bras, serving everyone around
with a perfect view of her pert, firm little breasts. Sometimes, Jake wondered,
if she went without because she didn't like wearing bras, or she had a little
exhibitionist in her, or if she simply wanted to make at least SOME of the
people around her just as uncomfortable as she was being here - <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sorenson, an imposing woman in her late forties with a ironclad reputation as a
nurse-practitioner, looked up from a chart as Hanley walked into the C/ICU
isolation room Jodie was in. &quot;No new seizures, Dr. Phillips. Her BP is
still depressed further than I'd care to see, and her temperature has risen up
to 95. Heart rate is now 66 BPM. No unusual EEG activity.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

poker face but inside, he sagged like an ill-fitting dress. 'Sarah the Swede',
as they referred to her because of her height (at six-five, towering over
almost everyone she met) and her 'ABBA features' (a fair, almost pale
complexion, platinum hair and ice water-blue eyes), had unbeatable instincts
for the C/ICU unit - and a reputation for seeing through even the slightest
deceptions. Most doctors hated having to work with her, enjoying the ego boost
that came with being 'godlike saviors of life and limb' and detesting the
manner in which she forced them to 'keep it real', but not Hanley. He wanted to
know if he was about to make a mistake, regardless of from stupidity or
ignorance...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

him a tray with the requested items, and her eyes narrowed as she saw the label

couldn't keep the stunned expression off his face. &quot;England, Doctor
Phillips. I worked with the World Health Organization for eighteen months, and
I did some... liaison work in Hereford. You'll need to increase the patient's
fluid intake over the next thirty-six hours to improve the saturation rate.
She'll also need sodium, iron and vitamin supplements for the next two weeks,
and we should start her on IV steroids for the same period. I assume you
brought enough for three more treatments over the next six days.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the fluid into Jodie's IV drip, and watched the pale-blue substance intermingle
with the D5W solution. &quot;They must certainly like you, though,&quot; Sarah
continued. &quot;This stuff is easily worth six figures on the black market...

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Hanley shook his head slowly. There were two things that he
really detested about his time in... government service. One was how incestuous
the intelligence community was - how everyone knew everyone and everyone else's
business, lifestyles, dating spots, favorite TV shows... <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>The second was how, no matter how far out of your way you went
to leave 'The Community' - as insiders referred to the various worldwide
intelligence services in general - you never really left. Sure enough, you'd
always run into other members of The Community or people who knew someone ... no
matter where you went, or how hard you tried to stay out of sight and mind... <o:p></o:p></span></p>

U.S. Special Studies Center in Savannah, Georgia, where Hanley spent the ten
months of his primary training for the Para/Military-Oriented Global Operations
(POGO) units, somebody had put up a sign as a joke in one of the main
classrooms. However, the truth of the saying had become evident, and now the
sign had been framed: <i>'Spies are like roaches. For every one you see and
step on - there are ten more running around somewhere out of sight.'<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

scribbled a couple of notes on Jodie's chart. &quot;She's going to be with us
for some time, Miss Sorenson. Her injuries are going to require us to pay
particularly close attention to her - you understand, don't you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Yes,
Doctor. I assume we're going to find high levels of GHB in her system when her
bloodwork comes back from the lab?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hanley looked
at Sarah. &quot;No - an unidentified substance that seems to be related to PCP.
That will explain the psychotic episode and the momentary physical
enhancements. It seems like someone's cooking up a new designer drug, and
slipped it to our patient - problem is, it doesn't seem to have any component
that provides a physical or psychological high.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

someone didn't study their chemistry texts as well as they should have. That
should work,&quot; she replied. &quot;It'll also give that witch Angela Li an
excuse to bust heads over at Lawndale High - not that she's ever needed
one.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

you'll be all right, and with the right wardrobe and makeup, nobody will even
notice the bruises on your neck!&quot; Stacy simpered, holding up an
almond-colored faux-turtleneck shirt. &quot;You can wear this along with some
matching cords - it matches your hair, and it'll help hide the bruises, and
it'll make your boobs stand out! Nobody'll be looking at your neck then!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

Tiffany echoed, the time dilation between her brain and her mouth even more
pronounced than usual as she toweled her hair off - once again. She has
showered and shampooed her hair five times that night to get the smell of vomit
out of her hair... &quot;Boobs. Boys. They won't notice.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I see
that Quinn has more important things to do than come to the aid of a fellow
Fashion Club member,&quot; Sandi said. &quot;I think that being at a stupid TV
show is so far less important than supporting one of our own in her time of
need... I mean, that Ribas woman is so - so masculine, what with her trying to be
a chef, and driving around in a Pimpmobile, and someone should tell her that
her hair is so 'Charlie's Angels' Farrah Faucett - why doesn't she just go
ahead and go -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sandi stopped
in mid-rant as she caught her own reflection. She looked deep into her own eyes
- and then, down to the marks around her neck. She heard the emptiness of her
own words echo in her mind as she saw the memory of the same emptiness in
Jodie's eyes; a less-than-casual notice of what was happening around her and of
what she was doing, as though it was nothing to just choke the life out of a
human being in the middle of the street in broad daylight - or the person who
it was happening to was nothing, and then it was all right to just kill them,
to remove them as though they were a swatted fly swabbed off the table with a
paper towel -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Stacy's
stock-issue sycophantic tongue-waving and Tiffany's generation-long attempts to
pronounce three-syllable words within the same sentence fell away without
notice from Sandi's interpretation of the world as she knew it. She had almost
died today. That's something that should matter... shouldn't it? Shouldn't it?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And for what?
What if she hadn't lived? Would it have mattered? Oh, sure - the girls in the
Fashion Club would have said nice things about her... for about fifteen seconds.
But what after that? Who would miss her? Why would they miss her? Maybe her
little brothers would miss her. Maybe. Maybe her parents would miss her - no, they
aren't concerned about anything I do now, but they would bitch about the cost
of the funeral. That's why they have those $100,000 insurance policies on each
of us. That way, if someone goes Jonesboro or Littleton on me or one of the
rats, they can pay for all of the expenses, take a two-week cruise (so the
healing can begin) and have something left over to put in the bank... To them,
I'm worth more dead than alive!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Who else
would care? The teachers? Barch? O'Neill? Yeah, he'd care - he'd care right
into a major stroke and some time in convalescence, with a heady helping of
psychological therapy. Ms. Li? Only because her death would bring shame, and
disgrace, and dishonor to the proud name of 'Laaaaaawwwwwwnnnndale High.'
Please, lady, go get laid, already.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Really, though; after the required faux-grieving before their
classes and the cliched tour of 'counselors' to the school for a week or so to
'help the Healing Process begin' - none of them would lose much sleep if she
were gone. Except for Mr. DeMartino. He acted like he didn't even care anymore
- and that began after she wrote that report on how events in post-World War I
Europe had led to the rise of the Nazi Party. He paid some attention to her
every now and then before that, usually comments along the lines of 'why don't
you at least TRY to be a good student?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>And then, one day, Sandi heard him talking to Stacy about
writing a comparison-&amp;-contrast paper about the parallels between the Nazis
and the Fashion Club, and was so angry that she blew off a weekend trip of
shopping in Dallas to write a report of her own. Oh, yes, she thought, actually
going through her schoolbooks and actually reading them, I'll show you! I'll
even make it sound smart by doing what Mark Twain said not to do - I'll go
ahead and use 'metropolis' instead of 'city' because they want you to use the
five-dollar words on papers like this!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>In her report, she spoke on how the German people had elected
Hitler chancellor because of the promises he made to restore glory and honor to
a Germany decimated because of the Treaty of Versailles. She argued the fact
that the Fashion Club acted in the same way - to give students something to be
proud of outside of the traditional school activities and despite the current
administration, which had sold the average student out to a plethora of outside
interests. Unlike the National Socialist, or 'Nazi' political faction, Sandi
pointed out - the F.C. was a force for good. Unlike the Nazis, they also acted
to abolish the stereotypical labels given to students who participate in, who
are pressured into, or who suffer repercussions because of the mindset inherent
within each of those activities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>My God, she said, sitting at her computer as she wrote,
thesaurus firmly entrenched in her lap, this actually sounds like something
that Jodie or that Daria bitch would write!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>And she continued on...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Anyone and everyone who truly wished to better themselves was
welcome in the Fashion Club, and no one faction within LHS society was singled
out to serve as the focal point for the F.C. to use as a scapegoat for the
purpose of gathering or maintaining power. The Fashion Club, she argued, was a
proactive faction that recognized the inherent flaw within the social strata of
the high school - that appearance was the initial, and sometimes determining,
factor as to how a young person would be accepted within teen society. It
recognized this, and acted to help young people by ensuring that a teen could
have the time needed to be accepted on his or her own merits by assuring that
they fit on a base level within that society. Once that person was seen to have
some common factors as others, then they could also display those traits about
themselves that would prove them to be a benefit to the group as a whole.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Two examples she gave in her report were of her friend
Tiffany, who would have been shunned by most of Lawndale High society were she
not in the Club, and Jodie Landon, who would be perfect for the Club (but not
now!) That way, people would just let her be JODIE, not the stereotype 'perfect
African-American student and role model' that she felt she had to be. In the
Club, Jodie would be able to relax, to have fun and enjoy high school, to date
someone she really liked and not someone she felt she felt obligated to be
with. Jodie felt that she had to stay in her current position and activities in
order to be a role model for other Blacks, Sandi argued, but didn't realize
that she could provide a better role model for Black students by being one for
ALL students - as a member of the Fashion Club.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Even now, she treasured the memory: the look on DeMartino's
face when she walked into the room, tossed the report at his feet and snarled,
&quot;So we're Nazis in the Fashion Club, right?&quot; She then turned to that
snotty, smarter-than-a-computer-and-just-as-attractive Daria, fastened her eyes
to those shit-colored beads hidden behind those 'Never gonna get kissed'
glasses and said, in a voice that could take a house off its foundation:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Ever wonder why...? Ever bother asking?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>It was the first A she had ever received on a project in high
school.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>From that day forward, Mr. DeMartino never pressured her on
her work. On occasion, she would see him watching her out of the corner of her
eye. He would just look at her with an expression of sadness, as though he had
failed at something really big, and that it really made him hurt inside... <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Now, if it were Jodie, I'd bet that he'd care about her dying
off - and it wouldn't be because she's the Great Yellow-and-Blue Hope! Oh,
Jodie's going to be worth something, Jodie's going to hold a high position in
life. Me? The only thing that they see me doing in ten years from now is some
rich, older man!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

brunette, but you'll never get any sleep with a redhead around. (2.) What's the

that Daria bitch back in her place? Really, though, Sandi thought, does she
need to be put back in her place? Is it my place to do it? Why are you even
thinking about her, anyway - don't you have someone more important to worry

get this straight: you've already progressed to the midway point in your
testing and recruitment program. You've got a probable candidate for
recruitment - one that scores within our chosen DFI range. You then change your
program protocols to maximize the potentials of the candidate and lower her
resistance quotient. You inform us of these changes and begin - without
consulting us - the process of moving the candidate to our regional staging
area so she can begin the process... and you recommended that, once there, she be
evaluated for possible POGO capability. You've sent us several reports,
including today's update, which shows that she's within days of a possible
shifting.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to,&quot; Kyle observed. &quot;Diplomatic immunity - it is a bitch'. Back to
the point. Since the nature of the recruitment program means that we're in a
number of schools at any one time, you could have brought someone else in to
run the Lawndale seminar during this cycle. You could have brought Whitney out
of SIU-Carbondale, or Marshall out of that Arizona backwater - don't tell me

- and it isn't your concern. Furthermore - the matter of your failed
relationships has nothing at all to do with the nature of your duties
there,&quot; Robert patronized. &quot;You were sent to complete an assignment,
not to alternate swapping insults and spit with her cousin. You're a Marine,
damnit, and I expect you to act like one! Execute your mission, Major. Recruit

with over-promoted, piece-of-shit REMF's like this ground-pounding Army asswipe
Bakeson, he learned long ago, just remember your early days as a butterbar - a
newly commissioned second lieutenant. Just do a lot of saluting, have a
parade-ready uniform... and practice up on the 'Yes, sir! - No, sir!' routine.
Oh, yeah - buy an extra tube of Chapstick, if you really want to get on his

After you get Morgendorffer, screw her cousin as much as you want - I don't
care,&quot; Robert said, tossing a dismissive wave towards the screen.
&quot;She's a hot little number, isn't she? Oh, yes - one other thing. Someone
down there's been checking up on you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

have a name?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Some
kid named Ruttheimer - his pappy's the head of some computer company,&quot;
Robert informed him, and he scowled as Kyle's face seemed to relax. &quot;He's
been getting information on your seminars and your background - looks like he's
trying to find out about you and your earlier classes. He's also had a lot of
contact with the UPN Network and the producers of some show they broadcast...
does this make sense to you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Yeah,&quot;
Kyle said. &quot;Nothing serious - just a rich kid trying to figure out how to
get a better grade. Don't pay any attention to him; he's harmless.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

paying to do a lot of digging...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;All
right then,&quot; Robert said, somewhat mollified by Kyle's comment. &quot;As
for the rest, I don't see a reason to change step or drag your ass on this job.
Your orders stand, Major Armalin. You will complete your assignment as
directed.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The screen went
dark, already forgotten by Robert as Franklin Davers sat his teacup and saucer
down and rose from his seat away from the wall-mounted videocamera.
&quot;Having problems with Armalin, I see...&quot; he opinioned, brushing off the
sleeve of his uniform - where the hard-won 'Ranger' and 'Special Forces' tabs
were sewn on. &quot;Again.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The tall,
well-built man with warm, 'movie-star' good looks and a smile designed to make
women's undergarments fly off on their own regard went to a well-stocked bar
and selected a bottle after examining it for a moment. &quot;He's a good man,
but it's always off-the-cuff improv with him; 'It'll work better if we do it
this way!&quot; A brief silence. &quot;We get specific orders for a
reason.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;He
keeps forgetting that he needs to follow those orders and do whatever the hell
he's told,&quot; Robert scowled, watching as Franklin poured a generous portion
of bourbon into an Old Fashioned glass and set it on the desk before the
general. &quot;Thank you, Franklin. You know how things are supposed to go,
while 'Chicken George' needs to be reminded that if I wanted him to have an
opinion, I'd have given him one.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Robert downed
the bourbon in one gulp, set the glass down and pushed it forward. &quot;And it
wouldn't have been to go catting around with a married woman - let alone a
white one - while he's supposed to be getting the job done. Another one.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Franklin's
face didn't change, but he felt distaste at the blatantly racist comments and
patronizing, paternalistic attitude of his commanding officer as he refilled
his glass. Sure, Kyle needed to concentrate on his assignment, but he had also
read the reports from LHS - the program was going better on his posting than
anywhere else. Kyle's recruits also tended to be far more focused than most,
and as for signing on once they found out exactly what they were in for -
nobody had the 96% rating that he maintained. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Only three of his recruits had left the program. One was for
medical reasons - she had lost the use of her legs to a mortar shell on her
first POGO field mission to monitor the Tamil insurgency in Sri Lanka and the
response to the troubles by India. The second was a young man with
cyber-skills, who left to take a computer-industry position that paid in the
mid-six figures. That one needed the money for his large and nearly destitute
family, which included three elderly relatives with barely any means of support
and serious medical needs, and Kyle, in a move that annoyed Robert (but didn't
surprise Franklin), supported both in every way possible. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>For the girl - Jennifer Hannon, he recalled - that included
securing a serious financial outlay and full medical coverage, including
complete rehabilitative and psychological therapy, as well as ensuring that
she'd have very little trouble with her peers after returning to her palatial
family home in New England. Of course, pushing for that Air Medal and a captain's
commission for the young Air Force Academy cadet also helped her family and
friends see her as the hero she really was... <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Even though she had completed her POGO training, Cadet Hannon
didn't have to go with POGO Group Ten. She was still a full two months from
graduation from the Academy, but her paranormally enhanced mental enhancements
and memory, and the psychic ability to project IMAX-class holographs of
anything she'd encountered were vital to the mission. Cadet Hannon had 'total
recall' of EVERYTHING in her life, including her birth, and having absolutely
perfect intel was a necessity. She was given full disclosure about the
situation - and volunteered anyway...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Seriously wounded in the pullout after POGO Group Ten's recon
blind was discovered by 'Tamil Tigers', Hannon still managed to give a
salivating group of G2 analysts more info on the situation in Sri Lanka than
they had received in the past five years - and from her bed in the U.S.S.
Ranger's infirmary before surgery. Kyle always did manage to instill serious
loyalty to duty in his pups, Franklin remembered...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>To help the boy - Jason Jackson - Kyle suited up, and deployed
POGO Group Four into the boy's run-down Boston neighborhood to wipe out a local
gang that was seriously harassing his family. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Robert nearly went seven shades of crazy over that stunt, but
calmed down after seeing the tac-cam footage of the op: deniable as hell, with
enough 'Sturm ung Drang' to ensure that nobody - NOBODY! - would ever screw
around in that neighborhood again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Killing over a hundred young, heavily armed men in their own
lair in less than ten minutes and leaving their bodies on display has that
effect on those who enjoy the beauty of being alive, especially other
gangbangers... The crime rates in that area dropped so far down afterward that,
for the next couple of years, not one single senior citizen in that
neighborhood was accosted in any way whatsoever.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>The police and the media never really noticed that something
major had happened in town that night. Funny thing, that a lot of promotions
and raises came through over the next month in the Boston PD, not to mention
that HUGE law-enforcement grant of funding and equipment that the department
received seven weeks later. It was also interesting, too, how each of the six-
and ten-o'clock anchors at the three local affiliates had departed for network
anchor and producer duties within that same month, with several major
promotions in the ranks at the stations. Everyone also noticed how a local
crime-beat reporter, a Latino kid named Juan Esteves who had real skills but
just hadn't grabbed that story to put him over the top, received an offer from
the L.A. Times that sent him soaring towards the West Coast in a hurry...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>The kicker - the thing that even made him have trouble swallowing,
Franklin remembered, was how Kyle had the gangbangers' bodies placed in sitting
positions all along the walls of their hangout. Their severed heads were placed
in the small of their left elbows, held like football helmets, with sunglasses
on some and only one eye closed on the others, as if they were winking - and
their right hands gripping their groins. The old POGO Four/One sported a
longtime track record as one truly twisted fucker who habitually dug beneath
the barrel of ideas clearly marked 'extremely whacked-out and sick shit' when
provoked or annoyed. He was also a really fast hand with a blade, especially
with a machete or a short sword - and he always had a really, really bad habit
of underestimating the effects of his 'extremely overt' actions... Even now,
there were some 'by-the-book' types who refused to go on missions with 'Major
Body Count', as they referred to him after the demotion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Maybe they should have thought longer and harder about
bringing Kyle into the program, or just scratched him and brought someone else
in - God knows there's enough gung-ho Marine pilots out there who could screen
for POGO skills...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>It didn't matter, Kyle rationalized as he went before a review
board - those kids still consider themselves DELPHI... and hadn't they gotten
some interesting info on New England's bluebloods and company from Hannon, not
to mention continuous updates on Bill Gates' latest 'electric wet dreams' from
Jackson? 'Forewarned Is Forearmed' - and that's what they're still doing,
right?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Franklin sighed inwardly as he remembered how Kyle arranged to
keep them on the rosters as inactive reservists, but with active pay - and
managed to make it stick. He eventually lost two grades in rank, but Kyle never
complained or even looked back. That was Kyle's weakness - he was always
watching over and checking up on 'his' recruits, even bailing them out if they
got into the slightest trouble. <i>'Chicken George?' </i>He wasn't a
chickenhawk, Franklin thought - he was a damned mother hen! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>I wonder... is that what's going on down there in Texas? Damnit,
Kyle, haven't you lost enough? Idiot!<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Franklin shook his head as he thought of Trent Lane - the
third recruit that Kyle failed to retain. The powers-that-be were <u>still</u>
smoking over that loss - his innate skills for higher mathematics had
manifested themselves only as a marginal talent for music, but his DFI test
battery showed that the sky had been the limit for that kid. Fractal encryption
operations, communications intercepts, next-generation cryptography and code-breaking,
cyber-espionage, ANYTHING with computers or in the analysis section<i>, </i>ANYTHING
involving numbers - and he had also tested positive for POGO capability. Kyle
hadn't known about that (until later), but the Lane kid definitely showed signs
of being an empath - only the third one recruited for the POGO Program in the
past fifteen years! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>True to his word, however, Kyle let him walk away when he said
that he didn't want in - in any way at all. He didn't even want Kyle to get him
a spot at the School for the Performing Arts in New York, rebuffed an offer of
a tryout at any of the major musical conservatories or schools after he
graduated, and wouldn't let Kyle even send talent scouts from any of the major
record labels - in case someone would someday want him to do them a favor.
Trent wanted totally free and clear of the 'James Bond and 'In Like Flint' trip
- no strings to pull me back in on, dude...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Dummy - that's how you got busted back down to Major, just as
you were about to screen for flag rank and take the program oversight chair
away from this country-fried jackass! Damn you, Kyle - think about yourself on
occasion, because even now - I could all but hear you thinking that Bakeson's
nothing but a rear-echelon mother-fucker who's got nothing for any of the kids
in the program... but you don't have anything to say there, do you? You screwed
it all up by letting that slacker kid walk and making threats to go public if
we didn't let him go... Bringing in Lane - hell, they'd have had your star
waiting for you at the damned door for him!<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>But you won't, will you? No, you're just like the Professor -
'It's all about the kids.' The old man got through your thick head and you
finally found something to believe in - and you put your own career on the
shelf doing it. You'd have married Erin five or six years ago if you'd had your
priorities straight, and who knows how far you'd have gone up the ladder? One
thing's for sure; we'd probably still be friends...<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>If that's what he's doing, then it's a sure bet he's not going
to deliver this Morgendorffer kid, either. Fine. I'm not saying a word to
Bakeson as warning - but if he gives me the order, I will bring the kid in.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

choose not to mention that Aki Ward was a fourth-generation graduate out of the

failed to mention that her grandfather won a Medal of Honor at Omaha Beach for

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That was one
of the worst things Helen could have said; Sha'Nequa whipped the door of the
SUV open hard enough to damage it and walked into full view of Helen, her hand

always had a problem with smart-ass lawyer bitches like you - parading around
with your tits and your diplomas up in the air, acting like you fart potpourri
and orange blossoms while the rest of us have real work to do getting punks and
other crap off the street - but you always fuck that up for us, too,&quot; the
female cop smirked. &quot;Well, you can parade your sweet ass all around our

digital videocamera pointed directly at them! &quot;And don't bother trying to
take the camera so you can get the tape, Officer Remy - we're quite live right
now, and with all of the 'Border Crossers' who are still logged on, I'd say
there's a lot of people who just saw all of your little performance...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

her confidence rising (and fangs showing) as she silently thanked God for the
instant 'Get out of jail - free' card. &quot;I WILL be coming down to the

evidence of my accusations. Have a pleasant evening, Miss Remy. After tomorrow

you have done tonight will NOT be forgotten,&quot; she said, stroking the boy's
cheek and causing a slight blush to rise. &quot;I am definitely in your
debt.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to her doorway - then turned back to face the camera. &quot;Let's wrap this up,
fellow 'Border Crossers'! Tonight, not only did we get to taste the dishes of
the gods tonight... not only did we get an exclusive interview with the lovely
Miss de la Ribas - but we were given an opportunity to rescue a damsel in
distress, and strike a blow for Truth, Justice, and the American Way! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;This, I
decided on,&quot; Jake said, popping the cork on another bottle as Lester Gupty
held up a tray of glasses. &quot;Lester, you don't have to play server!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

least I could do,&quot; the WASP-ish gentleman said, a smile covering his face
as Jake filled the glasses. &quot;Because of the lady's show, my own show's
viewer base has more than doubled! She's a true God-send; My wife and I have
been able to help more couples because more people have started watching us

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Lester,
I appreciate you as a client and as a person, but I don't -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;That's
not what I meant, Jake,&quot; Lester said, guiding him away from the others.
&quot;I know that you've had problems with Helen; problems that have been
around for a lot longer than your association with Miss de la Ribas. Sooner or
later, those problems are going to come to a head - and from what I've seen of
your marriage, your children are the only reason you two haven't had 'the big
one' yet.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I don't
understand -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;THE
argument. The one where everything is going to come out on the table,&quot;
Lester continued. &quot;All of the accusations, the hurt feelings and the
anger, the comments meant to wound - you're both probably waiting for the kids
to go off to school before you let the war begin. And when it comes - not if,
but when - and you go your separate ways... don't go to her, Jake. Don't go to
Lauriel.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lester saw
the confused look in Jake's eyes. &quot;Everyone that sees the two of you
together knows that you'd be good for one another. You have the same interests,
the same sensibilities, and the same outlook on life... in a real sense of the
word; you're soul mates. I think that's one reason why the two of you
haven't...&quot; He paused, glancing away from the guilty look on Jake's face.
&quot;You don't have to be embarrassed. I can tell that you two haven't done
anything to feel guilty about. You haven't broken any vows, and as much as she
would want for the two of you to be together, she wouldn't have let you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He looked
across the yard to where Lauriel was talking with a production grip as they
nibbled on berries from the counter baskets, and she looked over and gave Jake
a smile that made his own face come alive. &quot;No matter how much she wanted
to. Don't go to her when your marriage ends. You have to distance yourself from
her, Jake; she can't be your rebound relationship. Keep her at arms' length,
even if it means severing your professional connections and not seeing her for
some time. You are going to need time to heal from what's coming, Jake, and she
can't be a part of that. You're going to be angry, and bitter, and hurt, and you
may end up doing stupid, petty things to hurt your wife back. Don't use her as
a part of that - don't use her as a weapon or a trophy to hurt Helen. It'll
poison any chance you have of building a real relationship without any baggage
from before.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Jake directly in the eye. &quot;Promise me that you'll think about what I've
said, Jake. Walk away from Lauriel. If there's even a chance that you could
love her... please, walk away for now. It's the only way that you'll ever have a
chance to be together someday.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I'll
think about it,&quot; Jake said, distinctly uncomfortable by the direct
conversation and relieved when Eric walked over to them. &quot;Hey, Eric! You
were nice enough to stop by. We really appreciate the support!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Thank
you, Jake,&quot; Eric said, taking a filled glass from Lester's tray before the
smaller man excused himself and began serving the chilled champagne. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Being around Lauriel for a couple of hours had calmed Eric
down - long enough for him to actually talk to her, to realize that she had a
brain... and that he needed to act like a grown-up around her. The furtive
glances that he had gotten from the little red-haired Brit - Wendy, wasn't it?
- also calmed him down a bit. She was very attractive, and she didn't take any
guff from the other members of the crew - she seems to be in charge... <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

where Helen was? Boy, considering how much this seems to mean to Jake, I bet
that they're going to go like cats and dogs when she finally gets here!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

welcome, Eric,&quot; Jake replied, taking a glass of the sparkling liquid for
himself and passing another to Lauriel. &quot;And I know you can use
this...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;He's a
nice kid, but he's just so annoying with the constant leer!&quot; she replied,
shaking her hair out as she took the glass - and both Lester and Wendy noticed
the way Lauriel's fingers lingered near Jake's for just a second longer than
necessary. &quot;That interview with him was tougher than the ones with the
local reporters, though. He does know how to ask good questions - and he kept
the 'you're pretty' angle down to a minimum.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Upchuck
didn't drool all over you?&quot; asked Quinn, more than a bit surprised - and
she turned as Jake tapped her on the shoulder. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

business, and there's personal, Quinn,&quot; he said softly. &quot;Being an
adult and in business means you try and keep them separate. If he's never done
anything to you - he's Charles.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

offered her a glass. &quot;Dad -?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

around the backyard - now empty except for the production crew and the usual
suspects - and walked over to Jake. &quot;Everyone's got a glass, 'M'. Hurry up
and make your speech so we can get toasted.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

case - I'll make it very short,&quot; he said, raising his glass. &quot;To the
reason we're all here. To Lauriel de la Ribas - the only woman I've ever met
who I can honestly say - and without getting any resentment or anger whatsoever
from her in the process, guys! - that her place is in the kitchen. May you have
a long, successful and rewarding career - and may you find a special person to
share that happiness and those rewards... just not in divorce court.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

first, I'd like to thank all of you for all of the help that you've given me -
from working with me for months or years, to those of you who I've just met
recently. I really couldn't have done this without you. Thank you, Wendy - for
managing to keep this group of wonderful people productive and motivated each
and every week, and for reminding me why I sold my 'Victoria's Secret' stock
after I got here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

even blush or try to cover her chest, but a small smile graced her face as more
than a few eyes glanced towards her. &quot;But most of all, I want to thank
you, Jacob. I want to thank you for helping me take my show from a little
cable-access experiment to something that's allowed me to meet people on a
national level, and for putting up with a lot of my excess baggage.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

turned in Jake's direction as Lauriel continued. &quot;I also want to thank you
for putting up with all of the rumors about us, and not running away from this
program or not acting like a barbarian and punching in somebody's face. You are
a true professional, and worthy of every bit of respect I have for you. You're
a good man, Jacob, and I hope you receive every bit of success that I know this
is only the beginning of. For everything that's come of our association... thank
you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

arms crossed as she stepped from her spot at the back door and stood next to one
of the grills. &quot;Why don't you go out and dye your hair blonde, spray-paint

earlier that morning, when she got up and found Trent still awake - still drunk
like a glass of water as he stared at the same wall from last night. The other
Boys of Spiral were with him, trying to cheer him up...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I never knew
that her opinion meant that much to him - that she did, Jane reflected, walking
along down the street. I think that he's actually been paying attention to her
- I think that he may even have some feelings for her - does he love her? Oh,
man!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></i>I wonder where she is? Jane didn't get to
see Daria the night before: the near-hysterical, screaming rant that Helen
unleashed in the Morgendorffer's living room (and which could be heard halfway
down the block) made her forego knocking on the door in place of peeking
through the large front window. She watched as Helen paced and threw objects
and screamed; in a move that made Jane give him a few points upward on the
'Respect-O-Meter', Jake stood up from where he had been silently sitting and
went to Helen, cupping her face in his hands and trying to soothe her<i>.
You've got 'em big as wrecking balls, Mister M - reminding the Hydra that you
love her while she's ranting and preparing to castrate everything within the
Louisiana Purchase... hey, no ranting about your dad lately, either. Actually
doing what you're good at and having people recognize that would put that old
ghost to rest... looking a lot better lately, too, Mr. M...<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She walked
over to Morgendorffer Manor, waited until she saw Quinn exit the house, ran to
catch up with her, and saw that the attractive teen redhead was sporting a
bruise on the side of her face... what happened?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Your
'friend' - my so-called 'sister'-&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Cousin!&quot;
Jane blurted out, and Quinn went several shades of purple and red at the way
Jane had just made fun of the way the younger Morgendorffer daughter
(perpetually and callously) maligned her relationship with Daria. <i>No, I
can't be seen as having a less popular sibling and having that affect my life
&amp; the way people think of me...<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;-Hit
me! She TOTALLY blew off Dad's show last night and came in about one-o'clock,
looking all dusty and dirty - and she had just the coolest black leather jacket
on, so I just HAD to ask her where someone like her would get something so
cool, but when I asked where she got it, all she said was, &quot;GOD, Quinn -
what do you think people DO on dates?' The nerve! And she had all this money -
I saw it when I peeked - I mean, when I looked in her room, so when I just
suggested that maybe she should consider what Mom and Dad would say if they knew
she came in that late -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I
couldn't believe it! I mean, do you know how hard it is to cover up bruises?
She said that she'd cut off my hair, make it into a buggy whip and beat me to
death with it if I said ANYTHING to Mom or Dad! God, her damage is TOTAL! I was
only going to ask her for twenty-!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I'd pay
twenty to see that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After her
misadventures in conversation with She Who Was Otherwise Known As Quinn the
Great-Big-Pain-In-The-Ass, Jane spent the next several hours poking and looking
around for Daria, who apparently decided that school wasn't the order of the
day. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></i><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Then, there were the two
BIG stories around the school that morning. First - the entire school was
gossiping about the news that Jodie had flipped her lid yesterday afternoon and
nearly strangled Sandi Griffin (<i>Good for her!</i> Jane thought, but didn't
say), and then had some sort of seizure that had put her in the hospital - in
intensive care, someone whispered; she apparently had a bad reaction to some
drug she was slipped - come on, even as pressured and driven as Jodie was, SHE
wouldn't do drugs! Jane almost respected Brooke, the bitchy little Fashion Club
member with the nose job - until she heard Brooke continue, saying that Jodie
would try like hell, and then kill herself if she didn't make it to the top. <i>Just
because something's probably true, that doesn't mean you should say it in
public... </i>Jane inwardly winced, knowing that Ms. Li would have already gone
through the roof over the mere mention or insinuation that <i><u>DRUGS</u></i>
were responsible for taking down one of her showcase students. She also noticed
more than a few students quietly moving things out of their lockers and off
school grounds; the first 'surprise locker inspection' would probably begin
minutes after the bell for first hour began the day...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second
big story almost drowned out the Jodie-drug thing. Sometime early last evening,
three so-called bad-asses got theirs handed to them out in the quarry on silver
platters - and from the sound of it, the someone responsible must have been a
big reader of Ms. Barth's theory on how SHE'D educate the men of America to
behave with respect. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>All three of the muggers-to-be were in at least serious
condition. One had a fractured skull, lots and lots of bruises, a broken right
leg, knee and ankle, and both hands were smashed. The second had a concussion,
both arms broken, a hairline fracture in his left hip, serious bruises across
his body and two puncture wounds in his midsection. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>The third guy got it the worst.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>His injuries were a cornucopia of major league 'owies' and
'booboos'. Broken jaw, both arms and wrists broken, SEVEN fingers broken
(including both thumbs), a dislocated right shoulder and torn ligaments, a
major concussion, a bruised right kidney, six broken ribs, broken right hip,
left knee broken, both legs broken (compound fractures), both ankles broken, a
punctured left lung, a severe concussion, a blown left pupil, more cuts and
bruises than an NHL team sees in a season - and two penetration wounds, one
just above the penis and one through the scrotum and a testicle... said
penetration caused by two Bic medium-point pens, black ink. (The other
penetration wounds on the other guy were caused the same way.) The man would - perhaps
- regain consciousness soon, but he was out of the hard-ass bad-guy business
FOR GOOD. He had twenty-one years in the Army and out, the doctors learned, so
the VA was paying his tab - maybe he should have stayed in, a nurse thought. It
may have been safer for him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then there
was the little detail of the guys being robbed and their bikes being torched -
or two being torched and the third stolen as well. The bike stolen was one of
those Japanese models - the 'saki-driven crotch rockets' that the fraternity
boys loved to parade around on, and would be easy to spot, though. The police
were wondering just who was bad enough - and angry enough - and crazed enough -
to roll the Three Little Slaughtered Pigs up in a big-ass, 'Hungry-Man' sized
blanket of pain and suffering - and would have kept their wits about them so as
to pillage &amp; plunder afterward...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Naturally,
the police came around at lunchtime to question Ms. Barch. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>They were fully prepared to threaten to run her in if she
didn't co-operate fully - and they were just as surprised as the students, who
found an unbelievably happy and cooperative Janet Barch, dressed in a flowing,
flowery spring dress that stopped everyone in their tracks. The people in Hell
just started singing 'That's my cable company!' as they stood in line at the
free ice machines, Jane thought, who watched as Ms. Barch all but floated down
the hall to the teacher's lounge with the cops... and then stopped to come back
to where Dr. Armalin stood - and plant a serious liplock on him! Jane was just
as stunned as Kyle and EVERYONE else as she wrapped her arms around him and
nearly sucked the life out of him with that kiss, then whispered something in
his ear before actually SKIPPING down the hall!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now that's
something you don't see every day, she thought. Three yabbos are out for no
good and get Robo-spanked for their trouble, and not only is Ms. Barch working
a daylong orgasm over it - but she also marks the Doctor as the person to share
it with! First - yuck - and second, why is she so damned happy? SHE obviously
didn't do it... but maybe, she knows who did! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Nice
kiss, Doc.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I may
have to wash out my mouth with a good swig of Ebola Zaire,&quot; Kyle coughed,
leaning against the wall. &quot;I can't believe she actually eats anchovy
omelets on onion bagels - my God, that's foul... I wonder why she's so upbeat.
Sylvester Stallone and Russell Crowe are still alive, so her application to
become one of the Furies must have come through.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

then again, he's just like her! Can't have two tigers on the same hill, or
something like that...<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

you hear? Three biker-types got run through the cheese grater by someone out at
the Quarry last night!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

cop said that Zena's got three new openings on her 'asses to be kicked'
list,&quot; Jane replied. &quot;Around here, that's cop lingo for 'Ms. Barch's
been on the warpath'. <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

doesn't seem like she's just beaten three men to within an inch of their
lives,&quot; the Doctor noted, and glanced in Jane's direction. &quot;She's
acting like she was at the show and got the T-shirt, though. I wanted to talk
to you, anyway, Miss Lane.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;It's
great, sir!&quot; she enthused. &quot;I'm really getting into the spirit of
it!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;That's
good to hear,&quot; he said. &quot;What about your friend, Miss Morgendorffer?
How does she like the seminar? I haven't seen her all day, and I thought

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I

away from the Doctor, not noticing the slight satisfaction on his face as she
dashed down the hall. Daria - what was going on with her? Skipping out on her
dad's big night? Trashing Trent? Cutting classes? Quacking Quinn upside her
cranium - okay, CRACKING - but its funny! Well, I thought it was funny - and
man, I could use a laugh right now... <o:p></o:p></span></p>

visibly as she took in the cheerleader's dramatically altered appearance.
&quot;Whoa! What happened to you, Brittany?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Brittany was,
upon viewing, an entirely different young woman. Gone was the sapphire-and-gold
LHS cheerleader outfit, replaced by a jet-black blazer-and-skirt outfit, along
with a simple white cotton blouse and plain flats that screamed 'Men in Black'.
Even more shocking was her perpetual golden ponytails: they were gone, replaced
by an elegant hairstyling reminiscent of the way Jeri Ryan wore her hair in
'Star Trek: Voyager'. Her makeup was also toned down, with only a light blush
and lipstick accentuating her lovely features.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

told Kyle that she could probably get a better education by going to the kids'
section of the LHS library - and was not inaccurate in saying so. Besides
security, Ms. Li literally poured money into amassing a first-rate library that
not only outstripped the COMBINED assets of the Lawndale School District and
the Lawndale Public Library, but also could easily support a small university
or research facility. Apparently others felt the same way, for the Lawndale
School District and the Lawndale Public Library had cut a deal (for a sizeable
fee, no less) allowing LPL cardholders, as well as primary- and high-school
students from other Lawndale schools, to check out books from the LHS library.
There were a few questions raised about policy enforcement, but that ended when
they saw how Ms. Li dealt with persons who tried not to return books...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

It was just after two p.m., and Kyle had finished reading the preliminary
police report - which the Lawndale PD would have been shocked to know he had a
copy of - only twenty minutes ago. There were four sets of footprints at the
crime scene, and one set seemed to have been made by a female. The pens used as
weapons in the attack were commonplace, but the Doctor had seen photos, and
recognized them as the type Daria seemed to favor. The three had been robbed: a
lot of cash, jewelry, a few weapons - including a .357 revolver - and a leather
jacket. The forensic unit also recovered several hairs from two of the three
victims - female, brunette, long (which had been why the bluesuits had been so
hot to question Ms. Barth. She actually had an airtight alibi; she had been
with Timothy O'Neill on a romantic moonlight sail, and they had moored up near
the far end of the beach for... dinner.) &quot;You were lucky - damned lucky that
he didn't just pull that hand-cannon of his.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

leaned against a stack of books. &quot;Back to basics, Morgendorffer. You're
all bent out of shape because of that roasting you got - or are you angry
because nobody jumped to your defense? Here's a question, Daria - why should
they?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

biologically, I'm assuming that you're a human...and in some circles, like to fur
seals and American eagles, that's more than monster enough. Do you present
yourself to them in that fashion, Daria? To the other students - do you seem
like some sort of monster?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;As with
all other things - to the true extent of your ability. Do you comport yourself
in such a manner that, despite what you believe you are broadcasting out to
others, a vastly different view is being received?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;No, I don't
see that. I try to treat everyone the way I want to be treated.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Incorrect.
To obtain the optimum effect - treat others the way <u>they</u> want to be
treated. Granted, this requires that you actually attempt to socialize, to get
to know them and understand more than the surface values that they espouse, but
it is the way to better understand others. If you treat others the way <u>you</u>
want to be treated - you judge them on what, to them, is a totally arbitrary
set of rules and standards that they couldn't possibly live up to. Before you
try to change someone, Morgendorffer, you have to get to know them and see if
in fact they really need to change - and not just to make you feel
better.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and he shrugged as he plunged on. &quot;Let me ask you a question. You arrive
at school, and you've got some little tidbit that you'd really like to discuss

silent. &quot;I guess that makes up the list, but onward and upward. Why
wouldn't you talk to any of the others around here? Perhaps someone else could
give you an insight from a fresh point of view... or is it that their views are
worthless because they simply aren't up to your standards? If that's the case,
then let me ask another question: if you believe that they aren't worth talking
to because their views are as worthless as they are and therefore you don't
talk to them, then isn't your entire viewpoint faulty and therefore worthless
because it is built on inaccurate information - because you can't know that the
other students are worthless unless you actually talk to them?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kyle lifted
his hand to sip at his can of root beer, and Daria briefly wondered if he
actually needed the stuff to survive. &quot;Example. You are a writer, and one
recurring topic you deal with is espionage - actually, paramilitary activities
and low-intensity warfare, or as President Kennedy referred to it: 'the long
twilight struggle'. Your 'Melody Powers' titles are quite interesting, if a bit
technically awkward. Did you know that you have a person in close proximity to
you who could be of some help in cleaning up the technical details?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I read

cheerleader.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Obviously, Kyle didn't mention that he would recommend one of
Brittany's protocols to his superiors for immediate inclusion at all major
installations. Her idea of randomly setting scent detectors to identify the
trace scents of chemical compounds common in differing brands of body soaps (as
well as the various scents emitted by humans after bathing and the degradation
of those scents at various time-frames, so as to compensate for persons who had
been out in the field and contaminating themselves with other trace-scents),
was inspired. Shame he couldn't give her anything of value for it... <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Miss Taylor seems to be unusually well-versed in
military and security matters - but you've never gone to her to ask for ideas
for your stories, let alone asking her about how she came to develop an
interest in the subject. If you ask me, THAT alone could be fodder for one hell
of a story - and it also gives the two of you common ground. Unless, of course,
you simply want to hold onto your safe, comfortable and stagnant belief that
Miss Taylor is nothing more than a vacuous, pom-pom waving, silly sex-toy for
an idiot... 'Cheerleader Barbie', I believe, was the term.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;But she's a perfect example of what I'm saying. You've
never made an effort to find out more about her - which means that you've been
acting with incomplete or inaccurate information - which means that if you act
on something using that information, your plans will fail because they were flawed
from the beginning. Now - expand outward from Miss Taylor to others around you.
Obviously, you're correct about some of your fellow students, but what about
the others? What opportunities have you missed or let go to waste, what
accomplishments could you have achieved, what personal joys could you have had
- or could you still have? - if you simply reach out with an open mind.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

You may not SEE yourself as part of the community, thereby making your love
life a personal matter - but OTHERS SEE YOU as part of the community. Because
of this, they are going to be curious about you - popular or outcast, they're
talking about you even if it's just in passing. One of the things that defines
a young woman's image is her sexuality - perceived or otherwise. Does she have
a boyfriend? Does she want one? Who IS she interested in? Is she interested in
anybody? Why or why not - and in she isn't, then why isn't she?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

there's a market for information, someone's going to supply it - and if there's
a big enough price on that info, people will do anything to get it... including
make it up as they go along. Take control of the situation, Morgendorffer. Control
the information and you not only control the people, but you can take charge of

'grown-up': it doesn't work. Boys are going to want to have sex with you
regardless of what you wear - or what you say, think about, believe in or ate

Reason #97 in Maxim's '100 Reasons On Why It's Great To Be A Guy'. Because of

to have anything to do with you 'because you're smart', 'because you actually

Morgendorffer, a team works because every person there knows what everyone else

Griffin directly in the eye and ask her this: Does she think that you, Daria

socialize with the other teachers - well, maybe with one, and I don't date... the
