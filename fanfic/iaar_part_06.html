"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Excuse
me... you're Helen Morgendorffer, right?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Helen looked
up from her desk, a slight tinge of annoyance as she saw the tall,
scarlet-haired woman standing in the doorway of her office. <i>Tall, very
attractive, excellent taste in clothing and jewelry - although a bit more (and
a bit much) than I'm accustomed to, more than enough hair, a touch of attitude
to go along with the smarts that I can see in her eyes... Las Vegas lost yet
another showgirl to a foolish rich man and the Elvis Wedding Chapel, I see...<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I'm
Bronwyn Ruttheimer.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That name
brought Helen to full attention - and wiped the snide remark away with blinding
speed. The Ruttheimers were one of the wealthiest families in the state - even
wealthier than the Barksdales. The computer and 'dot-com' industries were the
crux of the 'nouveau riche' caste, creating a new host of multimillionaires and
the occasional billionaire - for which the Ruttheimers CERTAINLY qualified.
Counting only RADIAL, the cyber-company Charles Ruttheimer, Jr. founded on his
own in the early 1980's, the Ruttheimer fortune was easily valued in the
billions of dollars... <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor was
Bronwyn someone to be trifled with: as Chief Operating Officer of RADIAL, she
nevertheless managed to find the time to have seven children (three sets of
twins and a spare), have an actual family life, and garner one vicious
reputation through the business world. The 'Great Red Shark' (but not to her
face) pocketed an MBA from NYU, came to Texas in the early 1970's as a newlywed
and worked as an office manager to pay the bills. She did this while her
husband worked all-hours to develop not only new computer codes and software,
but tried to think ahead to the potential needs that the public would have for
the oncoming rush: the how-to's, the 'what's that's' and the 'how do I do this'
of the computer age. He was remarkably accurate, and with Bronwyn working the
business end, Ruttheimer Advanced Development and Integrated Adaptation
Logistics (RADIAL) became one of the first major cybernetics research and
development companies in the business.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Yes...
yes, of course,&quot; Helen replied, rising from her chair. &quot;It's very
nice to meet you in person; I've read about you for years. Why don't you come
in and have a seat?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I've
got a better idea, &quot; Bronwyn said, spinning her car keys on her finger.
&quot;Ever knocked back a really good bottle of hundred-year-old wine?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Sandi,
you've got to try harder! It took you over three minutes for you to stabilize
the machine! That's almost as bad as Mack's time - you have to do better!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Look,
I'm trying, like, all right?&quot; Sandi snapped, unfastening herself from the
belt harness of the three-ring stabilization trainer - a NASA-issue piece of
equipment, sold for surplus, that was now the biggest draw at the local arcade.
&quot;I can do it, it's just that it takes me a moment or two to focus!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;You can
try again, Sandra - but now, it's Miss Lane's turn,&quot; Upchuck said, motioning
for Jane to get into the device. &quot;Jane, just remember what we've said
about -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Yeah, I
think I've got it, Jane shot back, watching the fawn-like wobbling of Sandi's
legs as she stepped down from the trainer and then stepped up the four steps in
order to climb aboard. The trainer was an odyssey; a tribute to weird design
and looks married in a shotgun wedding to simplicity and purpose. It was simply
three concentric rings (each one singularly representing the X-, Y- and Z-
axes) with a pilot's command chair and a display monitor located within the
innermost ring. The three rings spun in differing directions, giving the
'pilot' one hell of a ride unless he (or she) could use the control yoke (or
'joystick') to control the rotations and stabilize the rings... not an easy task,
by any means. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Here,
let me help you strap in,&quot; Ted said, scampering up the steps and lending a
hand as Jane began to fight with the locking mechanism on the heavily
reinforced safety belts. &quot;It's not that hard - just put it in like
this...&quot; He looked up into Jane's eyes of light-struck sapphire, and a knot
appeared in his throat. &quot;I'm sorry - I didn't mean it like that, and
-&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Thank
you, Ted,&quot; Jane said, favoring him with a smile that put him at ease.
&quot;How do you know about this?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

to Space Camp three years in a row!&quot; he announced proudly. &quot;I tried
for so long to work this the right way, but my stomach -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;That
would be nice...&quot; She gave off a slight squeak as Ted tightened the belt a
bit, and laughed at his expression. &quot;Oh, don't worry, Ted. Nobody around
here expects you to end up working at 'Helga's House of Pain!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ted's face
went blank, and Jane blinked hard as the thought entered her mind: 'I have got

World'-<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

making moon-eyes at our Director of Medicine and Research, Lane,&quot; Upchuck
cackled, his head popping in-between the two blank-eyed teens. &quot;You're
about to take a ride, and you'll want to concentrate on that... you, too,
Ted.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ted suddenly
realized that he had been staring into Jane's eyes - <i>she's <u>so</u> pretty</i>
- and hopped down after giving the harness a final check, while Upchuck gave
Jane a once-over. &quot;Hello, Miss Goodheart,&quot; he growled, waggling his
eyebrows at her as he took on what he thought was (for him) a grandiose tone,
complete with him rolling his 'R's like SUV's on an interstate highway. &quot;I
see Lothar has made your acquaintance with the Cradle of Persuasion. I am -
Chaotica, Supreme Lord and Emperor of the Universe! Welcome - to my Dungeon of
Pain!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Oh,
you're no fun,&quot; he grinned, his normal voice back as he stepped away from
the machine. &quot;Okay - start it up!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

stomach suddenly lurch as the three rings began to move and quickly began to
twirl about; grasping at the control yoke, she watched the screen and attempted
to align the rings... her hair flew, her vision blurred and blood rushed to her
head, but she kept going...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

alignment. &quot;She's really good at this!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

for a moment. &quot;You can do it - Go, Jane, go!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

my,&quot; Upchuck said, shaking his head in wonderment as Jane hit the control
on the trainer, locking the rings in place. &quot;Forty-eight seconds. Not bad
at all.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

your first time doing this, you were absolutely incredible!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

it seems like you've got a new fan, Jane Lane,&quot; Sandi huffed, but without
her trademark snootiness behind it as she watched Ted go up and unfasten Jane
from her seat. &quot;Can I try again, now, please?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

atmosphere around Jake's office was - to be blunt - morose. Horizon sat at her
desk, sorting out the different types of tasty kibbles in her bag of trail mix
and putting them in small piles, while a fuming Wendy tried to while her time
away on the editing suite. The sharp, occasional burst of choice profanity
nearly blistered the paint off the walls in the hallway, and the tiny redhead
wanted so badly to pick up something and throw it - or throw it at Helen's
head, given the chance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

never really had the chance to meet Helen, and her vicious little snit aimed at
Lauriel had destroyed her chances of Wendy ever caring about her. <i>The woman
didn't deserve the crap you laid out on her, and I wish you had talked to ME
that way. I'll take a copy of the state lawbook and ram it up your ass! I mean,
how much money has Lauriel laid out on your family, and you never even bothered
to send her even a thank-you note for the lobsters. See, that's your problem -
you've spent so much time in courtrooms against a lot of people you can just
walk like dogs because they don't know the lingo. That's not me. Pull that on
Lauriel again and the word for the day's going to be 'Ow'....<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

smiled at the thought of Helen's having been harassed by a LPD officer last night.

supporting her man by being there on time... damn, she doesn't think much of him!

York City - she's got a couple of days worth of meetings,&quot; the redhead
spoke up, referring to Carter County International Airport. &quot;After last

the greeting bell caught the ladies' attention, and they started towards the

at the way the woman glared at her. &quot;What do you want, anyway - want to
deliver a poisoned letter, or follow up on your mom's performance and act like
one of the tramps on 'All My Children'? What your mother did last night was
some vile, crappy -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

did and call her all sorts of names,&quot; Quinn continued, warily due to
Wendy's proximity. &quot;She's a nice lady - she IS a lady - and my mother's a

fourth biggest night of her life because your Senior Prom's the second biggest
night of your life ESPECIALLY if you're actually in love with your escort to
the prom - he's an 'escort', not a 'date', because this is a FORMAL event! Or
wait - the Senior Prom is the THIRD biggest night of your life, because your
Debutante Ball is your formal 'coming-out' affair into society, and THERE you
have an ESCORT so I guess your date to the Senior Prom really IS a date after
all! And of course, your WEDDING NIGHT is the BIGGEST night of your life, so
everything has to be planned just right and MONTHS in advance - I mean, can you
just see having your wedding night ruined because they didn't put enough ice in
your Honeymoon Suite so the diet soda is warm, let alone the champagne - and
what if everyone eats up all of the wedding cake so you don't have any to feed
each other in bed?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Taylor leaned against the door of the arcade, sipping her chocolate shake and
glancing up on occasion to watch Sandi trying to master the flight simulator.
As she absently flipping through a copy of 'American Rifleman', a trio of men,
each wearing the 'AXP' of the Alpha Chi Rho fraternity on their jackets, walked
past. Two of the 'frat-rats' gave Brittany a serious once-over as they did so...
and then, suddenly broke away from the third and headed back on a beeline
towards her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the lanky, dark-haired young man said in a slight Southern accent, smiling a
smile that, if Brittany wasn't thinking like a security-type, might have been
charming enough to have landed him a date right on the spot. &quot;Love the
'Men-In-Black' thing. Going to a costume party?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

second, a small, wiry young man slightly older than the first, with wild brown
hair and a hawkish nose that only detracted slightly from his looks, break out
in laughter. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

her eyes. &quot;So, you're into guns, hmn? I've got a P-85 and a Remington
12-gauge... I'm also going to get a Glock as soon as I can.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the third frat-rat, who stood a reassuring distance away, laughed at the same
time. No, he's not really a frat-rat, she thought, looking at the slightly
overweight African-American who stood barely an inch or two over Joel. He's too
old - maybe he's a grad student, because he's at least 27 or so. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

though. One - if you're trying to carry concealed, it's a bitch-kitty to try
with something THAT big. Two - no offense, but you don't look like your hands
are big enough to handle a Para-Ordinance pistol.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

sound asleep, laid back on a surprisingly comfortable couch in an office within
the Lawndale Police Headquarters, when the door opened to admit Detective
Sergeants Melinda Hadley and Denise Riker.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the annoying sound quite different than the sensual, yet firm, athletic figure
that a commitment to bodybuilding since she was seventeen had blessed her with.

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>At five-nine and one hundred and thirty pounds (none of it
fat, thank you VERY MUCH!), with butter-blonde hair cut in a short, elegant
style that matched the stylish outfit she wore, 'Lindy' Hadley looked far more
like a female lawyer or futures trader - or a high-priced call girl, in the
right outfit. That was the primary reason she (and Riker, her taller and
equally attractive African-American partner) kept getting tapped for vice squad
duty - or had, until her promotion to a gold shield ensured that she'd never
have to wear garter belts or a bustier again... unless she wanted to put on a
naughty little show for the current love of her life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>She also hated being reminded of the soft spot that she had
for Morgendorffer, or for anything that looked sad, lost and alone... In a way,
it was part of what led her into law enforcement, and she hated having to go
hard on some of the individuals her conscience cried out for her to help...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

Denise snickered as she moved so Lindy could pass by. &quot;You tell him that
his so-called wife never showed up - not that it matters, with the calls the

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Her problem's that she didn't get to be a man,&quot;
Denise concluded. &quot;Don't get lip gloss all over him, all right?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

lying on the couch, beginning to find his way back to the land of the real. <i>He's
such a gentle, sweet man, and he's got the soul of a child... I wish that I could
find a man like you for my own. There's got to be at least one other sweet,
sensitive man who isn't pretending and isn't married... I'm just so tired of just
being alone.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

head and smiling as he saw the officer. &quot;Didn't get to see you or Denise
last night.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

smiled, looking directly at the beautiful Black officer. &quot;I looked up to
see this luscious, angelic Nubian queen of love and war standing over me, and
it never occurred to connect that image with you - after all, you're just a
beat cop.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;For some reason, I keep penciling in 'kick Jake's ass'
on my things to do list,&quot; Denise spoke, rewarding him with a smile that
would have made most of her fellow officers pass out in shock - they thought
her scowl was the only facial expression she owned. &quot;Now I know why. Don't
use him up too badly, Lindy - he still has to get my little boy that audition
for the amusement park ad.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;See you later,&quot; he smiled back as Denise left, and
looked back at Lindy. &quot;What happened last night? You won one of the taster
spots off 'Z-93' and I was surprised to see you blow it off!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Couldn't be helped, - we worked a bad one out at the
quarry last night,&quot; she said, leaning against the door. &quot;Three guys
got jammed by someone who knew what 'kicking someone's ass' is supposed to
mean. It wasn't pretty; whoever did it took pride in their work.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

least a month - and he's got a lot of rehab work in his future. Oh, we've seen
him before - likes to beat on women and anything smaller than him. I guess he
ran up on something bigger.&quot; Lindy smiled grimly as she spoke, remembering
the image of the man as he lay quivering in a hospital bed, a body-cast swathed
lump of bandages, tubes, blood spots and pain...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Sic semper tyrannis, you son of a bitch. If only you could do
a day in ICU for every person you put your paws on - no, someone worthwhile
might need the bed and care. If there was any real justice, you'd be in a HMO
somewhere, lying on bed sores in a lake of your own piss and getting your
morphine drip cut by two-thirds. At least you've only got half the chance you
had before of bringing another little dropping of crap into the world NOW, eh,
donkey-dick? Guess the pen is mightier than the sword - and hurts a hell of a

taken to warning the blonde officer when she was moving towards what he called

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
desk-sized, black-on-black German Shepard known as Judgement rose up from where
she rested, and gently nosed at the bowl Manuel stirred in. &quot;Just a
moment, girl, they're not soft enough yet. Denise, you know that she likes you
too - why don't you give her a chance?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;The
dog's the size of a Yugo, Manuel. I like smaller animals - animals that can be
stopped without the help of the National Guard.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;You're
going to hurt her feelings,&quot; the Latino deputy said, sliding the bowl to
his 'K-9' partner. &quot;Here you go, girl. Slowly, now - don't scare the
people.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Denise
watched, amazed, as the police dog sniffed the bowl's contents, and then began
to slowly lap the concoction up. &quot;You're going to ruin that dog's nose by
giving her stuff like that. Then you won't be able to use her for drug work and
you'll have to send her back where she belongs - over to Fort Hood, where all
of the other Army tanks live.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;They'll
have to get in line if they want to get their hands on Judgement. Everyone with
a badge keeps trying to peel my girl off, but we're a team - end of story. She
finds it - drugs, people, the best Mexican food on this side of the border -
and I do the rest.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Perez,
take your mount outside with the rest of the horses,&quot; Mintner said,
passing by with an armful of folders. &quot;Try to get a date with Riker later
- she has work to do.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;He was
an abused child,&quot; Manuel said, and smiled at the attractive Lawndale cop.
&quot;When you finally come around, give me a call.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Great,&quot;
Lindy said, looking out the window at the exchange. &quot;Manuel and his
doughnut-scarfing war elephant are out there hitting on Denise - again - and I
wonder what scut job the Lieutenant wants us to pull now...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>She glanced back at Jake. &quot;So, are you all rested and
happy?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I'm okay,&quot; he allowed. &quot;Why'd you let me sleep
this long?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Because you definitely needed it, knowing you - and you
probably haven't eaten anything today waiting on Helen all this time, so lunch
is on me!&quot; she said, waving Jake off the couch. &quot;After we collect my
partner, we'll go on over to the Settlement and grab something, and you can
tell us about last night - yours had to be better than ours.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Aren't you still on duty? The Settlement's halfway
across town, and -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;We both just came off double shifts when the quarry call
came in,&quot; Lindy told him. &quot;I've got the next three days off. After we
eat, I'm going home, pour myself into a tub for about an hour, and then I'm
going to sleep for the next twenty-four hours.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;In that case - let me treat the two of you to a really
nice meal. I happen to know people at Chez Pierre, and I also happen to know
that, for some reason, my money just isn't any good there - no matter what the
order is.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;It's a shame you're married, Jake,&quot; Lindy said,
watching as he slid his suit jacket on. <i>Especially since you've <u>already</u>
got someone in the waiting room if and when you remove that bitch from your
life - wish I could grow my hair out like Lauriel does...</i> &quot;A dodge like
that would be the thing for a man who's dating.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;You'd think that Helen would let me take her out for
dinner or even a fancy lunch,&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Jake chimed along, &quot;but it's always 'I've got work to
do!&quot; or 'Eric and the partners wouldn't look kindly on an associate who
just wastes her time and the firm's acting like a character in a soap opera -
just sitting around in the so-called 'lap of luxury', sipping drinks and acting
like they're the only important thing in the world!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lindy laughed
out loud at Jake's dead-on impersonation of Helen, complete with hand waving
and Helen's haughty, wealth-cultivated accent. &quot;You had better not ever
let her catch you doing that!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Well,
it's not as if she goes out of her way to have few laughs...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>*****<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;You have got to be kidding - an hour and ten
minutes?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I met Jake just before he turned eighteen, Bronwyn.
That's the thing - if you want them to be good at it, you've got to get them
when they're young!&quot; Helen laughed, taking another deep drink of the tangy
wine in her glass. &quot;That way, you train 'em up right the first time,
teaching them to do what makes <u>you</u> feel good instead of having to break
them of the bullshit that they see James Bond and Hugh Hefner pushing. Men
don't understand that it's about US - making sure that we get what we came for.
After all - if they want us to come back over for dinner again, then they need
to serve up a full-course meal right the first time!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I know that's the truth,&quot; the redhead laughed, her
face slightly flushed with the color that comes only from intoxication. &quot;I
met Charles when he was twenty-two, and you wouldn't believe the work I had to
put into putting him on the leash! I love my Charles, yes I do, but Ruttheimers
are sometimes the worst! It's like they're born already aroused and thinking
that the opposite sexes were put here just to scratch that itch!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Bronwyn leaned forward and speared another thin slice of rare
roast beef off her plate, swirling it around before eagerly devouring it.
&quot;I thought that a good lunch would be appropriate for talking over
business,&quot; she continued, &quot;but I didn't realize that we were so much
alike!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Helen looked around the colossal area and spectacular
surroundings that made up the Ruttheimer Gazebo, and turned back to her
hostess. &quot;We're not that much alike...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Helen, please! The only differences between us would be
hairstyle &amp; color, area of expertise, the number of children we have and
the fact that you don't let <u>your</u> dorsal fin ride as high in the water as
I do!&quot; Bronwyn laughed, and washed down the beef with another drink of the
fruity Italian wine. &quot;Oh, come on! You think I haven't picked up on <u>that</u>
from 'the Street'? You're just biding your time at that law firm until you make
partner - and then, you're going to carry out a pogrom there that'll make
Stalin weep! I have done it before, you know...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>The shorter woman nodded; she had heard about Bronwyn's
lightning-swift and vicious decapitation of a Japanese firm that had tried to
come in on a hostile takeover of RADIAL - and of several members of RADIAL's
own Board of Directors, when she found out about the complicity within. People
in the financial community, and others closely associated with them, still
whispered in board rooms and limousines about the ruthless, gangland-style
tactics Bronwyn mercilessly employed on the 'Day of Rutting' - not to mention
the SEC investigations she had initiated that fully vaporized everyone on the
wrong side of Bronwyn's holy, cleansing flames...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I'll bet you spent the '60's' in handmade clothing and
sandals, protesting the war and the draft, too! What did they call you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;They hung 'Lavender' on me,&quot; Helen admitted.
&quot;You?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Oh, I was 'Bronwyn' all the way through. I dressed every
day the way any good little Irish Catholic girl out of Boston should, and made
my people angrier than hell when I kept getting busted. I still remember how
the people I hung with tried to nickname me 'Big Red,' but I was like, 'If I'm
going to be free, I'm going to be free my way as myself - not the fashionable
way that everyone's doing by getting a nickname and hiding who I am. Now shut
up, gimme another toke, then get over here and do me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I'll just bet that you were a real fireball.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I think of it in a reasonable way,&quot; Bronwyn said.
&quot;Unless one of my kids comes home holding hands with 'E.T.', I really
don't have room to talk about who they find out there or how they do it. Even
then, all I ask is that it's someone who's not going to hurt my babies and make
them feel bad about themselves. That's all I ask.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Were you really THAT wild?&quot; Helen usually didn't
pry into other's business, but Bronwyn was a fascinating person with a
background much like hers - and several bottles of wine did loosen the screws
on her curiosity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Helen, I probably did everything but the 'Ed Sullivan'
show,&quot; she remarked casually. &quot;I was a little tramp. And where did
you sow your wild oats?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Europe,&quot; she admitted, inwardly wondering why she
was telling a secret that had never seen daylight before. &quot;Paris, Milan,
Corsica, and Barcelona... with a weekend side trip to Amsterdam. My mother gave
me a four-week trip for my Christmas present during my first year in law school
- I think she thought I'd find someone over there and get rid of Jake.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I see that you didn't find someone else.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;That doesn't mean that I didn't look around... a
lot,&quot; Helen giggled, amazed that she was capable of the sound. &quot;You
know, every woman should have a 'Paolo' in her life, even if it's for just one
night.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;That's because you're a WASP, Helen. If you're an Irish
Catholic girl, then it's got to be an 'Ian', with a strong, muscled back, long
hair with a touch of curl, a twinkle in his eye, and a book of sonnets or
poetry. You don't know what making love is, Helen, until an 'Ian's' made love
to you under a Irish sky, with the smell of all nature about you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Oh, yes, I do. You should try a 'Paolo', in a rose-petal
strewn bed in the center of a bedroom that looks like the foyer of a church,
with candles and silk all over, with open windows so the cool night air can
gently blow through, and the scent of the sea just barely comes through,&quot;
Helen continued. &quot;Being young only comes once. I'm glad I didn't waste it
all.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Did you have fun?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Yes...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Did you help anybody get out from under the
bullshit?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I think so.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Was the sex great?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;It wasn't bad.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;And we had penicillin, Pink Floyd and the joy of seeing
'Tricky Dick' get the axe, so we didn't waste anything,&quot; Bronwyn told her.
&quot;You know - I've wanted to talk to you for a while, and when Little
Charles told me about what that horrid policewoman did last night, I felt that
I needed to make the time to come and meet you. I've been meaning for some time
to inquire about retaining your services as my personal attorney -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Helen barely kept from choking on her green vegetables and
goat-cheese medley at that; such a move by her would increase the incoming cash
flow to the firm by at least an order of five - and could mean her partnership
by the end of the week.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;- But I didn't realize that I'd find such a good friend
as well.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Bronwyn nodded at the sudden look of surprise on Helen's face;
for her part, Helen felt the need to glance at her watch - and realized that it
was almost four P.M.! <i>We've been out here talking and drinking since at
least ten-thirty, and I haven't spent that much time just wasting time since...
since...<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>I can't remember the last time I've wasted this much time -
and I don't believe that I actually haven't taken a cellular phone call or even
touched my phone in hours... Eric'll think that I - to hell with what he thinks!<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I haven't had a friend that I could do things like this
with,&quot; Helen admitted ruefully. &quot;They all think I'm a bitch.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;True,&quot; Bronwyn said. &quot;Just so long as they
understand that you're the Queen Bitch, so everybody knows what's coming if
they step out of line. If they show proper respect, you and I may choose not to
notice when they slip up here and there.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;You don't care if they think of you that way?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;There are the people I care about, the ones I can use -
and everyone else had best stay out of my way,&quot; Bronwyn stated flatly.
&quot;I care about my babies, my man and most of the people who work for
Charles and me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>She lifted her glass. &quot;I also care about my
friends.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Friends,&quot; Helen said, trying out the word as if it
were a newly forged sword, feeling the heft and balance. &quot;A friend.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>She also lifted her glass in salute. &quot;It's nice to have
friends.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Bronwyn nodded, and looked over as she saw Michelle and
Danielle Ruttheimer, her oldest daughters, as they ran into the gazebo and over
to their mother. &quot;Mom, Danny broke the car again!&quot; Michelle
complained. &quot;I needed it to go over to Oakwood tonight, and -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Follow that God-awful so-called band to listen to them
kill cats with their music!&quot; the other auburn-haired twin snapped back.
&quot;Micky acts like that scarecrow fronting Mystik Spiral's 'so special and
so cute' - somebody needs to feed him a sandwich and throw him into a music
book! That's as close as he'll EVER get to real music! Come on - 'Ow, my nose?
Ow, my face?' If you played their tape in a pet shop, you'd get busted for
animal cruelty!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Girls, go inside. I'll take care of everything
later-&quot; Bronwyn began.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;You get a few music reviews published, and NOW you're
Miss Rolling Stone! You don't know music, and you're still pissed off because
the guy in the leather didn't give you any play when you came on to him -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Danny, Micky, I have a guest...&quot; Bronwyn interrupted
again, but the twins weren't paying any attention to their mother.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I'm not the one who said he dressed like he's in the gay
version of 'Gladiator' - but since we look alike, it got back to him that it
was me, you big-mouthed tramp!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Big-mouthed tramp? The only reason your mouth's so small
is because you don't need to open up that wide for a -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;That's it!&quot; Bronwyn snapped, rising up and towering
a good foot over her twins. &quot;Both of you, be quiet and get up to your
rooms right now! No television, no phones, no electronics of any kind until I
come up and deal with the both of you!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>The attractive twins looked at each other in a confused
manner, and one of them spoke. &quot;Mom, you can't ground us. We're
twenty-one.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>A very large chunk of roast beef barely missed the head of a
twin! &quot;And what is it about the words that are coming out of my mouth that
you two wee beasts don't understand?&quot; Bronwyn shouted, her deep, throaty
Irish accent coming to the fore. &quot;I said get up to your rooms before I
burn your overly rounded little backsides off right here and now - and don't
think that Helen here hasn't seen someone take a belt to their child
before!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Mom, you can't use a belt on a kid - that's child
abuse-&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>A solid lump of meat, fully six pounds in weight, flew through
the air and actually grazed the back of the other twin's head! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><u><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;That's one blast furnace of a temper you've got,&quot;
Helen commented, watching the twins sprint towards the main house. &quot;I
can't wait until I get to see it in action on someone you don't like.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Part of your new job'll be to keep me from doing that to
the ones I don't like. I won't be able to get back into their good graces with
an honest hug, money and new 'Playstation 2' games,&quot; Bronwyn said, her
anger bleeding off as she looked at the lumps of meat on the floor. &quot;Damn.
That's why I usually keep grapefruits out on the table.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Not exactly luck. You don't have to worry about your baby
boy running into some bimbo who'll try her best to siphon his trust fund out
from beneath him - or worse, playing 'wounded dove' to get his sympathy and
have him doing all sorts of fool things for her.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

across the table between the two friends...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

for view. &quot;This is my Little Charles...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;The boy who helped me out last night,&quot; Helen said.
&quot;He's a wonderful young man.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I know - against my oldest daughter.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Let's talk about Quinn.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;What would you like to know?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;What kind of person is she?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;She's a touch flighty,&quot; Helen admitted, &quot;but
that's because she's caught up in this little club. We got her a tutor over the
Christmas break and that's really helped her; she's buckled down and started
living up to her potential. I understand from her teachers that she's started
to really do well in math and history - and they're REALLY excited about her
math potentials.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Little Charles has always done well in school - even so,
he really doesn't need to consider a career based on how much money he can
earn. Because of that, I've been trying to have him become more involved in the
arts - he possibly could become a true name in the art world, if he'd only put
his soul into it. I'll show you some of the pieces he's painted; he's done some
truly inspired work.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I think that Quinn would be flattered and overwhelmed if
a gracious and extraordinarily talented young man were to offer to paint a
portrait of her,&quot; Helen continued, a light coming on in her eyes. &quot;It
would be a wonderful gesture, one I can't see her turning away.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Nor my Little Charles,&quot; Bronwyn finished, the same
light glowing in her eyes. &quot;I believe that he would consider the chance to
have such a beautiful young woman model for him an opportunity not to be missed
- and the time they spend together as he paints will give them a chance to get
to know one another...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>There was another slight moment of silence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;You know - when Quinn graduates and takes the summer to
prepare for school, Little Charles might possibly be able to help her out a
bit. After all, he won't be just another boy from high school - he'll be a
college man.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;This is true,&quot; Helen spoke. &quot;You know - when
Quinn leaves for college two years from now, she'll be leaving not as a child,
but as a woman. She'll have reached... the age of consent.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;This, then, is also true,&quot; Bronwyn replied.
&quot;You know - the University of Texas at Lawndale has a very active Greek
system, and the most incredible academic programs...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Academic programs? Which ones would the children be
interested in?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Oh, I wouldn't worry about that,&quot; the Olympian
redhead said, raising her wineglass. &quot;We have more than a year and a half
to make those decisions for them.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;The University of Texas at Lawndale,&quot; the lawyer
replied, her glass raised in return. &quot;I find it just remarkable that both
your son and my daughter are thinking about attending school there.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Isn't that an interesting coincidence,&quot; Bronwyn
Ruttheimer remarked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Yes, isn't it just,&quot; Helen Morgendorffer concurred.

alone in the bleachers, looking down at the football field and the school
grounds, now nearly deserted, with a benign look on her face and some serious
soul-searching going on in her mind. She had an interesting, if somewhat short
discussion with Andrea, who wanted to know about how she and Trent were doing... <o:p></o:p></span></p>

I know that you're probably pissed off at me because I didn't come in on your
gig, but it wasn't my thing - the money didn't have anything to do with it, and
yeah, I could have made things a lot better for Janey and me with it. I could
have done a lot for Janey with that kind of cash - but it's more important that
I was around for her, not hopping around the world with a baby supercomputer on
my back while tossing cash back towards her - that's what the P's do to her
now. I always wondered if I had made the right decision, and then one day, a
person came along on the way to Alternapaloosa and told me that I needed to at
least try for my own dreams. Even if I fail, I still have the knowledge of
knowing that I tried... and that's something I wouldn't have had if I had gone
off with your people. I learned a lot in your seminar, and the summer that I
spent at Grove Hills, but you've got to let that go. I even kept the gizmo your

landscape was unnaturally quiescent, divorced from sensation, or reaction, or
the input of his own feelings. He had taken time to touch his inner self - and

right to denigrate you, your family, your dreams and goals, and I don't have
any excuse for what I did. All I can say is that I was hurting, and when I saw
the concern you had in your eyes for me and you didn't expect anything in

slight step away from Daria. &quot;One of the things that makes you special is
that you say what you know is true. You don't sugarcoat things; you want to
face the truth. That's why I have to believe you're sorry for the effect that
saying those things would have on me - but not for saying them. How could you
be? On some level, you must believe that there's truth to what you said. You
have to believe that, otherwise, it wouldn't have been there for you to use.
Somewhere deep inside yourself, you know that I'm right - and in that same
place, you know that there's never going to be an 'us'.&quot; Trent swallowed.
&quot;I may want to be there for you, and you may want me there - but you don't

problem is that you won't. You're never going to let anyone in to help you,
Daria. You won't ever let me in, because I'm not good enough for you. In your

was the uniform, complete with decorations and skill-tabs. She wore the garb of
a 1<sup>st</sup> Lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force Commandos, complete with
beret and unit flashes - and no suggestion of a smile. She, Ted, Jane, Brittany
and Mack (who had also been recruited in haste) had received the things they
would need for their parts in Upchuck's plan. In Sandi's case (she was now one
of the team leaders - Upchuck was one fast talker and worked even faster), that
meant an Air Force uniform, ID cards and a BIG folder of information. The
entire group of students were to meet at the school tonight for a 'test run' -
and Sandi was REALLY stunned to find out what that really meant - so she suited
up before she came to the hospital.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

didn't think anyone would be so blatant to come in uniform,&quot; the Swede sighed.
&quot;You DELPHI goons are far, far too arrogant for your own good - and one

bruises of the past day's events were hidden by the ascot she wore.
&quot;First, I don't blame you for this. You weren't yourself, and everybody
knows it. I blame whoever gave you the drugs - and I almost feel sorry for them
if Ms. Li gets to them before the police do. Even my mother's shut up - after

wayward hair off the front of her uniform. &quot;Hey, what do you think?
Upchuck had... HAS one for you, too. He wanted all of us to be in on his crazy
idea to ace the Doctor's class, and you should see the machine he had built! He
wanted you to be - he wanted you in for the spot that I'm in now... yeah, uniform
and everything! He said that he always saw you as a Navy officer - a real
'Captain America', doing whatever the country needed, like you are at school. I
thought he only saw you as another girl to try and score on. I guess he was
more right about you than I was. I thought that I could do anything that you
could. Truth is, you're the one who always deserved to be in the front, and me
- I always ended up stealing your place in the spotlight, and 'stealing' is the
right word. Look at this - even now, I've got the space that should have been

she answered bluntly. &quot;Jodie kept herself on a schedule that simply
ensured that she wouldn't have time for any of that escapist nonsense - she's
understood ever since she was a little girl that drugs have no place in the
life of any Black person who wants to be a winner!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In response
to the uncomfortable looks of the two officers, Michelle plunged on. &quot;You
know I'm right - every time something goes wrong with any Black child, the
first question everybody wants to know is 'Was she high? Was she doing drugs?'
It's not like something else could have happened - oh, no, they're 'Black
folks', so they had to be into drugs! My baby's so afraid that someone'll say
that about her that she doesn't even take aspirin for headaches!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I
couldn't find anything,&quot; Denise said, more than a note of apology in her
tones as she went up to Michelle. &quot;Mrs. Landon - I really don't think that
Jodie was into the drug scene. The question is, then, who would slip your
daughter a drug, and why?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;The
'why' is easy,&quot; Michelle said. &quot;My baby's the best that ever came out
of that school. Someone wants her to lose any chance she's got for a good life
just as she's about to have all of the recruiters from the REAL colleges come
sniffing around her - you know no decent school's going to take any student
with a history of drugs. Someone wants to drag my baby down because they're
jealous, or because they can't do what she can, or just because they're petty
little bitches who want to hurt her because they can!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

&quot;GHB and all the date-rape drugs are the thing now. This was done to make
Jodie Landon look bad.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

called a friend from my old job to come over, open up the files and print them

unlike most people, had no problems when it came to returning to Lawndale High
School. Most high school graduates either detest even the slightest mention of
their high school years and fear returning to their old stomping grounds the
way a vampire fears hallowed ground, or relish their return the way a Macarthur
or a victorious Caesar relishes his return. The latter act as they do because
they reached their peak in high school, enjoying the belief that they will -
for a few brief moments - reign again as kings and queens of old did, while the
former act as they do because they remember high school as elderly Jews
remember the Holocaust. This is why many, even most persons avoid or even
refuse to go to their high schools for reunions. To those persons, two simple
words ring true: 'Never again.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

baggage was something that Trent had never managed to accumulate. He simply saw
those four years as something to get through on his way to 'the Prize'. The
teachers, the average Joes, the brains and the burners, the
pretty-beyond-perfect cheerleaders and the stylish clique-queens, the strutting
jocks and the way-cool mack daddies - they all had their own date with the
Inquisitor, that robotic-dude from the 'Red Dwarf' show out of England. They'd
have to justify themselves and what they did to themselves and everybody else
when they looked in the mirror, and that was cool; they got rewarded or
punished on their own - it didn't have anything to do with him or the way he
lived his life. <i>You can live your lives how you want, just so you remember
that your rights end at my nose - and vice versa. I'm cool with that. I'll just
go my way, and do my thing, and I'll try not to get into your face with my own
dream trip. That's why I never jammed with other guys at lunch hour in the
cafeteria or out in the parking lot: I can see how some people might not be
down with my music. That's cool, too, as long as they're decent about it.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

you do is work. No one ever sees you out on the town, you never socialize with
the other teachers, and you don't eat or even spend time in the Teacher's

watch some bad television. Take that little woman you've got there and go walk
on the beach with a picnic basket and a sleeping bag. You're starting to stress
out a bit, kid. Go home - and I hope you've got the sense to just relax a

place where people go when they want to be alone &amp; don't want to be

about him, and he's a workaholic. I'm surprised that he's got a woman in his

just say that my mom knew Clinton way back when and let it go. They got me an
apartment in Georgetown, and warned me every day to be careful - they actually
called every single night at 10:40, because Grandma said that I didn't need to
be out running the streets after eleven anyway. Kyle had the apartment two
doors down, and, well, the building superintendent decided that he liked the
way I looked. He was really putting the full-court press on me until one day,
when Kyle saw him corner me in the doorway and start to grope me... the guy's
probably still having a hard time with that arm.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

hardly - he said I was a stupid little rich girl who should have enough brains
to know when to stop something like that before it got out of control. I asked
him how I was supposed to do that, and he goes, 'Can you use your eyes? Can you
use your hands? Do you have money? Then you should have gone out, bought a gun
and shot the bastard when you saw him looking at you - and shoot him in the
chest, because then you could claim self-defense!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that's when we started to keep running into each other,&quot; she said.
&quot;Kyle was spending his time running between the Pentagon, the White House
and the Capital Building - when he wasn't just disappearing off the map for a
week or so every now and then. I'd seen him in the White House a couple of
times with some other military types to brief the President, and, well -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a deep red. &quot;It was kind of embarrassing when the First Lady and her
Secret Service detail came across us arguing in the Rose Garden and told us
that she tried to keep her dealings with her man from being a public spectacle.
Talk about 'famous last words'. Everybody in the place started trying to push
us together after that - and the people in our building? They all said that it
was obvious that we were interested in each other - and they got tired of the
sniping between us - so finally, they held a tenant's meeting, and when we
showed up, they locked us up together until we settled everything. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;And
things have been off and on ever since. I thought that we really had a chance
to make it legal, back in the summer of '96-&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;-But something happened and he got sent over to Europe.
I waited for him for over a year - he didn't even bother to call - and that's
when I met Brian. Kyle finally came back, we argued, I went home to Texas, they
both followed me, I kind of chose Kyle, Grandma wasn't happy about that and
chased him off, I married Brian - and here we all are.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Whoa - now that's a soap opera,&quot; Trent laughed, and
coughed as soda went up his nose! &quot;Thanks,&quot; he said, as Erin patted
him on the back and then offered him a napkin. &quot;With all of that going on,
how do you have time for a job?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

children's books. I do the 'Samantha Explores...' series - that's about a cat who
goes off to be an explorer, and learns all about different things, cities,
countries and cultures. I won two Peabody Awards, and my agent says that 'Nick
Jr.' is interested in making it into a show. I've also did a couple of other
books, and I'm working now on a novel - a historical romance about White House
pages back during World War II.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

dragging a memory out of storage. &quot;Samantha Explores The Capital'. My
niece and nephew read your books all the time... what's 'E.B.' stand for?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Erin Barksdale,&quot; she replied. &quot;Grandma always
did have pull. After a while, I figured that a pen name wasn't such a bad idea
after all, so I kept using it. It also makes Grandma feel special, so I milk
her for stuff whenever I need things.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;With any other man, I'd swear that was a proposition.
About a year ago, I decided that I 'needed' a new BMW. Grandma sprung for it -
and pays the bills on the gas card and the insurance.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Like I said - must be nice. Hey, Doc Kyle,&quot; Trent
said, looking over Erin's shoulder to see Kyle turn a corner and head for them.
&quot;You're not going to hit me again, are you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Trent, I'm sorry -&quot; Kyle began, but Trent cut him
off.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

wasn't even looking at him. &quot;Erin, I-&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Oh, no, you don't,&quot; she said, snapping at him.
&quot;An apology won't cut it this time. I'm getting something more out of this
than a few choruses of 'I'm sorry'. I want some trinkets. I want some dinner, I
want some flowers, and I want some serious romantic gestures out of you before
I forgive you!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Grovel or get cut off,&quot; she said simply. &quot;And
nights in the desert get really cold this time of the year...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

with?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Comments like that will not help you,&quot; Erin said,
turning and starting away. &quot;Let's go, Kyle. You have a lot of groveling to
do before we hit Chez Pierre...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

Trent...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Erin headed off, and Kyle turned back to Trent. &quot;I mean
it when I said that I'm sorry, Trent.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;If I were into that type, I'd be a little hyper
myself,&quot; Trent allowed. &quot;She's a nice girl, Doc Kyle, once you get
past the 'rich kid' attitude, but you've already done that. Just make sure that
you let her know you're there for her. She needs to know that somebody
is.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Got it,&quot; he replied. &quot;Oh - and one more thing.
I meant it when I said that I wasn't here to try and recruit your sister. I was
supposed to try for another girl, but I found out some things that made me
change my mind - and that won't get me busted down to a buck private when I
bring it before the board.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I need to tell you something else - and that's only
because you were in the program for five minutes or so,&quot; Kyle continued.
&quot;I understand you know the girl I was sent for. She's a little shaken up
by the last couple of weeks, because of the seminar, and because of the things
in her daily life, so -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Don't get ideas about popping me one, Trent. You were
atrocious in self-defense,&quot; Kyle cautioned. &quot;I said, 'was'. She
doesn't have any idea about the program - we didn't get that far.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;But you did do something, otherwise you probably wouldn't
be talking to me,&quot; Trent said. &quot;You probably want me to -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Be yourself,&quot; he said. &quot;Just be nice. You
don't have to worry about Morgendorffer - I believe that I've put everything
back in place. As far as I'm concerned, she's not going anywhere.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Kyle dropped coins into the soda machine, and selected a root
beer. &quot;I heard that she's got a crush on you. Now, I don't want you to
jump at her, but be just a little more -&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

against the wall, and saw the UPN Network promotional poster for 'Seven Days'
on the inside of the kiosk that served as Upchuck's computer area. &quot;I
can't believe you got all of these people to work together on this idea,
Charles. It's just so amazing - and the money you spent -!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

not about the money, it's the people that matter,&quot; Upchuck said. &quot;I
just wish Jodie was going to be here... I hope they find the slimes that gave her
the drugs. I'd pay someone to take them into the prison laundry and - You've
never seen 'The Shawshank Redemption', have you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Yes,&quot;
Stacy said, stepping back from the mean look that crossed Upchuck's face for a
moment. &quot;Charles, you wouldn't really do something like that, would
you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I was
wondering who would play me, if all of us were the people in 'Seven
Days'?&quot; he said, letting Stacy's question slide unanswered. &quot;I
wonder...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I know
who the main characters would be!&quot; Stacy exclaimed, bouncing onto the huge
four-post bed. &quot;We'd have Claire Forlani play Sandi, because she's
beautiful, slender and has great eyes, but she can be serious and mean - she's
the 'Donovan' character! Reese Witherspoon could play Brittany as 'Ramsey', the
security chief, and Jason Biggs could be Ted, who's the boy version of 'Olga'!

see Brittany as Ramsey, because they're clueless, but they're nice deep down and
they're good at what they do! Sandi as Donovan - that's easy, she takes being
President of the Fashion Club so seriously - and look at the way Ted and Jane
have been looking at each other lately!&quot; Stacy said, tossing a pillow at
him. &quot;That makes it perfect for Rachel Leigh Cook to be Jane's version of
'Frank Parker', since you've always wanted her to be your first choice for
chrononaut.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

giant 'nude demon' mural. &quot;Oh, my,&quot; she gasped, looking in awe at the
sight. &quot;That is - it's just... Oh, my.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

know,&quot; Bronwyn said, absolute pride in her voice as she watched Helen
begin to move about the room, looking at Upchuck's paintings. &quot;My baby boy
has skills. He's got this silly little dream about going to Harvard and being a
scientist, or perhaps flying in the Air Force - It's not going to happen. He is
NOT going to waste his time and talent sitting in some laboratory, or in a
fighter plane playing like Tom Cruise. He's going to be an artist, and the
world is going to see just how wonderful my Little Charles is.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

understand that,&quot; Helen allowed, looking at the incredible portrait of
Bronwyn and her husband. &quot;Any of these works could go for thousands - tens
of thousands, if you cared to sell them!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;The
mural's got a standing offer for four million from some half-crazy producer out
in L.A. We had the works appraised last year, and they accidentally were put on
display - the lowest bid was two hundred K, for the fractal,&quot; Bronwyn
said. &quot;However, the Prime Minister of Columbia REALLY wants that mural. If
the war on drugs goes a little better for the U.S., I told him that my Little
Charles might be amenable towards selling, or even taking on a special
commission - for our friends down south.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

has their price - and legal tender isn't the only coin of exchange. We want to
put a factory on the ground down there to service our Latin American interests,
the government wants to show results in their silly little drug war, and the
Prime Minister wants to show he has a taste for original works of art. Business
on the global scale - you'd be surprised at what gets the wheels greased... or
maybe you wouldn't. In any case - if your girls travel, make sure that they
watch their steps in the Asian countries... and steer clear of the Middle East.
They like their Western women over there... they like them down on their

what her partner was about to do - and just what Denise's gun was capable of
doing. A special-commission weapon that was custom-built to hold six rounds
instead of the traditional five thumb-sized rounds the Casull was known for,
the all-titanium version of the most powerful production pistol on Earth was
built to handle a combination of specialized - and HIGHLY illegal - types of
ammunition she kept locked away in her desk. Denise referred to it (when she
mentioned it at all to Lindy) as her 'DS Gun', after the weapons from the novel
'Logan's Run'. Only Lindy knew she had it; she got it just after she came out
of the Marines, where she spent three years as an MP, and cost her almost a
full year's salary. It was, Denise said, for 'special situations - when her
.357 SigSauer P239 semi-automatic pistol just wasn't gun enough.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

friends' who were still in the military. These were handloaded rounds, full
metal jacket, and jacked up to the ballistic maximum that the .454 was capable
of handling. Known as 'SABER rounds' (after the violently apocalyptic super-pistol
used by Raymond Steele in the 'Left Behind' books), each round was so powerful
that even the air pressure from the shell's passage could maim... a good two feet
from the point of impact.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

land one, every now and then... of course, he is only seventeen, and we
Ruttheimers usually start taking serious scalps once we're in our twenties... You
know, if you don't want Little Charles whoring around the globe like Wilt
Chamberlain on a bet, you might want to ease up on this girl and let him decide

coming around with her pretty little face and her dimples, and eyes so big that
they should have their own zip code, and she's just SO innocent and just SO in
need of someone to just be there for her, because no one else cares. She'll
have him eating and sleeping and living to help her, to make everything right
in her tortured little life - and then he'll fall in love with her, because men
just have to fall for the women that they rescue...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

hurt ESPECIALLY because he doesn't have money and the new guy in line's a trust

finding Marlene hanging by an extension cord tied to the shower head in the
bath, Sebastion (according to the jailhouse interview) calmly made himself a
cup of oolong tea, fixed a cucumber sandwich with the crusts cut away, and
waited in the living room with the double-barreled twelve-gauge he used every
year to take a fresh turkey for his family's Thanksgiving celebration...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

NO MORE WEAK WOMEN. I am NOT going to lose my child or anyone else to shrinking
violets who can't stand up for themselves, and suck everyone around them into
Hell when they finally realize that the best thing that they can do for Society

You're a really attractive girl who's cloistered herself in 'Teen Queen
Advertising Hell', staring off into space - probably because your boyfriend
didn't give you the right tennis bracelet - so you came here to binge and purge
with the help of Daddy's money. You saw THAT outfit - where you got it from in
here I'll NEVER know - and probably decided to get it to make fun of all the
girls who don't go through the fashion magazine racks the way most people go to
church.&quot; The boy shuddered. &quot;Instead of doing something worthwhile,
you're probably in some weird club where everybody sits around and decides
stuff like what the right lipstick and mascara you should wear that goes with
gym shoes. No - you're probably more worried about how to stack guys up and
make each one think you're only with him, so you'll never be without a
date!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

standing still in the middle of the floor. &quot;What? What's wrong?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was blank, devoid of anything. &quot;Oh, what's wrong? Did I hurt little
Jennifer's or Alison's or Heather's feelings? Did I make her feel bad about
pissing away someone else's hard-earned money so she could have all the other
girls tell her how pretty she is? Did Daddy's little princess have an attack of
conscience - I know that's a big word, but it means 'the little voice that's

nothing to - look, I'm sorry-&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

family, by their looks) appeared from between a row of clothing with large
sacks in her arms. &quot;I was just talking to -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

said. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

her clothes? You should've been!&quot; was the sarcastic reply Elsie Sloane

exchange that 'I'm so above it all' attitude for one that works! Hey, wait a

thought so - but now, since you've been behaving like a good little boy, they
gave you the silver Corvette with all the extras,&quot; she reminded him.
&quot;Wave goodbye to the geek girl who doesn't even have sense enough to wear
Danners because she's stuck on the 'Doc Martens is the boot for the 'out crowd'

settled over him. It was Rod Serling-strange; it was a morbid feeling, as
though he had just missed something very important, like a train or a plane,
only to find out that he was to die on it or was to meet the love of his life -
and now, he held within himself an emptiness that momentarily made his stomach
a bottomless pit of despair -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

snarled, turning on the younger man with a true fury. &quot;In case you haven't
noticed it lately - you are not a fucking musician. Musicians - REAL musicians
- are brave souls willing to put it on the line for themselves and their craft,
grow from the experiences and then share them with the world! You're just a
man-bitch who mumbles into a mike and pisses a little of his soul away every
time he gets on stage and tries to fool himself into thinking that he's got
something deep to say and needs to do it to music!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Trent froze. &quot;Cyber-jock, operative, lord of crypto,
math-god - you had opportunities that most people would kill or die to realize.
You could have done something REAL. Something worthwhile - something that has
meaning - something that could have helped you grow as a person and led to
bigger things for yourself and the people around you!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Like you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>The young man suddenly found himself hoisted off his feet,
gasping for breath as Kyle, angrier than Trent had ever seen, had him suspended
by a hand around his neck that just as well could have been made of iron! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;That's two. If that accusation comes out of your mouth
ever again, it will be the last thing that ever does,&quot; Kyle spoke in that
calm voice that brought fear even out of people like Janet Barch - and which
made onlookers decide that they, in fact, didn't see anything out of the
ordinary. &quot;You could have made a contribution. It didn't have to be in the
Program or even the service - and yes, I'd have been happy if you'd chosen that
route. Even if it really were just to go out and make a difference through
music, I would have respected your decision because you actually were going
somewhere for something worthwhile and actually making an effort. But then
again, you think it's better to lie out on a funky mattress with crusted
sheets, sleeping your life away and not even having the drive and desire to at
least be a decent example to your sister, who you supposedly stayed out of the
program for.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Kyle looked Trent directly in the eye. &quot;So tell me, big
brother - what have you done on your sister's behalf lately, besides suck down
her money and any chance of her looking at you with respect for what you've
done with your day? Yeah - that's what I thought.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>The lack of respect in Kyle's face and tone made Trent wilt
inside, and he didn't look up to face his former instructor even after Kyle let
him down. &quot;Come on. I'll give you a ride home so you can get back to
what's really important to you - your bed.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I can have my partner do that,&quot; a voice spoke up,
and Kyle glanced sideways to see Denise Riker leaning against a wall. &quot;We
need to talk about you roughing people up in plain sight.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;If you'd really wanted to see me, Riker, you'd have come
to say something after you read about Jodie Landon and my seminar,&quot; Kyle
said bluntly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I didn't say 'ask you to talk' - <u>sir</u>,&quot;
Denise said, her tone equally blunt. &quot;We will have words. We will do it
here, or we will do it in a Class Five holding cell that Uncle Sam thoughtfully
provided the county two years ago. In either case - we will have words.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Riker, don't threaten me. Forget about all of the legal
things or the rank or anything else - just consider one thing.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Kyle turned to face Denise fully. &quot;If I don't choose to,
you couldn't force me if you tried,&quot; he continued, and Lindy, off to the
side, looked at Kyle's eyes and suddenly felt the need to check and see if her
gun was still there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;After all - I have more ways to kill you than you have
ways to die.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Don't start with me, sir,&quot; Denise said, and Lindy
was truly surprised to see that she was wearing the .454 Casull. &quot;One
shot, one kill - and you know I was the best shooter in the program's
history.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Kyle shook his head sadly. &quot;For some reason, they all
want to pretend that Aki Ward never walked through the door...&quot; He looked
up and fastened an imperious stare on Denise. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;And this frightens me because...?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Dude, try talking peace instead of kicking ass,&quot;
Trent said, going over to Lindy. &quot;Your friend said that you'd give me a
ride...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>As Lindy led Trent away, Denise came over and looked Kyle
right in the eye. &quot;Sir, you know the rules - no going meta-active in view
of the public!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;The boy weighs barely one-fifty - I was pissed off, not
crazy.&quot; Kyle looked at the gold shield on the woman's belt. &quot;I see
congratulations are in order.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Screw you, sir,&quot; Denise replied. &quot;First - you
put your hands on someone like that again, and I run you in on felony assault.
No joke, and you do time under the Kelly Act.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;You should really wake up now, First Sergeant. Save the
tough talk for the jaywalkers and double-parking types who've never been to a
'camp of strict regime.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Denise let the challenge go unanswered. &quot;Second - I need
anything that you can find out about Jodie Landon, the kids she hangs with,
anything like that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;What's up?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I can't tell you right now, sir-&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;You mean that you won't.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Just keep your eyes open and tell me about any of the
strange things that you see the kids do.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;It's high school. Strange is what they're all
about.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Whatever. I got you that report - you owe me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;You got that for me because those are the rules,&quot;
he stated bluntly. &quot;If I see anything, Three/Ten, I'll let you know. Call
me in a couple of days-&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Denise glowered at him as she viciously cut him off.
&quot;Don't ever call me that again, sir. I'll help you and you'll help me
because, like you said, those are the rules - but don't ever call me
that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>The woman got directly in Kyle's face. &quot;You may still be
Delphi, but you are no longer POGO. You need to remember that, sir. You... are
not one of us.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Denise turned and left Kyle without a backward glance.
&quot;Oh, well,&quot; Kyle replied, taking a long, deep breath. &quot;It's not
as though I expected anything different from any of them...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

daddy,&quot; Quinn said innocently, as she looked up from the couch as Jake
came in. &quot;I'm okay - nobody's been here to make me soup, or squeeze
oranges so I can have some juice-&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

is everyone?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Well,
Mom hasn't come home yet, and Daria's little friend's brother and a teacher
came by looking for her earlier,&quot; she told him, putting her copy of 'E!
Entertainment Television Presents 'Rivers of Agony: Joan and Melissa on
Hollywood's Fashion Flubs and Firestorms'. &quot;I guess she's in some sort of
trouble, or something.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Because
of what?&quot; Jake was still sore about Daria's no-show at the taping, and
hadn't had a chance to talk to her about it. &quot;Does this have anything to
do with Daria's not being here last night-?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;No -
they probably wanted to talk to her because of what happened yesterday,&quot;
Quinn told him. &quot;Sandi and Daria are both in that seminar that everyone's
so crazy about, but yesterday, Daria said something to Sandi so Sandi jumped
all down her throat and told her that she was a person who didn't care about
anyone and called her 'the Queen of Misery', then somebody slipped Jodie Landon
some drugs and SHE went crazy and chased Sandi down and tried to choke her to
death before the drugs messed her up and put her in the hospital so the teacher
must want to talk to Daria because she was there but even if she was there then
I don't know why her friend's brother was there because I know Daria likes him
but why would he come along unless he's a narc but then I would have heard
about it but it does explain why his band's music sucks -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;HELEN!&quot;
Jake cried out as his wife opened the front door (and leaned on it somewhat
unsteadily for a moment or so) and walked into the house. &quot;Quinn said that
there's a drug problem over at the school, one of Daria's friends OD'd and
THAT'S why Daria wasn't here last night - and you were supposed to come down to
the station to file a complaint on that cop! Where were you, Helen? I waited
there for you for HOURS-&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Mom,
that Eric guy left a LOT of messages on the answering machine, and the people
from all of the news stations called to ask you about why you hate Lauriel so
much -&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That piece of
information made Jake's head snap around; Quinn sneezed into her tissues and
kept going. &quot; -And both Jodie's and Sandi's moms called to talk to you.
Sandi nearly got choked to death by Jodie yesterday while Jodie was high, and
now both of the moms want some legal advice on what they should do next -&quot;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Helen didn't
say a word; she simply made her way to the stairwell and started up the stairs
- but stopped at the first step and turned to her family. &quot;Jake - I don't
really feel like dealing with your boring, childish antics or your infantile
attitude right now,&quot; she said, and Quinn drew back from the look that
appeared on her father's face. &quot;I am going to bed, and I really don't care
to be bothered. I have to think about a very important opportunity that came my
way today, so I'll take care of all of those problems so you won't have to
worry - and so you won't screw everything up. I will talk to both of you
tomorrow.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Something in Helen's voice - the casually arrogant,
self-righteous and callous tone that came through when she was really drunk,
and reminded both Jake and Quinn of Helen's mother - kept both of them quiet as
Helen disappeared up the stairs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I think we can talk to your mother tomorrow
morning,&quot; Jake said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Okay, Dad.&quot; Quinn said as she slid off the couch
and headed upstairs, her eyes now widening with fear as she took the steps
three at a time. She saw how Jake watched Helen as she went up, and she knew
that life in the Morgendorffer household - for her parents, herself and even Daria
- were about to change... and, Quinn feared, for the worst.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Quinn grew up watching her parents' relationship and knew that
her mother was the dominant one in the mix, but unlike Helen, Quinn had chosen
to deal with the dimmer sex with a velvet glove. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Better to let them think that they're superior and 'let them
lead' - lead right where you wanted them to go. I mean, the three J's do
ANYTHING I ask! <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>I looked once in one of Stacy's science fiction books, and the
woman in the book had it right. 'Unless you intend to kill him immediately
thereafter, never kick a man in the balls. Not even symbolically. Or perhaps
especially not symbolically.' Mom's always held herself and everything that she
does over Dad's head - but she's NEVER treated him like that before. I love
you, Mom - but you don't deal with men that way. It's only going to make them
mad, and competitive, and horny - and if you do THAT, it means that sooner or
later, they're going to do WHATEVER they can to show that they still are men!
They'll usually do the worst thing possible if a woman insults their manhood -
and the worst thing they usually come up with is getting drunk and either
getting in a fight somewhere or sleeping with another woman!<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>You jumped on him about Lauriel last night - why push Dad in
that direction by telling him that he's not a man in your eyes and never has
been?<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Mom - what you did just doesn't make any sense. You just all
but told Daddy that he's worthless and that you don't need him for anything
important. Why you would basically show Daddy the door and tell him that you
really don't care if he uses it makes no sense - especially if there's a pretty
girl possibly in the wings to take YOUR place? What's going on, Mom? Did
something happen that makes you think that you don't need Daddy anymore?<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Mom - what are you doing? Do you WANT Daddy to walk out on
you?<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>A thought went through Quinn's mind that made her go cold all
over.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>No - you're sneakier than that... you're like Sandi. You'd do
stuff to make Daddy do something stupid, so you could do mean things to him and
feel like you're doing the right thing because 'he hurt you'. That's really
sleazy, Mom - and it's one of the lawyer tricks I've seen you do all of your
life, and what did you say when you came in -<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
