about like a Borg drone - aware, but completely unresponsive to the presumption
of her younger sibling's entrance into the room as she collected items for her
morning at school, &quot;Please, Daria - it's about Mom and Dad. You have to
talk to me: I think that something's going to happen.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The redhead
took a trio of steps back as she placed her hand on Daria's arm and was met
with a spirit-rending glance that made her skip a breath. &quot;What's going
on, Daria?&quot; she asked, and she stopped as Daria took a step towards her.
&quot;What's happened to you lately? I always thought that you were acting
weird and everything ABOUT everything, but at least YOU didn't act like you
thought I was right! Lately, you're like somebody that people see on TV that do
all sorts of weird militia stuff at their schools! You don't do any school
stuff, even your homework, and you don't hang out with your weird little friend
even though she's always trying to catch up with you! You don't go to that
pizza place - the people at school say that they don't ever see you, so you
must be cutting classes! You don't even write weird stories about that girl
that kills Communists, or go on the Internet, or watch TV anymore - not even
that strange show with the eye at the beginning!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Daria started
to move past Quinn - but to her surprise and even more to Quinn's, the redhead
stepped directly in front of Daria, blocking her way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Everybody knows that you're not very sociable, and going
to family things with you is ALWAYS weird, but NOW you act like you're not even
in our family anymore! Don't you see that something's wrong with Mom and Dad?
Don't you even CARE? What's going on that's making you this way? My God, Daria
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>There was silence as Daria stood silently, looking at Quinn
with an emptiness in her eyes that reminded her of a statue she saw in a film
about Egypt. She made no move to go around Quinn, or push her away; she just
stood there, unmoving and uncaring about the world around her...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>A sneeze broke the silence, and as Quinn instinctively turned
away to wipe her nose, Daria walked past and down the hall without a single
word. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

almost uncaring about the listless expression on her face. <i>This is what it
feels like to lose your best friend,</i> she thought to herself. <i>Damnit,
Daria - could you just once act like a normal person? Just once - why can't you
say 'my friends are more important than my own damned pride?' Just once,
couldn't you just say 'I need you to be there for me, Jane?'<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

friend and I love her dearly, but damnit, why does she have to be so damned
high-maintenance? Right now, there's some guy out there, somewhere between the
ages of fifteen to thirty, living his life in relative peace and <u>blissfully</u>
unaware of the hurricane named Daria that's going to hit his coast in about ten
years! Man, can she be a pain in the butt!<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

Miller said it best: 'In a nutshell, a friend is someone who can see through
your external surface bullshit to the deeper and more profound bullshit that
lies within.' Let's face facts - Daria's a bitch-queen on wheels who just has
the volume set on low... but I'm cool with that. After all- she's my friend.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

O'Neill leaned against the door of the Teacher's Lounge, serious concern in his
eyes. &quot;Tell me that you didn't torch his apartment!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

accidentally knocked the iron over into his bed when I went to fix breakfast,
and a little fire started,&quot; Claire said, a touch less lilt in her voice as
she continued to sip her hot jasmine tea with fresh lemon drops. &quot;There
wasn't any real harm done...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I'm
sure Anthony would have agreed - if he hadn't been in the bed at the time!
Claire, what happened?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Going over to
Claire, Timothy all but oozed heartfelt concern as he sat next to her. &quot;I
know that you've been looking for your relationship with Anthony to move
forward - did something happen?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;He had
been planning on going out with someone else,&quot; she answered. &quot;I went
over, I checked the voicemail, because sometimes I get messages at his place,
and he was talking to - can we not talk about it?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;You'll
hear about it soon, Claire. I heard a couple of students mention it when I came
into the building this morning. It's the latest bit of gossip, so expect plenty
of stares today.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Speaking
of gossip - have you heard about your favorite student? I don't think she's
doing too well lately...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Timothy
nodded. &quot;I just don't understand Daria, Claire. I thought that an
opportunity like the seminar would be perfect for someone like her to show
everyone what she's got - unfold her wings and allow an instructor like Dr.
Armalin to help her soar! That way, she can end the year on a positive note
that'll allow for good feelings and memories for herself and the other
students!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>He sighed. &quot;I must admit that Daria is truly an unusual
child, but perhaps she'll come to the realization that being around others and
having people around who care about you isn't necessarily a bad thing! She
pushes everyone away!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I think that she needs help beyond what we can give her
here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Both Claire and Timothy jumped with surprise at the sound of
the voice, and they spun around to see Dr. Margaret Manson rise up from the
couch near the windows. She shook out her thick, heavy mane of oak-brown hair,
set off with a pronounced gray streak in the right side, and smoothed her skirt
down over a quite attractive and shapely pair of legs as she sat up. &quot;I've
been reading some of the material that Kyle's forwarded to Ms. Li, and we've
talked a bit. I have to say -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Kyle?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Dr. Armalin - he does have a first name,&quot; Margaret
smiled. &quot;I think he's right. She's never been happy here at Lawndale High
- or in Lawndale, period. She needs something more... and she needs it now.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;You've actually spent time with him?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;We're not dating - I'm married, remember? We're just two
professionals in the same line of work that talk a bit,&quot; she said,
brushing the comment off. &quot;Besides, even if I were to stray, it wouldn't
be with him. He's a little too young, and he's not really my type... too forward
and aggressive, and a little too sure about himself. We hit the bars every now
and then, get something to eat, and we talk about things.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Margaret, while I've never been one to gossip, I for one
wouldn't mind learning a bit more about Dr. Armalin -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Then invite him out to lunch someday,&quot; a voice from
behind said, and Timothy gasped as a hand clasped down on his shoulder. &quot;I
like raw meat - we can grab a couple of swords and head on out to the pasture,
Timmy-boy... or I'll just take you out there, all alone. Talking behind my back,
are you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Timothy squeaked and went flying out the door on a wave of
terrified sobs as Kyle and Margaret watched with amusement. &quot;Oh,
dear,&quot; Claire sighed, &quot;I'd better go and get him before classes
start...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Claire whisked herself out the door as Margaret looked over
the rims of her glasses at Kyle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;All right, Kyle - what do you want?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Mags, I don't understand what you're saying!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;You scared Timothy off so you could ask me
something,&quot; Margaret said, leaning on the back of the couch. &quot;What do
you need?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Most people would say 'a clue', but for now...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt;margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The school psychologist suddenly focused her full
attention on her academic peer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt;margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Are we being serious now, Kyle?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt;margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;As a heart attack.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt;margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Then come on over here - we can get into the
closet.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Kyle's ears pricked up with interest, and he was about to
speak when Margaret put her finger to her lips and rose from the couch. As Kyle
watched, she went to the wall, winked at him - and peeled back a 'permanently
mounted' photo of Ms. Li to reveal a microphone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I love what you've got to hold the door closed, Doctor
Armalin.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>She laughed at the look on her fellow psychologist's face and
guided him out the door of the lounge, closing the door with a silence and an
ease that would make a cat burglar weep with pride. &quot;She loves to listen
in,&quot; Margaret let him know as they moved away from the door. &quot;So,
what do you want?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I'd appreciate it if you could creatively misfile Daria
Morgendorffer's psych evaluations, and everything else you have on her.&quot;
Kyle asked. &quot;That is, if someone from the media comes looking, or if
somebody who should know better asks for her records just so they can
'accidentally' leave them out for the tabloid crowd...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt;margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Are you expecting something to go wrong
here, Kyle?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I don't expect anything, Mags... but still, if you've got
sick time - take it all, starting the second you leave today. If you don't,
take it anyway. As far as everyone's concerned - you're really down with the
flu, or a virus, or O.P.P. - I don't care.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Margaret looked over her glasses at Kyle, her eyes now
beginning to show a touch of wariness. &quot;You really don't want me around
here, do you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;If I was really worried, I'd escort you out the door and
to your car right this second -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Or better yet, we should both go straight to the main offices,&quot;
Margaret said. &quot;Remember that if - God forbid - anything happens. Ms. Li
has turned that section into a fortress! You'd need a tank gun to shoot through
the windows in the office or just to get in after she locks it down - and who
knows what she's got back in her offices, or the school safe... She really
believes in security here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I noticed,&quot; Kyle replied. &quot;I've been on
military bases that were easier to move around.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to lay on you, and after you make her wipe your boots clean with her hair, we
can all have fun with this seminar! After we're done with the project, I hear
Charles is going to have a big party to celebrate at his parents' house. I have
to say that he's going to be going all the way out, if what he's got playing

you're one of the smartest people here at Lawndale - so with you aboard, we can
say that ANYTHING we come up with is because of your help! Come on - Miss Nobel

believe that you're going to come out of here and DO THINGS. You gotta come

Schedule a meeting with Miss Morgendorffer's parents. Also, due to Miss

Kyle snapped. &quot;You think that you're the only person to see-saw their way
through what could have been a great relationship but screwed it up because you
didn't move when you should've? You think that you've got <i>carte blanche</i>
to feel sorry for yourself because just as you decide to let that certain
someone know how you feel, you take a faceful of rejection and hurt? Do you
really think that <u>you've</u> cornered the market on that feeling of pain
that seems to strip out all of your insides and sit there as a hard lump right
inside your gut? I know how that feels, lady. I know how it feels like it's
going to just blow right out of you every time afterward when you see that
person, or hear their voice, or just think about them and know that they're
going to be with someone else. Don't you think that I know EXACTLY how it feels
to have the love of your life enjoying life, and love, and passion in someone
else's arms -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

damned thing about it, no matter how much you want - because you can't make
people love you. You've got two choices, Morgendorffer. Just like I had - just
like everyone has. One is in that room, right through that door. Those people
want to be there for you - if you let them. The other-&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

Alone. Drive on - and do it on your own. &quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

&quot;Fine. Just thought that you should know: the lifepod event begins
sometime tomorrow... and I <u>will</u> fail you if you don't complete the

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Daria turned and started away. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Have you read 'The Stand', Miss Morgendorffer?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Turning back, Daria eyed Kyle strangely. &quot;Of
course.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Then you must know how much you resemble the character
of Harold Emery Lauder,&quot; he said. &quot;In the novel, Harold is a flawed
person who comes to an end that he by no means deserved, but that he brought
upon himself nonetheless.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Kyle walked up to Daria. &quot;The greatest of Harold Emery
Lauder's flaws was that he couldn't accept the good opinions of others towards
him in what was basically a new world, and a second chance for everyone there
to reinvent themselves. He felt that, sooner or later, the ghosts of his
persecutors from before would rise again to torment him - and even if they
didn't, he was never going to forgive them and let go of his own feelings.
Maybe he felt that if he forgave them, they wouldn't be punished the way they
deserved. Maybe he thought that he was betraying himself in some fashion if he
put it all behind himself and became 'the Hawk' - the capable, able man that
many others were learning to respect.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>He looked her directly in the eye. &quot;And maybe, just maybe
- he did what he did because he simply made a choice. A choice not because of
his past, or his pain, or because of some esoteric rationale - but a plain,
simple choice to be who he was.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Did anyone ever tell you that you're very long-winded,
and somewhat dramatic when you should be just plain-spoken and get to the
point?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Kyle looked like he wanted to make a very nasty retort, but
instead, he just shook his head. &quot;If who you are now is what you always
plan to be, and if this is simply because you choose to be this way - then do
those around you a favor and let them know, so they can have some sort of
resolution in their lives. You do owe them that much, Daria. You owe them the
chance to move on, and have lives of their own.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Daria watched as the instructor started off down the hallway,
but stopped and turned back to face her. &quot;Oh, and since we've decided to
take the liberty of speaking freely, Miss Morgendorffer,&quot; he said, drawing
himself up in a manner that sent a flow of ice down Daria's back, &quot;I will
afford you the same. Pray that you never meet me when I am plain-spoken and to
the point - and if you don't believe in God, ask someone to pray for you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

echoed through the cordless phone. &quot;She's so much like Sandi - but she's
bigger... and she's louder... and she has all of that red hair! I think that she
wants to hurt me, Quinn - I really do!&quot;<br>
<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Stacy, I think that
you're being a little overdramatic,&quot; Quinn said, sniffling into a handful

planning on anything long-term, or permanent, or anything like that...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>A knock on Quinn's door caught her attention, and Helen stuck
her head into the room. &quot;Hello, Quinn!&quot; she said, holding up a tray
as she came in. &quot;I brought you something for a late lunch - I figured that
with your cold, you've probably been sleeping all day and really haven't felt
like having anything, but you really should eat...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Stacy, I'll talk to you later, okay?&quot; Quinn said,
sitting up in her bed. &quot;Because my mom's here, alright? Bye...&quot; She
hung up the phone. &quot;I'm not hungry. Daddy had lunch sent over to me from
Lauriel's restaurant - I mean, Chez Pierre.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Helen took a moment to calm herself from the unanticipated
verbal swipe. &quot;Well, I'll just sit it here on your dresser - you can have
it later, but you really should eat while it's warm -&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Mom - you're going to get Dad to mess around with

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Helen would later recall that she had never been blindsided as
badly in her entire life - not by an opposing lawyer, not by a client, or by a
man - as Quinn had just done.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

&quot;-But I know some things. Mom - don't you love Dad anymore?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Then why are you doing things that'll make him want to
leave - or just find someone else? Mom - the taping was important to him! He
wanted us there, and he was - Daddy was important to those people! They
listened to him... they had -&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

they had respect for Daddy! I should have known that Daria wasn't going to

you didn't show up! And then later, when you burst in like Heather Locklear or
Susan Lucci and accused Lauriel of doing all sorts of things with Daddy - Mom,
how can any of those people want to have any respect for Daddy when you make it
just as plain as day that you don't?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Quinn, I think that you're not feeling well, and you're
imagining things that aren't there,&quot; Helen said, controlling her voice and
her temper with effort. &quot;I love and respect your father more than any man
that I've ever met.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

worthless?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;Then you're not going to try to get Dad to leave you, so
you can divorce him and say it's all his fault?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

your wife would think that it's just a smokescreen so you and she could sneak

deep breath and steadied herself. News about certain people in Lawndale
traveled like a firestorm (okay, gossip), and Helen's new job was the immediate
topic of conversation AND concern among those in the know... More than a few
individuals shuddered, feeling that the teaming of two women like Helen
Morgendorffer and Bronwyn Ruttheimer was an action easily seen as - portentous...
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Also, with the newfound wealth Helen would certainly acquire
as Bronwyn's personal attorney (or 'consigliere', given the tactics Bronwyn was
said to use in her business dealings), she would have the financial power to
cause no end of grief to the power base that Angela had come to see Lawndale
High as. The high school was a successful, nationally ranked institution
(because of her efforts, of course) - but a vengeful, wealthy Helen
Morgendorffer could bring her plans to a screaming halt...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

tell her everything about her prized baby kit - besides, Angela reasoned

Morgendorffer, I'm afraid that the troubles with your daughter may be far
greater than you were led to believe,&quot; Angela replied, the gravity of her
tone resonating through Helen's receiver. &quot;Daria, as I'm sure you're aware
of, had been selected to participate in an exclusive academic seminar here at -
LAWNDALE HIGH, which is being taught this semester by a educator and
psychologist of national caliber and renown. With the intellectual prowess that
she has demonstrated, Daria should have been the star of the seminar.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;For
some reason, Daria has proven resistant towards inclusion in the seminar. She
refuses to participate in the class discussions - except to lash out with her
own brand of venomous scorn towards everything about her, she hasn't made an
effort to exert herself beyond the minimum needed for a satisfactory grade, and
she doesn't attempt to bond with the others in the class.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;A
couple of days ago, she was involved in a verbal altercation with several
members of the class,&quot; Angela continued, grateful beyond words that the
subzero tone Helen's voice held was in no way meant for her. &quot;As you know,
due to the latest incidents at schools across the country and the possible
causes of these unfortunate tragedies, we here at LAWNDALE HIGH have adopted a
'zero tolerance' policy towards all forms of intimidation, be it verbal,
physical or mental. To be honest - the teachers who were in the vicinity were
not certain that this incident fell under the zero tolerance policy, as it
occurred during an independent study session for the seminar. I can assure you,
however, that those teachers have been reprimanded for not taking the
initiative and stepping in.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Ever
since that incident, it has come to my attention that Daria has either been
skipping the seminar, or avoiding school altogether. I myself came upon her
earlier today; she had opted to skip the seminar meeting session in favor of
sleeping in the library! When I questioned her about her reasons for not being
in the session, she became insolent, uncooperative and quite flippant with her
responses!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Angela took a deep breath and plunged forward. &quot;I must
inform you that I am quite worried about the possible aftereffects of her
current behavior upon her academic future, Mrs. Morgendorffer. QUITE WORRIED.
If her behavior does not conform to school standards IMMEDIATELY, then I must
tell you that I can not in good conscience overlook her actions - even though
she is by far one of the most talented and potentially influential minds ever
to grace the halls of LAWNDALE HIGH. &quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Morgendorffer - I admit that, in the past, we have had our differences.
However, I would be remiss in my duties and my charge as an educator if I let
anything stand in my way of attempting to ensure that a potentially superior
intellect such as your daughter's is nourished and allowed to bloom to its
fullest. My wish is for Daria to become a premiere academic talent - but I
strongly caution you that, unless decisive, overt steps are taken without
delay... &quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

other end of the conversation...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

course,&quot; Angela said, marveling at how she managed to keep every bit of
triumph out of her voice. &quot;In fact, I was planing on having a special
conference with several members of the Lawndale High faculty to discuss this.
If you and Mr. Morgendorffer would care to attend, your input would be more
than welcomed.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

- thank you for taking an interest in your daughter's academic career. Most
parents simply shuttle their children off to the schools as though we were a
daycare center.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

stop it, Erin. You're almost as bad as your mother!&quot; Helen teased her
niece. &quot;Anyway, your Uncle Jake wasn't in the service - and he was a lot
more sensitive and intelligent than some of yours. I recall hearing about the
football player from A &amp; M who nearly choked and hung himself on the
extension ladder when he tried to get up to your room - and then there was the
boy who got himself hired as Mother's personal assistant so he could be close
to you. Whatever happened to him, anyway?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to be sorely disappointed if she's thinking about giving me a surprise birthday
party and letting her old boy-toy film it,&quot; Helen said. &quot;I'll have to
call her and tell her that I've always hated surprises. Speaking of surprises,
what about that Marine that followed you all the way back from Washington? I
can still remember Mother telling me about the smart mouth on that one; he
actually carried himself as though he could do more than hold a rifle!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

keep the grimace off her face, but her cheeks flushed slightly as she answered.
&quot;He was a Marine pilot, got promoted to full colonel at thirty AND had
gotten his Ph.D. two years earlier, Aunt Helen. He wasn't a dummy.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Oh, a

comic books to the other Marines and translated the episodes of 'Zena' for
them.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Erin decided
to change the topic: she knew her aunt had a lingering resentment of some
things military and all things Marine because of her father-in-law. &quot;So,
how's everything here at the Fortress Morgendorffer? How's Daria and
Quinn?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Quinn's
upstairs - and Daria's off somewhere. She's supposed to be in this high-powered
seminar at her school that's reserved for the best students, but for some
reason - God only knows what it is THIS time - she's rebelling against the
whole thing and refusing to participate.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;You
certainly seem eager to defend that waste of sheepskin - that Marine with the
doctorate - especially since you haven't seen him in a couple of years,&quot;
Helen said, abruptly shifting gears in the conversation. &quot;Who's your
friend here in town, Erin?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

again. Helen could smell blood in the waters of any conversation and sure
enough, her dorsal fin was riding high in the water; the fact that Helen didn't
want to discuss Jake and skewed the conversation away from him never occurred
to her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I just realized that your mother and your grandmother
didn't call to mention you'd be in town, and they always do. That means that
you didn't tell them you were coming here - so, who's your friend... and what
does he do?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

always call back home to Rutherford, Erin, and have Mother and Rita come up for
a family dinner. That should give everybody enough time to clear their

syrup,&quot; a bleary-eyed Quinn said, sitting down on the top step. &quot;I've
got some sort of bug; it should go away soon enough.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

even though my eyes hurt, they still work - so I don't even want to comment on
that dress you're wearing,&quot; the redhead continued, looking her cousin
over. &quot;Married life makes your fashion choices go downhill, doesn't
it?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

tossed something on, Quinn,&quot; Erin said. &quot;Jeez, give me a break. You
don't have to dress like a fashion plate every single day, all right?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

writes the culinary page in the local rag decided to come in today and sample
the broiled shrimp in garlic sauce, not to mention gazing at you like a lost
puppy,&quot; he continued, taking a moment to sample a cracker and a spoon of
foie gras. &quot;Apparently, he approves highly of your cooking and your looks.
You should meet more married men so that their wives can also call you 'bitch'.

resembled the mixing and premature birth of a scream, a whimper and a
near-orgasmic grunt. He collapsed upon the kitchen floor into a furiously
tightening ball of white-hot pain expanding out from his crotch, tears flowing
freely as he tried to recover from the perfectly-executed strike to his groin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

grim satisfaction in her eyes as she walked around the slightly squirming lump

getting fired. Keeping you happy and cooking allows me to pay my bills, stay
reasonably well-dressed, and go out for dinner on occasion without having to

warm, scented waters, liquor, and a really hot guy to massage your every tired

failing to hide itself as she followed the three hunks of beefcake and the

Quinn's words from earlier flooded through Helen, but she pushed them away as
she moved further into the kitchen. &quot;Jake - I want to apologize for last
night, no... I want to apologize for the way I've been acting lately. I had no
right to disrespect you the way I did last night, or to come in and ruin your
big night...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

do. I do need to tell you how sorry I am, for all the things that I've done and
haven't done for you lately. I guess... I know that I haven't been as good of a

at his sandwich as he watched his wife come over to the table and sit down.
&quot;I know that it seems that sometimes I'm too intense, or too driven, or
that I don't take the time to stop and appreciate the things that I've got -
like you, Jake - but that's going to change now that I'm a partner. Now that
I'm Bronwyn's personal attorney, I'll stop working all hours of the day and
night like a field hand, and start spending more time with you and the girls.
We can start being more of a family - a real family, instead of strangers with
the same address and last name. This money and this new job; it's the beginning
of a new chapter for all of us, Jake. Quinn and Daria will be able to go to any
school that they've ever dreamed of, and you'll be able to finally do what
you've wanted - quit that consultant's job and just go travel - travel, and
really work on your dream of being a chef. Travelling all over the world, and
learn about the foods of countries all over the globe... You'll be able to study
with chefs in France, in Singapore, in Nepal if you want.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

must be one hell of a raise you've gotten,&quot; Jake said, and Helen laughed
at the expression on his face. &quot;Think you can spring for a cruise on one

wants us to come over to the estate for dinner soon - you know, a little

Wednesday or so would be a good day to go over. What do you think?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

quicksilver to reveal a sharpened, hardening image that couldn't possibly hold

weirded out and stuff, ever since she started taking this stupid special class
for the brains that your 'friend' teaches! The way her face looked, it reminded
of that statue over in the desert with the Pyramids - the Sphincter, or
something like that... <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a bit tough, and I don't necessarily like everybody that's here, but I like
being here! I'm enjoying myself! This is something that'll look good on my
school record - I didn't do it just for that, but it's still nice - and

side cutting everybody down who's in this, and afterwards, we'd go grab some
pizza and then go watch TV,&quot; Jane said, looking down at her boots.
&quot;Trent - I love her like she's our sister, but we never did anything
constructive when we hung out together. It's like when you ate my gummi bears
for my art project and Daria went with me to that new superstore - the store
girl kept running from us. We finally caught up to her and it was Andrea - you
know her. She was running from us because she thought we were there just to
'cut her up like we do everybody else.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

true. Daria's a smart, pretty girl who speaks her mind to whoever's in her
face. You're a cool art chick who doesn't have her parents around, and lives
with her brother who plays guitar in a band. You two don't kiss up to the man.
You wear what you want to wear and do what you want to do instead of waiting
for some magazine to tell you to do it. You and Daria live your lives instead
of letting life wear you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

everyone has to be popular with the same groups. The people who look up to

you, nothing. You're just gonna keep on going like before. Daria - well, she
has to stop hiding from everyone, Jane. She has to stop hiding, even from
herself, and from the truth. Daria's got her own idea of what the world is all
about, and where she is in it. It's not a good thing, Janey, because she
doesn't want to change that view. Maybe she's too comfortable with the way she
thinks things are, even though it hurts; maybe she just can't deal with the
fact that everybody changes, eventually.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

around the area, then continued. &quot;Right now, she can't deal with the
notion that people - average people - could actually like her or respect her
for who and what she is. In her eyes, she's an outsider, and somehow, she's
better than the herd because of it. If the guys you and she run into everyday
think she's a great person, then it crashes her image because all Joe Blow
wants is the overmarketed corporate crap you see every day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

but sometimes, love just isn't enough. You've gotta have other things there,
too, like respect, and understanding, and just plain liking someone else as a

&quot;You've always been here for me - granted, I usually had to wake you up,

sources that could act - Erin, look at this! They actually got someone at NASA
to give them data on solar flares, sunspot activity and activity in the Van

his eyes dancing with boyish anticipation and delight as he scanned over the

went into the headshrinking for the money, the nice suits and the sexy,

into the Corps - they figure that I'll see the light soon, move to L.A. or the

walked in a full circle about her child. &quot;I think that your father and I
have been incredibly lenient and evenhanded in the hands-off policy we had
adopted towards your schooling. We've allowed you free rein to follow your own
desires and your own choices towards your future career, and asked for
practically nothing in return. You've never had to spend a semester in an
extracurricular activity - you really slid out of the yearbook, and we really
should have put our foot down there. Most children would have at least tried to
attempt something beyond their daily schoolwork! Your friend Jane tried out for
cheerleading and actually made the track team, and despite what people may say
about the Fashion Club, at least Quinn's involved in something, visibly dedicated
to it and it's something that she can actually justify putting on a college
application!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

superstar. You could have ensured that people know just what an incredible
woman you're going to become by showing them your potentials now and living up
to them! You could have gone to the best school in the state - in the COUNTRY!
- but no, not you. After all, why go to a world-renowned preparatory school
that would certainly prepare me to go to the best colleges out there? You don't
need that - not when you could amble aimlessly around the city, leaving a trail
of pizza crusts, sarcastic remarks and hurt feelings wherever you go, that is.
You haven't done much, Daria, not much at all. Starting tomorrow night - all of
that is going to change.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

believed in anything strongly enough for persons to see that you'd do anything
other than sell out at first chance,&quot; Helen verbally speared, not caring
about the look of pain on Daria's face. &quot;Oh, yes - sometime soon, we'll be
going over to the Ruttheimer estate. I've just agreed to become the personal
attorney for the Ruttheimer family, and they've invited us to dinner. You'll be
going as well - and you will leave your sarcasm and your smug attitude at home.
Give us any trouble or one untoward remark while we're there - and I'll ground
you for the next year so completely that if you even walk by a 9-volt battery,
the shock it gives off will kill you on the spot.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

intended. &quot;One minute she's an acid-mouthed harpy, practicing her
character assassination skills as though she's trying for an Olympic medal in
the sport, and the next - she's got that worn little hangdog expression on her

Daria sleeping in the library when she should have been in that special seminar?
Jake, I will not have it! She is not going to get this far and just throw her
entire life away because someone insulted her in front of other people and she
can't deal with it! She is NOT going to embarrass us by pissing away her chance

conversation that she thinks that some boy looks nice, or caught her attention
with something he was doing, or just acknowledges the fact that boys even
interest her! Hell, I'd actually be happy even if she said that GIRLS interest
her - but she just carries herself around like she's a psychic eunuch that

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

tone changed. &quot;Daria, I understand that you're having troubles at
school.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

please. I don't-&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;No -
hear me out,&quot; Jake said. &quot;I know that we're not a family that's all
hugs and kisses and 'touchy-feely' and all that. I don't know why we're not
like that, or like any of all of the stereotypes of what 'a normal family' is supposed
to be like. I only know one thing: that all of that is crap, because we ARE a
family - and even though I don't say it enough and you probably don't like
hearing it... I will be there for you, Daria, whenever you need me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Daria looked
down as Jake continued. &quot;I don't know what's happening at your school yet.
I'd like to think that you'd tell me if something's wrong, but I know that
you'll be able to handle whatever's thrown in your way. There's something else
you have to know, Daria - and this is something I should have said to you a
long time ago. Don't worry about doing or not doing anything, or of trying to
avoid what you've already done, because of what people think about you -
especially your mother and me. I don't ever want you to think that you've
disappointed us, or made us look bad, or dishonored us because of the choices
you make, the things you do or the way you want your life to go.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jake took a
breath. &quot;You've never disappointed me, Daria. There were times when you've
done things and I wish you had chosen another way, but you've always been
honest with yourself. If you can be honest with your decisions and live with
them, then I'll always be happy for you and I'll always love you. Don't ever
doubt that about me, Kiddo. No matter what choices you make, no matter what you
do or what happens because of it, you need to know that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

unmoving and silent, as her father leaned against the doorway.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:233.25pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;You know, Daria - most people want to live the so-called
'American Dream'. For them, that usually means having a nice home, a couple of
cars, almost all of the bills paid off, digital cable or a satellite dish, and
a nice family vacation every other year. For the past seventeen years, I've
been living the American Dream because each and every single time that I look
at you, I see a part of me. In you, I see the best part of me - and having a
daughter like you means that I succeeded. To me, that's worth more to me than
anything I could wish for or could buy. Good night, Daria. &quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
