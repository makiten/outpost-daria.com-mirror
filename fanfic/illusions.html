<h3 style="letter-spacing: normal; text-transform: none;">1.&nbsp;(by CharlieGirl)</h3>
<p class="firstParagraph">
Daria lay on her stomach, her head resting on her arms, staring at the
blankness of her padded wall.&nbsp;Nothing much was eating at her, except
boredom, and a bit of disgust that she kept well-squashed.&nbsp;For now.
</p>
<p>
Jane was busy with her new job at Pizza King, trying to save enough up to help
with college expenses, pending financial aid.&nbsp;Quinn, who was finally
becoming INTERESTING, was at Sandi's house, with the remnants of the
now-defunct Fashion Club.&nbsp;Jake was with a promising client, discussing a
possible contract over drinks or, more likely, drinking alone.&nbsp;Tom, whom
she had broken up with only a few weeks earlier, was most likely at the cove
with his family.
</p>
<p>
And Helen...&nbsp;She was at work, boffing the boss, as usual.
</p>
<p>
And, as usual, Daria said nothing, trying to maintain the peace long enough
so that she could escape.&nbsp;She hoped that Helen and Jake would maintain
their illusions long enough so that Quinn could get out relatively unscathed,
too.&nbsp;She was finally becoming human, and Daria didn't want to see that
crushed by their parents' problems.
</p>
<p>
She tried to block out images of what Helen was doing that very moment, but
it was becoming more and more difficult.&nbsp;She got up and put on her
boots, intending to go for a walk.&nbsp;Walking towards her door, she thought
about how very soon this house, which had been a home to her for the past
nearly three years, would soon be gone.&nbsp;No doubt that once Quinn was off
to college, the 'rents would split.&nbsp;They had been wanting to for years,
despite occasional flings with each other, and the only reason they stayed
together was &ldquo;for the girls.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
In the hallway, Daria paused at the head of the stairs and looked up slightly
at the attic pull-door on the ceiling near her parents' room.&nbsp;She'd never
really bothered to go up there, and all she really knew about their attic was
that there were a few boxes from Highland, and that the attic had windows, so
even if there was no bulb, the mid-afternoon summer sun would let her see.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, what the hell.&rdquo;&nbsp;She reached for the cord, and gave a
good tug.
</p>
<p>
The attic door came down with a hard creak, and Daria had to kick the hinges
to make the stairs unfold.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, no one's been up HERE in awhile, THAT'S for sure.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
Climbing up the steep steps, she looked around.&nbsp;Dust had been stirred up
with the stairs being moved, and the motes danced in the sunlight like
something from a dream.&nbsp;Nearly spell-bound, Daria pulled the steps up
after her, and closed the door.&nbsp;There was a switch on a support beam,
and the bulb on the pole crackled to life after long dormancy.
</p>
<p>
The floor of the attic was made of pieces of wood, some of it one-by-fours,
and some of it just thick, wide sheets of wood.&nbsp;Testing it, she found it
strong enough to hold her weight, although more than two people on one of
the boards would probably crack it.&nbsp;Just to be safe, she stuck to the
places where she felt beams beneath her feet.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
There were a few boxes right near the entrance, and Daria recognized all
of them.&nbsp;This one here was some of Quinn's baby clothes and
mementos.&nbsp;Worthless, financially, but too precious to be
tossed.&nbsp;And that one over there was...&nbsp;Hey! They'd fished her
ruined flute out of the garbage and saved it.&nbsp;Underneath were school
reports, progress cards, drawings, and a few toys.&nbsp;A well-read copy of
<b><i>Black Beauty</i></b> was tucked in the corner of the carton.
</p>
<p>
Gently searching through other boxes, she found all sorts of bits and pieces
of her childhood.&nbsp;Her parents had saved quite a bit more of her stuff
than she'd thought.&nbsp;God, had she really worn that dress? And those little
booties! Had her feet REALLY been that TINY? Wow.&nbsp;She was nearly
overwhelmed with emotion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;They loved me. They always SAID that they loved me, but they really
did.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
She sat down with a thud and put her head in her hands, trying not to
cry.&nbsp;Never before had she felt more wanted, more cared-for by her
parents.&nbsp;Even if they had their problems, even if they were probably
going to get a divorce, they had always loved her.&nbsp;No one who didn't
care about a person would save so much of a person's life.&nbsp;And now she
was leaving them, going off to college, and her plans never included
returning to visit her parents for anything other than holidays and
funerals.&nbsp;After pondering that for a moment, the tears began to leak
out of the corners of her eyes.
</p>
<p>
Twenty minutes later, after a good cry, and going downstairs to fetch a box
of tissues, she was back in the attic.&nbsp;The spell of the motes had been
broken, and it looked like any other attic, except for...&nbsp;Except for
that door on the far wall.&nbsp;Why was there a door in their
attic?&nbsp;Stepping lightly across the boards, not just worrying about
falling through, she crept quietly up to the far wall, and listened.&nbsp;No,
no unusual noises.&nbsp;She put her hand on the knob, and turned.&nbsp;Nothing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Locked?&nbsp;Okay, bigger mystery than I thought.&nbsp;Why is there a
LOCKED door in this attic?&nbsp;Why am I thinking of that Simpsons Halloween
episode where Bart finds his conjoined twin locked up, and creating
pigeon-rats?&nbsp;What is behind this door?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
She went back downstairs and returned with a screwdriver, and proceeded to
jimmy the lock.&nbsp;The handle was rusty, but eventually Daria heard a
click.&nbsp;She held the screwdriver in front of her like a weapon, turned
the handle, and pulled...
</p>
<p>
Thump.
</p>
<p>
Daria Morgendorffer had fainted clean away.
</p>
<h3 style="letter-spacing: normal; text-transform: none;">2.&nbsp;(by et alia)</h3>
<p class="firstParagraph">
She was jolted awake by a splash of cold water square in the
face.&nbsp;Coughing and spitting, she raised herself on her elbows as a
melodious and sultry alto voice, one she had never heard before but
recognized instantly, taunted her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Wake up, little Daria,&rdquo; said Melody Powers. &ldquo;Time to return
to the land of the living&mdash;if only for a little while.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
Daria sat up, wiped her glasses on her jacket, and looked at who stood
before her.&nbsp;A tall, leggy beauty with auburn hair wearing a black
leather trench coat stared down at her, an expression of amused contempt on
her face.&nbsp;In one hand she held a .44 automag; in the other, a
bucket, which she abruptly tossed aside.
</p>
<p>
Daria felt strangely calm.&nbsp;&ldquo;Nice outfit,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp;&ldquo;Cashmans, I suppose?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very funny,&rdquo; Melody replied, unbuttoning the trench coat to
reveal a strapless black evening gown&mdash;and to retrieve a clip of
ammunition.&nbsp;&ldquo;Better than Cashmans, of course, but still
<i>pr&ecirc;t &agrave; porter,</i> alas,&rdquo; she said, sliding the clip
into place.&nbsp;&ldquo;It wouldn't have killed you to look at Quinn's
fashion magazines every once in a while, Daria&mdash;you know, do some
research?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
Daria drew herself into a cross-legged seated position and shook her
head.&nbsp;&ldquo;No.&nbsp;<b><i>Waif</i></b> magazine fashions during the
Cold War would have been anachronistic.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
Melody sneered.&nbsp;&ldquo;No, Daria, what was anachronistic was putting
someone like me in the Cold War era to begin with.&nbsp;Two superpowers with
clear differences of ideology, clearly defined spheres of influence,
only the occasional double agent to spice things up&mdash;God, how
boring!&rdquo;&nbsp;She crouched down in front of her creator, stroking
Daria's chin with the tip of the gun barrel.&nbsp;&ldquo;But
now&mdash;a multi-polar world, murky ideological differences, confused
alliances, double cross as standard operating procedure, constant
uncertainty&mdash;it's all hothouse and madness!&nbsp;And I want in,
Daria.&nbsp;It's perfect for me.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Perfect for a killer, not a spy.&rdquo;&nbsp;Daria returned her gaze,
betraying no response to the caresses of the gun along her face.
</p>
<p>
Melody gave Daria an exaggerated pout.&nbsp;&ldquo;But that's exactly it,
Daria&mdash;I <em>am</em> a killer, not a spy.&nbsp;You may be my author,
but an author is not always the best judge of her work.&nbsp;And what is an
artist&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;&mdash;but the dregs of her work,&rdquo; Daria
interrupted.&nbsp;&ldquo;I know where this is going.&nbsp;Get it over
with.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
Melody stood up, frowning.&nbsp;&ldquo;You know, we could make quite a
team in this sickest and saddest of all possible worlds.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What's in it for me?&nbsp;The pleasures of murder are too
fleeting.&nbsp;I prefer the lingering satisfaction of seeing the souls of
those I despise crushed by hells of their own making.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
Melody raised an eyebrow and smirked.&nbsp;&ldquo;Really?&nbsp;And how's
that working out for you?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, Ms. Li is still principal of Lawndale High and Kevin Thompson
is repeating his senior year,&rdquo; Daria replied coolly.&nbsp;&ldquo;That
would make some people complacent, but for me it's just a start.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
Melody went to the closet door and gestured inside with the
gun.&nbsp;&ldquo;How's this then&mdash;come with me, or I'll leave you
tied up here with the closet door open.&nbsp;The flesh-eating virus from that
story you sent to <b><i>Musings</i></b> should be out before anyone else
gets home.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
Daria shook her head.&nbsp;&ldquo;No, you'll double cross me&mdash;I know
exactly when and where.&rdquo;&nbsp;She gave Melody her cryptic,
condescending smile.&nbsp;&ldquo;I'd rather have the virus eat
me&mdash;besides, it's a <em>sympathetic</em> character.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
Melody slammed the closet door shut and chambered a
round.&nbsp;&ldquo;What, and give you enough time to alert the Bureau, the
Agency, and the rest of the Keystone Kops?&nbsp;They can't stop me, but
they'll delay me.&nbsp;And I have places to go, people to kill.&nbsp;No deal,
Daria.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
&rdquo;Right.&nbsp;So like I said, let's get this over
with.&rdquo;&nbsp;With that, Daria closed her eyes and said a brief, silent
prayer for Quinn and her parents.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Have it your way,&rdquo; Melody fumed as she aimed the gun and&mdash;
</p>
<hr />
<p class="firstParagraph">
Melody Powers paced the irregular and uneven floor of the Morgendoffer's
attic in a vain attempt to calm herself.&nbsp;The cold sweats had stopped,
but her fingers were still trembling.&nbsp;All her years of killing did not
prepare her for someone who would open her eyes at
<b><i>exactly</i></b> the moment she pulled the trigger and
give her&mdash;Melody Powers, Death in a Little Black Dress&mdash;a look of
unconcerned condescension.
</p>
<p>
Daria lay dead on the floor in front of her.&nbsp;Except for the hole in the
middle of her forehead&mdash;and the gaping hole in the back of her head, and
the blood and brain sprayed across the floor behind her&mdash;her expression
was exactly  that of Daria alive: a cool mocking gaze, and that damned
smile.&nbsp;Even dead she maintained her air of detached superiority.
</p>
<p>
<em>She knew she'd look like that,</em> Melody thought, and shuddered.
</p>
<p>
At length, Melody stopped pacing and tried to look at Daria square in the
face.&nbsp;She couldn't.&nbsp;She closed her eyes and tried to recall her
favorite kills&mdash;handsome Tonio, shot as he slept on the beach; the
overweight, pompous, double-dealing embassy bureaucrat she strangled with
a silk stocking; Dmitri, who thought his blue eyes were so beautiful that
she wouldn't drive an ice-pick into them&mdash;and failed.&nbsp;Instead of
fond memories of mayhem, Daria's cold supercilious face filled her mind.
</p>
<p>
<em>She knew she'd look like that.&nbsp;<strong>BITCH!</strong></em>
</p>
<p>
Standing over Daria's body, she picked her up by the lapels of her coat,
forced herself to look into Daria's dead eyes and screamed,
<span style="font-size: large; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;
line-height: 150%">&ldquo;Who's so fucking smart now, Daria?&nbsp;Who's
so fucking smart?&nbsp;You're not the author anymore&mdash;I am!&nbsp;I'm
in charge of my life now, you smug, pretentious little bitch!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
Melody, realizing she had broken out in a cold sweat again, dropped Daria's
body to the floor and dashed to a corner of the attic.&nbsp;The urge
to vomit was strong but she suppressed it.&nbsp;<em>What's wrong with
me?</em> she thought.&nbsp;<em>I've killed hundreds of people, dangerous
people&mdash;</em>
</p>
<p>
She turned to look at Daria's body.&nbsp;Her head had rolled to the side, as
if she had turned to look at Melody cowering in the corner.
</p>
<p>
And Melody closed her eyes as she began to understand.&nbsp;<em>&mdash;and
all of them, the most treacherous, the most dangerous, all of them were just
products of <b>her</b> imagination.&nbsp;My worst ordeals were just ways
for her to pass the time in a boring class, or when there was nothing good
on TV, or when she didn't feel like reading, or when she wasn't writing
something else.&nbsp;I've never really faced anyone as deadly as Daria
Morgendoffer.</em>
</p>
<p>
Melody sank into the corner as she realized the further implications of what
she had done.&nbsp;<em>But she also made sure I always got out alive, that
it was all good fun&mdash;blood and sex and dead Communists&mdash;but she
just let me kill her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Why?</em>
</p>
<p>
She curled into a fetal position and screwed her eyes shut as her
thoughts became more disordered.&nbsp;<em>She was testing me.&nbsp;It was a
test, and I failed.</em>
</p>
<p>
Finally, the most disturbing possibility entered her
mind.&nbsp;<em>What if this is all a trick?</em>&nbsp;<span style="font-size:
large; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; line-height: 150%">Could she be
writing this?</span>
</p>
<p>
With a great act of will, she opened her eyes and stood up,
shaking.&nbsp;&ldquo;Get a grip,&rdquo; she whispered, her voice faltering.
</p>
<p>
This was not a time for metaphysical doubt or despair.&nbsp;It was a
time for action.
</p>
<p>
She came out from the corner to stand again over Daria's body.&nbsp;She
opened the closet door and, averting her eyes from Daria's face, tossed
her inside.&nbsp;&ldquo;Your virus can still get to know you,&rdquo; she
muttered, slamming the door.&nbsp;She descended the stairs from the attic,
darted into Daria's room, and closed the door.&nbsp;She needed a cover identity
and needed one quickly.&nbsp;Fingers still trembling, she began to rummage
through Daria's papers for Amy Barksdale's address.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p class="firstParagraph">
The first section by CharlieGirl originally appeared on <a
href="http://www.thepaperpusher.com/forum/index.php">The Paperpusher's Message
Board</a> in January 2005.&nbsp;Kristen Bealer then created an Iron Chef
item for it both there and at <a

Board.</a>&nbsp;A version of the second section by et alia appeared at the
latter.

<p class="firstParagraph">
The original title given by CharlieGirl was "Illusions."&nbsp;et alia
added the phrase "The Unswerving Punctuality of&mdash;" which is a truncation of
"the unswerving punctuality of chance," a phrase that appears in all of
William Gaddis' novels.&nbsp;The phrase itself comes from Thomas Wolfe's
<b><i>Look Homeward, Angel,</i></b> but Gaddis claimed to have only known
it through a classmate at Harvard.&nbsp;See <a
