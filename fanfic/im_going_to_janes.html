<P><I>"Beautiful." Daria was being sarcastic.</I>

<P><I>"Isn't it?" Jane wasn't.</I>

<P><I>"Forgive me for a lack of artistic appreciation, Jane, but it's
a pile of rusty metal objects you <b>told</b> me you'd glued together at
random. I've heard of abstract art, but this is kinda stretching
it."</I>

<P><I>"Exactly."</I>

<P><I>"Excuse me?"</I>

<P><I>"Daria, this will be my introduction to the Baltimore art
community. A piece where Jane Lane stands proudly and proclaims 'I
am.' The fact that I made the minimum of effort and that it means
absolutely nothing will only improve things, since they won't be able
to figure it out. Like that science project you told me about."</I>

<P><I>"Oh. Cool." She paused. "I hate to spoil your thunder, but it
<B>does</B> look kinda like something. A big brain."</I>

<P><I>"Because nobody's a bigger brain than you, Daria." Deadpan.
Thankfully, the shorter girl caught the sarcasm.</I>

<P><I>"Since the prize was getting humiliated every other day between
five and twelve, there wasn't too much competition." Jane
was genuinely surprised... if she didn't know better, she'd think
Daria was showing emotion with that statement. Or maybe it was just
that she knew what her best friend was talking about too damn well.
Though having a big brother, scrawny as he was, around to stick up
for her had helped back then.</I>

<P><I>"Now, what was Li going on about in assembly? The football
player?" Daria was changing the subject. Apparently, she
<B>had</B> been showing emotion and didn't particularly
like the novelty.</I>

<P><I>"Long story. I'd tell you, but you'll never amount to anything
in this world if you don't start finding things out for yourself!"
She finished shaking her finger in mock anger. Daria just rolled her
eyes, and made the mistake of looking at her watch.</I>

<P><I>"Shouldn't we be going?"</I>

<P><I>Jane looked at hers. They were ten minutes away from being
late. School was an eleven-minute walk, and Morris in homeroom had a
grudge. She ran.</I>

<P><I>"I'll take that as a yes."</I>

<P>
<HR>


<P><I>"... how can one make sense of a tragedy, so tragic..."</I>

<P><I>"... shouldn't have died..."</I>

<P><I>"... no..."</I>

<P>
<HR>


<P>Two nights later. Quinn is worried. Daria hasn't come out of her
room, and her parents have sent her to go up and get her. Normally
that's just a little annoying, but now... who is she kidding? She's
scared. For herself and for Daria.

<P>So are her parents.

<P>Tentatively, she knocks at the door.

<P>"Daria?"

<P>Silence.

<P>"Daria?"

<P>Still nothing.

<P>"Daria -- if you're awake, if you're OK... dinner's ready."

<P>She goes back downstairs. She could do more. She could open the
door, check on her sister. But... what would she see? She's too
scared, that simple.

<P>
<HR>


<P>Jane comes into Daria's room.

<P>"Hey."

<P>"Hey, Daria. Not watching the show?"

<P>"Nah, they've got on one of those stupid seafloor research
episodes on."

<P>"Sucks."

<P>"No kidding."

<P>"So, whatcha doing--" She gets cut off by a quiet knock on the
door.

<P>"Daria?"

<P>Who puts a finger to her lips. Her best friend takes the hint.


<P>"Daria?"

<P>"Daria -- if you're awake, if you're OK... dinner's ready." And
footsteps are heard, going down the stairs.

<P>"Sorry about that. But you already know my sister." Pause. "So,
how's the sculpture?"

<P>"Not great. Have a look," Jane says, gesturing to a corner of the
room. The intricate, if messy, network of metal was never held
together that well in the first place, and it's come apart along a
line, front to back, dividing it neatly in two pieces.

<P>"Damn." Another pause. "Look, much as I've missed you, I'd better
go down before Mom puts me in a real padded cell."

<P>"No problem. Later."

<P>
<HR>


<P>Helen and Jake share a look of surprise when their eldest daughter
comes down the stairs and starts on her dinner, with no less
enthusiasm than any normal night. As if that's all it is for her.


<P>Daria, while digging into her slightly overcooked lasagne, wonders
why they're so nervous, quiet. Briefly. At least they're not getting
intrusive.

<P>"Daria..." That's what you get for trying to find the silver
lining, she chastises herself.

<P>"Yes?" She keeps deadpan. It's safest.

<P>Silence. She goes on eating.

<P>"Daria... we worry about you, Daria." No, you worry about
<B>your</B> father, Dad, she thinks. At least he didn't turn out like
him.

<P>"That's great, Dad. I do too." She's finished, so she gets up,
takes her plate to the dishwasher, and heads towards the front door.
"I'm going to Jane's."

<P>Helen follows.

<P>"Daria?" Her daughter stops, but doesn't turn around. "But you
kn... what about the funeral?"

<P>Daria goes on walking.

<P>
<HR>


<P><I>She walked to Jane's, worried about what was wrong, what the
hell she was going to say. Six months they'd known each other for
next week and this was the closest they'd ever been to a real fight;
even Willow had stood up to her before then.</I>

<P><I>She had a plan, of sorts; simply walk in and explain herself.
How exactly she would do that, she wasn't sure. Still, words came
easily to her. Even when she wasn't being sarcastic... rare as that
was.</I>

<P><I>Round a corner, up the driveway, past the one sculpture left on
the property that wasn't Jane's creation. She knocked on the
door.</I>

<P><I>Trent opened it. "Hey, Daria. Janey went running."</I>

<P><I>Damn. "Oh, well, I'll see her another time."</I>

<P><I>"Scary about Tommy Sherman." Oh hell, not him too. Then again,
she couldn't exactly blame the guy...</I>

<P><I>"Yeah. You knew him, right?"</I>

<P><I>"We had a couple classes together. I mean, we didn't see him
much. You know, he didn't show up too often."</I>

<P><I>"Not like you, huh?"</I>

<P><I>He couldn't help laughing. One thing you could say for Daria,
she could always make you laugh. Or at least do that smirk thing she
did. Pity she never showed more of what she was thinking than
that.</I>

<P><I>"I guess I might have missed a few classes, now that you
mention it. Weird thing, freak accident."</I>

<P><I>"Would you say it really makes you think?"</I>

<P><I>"No." It didn't.</I>

<P><I>"Thank you for that."</I>

<P><I>That was weird. "Huh?"</I>

<P><I>"See ya."</I>

<P><I>"Hey Daria."</I>

<P><I>"Yeah?"</I>

<P><I>"You know, it was a while ago that Janey went running..."</I>


<P>
<HR>


<P>Around the corner, up the driveway, past the concrete sculpture,
the door is left open. Trent is just inside.

<P>"Hey, Daria." He appears devastated.

<P>"Trent? Are you OK?"

<P>"Yeah, I'll be fine. Don't worry about me."

<P>"The band break up or something?" He looks at her. She is straight
faced as ever, but drops her eyes from his incredulity.

<P>"You... heading up to Janey's room?" Tear in his eyes.

<P>"Yeah." A pause. "Trent, are you sure you're all right?"

<P>"No. But don't let me get in your way."

<P>She turns, looks him full in the face. Sees grief. Sees that he
<B>needs</B> to get it out, before it consumes him.

<P>She can't find words.

<P>She turns back, and makes her way up the stairs.

<P>
<HR>


<P><I>"...I'm not miserable. I'm just not like them."</I>

<P><I>"It really makes you think."</I>

<P><I>"Funny. Thanks a lot." She turned to leave.</I>

<P><I>"No! That's why they want to talk to you. When they say,
'You're always unhappy Daria,' what they mean is, 'You think Daria.
I can tell because you don't smile. Now this guy died and it
makes me think and that hurts my little head and makes me stop smiling.
So, tell me how you cope with thinking all the time, Daria, until I
can get back to my normal vegetable state.'" Comforting words. Daria
wondered why Jane's English grades weren't a whole lot higher. But
there were more important things right now...</I>

<P><I>"OK. So why have you been avoiding me?"</I>

<P><I>"Because I've been trying not to think. About the way we were
making jokes about him dying and then boom, it happened."</I>

<P><I>"We didn't have anything to do with the guy dying. It was a
freak accident."</I>

<P><I>"Yeah, well I don't like it when I say people should die and
then they do. I don't want that kind of responsibility. At least not
until I've got a job in middle management." Daria tried to reconcile
the image of the paint-splattered artist Jane with someone like her
power-suited mother. It simply didn't work. Then she realised Jane
wanted a reply. Time to get this reconciliation thing over and done
with.</I>

<P><I>"You didn't make him die."</I>

<P><I>"You're not the misery chick."</I>

<P><I>"All right then."</I>

<P><I>"All right then."</I>

<P><I>"He shouldn't have died."</I>

<P><I>"No."</I>

<P><I>"But he wasn't a nice guy."</I>

<P><I>"No."</I>

<P><I>A pause. Now the argument, such as it had been, was over, there
didn't seem to be anything to talk about.</I>

<P><I>"Did Trent know you were up here?"</I>

<P><I>"Told him to tell anyone who dropped by that I was out running.
What a surprise, he forgot."</I>

<P><I>"No, he didn't."</I>

<P><I>Jane cocked an eyebrow at that, and looked like she was about
to comment. Then she turned back towards her sculpture.</I>

<P><I>"You know, I think that's almost finished. Almost." A peace
offering, gratefully accepted. "Help me out with this, will you?"</I>


<P><I>"So... what is it? That... huge grey thing?"</I>

<P><I>"It's a... I'm not sure what it's called. It's big, it's metal
it's </I><B><I>damn</I></B><I> heavy, and it'll look good in the
sculpture, so pass me the glue gun and come over and help me out
here, 'kay?"</I>

<P><I>"Whatever your wish, O Mistress..." Daria grabbed the infamous
adhesive applicator from the floor nearby and walked over to Jane,
who was already half-buried under her work, motor-mechanic-fashion.
Her head was resting over a long, thin steel rod a few centimetres
from the ground, obviously uncomfortably. Pushing herself further
back, she winced at her position, took the gun, and looked at her
position. Then she threw the gun away, scrabbled for an ordinary and
half-empty-looking tube of glue from nearby underneath, and turned
back towards her friend.</I>

<P><I>"OK... um... could you go over and get the... thing?"</I>

<P><I>Daria took a few steps and picked up the large metal object.
Jane was right, it was heavy as hell and hard to get a good grip
on.</I>

<P><I>"Jane, are you sure that this is sa--"</I>

<P><I>She tripped over the thrown gun and fell on the sculpture. Most
of it collapsed under her weight. Amidst the clatters and crashes as
various pieces hit the ground, there was a quiet crack and loud
thump.</I>

<P><I>"Oh, shit, Jane, that was stupid of me..."</I>

<P><I>She looked up. Saw where the metal thing she had been carrying
was. Saw the blood. Saw Jane, head resting on the floor, neck
bleeding and bent back too far.</I>

<P>
<HR>


<P>Daria comes into her late best friend's room. She sees the glue
gun, kicked away near the bed. The bloodstains in the corner. The
sculpture, a formless, collapsed pile of metal scraps.

<P>She falls onto her knees and puts her head in her hands.
