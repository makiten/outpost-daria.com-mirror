Suddenly Tom appears and when Sandi sees him, she blushed and felt herself melt, she'd never felt something like this before<br>
<br>
Tom: Hi Quinn<br>
Quinn: Hi Tom, what are you doing here?<br>
Tom: I'm looking for Daria, she asked me to come, do you know where she is?<br>
Quinn: I guess she's in her classroom<br>
Tom: OK, see you<br>
Quinn: Bye<br>
<br>
(Tom leaves)<br>
<br>
Sandi: Quinn, do you know that guy?<br>
Quinn: Sure, he's Daria's boyfriend, why?<br>
Sandi: No... nothing, I was just wondering, so when is the next Fashion Club's meeting?<br>
Quinn: Tonight, in my house, don't you remember?<br>
Sandi: Sure, your house, well... I... I see you later...<br>
<br>
(Sandi leaves)<br>
<br>
Quinn: What's wrong with Sandi?<br>
Stacy: I don't know, maybe she's mad 'cause I bought that lipstick she wannted, oh god, what did I do? it's my fault, what do you think Tiffany? <br>
Tiffany: Uh?<br>
<br>
Scene 2: Outside Lawndale High<br>
<br>
Jane: So... are you gonna tell me?<br>
Daria: What?<br>
Jane: What? the big thing that you're gonna tell Tom<br>
Daria: I have to tell him... just him<br>
Jane: C'mon Daria, I'm your friend, your best friend... in fact I'm your only friend...<br>
Daria: What are you trying to do with that speech?<br>
Jane: I try to make you feel guilty... is it working?<br>
Daria: Of course... NOT!<br>
Jane: It doesn't matter, here comes Tom, and I won't go 'til I know<br>
Tom: Hi Daria, hi Jane<br>
<br>
(Tom kisses Daria)<br>
<br>
Tom: And, what's the big deal?<br>
Daria: I can't tell you<br>
Tom: You said you couldn't tell me 'cause we were on the phone, now what?<br>
Daria: Jane's here...<br>
Jane: And I won't leave, so tell us Morgendorffer, TELL US, TELL US!<br>
Daria: I won't say anything 'til Tom and I are alone<br>
Jane: I see the problem, I'm gonna find out one way or another, you better tell us now, TELL US, TELL US!<br>
Daria: Can you go to my house tonight Tom?<br>
Tom: Sure, but don't invite Jane or I will never know<br>
Jane: Hey! alright, but you'll have to tell me tomorrow Daria<br>
Daria: OK, see you guys, I'll see you later Tom, bye Jane<br>
Tom &amp; Jane: Bye<br>
<br>
Suddenly Daria turned around and embraced and kissed Tom<br>
<br>
Tom: Wow, I thought for a while that you wasn't gonna give me a good bye kiss<br>
Daria: (whispers) I'm gonna wait for you tonight, I mean it<br>
Tom: (whispers) I'll be there, I promise<br>
<br>

Helen: So girls, what are you gonna do tonight?<br>
Quinn: The Fashion Club's coming, we have to coordinate our outfits for the next week<br>
Helen: What about you Daria?<br>
Daria: Tom's gonna come, we're gonna be in my bedroom, you know, closed door, slow music, perfect for...<br>
Helen: DARIA, please, even Tom maybe is ready, I'm not sure that you are and...<br>
Daria: Perfect for study, I tried to say<br>
Helen: What a relief, I mean, it's good that you and Tom study together, but... do you think you can avoid the closed door?<br>
Daria: Alright mom, I'm so lucky for living in a time where the sex is not banned<br>
Jake: SEX???!!!! for god's sake Daria, you can't have sex, you're too young!!!<br>
Helen: Jake, didn't you listen to Daria? she said...<br>
Jake: As soon as I see Tom, I'm gonna kill him!!!<br>
Daria: Dad, Tom and I haven't had sex... YET<br>
Jake: Good for you kiddo!<br>
Daria: See you later... I'll go to the drugstore<br>

(Daria leaves)<br>
<br>
Jake: We have a nice daughter Helen... wait Daria!!... YET?! DRUGSTORE?! HELEN, DARIA'S GONNA BUY CONDOMS!!!<br>
Helen: Jake, could you stop saying that?... DARIA, WAIT!!<br>
<br>
Daria's in the living room, watching Sick Sad World<br>
<br>
Daria: What's going on?<br>
Helen: You said you was gonna buy cond... GO TO THE DRUGSTORE!<br>
Daria: And you thought that I was gonna buy condoms, right?<br>
Helen: Of course not sweetie<br>
<br>
(Bell rings)<br>
<br>
Helen: I'm coming<br>
<br>
Daria goes to her bedroom and Helen opens the door<br>
<br>
Helen: Hi Tom, what a surprise!<br>
Tom: Good evening Mrs. Morgendorffer, is Daria here?<br>
Helen: Sure Tom, come in, Daria, Tom's here!, Tom sit down please, Tom I prefer that you and Daria stay here, in the living room...<br>
Quinn: Hi Tom, Daria says that you should go upstairs, in her bedroom<br>
Tom: OK, thanks Quinn, see you later Mrs. Morgendorffer<br>
<br>
(Tom goes upstairs)<br>
<br>
Helen: Quinn, could you check that Daria's door is opened?<br>
Quinn: Mom, you shouldn't worry about that, besides, what do you think it could happen between Daria and Tom?<br>
<br>
(Bell rings)<br>
<br>
Quinn: That must be the Fashion Club, I'm coming!<br>
<br>
(Quinn opens the door)<br>
<br>
Quinn: Sandi, Stacy, Tiffany, go to my room, our clothes are gonna be the coolest in all the school this week<br>
<br>
Scene 4: Daria's bedroom<br>
<br>
Daria was worried, he had taken a decision... she was sure, but she didn't know what Tom would think about it...<br>
<br>
Tom: Daria?<br>
Daria: Oh, hi Tom, could you close the door, please?<br>
<br>
Tom closed the door, that wasn't Daria, he noticed that she had been a little weird those days, but he really wanted to know why<br>
<br>
Tom: OK, I'm here, what is it?<br>
Daria: Tom, I...<br>
<br>
(Helen opens the door)<br>
<br>
Helen: Daria, Tom, there are snacks in the kitchen if you want, Daria why don't you take Tom to the kitchen?<br>
Daria: Why don't I take Tom?<br>
Helen: DARIA!!!<br>
Daria: To the kitchen, no I guess I prefer to bring the snacks here, I'll come back soon Tom, try to hold on<br>
<br>
(Daria leaves)<br>
<br>
Sandi was in Quinn's room and saw Daria leaving, that was her chance, she had to get in Daria's bedroom and look for something... about Tom... a picture or well, anything<br>
<br>
Quinn: And I say that if we all buy those skirts, we're gonna have dates the next week, what do you think Sandi? you're the president<br>
Sandi: Uh?... it's OK Quinn, whatever you say... listen, I have to go to... to the bathroom...<br>
<br>
(Sandi leaves)<br>
<br>
Quinn: What was that?<br>
Stacy: It's because the lipstick, but I swear I didn't know that Sandi was looking for that lipstick too, what was I thinking?<br>
<br>
(Stacy starts to cry)<br>
<br>
Quinn: Please Stacy, it's not worthy, right Tiffany?<br>
Tiffany: What?<br>
<br>
Sandi went to Daria's bedroom, and she came in, she saw him... the most gorgeous guy in the world<br>
<br>
Tom: Who are you?<br>
Sandi: I'm Sandi, I'm looking for... for... (which was her name?)... Dora<br>
Tom: Dora?<br>
Sandi: Dorian, I mean<br>
Tom: I guess you mean DARIA<br>
Sandi: That's right, Daria!<br>
Daria: Quinn's bedroom is by that way, did you get lost?<br>
Sandi: Oh, sure, see you...<br>
Daria: What was she doing here?<br>
Tom: She was looking for you... well, she said that, but she couldn't even remember your name Dora<br>
Daria: it's not funny<br>
<br>
(Daria closes the door)<br>
<br>
Tom: And the snacks?<br>
Daria: There weren't any snacks, it was just one of my mom's tricks<br>
Tom: Daria, I'm dying, are you gonna tell me or not?<br>
Daria: OK, Tom... I'm ready...<br>
Tom: Ready? ready for what? oh, I understand, but have you thought it, right? or are you gonna leave me with my candles and my roses like the last time?<br>
Daria: I'm serious this time Tom, I've thought about it and I want to do it<br>
Tom: Well, I want to do it too... but just with you, so when and where?<br>
Daria: Friday, your room, unless your parents stay there...<br>
Tom: No, they are not gonna be there, don't worry about that... are you really sure about this?<br>
<br>
Daria embraced and kissed Tom, now she was sure, but she didn't want to be with him for just a few hours...<br>
<br>
Daria: Can I stay there all night?<br>
Tom: All night? what are you gonna say to your parents?<br>
Daria: Easy, that I'm going to Jane's<br>
Tom: That's my girl<br>
<br>
Tom leaned and kissed her, he was so happy, finally Daria decided to take their relationship to the next level<br>
<br>
Tom: OK, I gotta go, I have just one week to plan all this, it must be perfect<br>
Daria: Alright, see you, I guess I'm gonna take you anyway<br>
Tom: (laughs) I don't have anything against that, you know<br>
<br>
Scene 5: The next day, Pizza King<br>
<br>
Stacy: Sandi I just wanted to tell you that I'm not gonna use that lipstick again<br>
Sandi: What? which lipstick?<br>
Stacy: Aren't you angry 'cause I bought that bronze lipstick? I thought you wanted it<br>
Sandi: No, I don't want it... Quinn, which is the name of your sister's boyfriend?<br>
Quinn: Tom Sloane, why are you asking me this?<br>
Sandi: Do you know where he lives?<br>
Quinn: I'm not so sure, why? are you interested in Tom?<br>
Sandi: Of course not, I have to go...<br>
Quinn: Why?<br>
Sandi: I have a date, see you<br>
<br>
When Sandi got out of the Pizza King saw Daria and Tom together, then she got in her car and try to hide, but she was still watching them, what was this? she... she felt... jealous... of... it couldn't be!, she was one of the most popular girls in the school and Daria... Daria... she was nothing but a brain... how could she be something for such a charming guy?<br>
<br>
Tom: OK, I'll drive you home<br>
Daria: I ate too much <br>
Tom: Well, actually I didn't believe that all the pizza of the world could be enough for you<br>
Daria: You're right, but that was pizza for two worlds<br>
<br>
Then Daria and Tom got in his car and left. Sandi didn't wait, she followed them, she needed to know where Tom lived...<br>
<br>
Scene 6: The next day, Lawndale High<br>
<br>
Jane: Soooo, are you gonna tell me before the end of the world??<br>
Daria: Alright, I've, well, we've decided to take our relationship to the next level...<br>
Jane: And are you gonna leave him like the last time?<br>
Daria: No, we both want it, and maybe I'll spend the whole night in Tom's house, so I have to tell mom that I'm gonna be in your house, OK?<br>
Jane: OK, and if she calls you?<br>
Daria: In the bathroom, the perfect answer, or better yet: don't answer any phone call<br>
Jane: And what about if she's too worried and goes to my house? I'm gonna have to tell her that you're with Tom... having sex!<br>
Daria: You know what? SHUT UP!<br>
<br>
Outside the school there was Sandi talking with the rest of the Fashion Club when she saw Tom's car arriving. Inmediatly she stoped talking and left<br>
<br>
Quinn: And Edward invited me to Chez Pierre...<br>
Sandi: Bye... I have something to do...<br>
Quinn &amp; Stacy: What?!<br>
Sandi: Hi Tom, right?<br>
Tom: Hi, I remember you... Sandi if I'm right<br>
Sandi: Do you remember me? god I can't believe it, and... what are you gonna do later?<br>
Tom: Why?<br>
Sandi: I thought we could know each other better...<br>
Tom: I'm dating Daria<br>
Sandi: So? I don't see the problem, we can get out anyway, maybe tomorrow or this afternoon<br>
<br>
In that moment Daria got out of the school and saw Tom talking to Sandi, it was obvious what she was trying to do, but she was surprised, Sandi could have a date with any guy, why should be interested in HER Tom?, but Daria knew it, why not? Tom was handsome and intelligent for her, and for Sandi he was charming and RICH<br>
<br>
Daria: Am I interrupting something?<br>
Sandi: Actually you are<br>
Tom: Hi Daria<br>
Daria: You don't look as happy as you were a minute ago Tom<br>
Sandi: Well, I have to go Tom... call me, here's my phone number... bye<br>
<br>
(Sandi leaves)<br>
<br>
Daria: Why was she talking to you?<br>
Tom: Actually I don't know<br>
Daria: And you're expecting that I believe that, aren't you?<br>
Tom: What are you talking about?<br>
Daria: She was flirting with you! don't you realize of that?<br>
Tom: (angry) Jane told me something similar when I was dating her, you know?<br>
Daria: Does it mean that you're gonna make out with Sandi too?<br>
Tom: (more angry) We better talk later Daria, but first ask yourself this question: why do you want make love to me if you don't trust me?<br>
<br>
(Tom leaves)<br>
<br>
Daria: Hey, wait!, alright go, I don't care!<br>
<br>
Scene 7: Quinn's room<br>
<br>
Daria: Tell her leave him alone<br>
Quinn: What?<br>
Daria: Tell your friend Sandi Griffin leave Tom Sloane alone<br>
Quinn: What do you mean?<br>
Daria: I saw her flirting with Tom, now please tell her leave him alone, she can get out with any guy, why does she want my boyfriend?<br>
Quinn: I don't know, she's been asking about Tom these days but don't worry about that Daria, it's just a crush, the next week Sandi won't remember Tom<br>
Daria: The next week? could it be before friday?<br>
Quinn: Relax Daria, I know it's just a crush, don't worry<br>
Daria: See you later Quinn<br>
Quinn: Where are you going?<br>
Daria: With Tom...<br>
<br>
Scene 8: Sloane's house<br>
<br>
(Bell rings)<br>
<br>
Daria: Hi<br>
Tom: Hey, are you still mad?<br>
Daria: I wasn't mad with you... and you're right, if I wanna make love to you I must trust you first<br>
Tom: And? don't you trust me?<br>
Daria: I do... but I don't trust Sandi... she was flirting with you and she knows that you're my boyfriend<br>
Tom: Of course she knows... I told her... listen Daria, don't worry, I love you... only you... you know that...<br>
<br>
Daria kissed him, of course she knew it, she loved him, that's why she wanted to be his, but she was still worried... Sandi... the president of the Fashion Club liked Tom, she was afraid, if Tom left her, she couldn't resist that...<br>
<br>
Daria: I love you Tom Sloane<br>
Tom: Our date still exists, right?<br>
Daria: Sure, what did you think?<br>
Tom: I thought that you were gonna leave me with my candles and my roses again. But now I know that you wouldn't do that to me<br>
<br>
Scene 9: The next day, Morgendorffers' house<br>
<br>
Quinn: Daria, can I talk to you?<br>
Daria: I guess<br>
Quinn: I know Tom's gonna come and I think you should know that Sandi's coming too<br>
Daria: Just tell her that if she stays away from my boyfriend, the blood won't run in this house<br>
Quinn: Daria, please! I'm doing my best<br>
Daria: I can see that Quinn and thanks<br>
<br>
(Bell rings)<br>
<br>
Quinn: I'm coming!!... Sandi! Hi!<br>
Sandi: Hi Quinn, is your sister here? or her boyfriend?<br>
Quinn: C'mon Sandi, you don't need that, in my opinion Tom really loves Daria<br>
Sandi: So it's gonna be such a great challenge to win his heart<br>
<br>
(Bell rings)<br>
<br>
Quinn: I'll go... oh... hi Tom<br>
Tom: Hi Quinn, is Daria here?<br>
Sandi: Tom?... so I see that I just need to pray and then the god will appear<br>
Tom: God?<br>
Quinn: Sandi, forget Tom, listen, I'm dating Sean and Edward, choose one of my boyfriends<br>
Daria: It's OK Quinn, I believe she wants MY boyfriend<br>
Sandi: Tom, actually I don't see what you saw in her, if you get out with me, you'll notice a huge difference<br>
Quinn: Stop it Sandi!<br>
Tom: Listen to me: I LIKE DARIA, I LOVE HER!, do you understand?<br>
Sandi: You can't love her!! she's boring, ugly and unwanted...<br>
<br>
Then Sandi pushed Daria, Tom was so angry, how dare she? but he didn't know that Quinn was even more angry... Quinn pushed Sandi and Sandi fell, confused...<br>
<br>
Quinn: I SAID STOP IT SANDI, SHUT UP!! you can't insult my sister!!!<br>
Sandi: Wh...Wh...what happened to you Quinn? I'm your friend...<br>
Quinn: GET OUT OF HERE, NOW!!!<br>
Sandi: But Quinn...<br>
Quinn: I SAID OUT!!!<br>
<br>
Quinn pushed Sandi out of the house, of course she didn't regret it, that frienship wasn't really worthy, Daria didn't know how to feel, Quinn helped her instead her friend, that wasn't the perfect moment to be with Tom, but it was perfect for talk to her sister<br>
<br>
Daria: Tom, can I see you later?<br>
Tom: Sure Daria, bye<br>
<br>
(Tom leaves)<br>
<br>
Daria: Um, Quinn, I know that was hard for you<br>
Quinn: Kind of... Sandi wasn't a really good friend, she was stabbing me in the back all time... and I couldn't let her insult you in our house<br>
Daria: Well, thanks<br>
Quinn: Don't worry about Tom, why didn't you tell me that he loved you? that's a big word you know: love<br>
Daria: I love him too<br>
Quinn: I know that Daria, I'm not that dumb... you were kind of jealous of Sandi, right?<br>
Daria: I wasn't jealous, I was afraid, you know Sandi is an attractive girl...<br>
Quinn: Daria, you, well... you're a beautiful girl too...<br>
Daria: Thanks Quinn I mean it<br>
<br>
Scene 10: Pizza King<br>
<br>
Jane: So, did Quinn actually do that?<br>
Daria: I swear, I couldn't believe it<br>
Jane: Wow, that's an advance in Quinn and Daria's relation, since she admitted you are her sister<br>
<br>
Then Sandi arrived, they look each other, Daria wasn't worried, she was more intelligent than Sandi, but Sandi thought that Daria didn't deserve Tom... Tom should be with the most popular girl in Lawndale... her<br>
<br>
Sandi: I still don't understand why Tom is with you...<br>
Daria: You could understand if you try to use your brain, it's just a suggestion<br>
Sandi: But you're nothing!!!<br>
Daria: If I'm nothing, why Tom is interested in me instead of you?<br>
Sandi: Maybe he wants Quinn...<br>
Daria: No, he doesn't, c'mon Sandi, you're jealous of me<br>
Sandi: What?? me, jealous of you?, I don't have any reason to be jealous of YOU, did you hear me?<br>
Daria: You're jealous 'cause I have what you want most... Tom Sloane, even you're popular and beautiful... and you don't have him. There's no way you could have him... if you're not me...<br>
<br>
Sandi was shocked, that damned truth!!, she couldn't say anything 'cause everything Daria said was true, every single word, she wanted Tom, and she wished to be Daria, so she could be with him... she... she was... jealous... of Daria<br>
<br>
Jane: Yes, you're jealous<br>
<br>
A tear crossed Sandi's face... it was true, and it was hard to accept it, the popular girl, the beautiful, the most wanted, the president of the Fashion Club... jealous of Daria. She had to get out of there or... she could tell her the truth...<br>
<br>
(Sandi leaves)<br>
<br>
Jane: As I said, she's jealous<br>
Daria: I guess that she just can't believe it... I can't believe it...<br>
<br>
Scene 11: Sloane's house<br>
<br>
Finally the friday arrived... Tom (as the last time) put roses and candles in his room, but he was afraid... if Daria leave him again, he couldn't resist that, and he hadn't seen Daria since Quinn and Sandi's fight. He thought he should call her... to ask her... no, that was a really bad idea... Daria could think that he was dying for her... it was true but... he didn't want to be hurt again<br>
<br>
(Bell rings)<br>
<br>
Tom: That's her... coming!!<br>
Mr. Andrews: Hi Tom, do you remember me? I'm your neighbour<br>
Tom: Hi Mr. Andrews<br>
Mr. Andrews: Call me George... have you seen my cat?<br>
Tom: No...<br>
Mr. Andrews: What a problem, do you have a beer or something?<br>
Tom: Actually I'm waiting for someone... George<br>
Mr. Andrews: OK, but if you see my cat, could you call me?<br>
Tom: Sure, bye<br>
Mr. Andrews: Bye<br>
<br>
(Mr. Andrews leaves)<br>
<br>
Tom: Please Daria, don't leave me alone tonight...<br>
<br>
(Bell rings)<br>
<br>
Tom: That must be George again,... I TOLD YOU THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN YOUR CAT, LEAVE ME ALONE!!<br>
Daria: Maybe you haven't seen it 'cause I don't have pets<br>
Tom: Daria! I thought it was my stupid neighbour... and I thought you wasn't gonna come<br>
Daria: You must trust me first...<br>
Tom: Good one, how have you been? I haven't seen you since, um, that day<br>
Daria: I'm fine, well...<br>
Tom: Nervous?<br>
Daria: No, I'm kind of scared<br>
Tom: You know, if you're not ready I can understand, we don't have to do it if you don't want<br>
Daria: But I want... I'm scared 'cause I don't have any experience on this, what about if I dissapoint you? I tried to think all night but...<br>
<br>
(Tom kisses Daria)<br>
<br>
Tom: Daria, to make love you don't need to THINK, you just have to FEEL, and you're beautiful, intelligent and awesome, there's no way you could dissapoint me...<br>
<br>
Daria embraced him, Tom not just love her, he trusted her too, she kissed him without fear, she knew what was going to happen but she wasn't scared anymore. They started making out heavier, Daria took off her jacket while they were going upstairs, to Tom's room, then they closed the door...<br>
<br>
Scene 12: Sloane's house, the next morning<br>
<br>
Tom woke up and saw an angel lying next to him. The last night was the most wonderful night he had ever lived, he wasn't virgin already, but it was the first time that he loved someone, he loved Daria, who was still sleeping, he touched her face so sweet, Daria woke up slowly and when she saw Tom, she smiled<br>
<br>
Tom: Hey, good morning<br>
Daria: Hey<br>
Tom: Are you OK?<br>
Daria: I couldn't be better<br>
Tom: Really?<br>
<br>
(Tom kisses her)<br>
<br>
Daria: NOW, I'm better<br>
<br>
Daria leaned her head against Tom's chest and sighed, she knew that it didn't matter if her parents found out about last night, she couldn't leave Tom even they want to<br>
<br>
Daria: I better get dressed... well I have to find my clothes first, I guess they're all over the place<br>
Tom: Mine too, wanna take a shower?<br>
Daria: God, Tom...<br>
Tom: That exactly you said last night, but with more enthusiasm..., c'mon a shower is always relaxing<br>
Daria: Tom, if I take a shower with you, well, relaxing is not the word I'd use for that... I better take that shower in my house...<br>
Tom: Alright... but you're missing something really good...<br>
<br>
Scene 13: Night, Morgendorffers' house<br>
<br>
Helen: Quinn, do you know where is Daria? she couldn't be with Jane the whole night and all day<br>
Quinn: Mom, you don't have to worry about Daria, she's...<br>
<br>
(Daria arrives)<br>
<br>
Quinn:...here<br>
Helen: Daria, where have you been?, your hair is wet...<br>
Daria: Jane and I went to the movies, when we got out of there it was raining, I'm tired, I'll go to my room<br>
<br>
When Daria entered in her room, she closed the door and touched her hair... it was still wet...<br>
<br>
Daria: (smiles) You were right Tom... a shower is always relaxing...<br>
<br>
