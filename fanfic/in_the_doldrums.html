<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">The
light blue sedan pulled up in front of Lawndale Elementary School,
near the designated entrance for first graders. On the other side of
the chain link fence adjacent to the building, a variety of
elementary school students played, chatted, and otherwise ran rampant
over the playground and sports field, enjoying the last few precious
minutes before the bell rang and they would be forced to line up and
go into the building to start another day of classes.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Inside
the car, Jake and Helen Morgendorffer turned to face the backseat,
smiling brightly.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Okay,
kiddo, here it is! Your new school!&quot; Jake said, grinning.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Isn't
it exciting?&quot; Helen added. &quot;I bet you can't wait to get in
there and make all sorts of new friends.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">in the
back seat, a young girl with long brown hair, about six years old,
looked at her parents from behind overly large glasses that she had
yet to grow into and said in a quiet voice &quot;I don't wanna go.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">jake
and Helen exchanged glances. Helen took point.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">&quot;Why
not, Daria?&quot; she asked. &quot;It's a brand new school in a brand
new town. It's completely different from Highland.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">&quot;The
kids won't like me.&quot; Daria answered, looking a2t the backpack on
her lap. Next to her, strapped into a car seat, her four-year-old
sister Quinn bounced happily up and down.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">&quot;Other
kids like me!&quot; she  chirped. Daria gave her a nasty sideways
glance.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">&quot;Quinn,
honey, we're talking to Daria right now. &quot; Jake said. He looked
back at Daria. &quot;C'mon, kiddo, they haven't even met you yet.
They're sure to like you!&quot;</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">&quot;That's
what you said when I went to school in Highland.&quot; Daria replied.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Jake
and Helen exchanged another glance. &quot;Daria,&quot; Helen said,
&quot;every new place is a new opportunity to make friends. There's
bound to be plenty of other kids who want to be your friend.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">&quot;You

<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">&quot;Daria,&quot;
Helen said, exasperation creeping into her voice. &quot;I don't have
time to argue with you about this. We have to get Quinn to day care
so your father and I can get to work. Now, are you going to get out
of this car voluntarily or do I have to drag you out?&quot;</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Daria
sighed, unbuckled her seatbelt, and opened the car door. She was
dressed in a green t-shirt, black shorts, and a pair of black Chuck
Taylor-style sneakers. She put her backpack on and stood at the curb,
her lunchbox in her other hand. Helen got out of the car and knelt
down next to her.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">&quot;I
know it's scary and that it seems like it will be hard to fit in,&quot;
Helen began, &quot;but you just wait and see. I bet that you'll have
a bunch of new friends by the end of the day.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Daria
shrugged. It was easier than fighting.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Helen
kissed her on the cheek. &quot;Okay, now you remember which bus you
need to take to get home, right?&quot;</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">&quot;Number
15.&quot; Daria answered.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">&quot;That's
right. Now, once you're off the bus, you go straight home. Don't talk
to any strangers, lock the door when you get home, and your father
will be home at four o'clock to look after you and Quinn. Okay?&quot;</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">&quot;Okay.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">&quot;Bye.&quot;
Daria said flatly. Helen smiled at her then climbed back into the
car. Jake honked the horn jovially and the sedan pulled away. Daria
turned and stared at the entrance to the school. </FONT>
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">&quot;They

<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Okay,
class, we have something exciting happening.&quot; said Miss DeFoe,
the first grade teacher. &quot;We have a new student joining us
today. Her name is Daria Morgendorffer. Let's all say hello to
Daria.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Hello,
Daria.&quot; The class chimed, some less enthusiastically than
others. Daria stood at the front of the class, clutching her book
protectively.  Miss DeFoe smiled at her.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Daria,
why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself. Where did you move
from?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
looked apprehensive for a moment then muttered &quot;We moved from
Highland. That's in Texas.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Well,
that must have been exciting, moving all the way across the country
like that.&quot; Miss DeFoe said. &quot;I bet you did a lot of fun
things in Texas.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
looked up at her. &quot;I like to read.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;That's
wonderful,&quot; Miss DeFoe replied, &quot;What sorts of things do
you like to read?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Um...books?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">There
was a giggle from several of the kids in the class. Daria looked at
them, eyes wide and flushed in embarassment, then stared at her
shoes. Miss DeFoe got a concerned look on her face, and decided to
change tactics.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Who
has a question for Daria?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Several
hands went up and Miss DeFoe picked a boy in the second row, who had
a winning smile, black hair, and was dressed in jeans and a football
jersey with the number 1 on it.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;All
right, Kevin, go ahead.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Um,
yeah! Why's your name so weird?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
blinked. &quot;My name's not weird.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Yeah,
it is.&quot; Kevin said, matter-of-factly. &quot;Doreea
Morgenfluffer. That's weird.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Kevin's
assessment was echoed by several other members of the class. Daria
flushed even further and frowned. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;My
name is Daria, not Doreea,&quot; Daria said, raising her voice
slightly. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;And
why are your glasses so big?&quot; said the perky girl with the big
eyes and blonde pigtails sitting next to Kevin. &quot;Are you blind?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;I'm
not blind!&quot; 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Then
why do you need such big glasses?&quot; the blonde girl asked. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;I'm
growing into them!&quot; Daria protested. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Miss
DeFoe held up her hands. &quot;Brittany, we want to make Daria feel
welcome. It doesn't matter how big her glasses are or how different
sounding her name is.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Kevin
piped up again. &quot;My dad says people with glasses can't do
anything. He says that  they're...um...'nerdy little piss ants!'&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Kevin
Thompson!&quot; Miss DeFoe snapped. &quot;You know better than that!&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Sorry,
Miss DeFoe,&quot; Kevin said, slumping down in his seat. Miss Defoe
pointed at a stool in the far corner of the room.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;I
believe you know where the Time Out Area is?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Aw
man.&quot; Kevin moaned. He got out of his chair and trudged to the
stool in the corner. As he passed by Daria he frowned and whispered
&quot;You got me in trouble.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
blinked at the hostility and sighed. Why did the teachers always do
this to her? It always ended up with someone in trouble and it was
always her fault.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Miss
DeFoe smiled down at Daria. &quot;Okay, Daria, I think that's enough
questions. Go ahead and take your seat.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
walked to her desk in the third row. As she sat down, Brittany turned
to look at her and stuck her tongue out. Daria sighed again, and
waited for Miss DeFoe to start the first lesson.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">--</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Things
didn't improve at lunch time. When the bell rang, Daria recovered her
lunchbox and went down to the cafeteria with the rest of her class.
But nobody wanted her to sit next to them. Most of her classmates had
been sitting together since school began and didn't want to give up
their places. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
looked around and found an empty space next to a redheaded boy with
prominent freckles, dressed in a yellow polo shirt. He had an
assortment of plastic trinkets and toys positioned around his lunch
tray. Daria's lips curled up in a slight smile. The boy had some
really cool stuff.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">She
walked over to the table and started sitting down opposite the boy.
No sooner had she done so, than he looked up sharply.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;What
are you doing?&quot; he asked, suspiciously.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Um...sitting
down so I can have lunch?&quot; Daria answered. The boy snorted.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Not
here. This table's for BOYS only. Go sit over there with the GIRLS.&quot;
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;There
aren't boys and girls tables. We can sit anywhere we want.&quot;
Daria argued. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Well,
I don't want you sitting here!&quot; the boy snapped. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;I
just...&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Just
what?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;I
just wanted to see your stuff...&quot; Daria mumbled, looking down at
the table. The boy frowned again and waved his hand in the air. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Miss
DeFoe!&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">The
teacher, who had pulled lunchroom duty this week, approached. &quot;Yes,
Charles? What is it?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;This
GIRL is trying to take my collection!&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;I
was not!&quot; Daria snapped. &quot;I just wanted to see them!&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Miss
DeFoe put a hand on Daria's shoulder. &quot;Calm down, Daria, it's
okay. Charles, what have we discussed about boys and girls?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Girls
are just as good as boys in lots of things.&quot; Charles muttered,
in the tone of someone who had been forced to repeat the phrase many,
many times before.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;That's
right. Now, do you have something to say to Daria?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Charles
looked at the teacher then at Daria. Daria looked back at him,
waiting. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;You
stay away from my stuff...GIRL!&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Miss
DeFoe sighed. &quot;Daria, why don't you go sit over at that table. I
need to have a little talk with Charles.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
got up and trudged over to an empty table. Behind her, Miss DeFoe
began her latest round of lessons in remedial gender relations with
Charles. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
tossed her lunchbox on the table and opened it. She pulled out a
sandwich, some potato chips and her thermos of milk. She took the
sandwich out of the plastic bag and bit into it. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">She
stopped after the first bite and peered into the sandwich, and
sighed. Her mother had put strawberry jam on her peanut butter
sandwich, despite Daria telling her multiple times that she only
liked grape. It was Quinn who liked strawberry. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">She ate
the potato chips for lunch.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">--</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">After
lunch, the first graders were allowed to go outside and play on the
playground. Daria decided to avoid any more problems with the class
and went and sat under a tree with her copy of &quot;The Phantom
Tollbooth.&quot; She found her place and began reading, imagining
herself traveling to the city of Dictionopolis in place of Milo, the
book's hero.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">After a
few minutes a shadow fell across her. Daria looked up and saw a girl
standing in front of her. The girl was dressed in red overalls,
spattered with random splotches of paint here and there, a black
t-shirt, and sneakers. She had short black hair that had been pulled
back into a short ponytail. A blue butterfly barrette was clipped
into her hair. The girl had the bluest eyes Daria had ever seen. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">The
girl held up a grubby hand. The palm was coated in dried green finger
paint.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Hi!&quot;
she said.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Um...hi.&quot;
Daria replied. She recognized the girl as one of the kids sitting in
the back row of her class. She and the other girl looked at each
other for a few moments, then Daria went back to her book. The girl
in the red overalls walked around her, clasped her hands behind her
back and leaned over Daria's shoulder.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Whatcha
readin'?&quot; she asked. Daria looked up, frowning. But the frown
disappeared when she saw that the girl seemed genuinely interested in
the answer to the question.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Um..it's
called 'The Phantom Tollbooth.'&quot; 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Oh.&quot;
The girl replied. There was silence for a moment then: &quot;Any
pictures?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;A
few.&quot; Daria answered, not looking up. The girl nodded, watched
Daria read for a few seconds, then jerked the book out of her hands.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Lemme
see!&quot; she said, paging through the book. Daria's eyes widened
and she reached up frantically.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Give
me my book back!&quot; 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;I
just wanna see the pictures!&quot; the girl protested. Daria got to
her feet and made to grab the book, but the girl ran off with it.
Daria began chasing her.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;GIVE
ME BACK MY BOOK!&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"> The
two girls dashed across the playground. Daria found herself breathing
hard as the girl led her on a chase past the swings, under the monkey
bars, around the seesaw, and onto the stupid balance bar that every
playground had but nobody ever actually used. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
grit her teeth and willed herself to run faster, but no matter how
hard she pushed herself, the girl in the red overalls seemed to be
able to run faster than that. The girl looked over her shoulder, saw
Daria behind her, and smiled brightly. Daria frowned and forced
herself to run faster.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"> The
girl made a hard right away from the playground equipment, onto the
asphalt where the hopscotch, kickball, four square, and tetherball
courts were painted. The two girls ducked and dodged their way past
the older kids from the second and third grades who were using the
courts, raising shouts of protest and annoyance.  
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">The
girl in the red overalls leaped over the concrete curb dividing the
asphalt from the athletic field and started charging up the low hill
that acted as a natural barrier between the sports fields and the
playground. Daria took a deep breath, grit her teeth and poured on
the speed, closing the distance between her and the girl, who was now
fighting against the incline of the hill. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
jumped the curb and charged up the hill, the girl reaching the crest
just ahead of her.  With a cry of exertion, Daria leaped into the air
and up the hill, colliding with the girl's ankles. The two became
entangled, Daria's book went flying and all three began rolling down
the other side of the hill. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria's
vision was a blur of color as she and the other girl rolled and
bounced their way down the hill. Swirls of red, green, brown, blue,
white and other colors flashed  past her vision. Suddenly, what few
details she could make out were lost and Daria's eyes widened as she
realized she had lost her glasses.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">She
pushed off the other girl, and the two separated, canceling some of
their momentum. They stopped rolling and slid to a halt at the bottom
of the hill. The girl was laughing hysterically. Daria stood up and
peered around, trying to find her glasses. As she looked, the girl
sat up, still giggling.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Shut
up!&quot; Daria snarled. &quot;You made me lose my glasses!&quot; 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">The
girl didn't answer, but her breath hitched as she tried to get her
laughter under control. Daria clenched her fists but forced herself
to turn away. As she did, she felt her foot come into contact with
something. She looked down and saw the toe of her shoe had bumped
into something black. She reached down and found the familiar shape
of her glasses. She let out a sigh of relief and put them on. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">She
frowned again as she realized there was a large scratch across one of
the lenses. She shot a dirty look at the girl, who was still lying on
the grass. Daria stalked over, located her book, picked it up and
began walking back up the hill.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Wait!&quot;
came the girl's voice. Daria paused for a second and glared at the
girl, who had gotten to her feet and was following her.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;What?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;I
still wanna see the pictures!&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria's
lip curled up in a snarl and she started making her way up the hill,
the girl following behind her. As she reached the crest of the hill,
Miss DeFoe appeared, looking stern.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;What
on earth is going on here?&quot; she demanded. Daria looked at her
with trepidation then pointed at the girl, who was ascending the
hill.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;She
took my book and wouldn't give it back.&quot; 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Miss
DeFoe frowned and sighed when she saw who Daria was pointing to.
&quot;Jane Lane, do we need to have ANOTHER little talk?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Jane
looked up, blue eyes wide. She bit her bottom lip and looked at the
ground. &quot;No, Miss DeFoe.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Miss
DeFoe folded her arms. &quot;Now, why did you take Daria's book?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;I
just wanted to look at the pictures. She wouldn't let me.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Miss
DeFoe looked at Daria for a moment. Daria hugged the book to her
chest, protectively. Miss Defoe quirked an eyebrow and went back to
Jane.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Jane,
the book belongs to Daria. Whether she lets you look at the pictures
or not is up to her. If she didn't want you to look at her book, you
should have respected her decision.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Jane
looked contrite and Daria smiled in satisfaction. The smile quickly
faded when Miss DeFoe turned her attention to her.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;And,
Daria, you didn't need to go chasing after Jane. You should have
gotten a teacher and we would have been able to get your book back
without all this chaos. Now, you two apologize to each other.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
and Jane stared at each other, both mortified. Jane continued looking
at the ground, but glanced at Daria out of the corners of her eyes. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;'m
sorry I took your book.&quot; she mumbled. Daria frowned and opened
her mouth to let Jane have it.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Daria...&quot;
Miss DeFoe said, voice stern.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;I'm
sorry I chased you and made you fall down the hill.&quot; Daria said,
practically choking on the words. Miss DeFoe smiled.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Good!
See, things work out much better by talking. Now, lunch is almost
over. You two get ready to go back inside.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Yes,
Miss DeFoe.&quot; both girls chorused, following the teacher back to
the school building.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">--</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">The
afternoon classes passed quickly enough. Daria answered so many
questions in class that she was starting to get mean looks from the
other kids, especially Kevin and Brittany, who seemed to be having
difficulty keeping up. Daria took a secret delight in that knowledge.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">During
free reading time, Daria glanced back behind her at Jane's desk. Jane
didn't appear to be reading. Instead, she had her crayons out and was
drawing on a piece of paper. Daria thought about telling Miss DeFoe,
but decided not to. She had acquired a reputation as a tattletale
back in Highland, when she told the teacher about the two stupid boys
who had brought a cigarette lighter to class, and while the teachers
told her she did the right thing, the other kids didn't agree and
didn't want Daria playing with them anymore. Better to not attract
any more attention to herself.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Finally,
the bell rang, ending the school day. Daria picked up her backpack
and lunchbox with relief, ready to go back to the safety of her room.
As she made her way to the school exit, a foot lashed out and tripped
her, sending her sprawling on the floor. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria's
cheeks burned red as the kids around her laughed. She looked up and
saw Charles waving at her from the door.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;That'll
teach you. Stay at your own table...GIRL!&quot; He crowed before
running out the doors. Daria got to her feet and stalked out the
door, trying to ignore the burning sensation in her face.  
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">She
stopped outside the school and scanned the buses, looking for number
15. She found it and began walking towards it when she heard the
singsong chanting coming from nearby.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Crazy
Jane, Crazy Jane, youngest of the Crazy Lanes!&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
turned, frowning, and followed the sound of the voices. She rounded
the corner of the school and saw nine or ten kids, some from her
class, some older standing in a  circle. One older girl, a third or
fourth grader, was inside the circle holding a blue backpack up by
one strap. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
came closer, but not close enough for anyone to notice her. Through
the gaps in the crowd, she could see Jane standing there, fists
clenched, looking at the ground. The black haired older girl sneered
at her, brandishing the backpack.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;C'mon
Crazy Jane, don't you want it?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;'es.&quot;
Jane sniffled. It was then that Daria realized Jane was crying. Her
frown deepened. She knew this type of setup all too well.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;I'm
sorry, what was that?&quot; The older girl said, cupping a hand to
her ear. &quot;You'll have to speak up, I don't speak Crazy.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;I'M
NOT CRAZY!&quot; Jane howled, her head flashing up. Her cheeks were
wet, and her blue eyes puffy. &quot;Gimmie my backpack, Monique!&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Monique
gave a cruel grin. &quot;Well, come take it then...Crazy Jane.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Jane
sniffled, wiped her eyes and charged forward, leaping into the air,
trying to grab her backpack. Monique held it just far enough for it
to be out of Jane's reach. Jane kept leaping and grabbing, trying to
get her backpack. The crowd started up with the &quot;Crazy Jane&quot;
taunt again.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Awww,
you don't want it then? Okay, well, I guess that means it and
everything in it is mine, then.&quot; Monique opened the backpack and
began pulling out Jane's books, tossing them on the ground. Jane
looked on in horror as her crayons came next, Monique &quot;accidentally&quot;
stepping on them with a sickening &quot;snap.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
felt her cheeks flush with anger. This wasn't just ordinary bullying,
this was outright cruelty. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Oooh,
what's this?&quot; Monique pulled out a sheet of paper. On it was a
fanciful and highly detailed picture of a three eyed cat with yellow
fur and blue polka dots. Daria found herself transfixed by the
vibrant colors and the way it actually looked like a real cat...well,
sort of. She knew she'd never be able to draw anything like that,
anyway.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;What
the heck is this?&quot; Monique said. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;It's
a jaguar!&quot; Jane yelled. &quot;And it's mine!&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Monique
let out a cruel laugh. &quot;A jaguar? Really. Doesn't look like one
to me. You know what I think it is? It's crap.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Jane
could only stare, wide eyed, as Monique ripped the drawing to shreds.
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Crazy
crap from your crazy family,&quot; Monique said as she systematically
shredded the drawing. &quot;My mom says your parents ought to be
locked up, and you should be put into an orphanage.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Jane
had started crying again, tears running down her cheeks as she looked
at the remains of her drawing blowing around on the grass. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Monique
kept talking. &quot;Yeah, you know what happens to crazy kids like
you in an orphanage? They stay there until they grow up and then they
get sent to jail. Nobody wants crazy people like you around, Crazy
Jane. They should take your whole family away. Nobody in this town
wants them here. Why don't you just go somewhere and die, Crazy Jane?
Nobody would care. In fact, everybody would be just plain thrill--&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;LEAVE
HER ALONE!&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
shoved her way through the older kids and stood in front of Jane. She
took advantage of Monique's surprise and ripped the backpack out of
her hands. Daria handed it to Jane, who wiped her eyes and sniffled a
quiet &quot;thank you.&quot; Jane dropped to her knees and began
refilling her backpack.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Who
the hell do you think you are?&quot; Monique snarled, gloweirng down
at Daria. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;You
leave her alone. She didn't do anything to you.&quot; Daria said
quietly.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Oh
yeah? And what are you going to do about it? Huh? You wanna fight?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Monique
flashed a quick smile at the onlookers and balled up her fists.
&quot;C'mon then, Shorty, you think you're so tough.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
looked the older girl over, her expression blank. &quot;You're
stupid.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Monique
blinked. &quot;You what?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;You're
stupid.&quot; Daria repeated. &quot;You have the brains of a dead
squirrel on the freeway.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Monique
just continued staring, unable to comprehend what was happening.
Daria gave a close mouthed smile.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;I've
met bricks smarter than you. At least the bricks never picked on
somebody smaller than them.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Why
you little--&quot; Monique's face contorted with rage and she reached
out for Daria.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Who,
using knowldege gleaned from the medical dictionary her parents kept
for emergencies, lashed out with her foot and dug the toe of her shoe
hard into the soft cartilage under Monique's kneecap. Monique howled
in pain and collapsed onto the ground. Daria turned to Jane, gripped
her hand and yelled &quot;RUN!&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">The two
girls took off as fast as they could, bashing their way through the
older kids and down the sidewalk. Daria took a quick glance behind
them and saw Monique lurching along, a couple of her friends slightly
ahead of her.  Daria turned her attention back in front of her and
willed her legs to keep running, 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">She had
thought to head back to the first through third grade playground and
find Ms. DeFoe, but as they reached the playground Jane tugged on her
hand.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Keep
going! Around the back!&quot; Jane yelped. Daria, out of breath,
nodded and kept running.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;I'M
GONNA GET YOU, YOU LITTLE SNOTS!&quot; Monique's voice held the
promise of torment and agony if she ever caught them. That was all
the motivation Daria needed to keep up with Jane. She didn't dare
look behind them again.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Jane
pulled into the lead and disappeared aroudn the corner. Daria grit
her teeth and pushed herself onward, rounding the corner at high
speed.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">She
slammed into something that went &quot;oof!&quot; and brought her to
a halt. Hands clamped down on her shoulders and Daria looked up in
fear, sure that Monique had gotten ahead of them.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Instead
she looked into the face of a  tall, slender 11-year-old boy with
spiky hair and sleepy eyes. He looked down at her in surprise, then
up again as Monique and her friends rounded the corner and skidded to
a halt. His brow furrowed and he looked back down at Daria.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Did
she hurt you?&quot; he asked in a soft voice. Daria blinked and shook
her head no, too out of breath to speak. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">The boy
looked back at Monique and titlted his head slightly. &quot;Janey?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Jane
stuck her head out from behind the boy. &quot;She took my backpack,
broke my crayons and tore up my jaguar. Daria saved me.&quot; 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">The boy
nodded and his thick angular eyebrows came together in a frown. He
moved Daria behind him. &quot;Stay here with Janey. I'll deal with
this.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
watched as the boy walked over to the mean girls. She expected him to
start yelling like her dad sometimes did when he got angry at
something on TV or in the newspaper. But that didn't happen.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">What
did happen is Trent pointed at her and Jane a couple of times, then
at Monique, then at himself. They were too far away for Daria to make
out what was being said, but she caught the word &quot;penny,&quot;
and blinked as Monique's face went pale. She and her friends looked
at each other then turned and went back the way they had come.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">The boy
watched them leave then turned around and walked back towards Jane
and Daria. Jane dashed up and leaped into his arms. She threw her own
arms around his neck and kissed him on the cheek. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Thank
you, Trent! I love you!&quot; she squealed.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Trent
smiled. &quot;Anything for you, Janey.&quot; He put Jane down and the
two walked over to Daria. &quot;So, you're Daria, right?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
blushed and nodded, looking at her shoes again. &quot;Yeah.&quot; she
said quietly.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Well,
thanks for looking out for Janey. Monique and her friends shouldn't
bother you guys anymore. But if they do, come find me. I'll deal with
it.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Okay.&quot;
Daria mumbled. &quot;I need to go catch my bus. I have to go straight
home.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Can
we give Daria a ride?&quot; Jane asked Trent. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Depends
on Penny. She's supposed to pick us up. Let's go see if she
remembered.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Kay!
 C'mon, Daria!&quot; Jane grabbed one of Trent's hands and  began
pulling him back towards the front of the school. Trent smiled at
Daria again and held out his other hand. Daria looked at it then up
at Trent's face.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Don't
worry, Daria,&quot; he said, &quot;It's pretty clean.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
reached out and took Trent's hand. She was surprised by how warm it
was. Trent smiled and led the girls back to the front of the school.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">---</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Jane's
older sister Penny grumbled a little about having to go out of her
way, especially when it took Daria a few minutes to find the piece of
paper with her new address on it, but when she heard how Daria had
kicked Monique in the knee, she laughed and said that a ride was the
least she could do for her.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
enjoyed the ride to her house. Penny had a really fast car and took
corners at high speed. Daria's parents never drove that fast, and
they didn't get everyone in the car to let out cowboy yells when they
almost went on two wheels rounding a corner either.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">All too
soon, the ride was over and the dark blue Plymouth pulled up in front
of the red brick house on Glen Oaks Lane. Trent got out of the car
and let Daria out of the backseat. Daria slung her backpack onto her
shoulders and picked up her lunchbox. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Thank
you for the ride.&quot; she said politely.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Anytime,
kid.&quot; Penny said from the driver's seat. &quot;Come on Trent, I
got places to be.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Trent
nodded and got in the car. &quot;See you around, Daria.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
nodded. The car door slammed and the engine revved. Suddenly, there
was commotion from inside and the passenger side window rolled down.
Jane leaned out form the back seat.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Hey,&quot;
she said, &quot;if your mom says it's okay, you wanna come over to my
house and play tomorrow? We got a gazebo!&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
had never seen a gazebo before. And it sounded like a lot more fun
than just sitting at home and telling Quinn to stop bugging her. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Mom
says I can only go over to places if someone responsible's there.&quot;
she told Jane. her expression begged Jane for there to be someone
responsible at the Lane house.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Jane
looked back at Penny. Penny looked at Jane, then sighed.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Oh,
all right. If Mom's not back before you get out of school, I'll
babysit. But only for the afternoon, got it?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Got
it!&quot; Jane grinned. Trent smirked and handed Daria a scrap of
paper. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;That's
our phone number. Sometimes it gets turned off though, but if your
mom wants to call and make sure we're okay, she can.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Thank
you.&quot; Daria said. 
</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;All
right, are we done here?&quot; Penny said irritably, &quot;Some of us
have a soul sucking job to go to. I swear, one of these days I'm just
gonna chuck it and go to Guatemala or something,&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;You
say that all the time.&quot; Jane said.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Yeah,
but one day I'll mean it.&quot; Penny replied. She put the car in
gear. &quot;Siddown, squirt.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;Okay,&quot;
Jane waved out the window one last time. &quot;Bye, Daria! See you
tomorrow.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
waved as the car drove off. As it did a small smile crept across her
lips. She pulled her house key out of her pocket and let herself
inside.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">---</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">The
rest of the day passed normally. Her dad came home with Quinn and the
two sisters passed the time with TV, books, and Barbies. (Daria's
books, Quinn's Barbies.) Her dad made dinner and had it ready by the
time her mom got home. They all sat down to eat. <BR><BR><BR>

<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">They
had lasagna.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;So,
Daria,&quot; Helen said, &quot;How was your first day of school?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Daria
looked at her mom and dad and thought about telling them about the
stupid kids who made fun of her name and glasses, or how Charles had
wanted nothing to do with her because she was a girl, or the
strawberry jam on her sandwich, or how Monique and her rotten friends
had chased her all over the school grounds. But, she realized that
wasn't important. That was just life. Her parents were used to her
complaints.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">She
decided to tell them what was really important.</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">&quot;I
made a friend.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">---</P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">The
next day, after school at the Lane house, Daria let Jane see the
pictures in her book.</P>
