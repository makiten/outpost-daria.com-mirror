a <I>Daria</I> ficlet
<P>
by wyvern337
<P>
The woman fussed with the girl's coat and scarf. It was <I>cold</I>
out, after all -- had just snowed the night before -- and she
wanted to make sure she was properly bundled-up before letting
her out to play with her friends. After all, her daughter was
all she had left.
<P>
<I>All I've got left,</I> she reflected bitterly, <I>and all I've
got to show.</I> 
<P>
All she had left from, or to show for, a failed, loveless marriage.
Matched by a career that had stalled as she'd unfailingly driven
everyone around her away with her lousy attitude and horrible
people-skills.
<P>
&quot;I really hope Rachel's not there at the park,&quot; said
the girl sullenly. &quot;She always tries to take over and get
everyone to do what <I>she</I> wants, when <I>I </I>want to--&quot;
<P>
&quot;If you're friends it shouldn't matter who's in charge,&quot;
interrupted the girl's mother. &quot;Friends are <I>worth</I>
keeping, even if it sometimes means not getting what you want.
Back in high school I had a friend. She was my <I>best</I> friend,
the best I ever had.&quot;
<P>
<I>The <B>only</B> one I ever had, </I>thought the woman to herself.
<P>
The girl rolled her eyes. <I>Not <B>this</B> one again.</I> 
<P>
&quot;It was like that through most of high school,&quot; the
woman continued, &quot;even though I really didn't deserve it,
as many things as I did to sabotage our friendship, mostly because
I didn't get my way as much as I wanted. Still, she put up with
me -- I don't know why, she could've done so much better -- until
we were most of the way through. Then she went and got herself
a boyfriend, senior year -- a real one, not just some guy she
was dating. Well, I just <I>had</I> to have him for myself! There
was no way I was going to stand being second-best! So I plotted
and connived and, finally, I managed to steal him from her. Well,
of course <I>that </I>was the end of our friendship...there was
no way she could forgive me for it, and no way I <I>deserved</I>
to be forgiven. I lost the only real friend I ever had because
I was so jealous and self-centered.&quot;
<P>
She was really talking more to herself than to her daughter by
now, as she continued. &quot;And I know just why I was like that,
too, though I didn't figure it out until years later. It was the
fault of an uncaring parent with no real idea of just what kind
of job they'd undertaken when they'd had children. <I>Or maybe
it was just a case of passing on what they'd gotten from <B>their
</B>parents, doing to me what'd been done to <B>them</B>!&quot;</I>
she continued, her voice rising and growing louder as she began
to become angry at the memories.
<P>
<I>&quot;Hell, maybe it was even <B>genetic</B>, monsters breeding
monsters! No end to it, one after another down through the years!&quot;</I>
she continued, beginning to rant.
<P>
&quot;<I>Raise a daughter who could <B>cope</B> with the world?
Oh, how could she do <B>that</B> when she was too busy turning
her into a hateful little <B>bitch!?</B> Thanks a</I> <I>lot,</I>
<I><B>Mother!</B></I>&quot; she continued, railing against the
person she blamed for her problems and losses.
<P>
Her daughter, the front of whose coat she was still hanging onto,
began to pull away. Her mom always made her nervous when she got
angry like this.
<P>
&quot;<I>Sandi</I>,&quot; the girl began, &quot;--uh, I mean <I>Mom,</I>&quot;
she hastily corrected herself, remembering how her mother preferred
to be addressed.
<P>
At the sound of her daughter calling her name, Sandi pulled herself
back from the past, composed herself, and even managed a smile,
of sorts, as she gently cupped the sides of her daughter's face
in her hands.
<P>
&quot;I'm sorry, Quinn,&quot; she said. &quot;You know how Mommy
gets sometimes -- it's got nothing to do with you.&quot;
<P>
She let go, stood up straight, and continued. &quot;You go out
and have fun, and remember: if you're friends, it doesn't matter<I>
who's</I> in charge today.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Whatever,&quot; said Quinn, headed for the door. Her mom
sure could be weird sometimes.
<P>
Sandi watched her daughter leave. <I>All I've got left, and maybe
my last chance.</I>
