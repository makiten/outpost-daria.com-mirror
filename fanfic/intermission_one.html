<h3><span style='font-size:12.5pt'>Three years before Morgendorffers </span></h3>

<h3><span style='font-size:12.5pt'>Part 1 – Friday evening</span></h3>

<h1><span style='font-size:15.5pt'>Louis </span></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Louis had sat in a
night-bar, contemplating his life so far - the whole nineteen years of it. They
have passed as he had willed them, neither good nor bad. He didn’t believe in
good or bad anymore, such rules certainly didn’t apply to his family. For what
family could be considered normal, in which a girl - his sister - four years
his junior ran things? “I’m not a bigot,” Louis’s lips formed familiar words,
one of his mantras, “but I will not let Eve run my life. No way, no how! The
rest of you - do what you will!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>They had cut him off, of
course, for they would not do anything else. “To kill the doctor and the
physique’s payment handed to disease,” Louis whispered. “Shakespeare knew, what
he was doing, when he wrote ‘Lear’.” It was certainly true in the Laminar
household, where his sister remained in virtual charge before the mentally
deaf, blind and dumb parents of his, and he - the only one-eyed man in the land
of the blind - has been ousted to Middleton College, with only a curt monthly
allowance to remind him of them. Well, that wasn’t exactly true. Last week-end,
his mother and he had a talk. Apparently, his sister was entering high school,
and could use his help. Louis patiently reminded her of his opinions and that
they didn’t change. His mother realized that, and hanged-up. ‘Course, that
happened only after Louis used a lot of colourful words in his patient
reminder. Well, patient it was. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Louis chuckled. Fools! He
wasn’t really ousted from his home, he left, as he had planned. He had planned
to leave the house since he was twelve, and when he turned eighteen - last year
- that wish was granted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Louis grinned. A lot had
happened to him since he had left home. For one thing, he dropped his disguise
of a slacker. It was quite unnecessary now. Instead, Louis used his
newly-gained freedom to go his own way. His own way. That what counted. Not his
sister’s way. That was important too. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>At any rate, by now he was
quite stronger and faster than when he was in the past, and he was doing much
better than when he did it school. That was probably what brought forth the
attempt of his parents’ to reconcile with him. “Not bloody likely, Shautu,” he
said to himself, and grasping slightly the pendant under his clothing -
courtesy of Dega street. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Anyways, what he was doing
in this bar? Having a drink. Aside from alcoholic beverages, the bar also
served some very powerful coffee - and Louis liked to drink coffee. Any college
student did. Heck, Louis reasoned to himself, when those college students would
become graduates, the world’s coffee market may experience a sudden upward
boost. ‘Course, this would happen only if…</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Louis idly looked around
the bar. Aside from himself, the only customers in it were four bikers, members
of a gang led by some fellow named Walter, aka Corporal, nevermind why. Louis
seen Walter and his men before - there were sixteen of them or so - in the same
gym he worked-out on week-nights. He and them never mixed there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Suddenly the bar’s door
opened. Louis shifted around and he blinked. A girl had entered the bar.
Apparently a punk or a rocker. Louis’s expression remained stone-still. He and
girls didn’t really mixed; not that he was gay, of course. No, in fact, he was
quite straight; it was just that he… Louis suddenly became aware of the pendant
against his skin. His nostrils flared. Was it just his imagination, or-?</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Then the girl walked
towards him, and all of his doubts vanished.</span></p>

<h1><span style='font-size:15.5pt'>Monique</span></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Monique didn’t know what
did she opt to come to this bar. Well, she wanted to have a drink, and possibly
something else afterwards as well, but she could’ve gone to any other spot tonight.
No, it was something else that made her want to come here, but she didn’t know
what. And she didn’t care. She just really wanted a drink. And a lay. Monique
was not what one could call a chaste, or a good girl. Still, this dive - it
didn’t have the best reputation, even by Monique’s standards. But she wanted to
have a drink, and this dive had to do. Oh, it had to do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Inside, there were
customers already - way over ten rowdy guys, though not bikers, but beefy
enough. The exception was a tall, spindly Chinese character, who did his best
to melt into the background like a clothes’ rack, in order to avoid attention.
In Monique’s case, he quite succeeded - Monique didn’t want to do anything with
him - he emitted that type of aura, similar to a praying mantis’s. Then she
turned around. Whoa! There was yet another colourful character in this dive. He
was solidly built - like others, but apparently he and them weren’t “meshing”,
to quote LH’s English teacher O’Neill, for he and others had some empty space
between them. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Monique paused, studying
further the odd man. As she continued to look, she couldn’t escape from
thinking: “Escaped convict”. The guy, however, seemed unencumbered by this
fact... and then there were his eyes. They made Monique pause. They seemed to
drill completely through her - through everybody else too, she suspected.
Apparently, this guy was a quite decent judge of character. And as for Monique’s
own estimation of him... Well, not an escaped convict, obviously... more like
Middleton’s college student. Well, he’ll do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Monique smiled and went
towards the college student. “Hey pal - can I join you?”</span></p>

<h1><span style='font-size:15.5pt'>Walter (Corporal)</span></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Tonight began as an
ordinary night for Walter-Corporal, and neither were there any clues that it
was going to be any different. Rather... an ordinary night, full of drinking,
and fighting, and other such stuff. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>When they came into the
night-bar, it was empty. Except Louis Laminar, whom they privately called “Student”
between each other. They didn’t call him to his face, of course, because Louis
once managed to fight Walter’s first-hand man - Kun-shan - to a standstill. And
Kun-shan was very hard to beat in a fair fight, despite the fact that he was
built like a stick. His arms were as tough as steel bars, and his body was
seemingly impervious to pain, and yet Louis managed to fight him to a
standstill <i>and </i>get respect from him. And from the rest of Corporal’s
gang, of course. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Besides, Louis was a pretty
quiet guy. Walter and his gang ran into him before - usually in the work-out
session of the gym - and he never showed any hostility or friendliness towards
them, except for Kun-shan. The two were cautious for some reason around each
other. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>So-o, just Walter, his gang
and Louis-Student. And then <i>she </i>walked in. And things changed
immediately. It wasn’t that she was especially pretty; but her black hair, green
eyes, and slim built instantly reminded Walter of a cat. And Walter liked cats.
And furthermore... while there were at least five girls whom it didn’t take
much to win over, they also weren’t cheap - their “protectors” insured that.
And now here was a girl for whom those requirements didn’t apply... And all she
had to do was to join Walter or one of his men...</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>And then the girl promptly
beat the odds, and joined Louis.</span></p>

<h1><span style='font-size:15.5pt'>Kun-shan</span></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>A wave of worry rolled
through the night-bar, as Walter got up and went towards Louis-Student and the
new girl. Kun-shan, however, wasn’t worried. Both his master and Louis were too
smart for people to start an immediate fight here, especially because of a
strange girl. However, Kun-shan also doubted that that matter will be settled
peacefully, for Walter was used to getting what he wanted, and Louis... ever
since Kun-shan learned that Louis somehow became aligned to a god that warred
with Kun-shan’s god, Kun-shan didn’t doubt that Louis could handle Walter
before any of Walter’s men would leap into the fray. Or maybe not. Not all
Louis’ men were average people, after all. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Too many “maybes” and “what-ifs”,
Kun-shan sadly shook his head. It was smarter to tune-in to what Walter and
Louis were talking-about right now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Right now, Walter, Louis,
and the strange girl were all grouped around a single table, and the two men
were talking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Hello, Louis.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Walter. What may I do for
you?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Well, Louis, it’s like
that. For a time now, we’ve got along each other pretty well, no?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Judging from the wary look
Louis gave Walter, he had a different idea, but didn’t argue at this point. “Oh?
So?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“However, just because we’re
not enemies, doesn’t mean you can do anything you want.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Louis leaned forwards,
looking unhappy. “Walter, here’s the buzz: I <b>won’t </b>back away.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The girl looked worried. “Guys
really - I don’t want to cause trouble between the two of you!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>It was when things clicked
in Kun-shan’s head: a music band that plays in the Zon - Mystik Spiral! That
girl was with one of them - well, “was” may be the key point here, because in
present tense the girl being here and having a steady boyfriend at the same
time was unlikely. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Unless, Kun-shan’s dry
mantis-like face grimaced slightly, she’s here for some excitement. Well, she
had it now, he thought. He got up and walked to her, Walter, and Louis. “Is
there a problem, boss?” he asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Yes,” Walter said, looking
at his aide. “Louis here doesn’t get the idea of <i>my tax</i> on free girls.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“But this girl isn’t free -
she’s with some music band that plays around here sometimes.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Walter paused. That changed
things somewhat. “What group?” he asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Mystik Spiral, I think.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Does Louis know about
this?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Maybe he does and maybe he
doesn’t - who know? But I don’t think he cares or would care about that matter.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Walter paused, and looked
calculating. “So-o, when is their next concert due?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Tomorrow, I believe.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“A-ah, we’ll be there.”</span></p>

<h1><span style='font-size:15.5pt'>Monique</span></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Well,” Monique quietly
thought, “I just wanted for a guy to buy me something to drink and take me to
his home - nothing else. Instead - I get shoved right into a power struggle.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>She looked at the two guys.
Apparently, she did something wrong, for as soon as she sat next to the student
with a face of a convict, another young man went up to their table. He was a
few inches taller than the student, plus he had a lot of hair on his face, like
a werewolf would. Of course, werewolves were myths, but still...</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Louis.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Walter. What may I do for
you?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Well, Louis, it’s like
that. For a time now, we’ve got along each other pretty well, no?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Louis instantly tensed-up
and looked like he would argue the point. He didn’t, however. “Oh? So?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“However, just because we’re
not enemies, doesn’t mean you can do anything you want.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Louis leaned forwards. “Walter,
here’s the buzz: I <b>won’t </b>back away.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Monique started to worry -
this was not what she wanted to happen on her “free” evening - two guys flexing
their muscles at each other. “Guys really - I don’t want to cause trouble between
the two of you!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>It was at that point the
stick-thin Chinese walked-over to Walter of the big beard and took him aside.
After some conversation Walter and the Chinese left.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Our que to leave?” Monique
asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Why not?” Louis agreed,
looking thoughtful. “Want me to walk you home?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Want me to spend the night
with you?” Monique grinned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Louis smiled. The smile was
like a crocodile’s. “Don’t mind if I do.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>They left the bar together.</span></p>

<h3><span style='font-size:12.5pt'>Part 2 – Saturday morning</span></h3>

<h3><span style='font-size:12.5pt'> </span></h3>

<h1><span style='font-size:15.5pt'>Trent</span></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The morning turned-out to
be grey, sunless, dim. And Trent Lane, musician and guitar-player of the Mystik
Spiral couldn’t find fault with it. It was all because of that dumb fight with
Monique, about whether she could or couldn’t take care of herself. The fight
was dumb, the reason for fighting was dumber, and the result that Monique left
Trent was downright stupid. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>But why then Trent felt so
nervous this morning?</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>At this moment, there was a
knock on the door. Trent opened it. “Yes?” he spoke. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Outside, were three women.
One looked like Monique, with four or five years difference - Monique’s sister,
Alecto. Another one was a black-eyed, swarthy-skinned Metis girl, called Calais.
And the third one was a short, coppery-skinned, big-nosed and big-eared girl,
whom all called Effïndïe. What kind of name was <i>that</i>, Trent didn’t know.
“Yes?” he asked nervously. Monique’s band - the Harpies - always made him
somewhat nervous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Where’s Monique?” Alecto
bit-off the words. “We have an early band practice.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“I don’t know,” Trent
snapped back. “We had an argument last night and she stalked-off.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Peachy!” Calais
sarcastically said. “Why didn’t you try to stop her?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“That was the whole point
of the argument!” Trent protested. “Whether she could or couldn’t get along on
her own! Somebody riled her up before we two met!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Effïndïe gave a look to
Alecto that went unnoticed. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Trent shook his head. “Can
I go and get dressed now?” he asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Alecto sighed. “Get lost.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Trent complied, but in his
heart, he felt worry. What has Monique got herself into?</span></p>

<h1><span style='font-size:15.5pt'>The Harpies</span></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“So what do we do now?”
Effïndïe asked Alecto.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The lead Harpy paused. That
was a very good question. Ever since her sister failed to return at midnight as
she used to, she was concerned. Very concerned. And now those concerns were
affirmed by Trent Lane, who <i>didn’t </i>spent the night with Monique. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Maybe I should get in
touch with my boyfriend,” Calais suggested.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“No!” Alecto emphatically
said. While Calais’ boyfriend <i>was </i> a big-wig in Lawndale’s underworld, he was also a very unpleasant
person. ‘Course, so was Calais herself, but Calais didn’t have the
possibilities that her boyfriend had. The possibilities to do evil, that is. “Let’s
leave him out of it!” she firmly said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Effïndïe pulled calmly at
Alecto’s sleeve. “What do we do now?” she repeated her question. “’Tis
Saturday: lot of week-end people in town; possibilities increase drastically
that Monique left Lawndale area by now!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Now look, “Dance Arabesque”,”
Calais began, but never finished. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Excuse me,” somebody spoke
instead.</span></p>

<h1><span style='font-size:15.5pt'>Louis</span></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Louis wondered about the
soundness of his idea - taking the girl up on her offer. For you see, though
Louis wasn’t a caring, or considerate man, he was also smart. And not without
caution. And also he had an in-built natural alarm that was hollering rather
loudly at the black-haired, green-eyed girl that was walking side-by-side with
him. “So what’s your name?” he asked, feeling confident that he had <i>seen </i>her
somewhere before, in less than ordinary circumstances. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Monique,” the girl
carelessly replied. “Why do you ask?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>That clicked it - the
pieces settled in place. “Of the Mystik Spiral,” Louis said with affirmative. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Am not!” Monique instantly
huffed. “My music group is the Harpies!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“The Harpies. I see,” Louis
shrugged. That explained everything. Several days ago - like seventeen - Louis
was at the grunge club called Zon, where he heard the Mystik Spiral play. It
took an amazing amount on his self-control part from <i>not</i> going upon the
stage and killing each and every of self-proclaimed boy wonders. And now he was
about to screw the girlfriend of one of them? A wonderful revenge, and... what
the catch?</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>A quick memory search
quickly exposed the catch. The Harpies. <i>Another </i>music group - an
all-girl one. Lead by a girl - no, a <i>young woman </i>- called Alecto, who
was obviously Monique’s older sister. And unpleasant rumours circulated around
the Harpies - that they were connected to one of Lawndale’s very own drug
lords... So this is how the scales fell. On one cup - a very pleasant night
with Mystik Spiral’s very important groupie, on the other - a very real
possibility of gaining a new, terrible enemy...</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Baal and Gothmog!” Louis
cursed. “What to do, what to do...”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Suddenly he smiled. He knew
exactly what to do...</span></p>

<h1><span style='font-size:15.5pt'>The Harpies</span></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Excuse me,” somebody spoke
instead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The Harpies whirled around.
A large, powerfully-built man was standing before them, gazing down at them
from underneath his eyebrows. “Oh boy,” Calais snorted. “From which prison camp
did you escape from?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Calais - hush!” Alecto
said quickly. She didn’t enjoy thinking of fighting <i>that </i>guy - he looked
big and mean enough to do considerable damage even with Monique being with
them. “What do you want, mister?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Tell me - <b>you </b>have
a younger sister called Monique?” the man replied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Yes,” Alecto said, getting
up. “Where is she?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Currently - at my place,
sleeping soundly. When will you pick her up?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“You didn’t touch her?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“The girl was searching for
adventures on her foolish head, and if I know anything about Walter and
Kun-shan, I’ll say that somebody <i>will </i>have an adventurous and exciting
future, yes. I, however, know better than to mess with a drug lord’s call-girl,
so no - no sex.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Look pal - we don’t have
no deals with drug-lords - most of us. Certainly not Monique,” Alecto said. “As
for Walter - who’s he?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“You may know him as
Corporal, no? I’m Louis, or Student.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Ah. Corporal, yes. I know
off him, and I know Kun-shan,” Effïndïe spoke quietly. “Kun-shan is odd. He’s
got those tattoos...”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Kun-shan isn’t the only
one with tattoos,” Louis said grimly. “So back to your sister. When will you
pick her up or what?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Just a sec,” Alecto smiled
sweetly. “I need a word with my comrades.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>She took them aside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“What?” Calais asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Here’s the buzz, girls?
When Mystik Spiral performs next?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“On a- tonight.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Then the Harpies will be
there to cheer them and offer support. After all, they’re not exactly
strangers, that Trent boy is good to our Monique, no?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“You’re the boss,” the
other shrugged.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Good. Now I’m off to find
Monique.”</span></p>

<h1><span style='font-size:15.5pt'>Monique</span></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Monique awoke with a
splintering headache. What has happened last night? Well, Louis took her here,
gave her a drink, and then...</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>No, the floor hadn’t gave
way into Hell, and Monique didn’t fall into it, only to be grasped by a huge
black-skinned demon, wreathed in flames, with eyes like burning coals, who examined
her like a prized possession and all. No, it just had to be a very crazy dream.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Monique opened her eyes and
smelled something nice coming from the kitchenette. She went in that direction
and fund a large, iced jar. Inside it was alcohol, judging from the taste -
vodka. Next to the jar was a pot, only recently taken off the stove to
cool-off. Monique opened it - sausages in tomato paste. Monique shrugged and
began to eat. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Then the door opened, and
in came Louis, followed by - Alecto? “What are you doing here, sis?” Monique
asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“I could ask you very much
the same thing - what were you doing last night? Searching for the adventures
on your ass?” Alecto snapped back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Now see here!” Monique
said, waving a fork with a sausage on it. A large gob of still warm tomato
paste smacked the older Dupri sibling right in the nose. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Why you!” Alecto snapped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“A-hem!” Louis coughed. “If
the two of you are <i>finished</i>, then...”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Sorry!” Alecto snapped at
the man, then turned back to her sister. “Monique, come on. Thanks to your
foolishness, Trent and Mystik Spiral might be in trouble!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Can’t it wait?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Let’s go!” Alecto turned
to Louis. “You’re smart man, Louis, and I suggest you give it much thought -
will or won’t you be at the Zon tonight.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“I’ll keep it in mind,”
Louis said with a humourless, shark-like smile.</span></p>

<h3><span style='font-size:12.5pt'>Part 3 – Saturday night</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h1><span style='font-size:15.5pt'>Kun-shan</span></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Tonight, the thin Chinese
man thought dispassionately, was going to be exciting. First of all, he
received from Walter a set of instructions, which resulted clearly that he,
Kun-shan, should take Casca and Cassius with him to Zon’s back entrance and insure
that nobody tried to use it as an exit instead. Then, Louis-Student commented
that he was going on a date with the Harpies’ main singer called Alecto to the
same Zon. And finally, a fellow Kun-shan knew under the name of Rajeet
whispered to Kun-shan that tonight it wasn’t such a good idea to be at Zon,
listening to Mystik Spiral’s grunge music. But Kun-shan - like other men of his
calling - believed in loyalty above everything else, though not caution.  And so here he was, backed-up by Casca,
Cassius <i>and </i>Lothan, wondering if he and his men will be needed tonight. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Then the shouts started and
Kun-shan smiled. The party that Walter organized began.</span></p>

<h1><span style='font-size:15.5pt'>Jane</span></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>For some reason Jane was
worried as the Mystik Spiral - her brother and his friends - preformed in the
Zon tonight. Something was odd, something subtly was off - but it was there,
like a pale green snake, coiled and ready to strike. She didn’t know what it
was, but ever since Monique, her older sister, and the rest of the Harpies came
into the Zon to supposedly “support” Trent and the guys, Jane didn’t feel
hunky-dory. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Then there were other
customers - about ten or so of big bruisers, bearded, hairy, smelly, <i>and
tough</i>. They hang in a loosely-knit group and the way they eyed Trent and
his bunch made Jane even more worried.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Then yet another new
customer came in - another muscle-head, who, however, didn’t join the others
but went and talked briefly to Monique’s sister and left. And then Trent
stepped forth and spoke his usual: “Hey! We’re the Mystik Spiral, but we’re
thinking of changing our name. Hope you’ll like our performance tonight.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Trent stepped back and then
the muscle-heads’ leader yelled: “Get them!” </span></p>

<p class=MsoList><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Then everything dissolved. </span></p>

<p class=MsoList><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Into chaos. And anarchy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h1><span style='font-size:15.5pt'>An excerpt from ‘Lawndale News’ newspaper</span></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“...Yesterday, at about
eight o’clock in the evening, a grunge club’s regular “Battle of the Bands” was
replaced by much more irregular and bloody battle of two or so rival gangs.
Blood and various weapons were flying and splattering, furniture was splintered,
and at least one lamppost before the club got dented from the impact of
somebody’s cranium. Admittedly, the lamppost remained, whereas that somebody’s
cranium didn’t. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Other than that, there
weren’t many death casualties in the gang warfare; the speedy police appearance
was probably the reason for that. Fourteen or so young bandits were arrested;
curiously, they belonged to the gang of Corporal (real name Walter). According
to the police information, at least one gangster - called Kun-shan is still at
large, though Walter himself was apprehended...”</span></p>

<h3><span style='font-size:12.5pt'>Epilogue </span></h3>

<h1><span style='font-size:15.5pt'>Jane</span></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“...And so this is what
happened Daria, I swear. One moment, it is ordinary night at the Zon, the next
- Gettysburg! Everybody fighting everybody else, and Monique getting me, Trent,
and others out through the back door. And 
guess what we see? Two unconscious guys and a third one, his head
smashed on a lamp-post! I fainted after that and don’t recollect anything about
it ever since.”</span></p>

<h1><span style='font-size:15.5pt'>Alecto and Louis</span></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Ow, ow, ow-ow-ow,” Louis
groaned as Alecto administrated iodine and bandages to his face. “What are you
applying, woman?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Nothing out of the
ordinary, and I’m not your woman!” Alecto snarled. “How’d you get your nose
broken, anyways?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“A guy - I think it was
Lothan - went after me with a modified fireman’s hatchet. It had an iron nubbin
on the end without the blade.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Fortunately, you didn’t
meet that end,” Alecto sighed. “Again, thanks for sticking for me and my girls.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Girls? You and your sister
are one thing, but Calais and Effïndïe is another thing. Especially Effïndïe.
What is she - part goblin?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“I have my money on ghoul,”
Alecto sighed. “She <i>is </i>part Arabic, after all.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Mmm. Touched.
Coincidentally, Kun-shan is at large.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Kun-shan?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“A tall Chinese character,”
Louis sighed. “O Baal and Gothmog and the throne of Nock’ma’ar! It hurts!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Stop whining,” Alecto sighed.
“It’s good thing that it’s Sunday, no?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Yeah,” Louis sighed, and
suddenly grasped Alecto. And although his head was covered in bandages, he
smiled. “So Alecto, how about a date?”</span></p>
