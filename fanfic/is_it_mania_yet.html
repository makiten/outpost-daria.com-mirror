Rumble, eight teams, each with one man and one woman, fought in a single
elimination tournament. The two finalists are the team of Dewey "Shaggy" Rogers
and Jennifer "Burnout" Burns, and their opponents, Evan Johnston and Siobhan
"Chipmunk" Hogan of The Track Stars."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Barch:</b> "Shaggy and Burnout are possibly the craziest
pairing in the history of the LFC, but they are possibly the luckiest. Their
quarter final against Upchuck and Dawn Harris was a glorified handicap match
when Dawn turned her back on Upchuck, and really who could blame her? Then they
got really lucky in the semi final when they defeated Sandi Griffin and Joey
Black after Stacy Rowe interfered. I just think that they're out of their depth
here. Meanwhile, The Track Stars had a very convincing win over Josh Carter and
Brooke Watkins, as well as an upset win over Kevin Thompson and Brittany
Taylor. Add that to their chemistry from years of teaming and training
together, and you can see why I think Evan and Siobhan are the favourites."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Barch:</b> "And by God, didn't she earn it! She went toe
to toe with Brittany Taylor and Jodie Landon, both at their absolute best, not
to mention surviving all of that interference towards the end that pretty much
emptied the women's locker room."</p>

celebrate."</p>

all wrapped up as well)<o:p></o:p></i></p>

we're seeing in the ring right now. They live for moments like this!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Barch:</b> "They spend years training and working with each
other, sharing the highs and lows, a lot of them not seeing their families for
weeks at a time. It's things like this right here that is what makes it all
worthwhile."</p>

Daria, Jane and Stacy a hug as they finally get in the ring, tears of joy
streaming down her face)<o:p></o:p></i></p>
