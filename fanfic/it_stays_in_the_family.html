can't I borrow your cell phone?&quot; Daria turned in her seat, hoping against
hope that the whiny voice of her sister was only a part of some scary dream. <i><span
style='color:green'>If I continue ignoring it, I might wake up in my own bed
instead of waking up to find myself in Dad's car with him, Mom and Quinn on
some highway. Yeah, sure. Fat chance.</span></i> &quot;For the last time,
Quinn: You're not going to call one of your friends - or a boy, for that
matter!&quot; <i><span style='color:green'>Sure enough, that was her mother,
sounding even more strained than before.</span></i><span style='color:green'> </span>Daria
tried for another moment to reassemble the scattered parts of her dream - <i><span
style='color:green'>whatever it'd been about, it couldn't have been worse than
reality</span></i><span style='color:green'> </span>- before opening her eyes
slowly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>When her eyes were
finally open, she was greeted by the same scene she had been seeing for three
long hours before falling asleep at last. Jake was still driving; his gaze was
fixed on the road ahead while his hands clutched the wheel tightly. Helen sat
next to him with several files on her knees, one of which had fallen on the
floor as a result of her sudden turn to answer the complaint coming from the
backseat. Now Helen settled in her seat again and bent forward to retrieve the
escaped file. Daria turned her head to the right, where Quinn sat: her younger
sister looked very annoyed and fussed around in her purse for a lipstick or
something else, deliberately looking out of the window at the roadside as a
show of concealed anger over her mother's repeated stubbornness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Daria sighed
inwardly. <i><span style='color:green'>It was bad enough to drive the whole
morning confined with her closer family, not to mention hearing Quinn and Helen
quarrelling and Jake having been quiet since about five minutes after the
start. What was even worse, however, was the fact that she would have gladly
traded the present situation for the one which awaited them in about</span></i>
- she glanced at the old yellow wristwatch on her left arm - <i><span
style='color:green'>two and a half more hours from now, if Jake kept on driving
with approximately hundred mph.</span></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS";color:green'>Grandma
Evelyn's seventieth birthday... celebrated by a whole weekend with her three
daughters and their families.</span></i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'> Daria shuddered at the thought. <i><span style='color:green'>There
hadn't been such a family reunion for ten years - at Erin's wedding, Evelyn
hadn't been present and the explosive mixture the Barksdale clan was had fumed
and broiled, but not exploded like it had earlier.</span></i> But now everyone
would be present - <i><span style='color:green'>at Evelyn's home court, which
would give her grandmother the moral right to shoot off the first salvo of
barbs about the faults of Helen, Jake and their daughters, who would have to
tolerate it for the sake of celebration and then complain about it for the
whole trip back home</span></i>, Daria thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS";color:green'>Come
to think about it, she couldn't really blame her parents and Quinn for being
the raw nerves they had been since falling out of their cushy beds two hours
before dawn this morning. Quinn had had to cancel several dates as well as the
Fashion Club's Fantastic Fall Fad Finding which </span></i><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>(Daria knew very well) <i><span
style='color:green'>Sandi had scheduled for this weekend deliberately to make
Quinn &quot;shirk away from her duties as vice-president&quot;, as Sandi would
have called it. Jake had been forced to dump his business trip to the Maryland
State Fair where he had acquired several big clients in the preceding years,
most of which would be there looking for him; Daria knew that he had counted on
getting new contracts at the fair, which would have given his business a shot
in the arm. Helen would be away from her job instead of preparing the paperwork
for a big lawsuit against the town's biggest housing corporation, which meant
missing a round in the rat race for the full partnership Helen desired above
almost anything else.</span></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Ironically, the one
person in the car whose life was disturbed the least by the family reunion was
Daria herself: when it came up some months ago, she had complained to Jane how
a perfect weekend for &quot;Bad Movie Night&quot; would be wasted, but since
then, they had spent several Saturday nights at Jane's to watch TV or some borrowed
movies - and three weeks ago, Jane had found another friend to spend the time
with if Daria was not around... <i><span style='color:green'>Tom</span></i><span
style='color:green'>.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Daria looked out of
the window absentmindedly, her mind busy with Jane and the guy they had met at
the last Mystik Spiral concert. She knew that most guys considered Jane to be
more attractive then Daria, but up to now, every male who had taken interest in
her friend had been driven away again by Jane's nature and her unique views.
The occasional short flings Jane had were just another facet of her complex
personality and the guys had barely been worth the short time she had spent
with them. Daria had never really feared to lose her best friend to a guy,
especially since Jane had seen her four elder siblings failing at their
relationships and had vowed not to make the same mistakes, least of all those
that presented the need for a priest, a midwife - or both.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS";color:green'>But
now, a guy had appeared who seemed to like Jane's way of life</span></i><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'> - and he had some of the
character traits Jane had found only in Daria before: he was smart, witty and
sarcastic. Moreover, he did not seem to care about his social position or about
Jane's situation, which was a very touchy subject for her. <i><span
style='color:green'>If Tom had suddenly appeared at Lawndale High as a fellow
student, he might have been the perfect addition for our friendship</span></i>,
Daria thought grimly. <i><span style='color:green'>Too bad he appeared at the
Zen instead and took Jane away from me... hey, wait a second, did I really
think that?</span></i> She shook her head. <i><span style='color:green'>Stop it
now, Morgendorffer. Jane's found a boyfriend and I should be happy for her.
Besides, they'll probably break up soon, Tom will vanish and then it'll be just
me and Jane again.</span></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>She was pondering
the question how to say &quot;<i><span style='color:green'>I told you, didn't I</span></i>?&quot;
to Jane as soon as Tom would leave for good when her train of thought was
interrupted by Quinn leaning across the back seat. After retrieving a donut
from the bag in front of Daria's feet, she looked up and noticed that her
sister was awake. &quot;Oh, hi Daria. Thought you're sleepin'.&quot; she said
before taking a bite from her donut.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Daria gave her a
sour look. &quot;It's the only way to spend the time. You know I can't read in
the car and...&quot; she glanced over at her mother &quot;...someone took the
spare batteries I needed for my Discman to feed a cell phone.&quot; Helen gave
her other daughter a small smile. &quot;I already told you I'm sorry, honey.
Did you at least have a nice nap?&quot; Daria yawned. &quot;I think so, but I
had a weird dream. There was a stupid pink monster screaming that it wanted to
have something from you, I remember. I don't think it was successful.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Quinn frowned at
her. &quot;Very funny, Daria. You know some people have a social life they have
to organize somehow if they're dragged out of it for a whole weekend.&quot; She
looked at her mother. &quot;I don't except you to understand it, however.&quot;
&quot;That's not fair, sweetie. You know very well that I'm missing out on some
very important things also. Besides, the date for Mother's celebration has been
set four months ago, so you had enough time to organize whatever you wanted.&quot;
&quot;In that case, tell me please why you spent the first fifty minutes of the
trip 'organizing' your matters by robbing both Marianne and your current intern
of their much-needed sleep, Mom.&quot; Daria remarked. &quot;Didn't you have
four months to plan also?&quot; Helen turned in her seat to look at her.
&quot;It's not the same, Daria - and it weren't fifty minutes!&quot; Daria held
up her wristwatch. &quot;Sorry, Mom. If you force me to wear the stupid watch
Grandma gave me, I can just as well use it.&quot; &quot;Whatever. You should know
that I...&quot; &quot;So you're a worse planner than me, Mom?&quot; Quinn
asked. &quot;No way! But my work is so complicated...&quot; she broke off when
she saw that Jake had left the highway and rolled in front of a small gas
station while she had been bickering with her daughters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Jake slowed to a halt,
killed the engine and unfastened his seatbelt, then he turned to his wife and
daughters. &quot;Before you go on like that, honey, consider one or two things.
First: this is <u>your</u> mother we're driving to, please don't forget this.
Second: Nobody - neither we nor the kids - are looking forward to what will
inevitably end in open hostilities between you, your sisters and your mother
with everyone else caught in the carnage. So please don't spend all your energy
about some pointless argument who's suffering harder over this; we'll be
miserable enough as it is.&quot; He drew a breath. &quot;Quinn, do you need me
to get you anything from the shop which might keep you from starting another
fight with Mom?&quot; &quot;Yeah, a cell phone.&quot; Daria remarked. &quot;Daria,
since you're the only one here who seems to be able to sleep in the car, please
try it again. Believe me, I'd like to do the same, but I just can't.&quot;
&quot;In that case, I'll come with you to stretch my legs and leave the angry
kids in here to cool off.&quot; Daria said. Before her mother could react, she
opened her door and stepped out of the car.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>As Jake started
filling up the car, Daria walked slowly towards the small hut that housed the
cash register and a tiny shop, her mind still filled with the images of Jane
and Tom in the Zen, at Pizza King and at Jane's house. <i><span
style='color:green'>Maybe I should try to call Jane tonight just to pull her
leg a bit about the unspeakable things she might do with Tom while I'm away and
  Trent does his &quot;intensive lyrics session&quot; at Jesse's place</span></i>,
she mused.<i><span style='color:green'> With my luck, I'm just disturbing
something between them... hold it right there, that's even worse than the one
in the car. I'll be miserable enough for the next two days without the mental
image of the two fooling around... and not only because Jane would probably use
it as an inspiration for a really sick painting... Brrr.</span> </i>She looked
back to the car, seeing that her father was now walking towards her after
leaving the cashier's hut.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>When Jake reached
Daria, he handed her a small box. &quot;Here, kiddo, you might need
these.&quot; Daria examined the box. &quot;Did you get mints from the
cashier?&quot; &quot;No, I didn't. These are earplugs for you to be able to
sleep if there's another row between Helen and Quinn.&quot; &quot;Thank you,
Dad.&quot; They walked back to the car and entered, Jake handing out a Styrofoam
cup of coffee to Helen and a magazine to Quinn. Daria stuck the plugs in her
ears and leant back in her seat; it took her about five minutes to fall asleep
now that her family was blocked out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>One hour later,
Daria woke up again when Helen suddenly shouted &quot;Stop!&quot; followed by a
sharp turn which made her head bounce against the window. She took out the
plugs and rubbed her forehead. Quinn had obviously been sleeping also; she
looked angrily at Jake who had almost missed the exit and swerved into the exit
lane at the last possible moment. Helen closed her briefcase and shoved it
under her seat. &quot;Don't you want to have anyone noticing you did work on
the way, Mom?&quot; Daria asked. &quot;Well... your Grandma asked specifically
that her birthday shouldn't be spoilt by anyone's work - not like the last
time.&quot; &quot;I told her it wasn't my fault when the patron of the
restaurant we dined at turned out to be an old client of mine. I also didn't
ask for the detailed account about how his business went in the years after I
left Cowton.&quot; Jake said slightly annoyed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Quinn stretched in
her seat and smoothed the creases in her jeans. &quot;I hope we'll be arriving
fashionably late; I hate to be early for something.&quot; &quot;Fat chance of
that happening with Dad trying to press the accelerator through the floor of
the car for five hours.&quot; Daria remarked. &quot;Don't you want to stand at
the patio and wave at the others as they arrive?&quot; Quinn pondered the idea
for a moment before she looked at her sister. &quot;Grandma's house doesn't have
a patio, Daria.&quot; &quot;Had you fooled for a second, didn't I?&quot;
&quot;Stop it, girls.&quot; Helen said. &quot;Let's try to be nice to each
other for the next days...&quot; Daria finished the sentence. &quot;...so
Grandma can see what a perfect family we are - compared to Rita and Amy, who
either married several times or not at all.&quot; &quot;That's the spirit,
sweetie.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>After ten more
minutes - filled with a last 'moral briefing' by Helen - the car rolled towards
a slightly worn-down, colonial-style three-storey house with three cars
standing directly in front of it: a black Chrysler Jeep, a white Ford Taurus
and a brown Dodge sedan. Quinn turned to her sister. &quot;Seems like we're the
last ones to arrive after all.&quot; Helen frowned. &quot;Now let's see: that
huge show-off jeep is Rita's. I guess the Ford belongs to Brian and Erin, but I
don't know who might own that brown thing. Maybe Amy's got a new car.&quot;
Daria shook her head. &quot;Amy wouldn't use such a thing for her own funeral,
Mom. Don't you remember her red roadster?&quot; &quot;Oh yes. Isn't it pathetic
to play the rebel even when she's already approaching her fortieth
birthday?&quot; She looked at Jake. &quot;Isn't it?&quot; Jake looked
surprised. &quot;What? Oh, sorry, honey, I thought you were talking with the
girls.&quot; He stopped next to the Jeep. &quot;Why don't you three get out
here; I'll park the car and come back with the bags.&quot; &quot;Okay. But
don't take too long; otherwise Mom will start calling the bars again.&quot;
&quot;Last time I had an accident, Helen.&quot; The girls and Helen stepped
out, then Jake drove away.</span></p>

200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>As the three females
walked up the driveway, the door opened to reveal a tall white-haired woman
with a stern look on her face. Helen produced a smile and embraced the old
woman. &quot;Hello Mom. How are you?&quot; Evelyn beamed at her daughter.
&quot;Hi Helen. It's so nice of you to come. I'm so glad you could take some
time off from your job.&quot; She released her again and turned to the girls.
&quot;Oh my, Quinn! You look stunning. I'm surprised you haven't brought a nice
young man to accompany you. And Daria... you must tell me about your
schoolwork!&quot; She looked at Helen again. &quot;Haven't you brought
Jake?&quot; Helen's smile faded a bit. &quot;He's just parking the car and will
be back in a minute.&quot; &quot;If you say so. I just hope he finds
back.&quot; &quot;Mom, he lived here with me for over a year, so he knows his
way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>They went into the
house and - after Evelyn demanded it - exchanged their shoes for fluffy
houseslippers Evelyn handed them from a big plastic bag. Helen looked at her
feet sticking in what looked like two oversized hamsters, then she peered down
the hall into the living-room. &quot;Hasn't Amy arrived yet, Mom?&quot;
&quot;Oh, she's already there, honey. Her car broke when she bought flowers for
me at the mall this morning. Did I tell you that Rita's arrived on Wednesday
already to help me with everything? Her new friend is such a nice man. Erin and
Brian came at 4 am in the morning, and... oh, just go say hello.&quot; She
walked to the kitchen while the girls and a rather annoyed-looking Helen opened
the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>When they entered
the living-room, they caught the last part of something Amy had said to Rita.
&quot;...I really hope that stupid car hasn't busted something vital this time.
It'd be a shame to miss the farewell lecture of my boss.&quot; Rita's answer to
that was lost as everyone rose to welcome the newly-arrived. Amy hugged her
sister and then her nieces, whispering &quot;...finally someone
intelligent...&quot; into Daria's ear before she walked out into the hall. Rita
also hugged Helen briefly and waved at her nieces, then she motioned to a
tanned man of about fifty years with slightly greying hair. &quot;Helen, this
is Delano Franklin, my current companion.&quot; Delano presented a set of
beaming white teeth as he shook hands with Helen. &quot;I'm glad to meet you at
last, Helen. Rita has told me so much about you.&quot; &quot;She did?&quot;
Helen asked as she shook hands with Erin and Brian, who had shared the
love-seat on the far side of the table before. Rita smiled at her mother, then
she scanned the room. &quot;Hasn't Jake arrived with you, Helen?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:

entered from the hall. &quot;I'm here, Rita. It's good to see you too.&quot; He
hugged her shortly before he shook hands with Erin, Brian and - after Rita had
introduced them - with Delano. Evelyn appeared again with some bottles of red
wine, followed by Amy carrying a tablet with several plates and glasses. As she
placed it on the supper table, she gave Jake a tired smile. &quot;That's what
you get for arriving early to your mother's birthday.&quot; She came over to
embrace him. &quot;How was the trip?&quot; Jake returned the embrace. &quot;Oh,
it went okay. Is that brown car outside yours?&quot; &quot;That outdated
heap?&quot; Evelyn gave her a sour frown. &quot;No, my car decided to stay at
the mall instead of bringing me here.&quot; Amy said. &quot;The brown one is
Maldwyn's car. He's upstairs at the moment.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Evelyn looked
disappointed. &quot;Oh Amy. This was supposed to be a surprise until
dinner.&quot; Helen looked at Amy. &quot;Did you bring someone?&quot; &quot;No,
I didn't. You better tell them, Mom.&quot; Evelyn hesitated. &quot;Well, you
see, I met this very nice man three months ago at the bakery. He offered to
help me carry my bags and I invited him for dinner to thank him. Since then,
we've met regularly. He went to wash his hands before supper.&quot; Helen
looked less than pleased at the thought that her seventy-year-old mother was
seeing a man, but refrained from saying anything as they sat down at the dinner
table. After everyone had settled, they heard a knock on the door and Evelyn
called &quot;Come in, honey!&quot; Helen drew a face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>When the door
opened, it revealed a smallish, white-haired man in a tattered grey suit and
loafers whose shy gaze immediately reminded Daria of a mole. She leant over to
Amy sitting next to her and whispered. &quot;How old is he exactly?&quot;
&quot;Seventy-nine.&quot; Amy answered while Evelyn introduced the old man to
Daria's parents and to Quinn. After he had sat down between Delano and Evelyn,
Maldwyn gazed across the table and then rose again to stretch out his hand to
Daria. &quot;I'm sorry I've overlooked you, little lady, but when I saw you
sitting next to your mother, I thought had that double vision problem again.
You do look like Amy; I believe many people are telling you this.&quot; Daria
shook his hand and smiled. &quot;Well, I'm Helen's and Jake's daughter
actually, but thanks anyway.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:

Erin laughed at the sight of Maldwyn's awkward face while Evelyn was clearly embarrassed
and the others tried to keep straight faces at the old man's mistake - with the
exception of Helen. Daria had just glanced at her mother, but she could have
sworn she had seen a look of anger passing over Helen's face. Jake might have
seen the same thing because he grabbed a long knife and offered it to Evelyn.
&quot;Would you like to carve the meat by yourself, Evelyn?&quot; Evelyn
immediately grabbed the knife. &quot;Oh yes, of course. Who wants to have a
slice?&quot; Rita held up her plate. &quot;One for me, please.&quot; Helen
seemed to consider something for a moment before she held up her plate also. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:

from the meat, the potatoes and the other dishes, Amy whispered to Daria.
&quot;Poor old Maldwyn; he really must've thought you're my daughter.&quot;
Daria smirked. &quot;I'd be </span><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>honored</span><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>, but Mom wasn't so amused, I
think.&quot; She poured gravy over her potatoes. &quot;Did I ever tell you
Quinn thought the same after we met you at Erin's wedding? She really asked Mom
and Dad if they'd adopted me from you.&quot; When Amy did not answer, Daria
quipped. &quot;I'm not your child, am I?&quot; Amy smirked. &quot;Well, I was
told that bearing a child is an experience a woman never forgets and I can't
remember doing this, so you must be Helen's child. Are you disappointed
now?&quot; &quot;Oh, no problem.&quot; Daria smiled. &quot;But you should worry
about Quinn; she might take this not as well as I do.&quot; &quot;She'll
live.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:

minutes, the room was filled with the sound of eleven people eating, drinking,
filling their plates and talking with each other. Since Daria had missed out on
breakfast when they had started in the middle of the night, she took great
portions of everything with special emphasis on the yellow gravy for the meat,
which the others somehow ignored more or less. The reason for this became clear
however after she had just taken seconds on meat and potatoes; a second later:
her stomach suddenly started feeling heavy and grumbled loudly while something
tried to fight its way back up towards the </span><span style='font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>esophagus</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>

returned to the dining-room, the others had finished eating already; the only
person left in the room was Amy, who was busy putting back the unused porcelain
into Evelyn's cherished oak sideboard. Daria walked up to her aunt. &quot;Hello
Amy. Need any help?&quot; Amy looked up and smiled warily. &quot;No, thanks. Is
your stomach better again?&quot; Daria nodded. &quot;I should've warned you
before: Mom loves to try out some new recipes whenever she has guests. Since
her skills haven't improved over the years, her audience has reduced until the
only ones left are either blood-related to her or had their palate
amputated.&quot; She grinned. &quot;That might be an explanation for Helen's
all-lasagna diet, by the way. You know: better feed your loved ones with food
someone else spoilt than making bad food by yourself.&quot; Daria smirked as
Amy placed the last plate in its place and shut the heavy wooden door with just
the necessary amount of force to make the contents clank loudly without
actually damaging something.</span></p>

anything good?&quot; Daria asked when she and Amy sat down at the table again.
&quot;Well, there was Brian whispering to Erin that his mother's cooking could
whip Mom's even on porridge day, Maldwyn complementing the food - after telling
Jake that his throat has never been the same again since he accidentally drank
a full glass of pipe cleaner he mistook for prune juice, and Jake being quiet
except for a longing sigh when Delano mentioned the business conventions in
Vegas he used to visit before he came over to the east coast. And those were
just the males who aren't bearers of the Barksdale madness gene.&quot;
&quot;Hmm. Now I remember why Dad made his will before coming here.&quot; Amy
frowned. &quot;He really did?&quot; &quot;I don't think so, but he told me
Thursday evening that he might be better off making a will before facing this
experience unprepared.&quot;</span></p>

moment before she pushed back her chair. &quot;Speaking of your Dad, he offered
to drive me to the mall where my car blew its radiator. Do you want to leave
this party for an hour or two?&quot; &quot;You mean to get rid on the dead
gerbils on my feet and miss out on seeing more family blowouts? Where do I
sign?&quot; Amy rose. &quot;Then it's a deal. I think your father is outside,
'testing the car for some strange noise', as he called it. I hope he didn't
hide a thermos of pure martini under the backseat this time.&quot; &quot;What
do you mean 'this time'?&quot; Daria asked. &quot;It's a great story, but let's
tell it in the car with some distance from the house - just don't ask him
before what happened to Helen's Dodge Dart and what caused the jagged scar on
his left hip.&quot; &quot;Aye, Auntie.&quot;</span></p>

took off with a jump that pressed Daria into her seat.</span></p>

&quot;Sorry, kiddo, but I can't help it. I've been there several times, but
this place still gives me the creeps. No offence, Amy.&quot; Amy snorted.
&quot;I was born and raised there, but I feel the same. Thanks for the ride, by
the way.&quot; Jake smirked. &quot;Thanks for giving me an excuse to leave
Castle Barksdale, Amy. I would've driven back to Lawndale for a comb if anyone
would've asked for it.&quot; He stopped at a red light and adjusted the
air-condition settings. &quot;Where did you say your car stranded?&quot; &quot;At Circus Court. You might remember it from...&quot; she stopped suddenly, looking at Daria,
&quot;...well, I think you know the way.&quot; Jake gave her an astonished
look, then he also glanced at Daria before he changed into the left lane. The rest

drove by the school all the Barksdale girls had gone to and Amy asked him to
slow down; he just replied &quot;Oh, sure&quot;.</span></p>

which works 24-7.&quot; She smirked. &quot;I don't want to spend additional
time at Mom's while my car is standing around waiting for a radiator

some fun; we'll get you after we've taken care of Amy's car.&quot; He stopped
near to an entrance, which looked like a circus tent with sliding doors painted

discovered that the only bookstore in the mall was a place the plan described
as &quot;<i>Fair(y) Tales - the ultimate place for little Princes and Mermaids</i>&quot;.
Daria shook her head before she looked at the plan again to ensure that her
vision had not failed her. <span style='color:green'>&quot;<i>Fair(y)

Helen knows about it; the second thing is that I must ask you not to tell Quinn

took a sip of her coffee as Jake started. &quot;I better tell it from the very
beginning. When I met Helen for the first time in 1973, she was already living
in the commune she had started with Willow and Coyote in an old farmhouse near Smithville,   New York, where Mom and I lived. I had a summer job as replacement mailman
and delivering the post to the commune was part of my daily routine. One day,
Helen waited at the gate and asked me why I worked for the 'Man' instead of
pursuing my own dreams. I told her that earning money was a necessary thing to
do before being able to pursue my dreams and we had quite a discussion. Since
we'd enjoyed talking, she stood at the gate again the next day... and we became
very close, so to say. When my job ended, she invited me to join the commune
and I gladly accepted to be with her; the ideological side never fully persuaded
me although I agreed with many things. Helen and I both went to college in
Middleton - which was heavily frowned upon by other members of the commune -
and we always knew that the commune should just be a station in our lives, not
the final goal. In June 1975, we married and left the commune, which earned us
much scorn and anger from our friends.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>The waiter came to
refill Jake's cup, which gave Amy the opportunity to carry on. &quot;After Jake
and Helen had married, they came back to Cowton where Mom and I lived. Helen
still visited law school at Middleton, while Jake worked in a local consulting
firm and earned the money they needed.&quot; She breathed deeply before
continuing. &quot;I'd always been the youngest of three daughters in a house
reigned by Mom, who expected me to follow Rita the School Queen, Helen the
genius - or both. Things went OK as long as my father was around, but he died
in 1970 when I was ten years old, leaving me alone since Rita and Helen left
our home soon after his death. Mom grieved only for a month before she started
going out with other men, which freaked me out and led to some deep problems
between me and her. To make a long story short, I led a miserable life at the
time Helen returned from Smithville... with Jake in tow.&quot;</span></p>

milkshake and wiped off the foam with a napkin. &quot;So Mom and Dad moved back
here, but Mom was at Middleton most of the time?&quot; Amy nodded. &quot;Mom
was PO'd that Helen and Jake had married without a decent ceremony, but she
adjusted to the situation by inviting them over for tea on Saturdays, which
gave me the opportunity to get to know Jake better and to tell them about the
hell that sharing a house with Mom meant.&quot; She looked at Daria. &quot;Your
mother was usually uninterested in my problems and loved to point out that, if
she'd survived Mom for nineteen years, so could I. With Jake, things were
different: he liked to talk with me and seemed genuinely interested in my life.
If I dare say so, I saw him as the big brother fate had denied me.&quot;</span></p>

things became clear soon: Helen's workload was so huge that she started
spending every second weekend in Middleton and Amy's feud with Evelyn turned
from sour to ugly. One day in early November, Amy appeared at our door at 6 in
the morning; when I let her in, she told me that she'd spent the night in the
local park after her mother had thrown a bowl after her - and had in fact
managed to hit her with it, causing a bleeding head wound.&quot; Daria gasped
as Amy traced her head slowly and turned to Jake. &quot;Can I continue?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I told Jake he
shouldn't try to talk me into returning to my house because I'd rather live on
the streets than with Mom. He treated my wound, gave me a hot chocolate and
listened to my endless stream of complaints. Somehow, I must've fallen asleep
after spending a sleepless night on a park bench; when I woke up, I found
myself in the master bed in my underwear and it was 3 pm. To be honest, I
feared at once that Jake had taken advantage of me and my situation, so I
rushed out of the bed to find him.&quot; She smiled. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I entered the
small living-room and saw Jake sitting in his old armchair, reading a book.
When I asked him what he'd done with me, he told me that, after taking off my
wet clothes and putting me in his bed, he'd gone over to Mom to tell her that I
was at their place and didn't intend to return home. At that moment, I was
angry at him for betraying my trust, so I shouted at him what a damned crook he
was. He just held up his hand and told me that he gave Mom a choice: either I
would be allowed to move out or she should go straight over to the local police
station to give them a detailed description of me because I'd run away from
home again - and also that he'd do the same in my situation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Daria turned to her
father with open mouth. &quot;You told Grandma this? I can't believe
that!&quot; Amy smiled. &quot;It gets even better. Jake told me Mom tried to
brush him off by saying she couldn't allow me to live alone because I'd screw
up very soon just like I did at everything else, but he'd offered to let me
move in with Helen and him until I'd graduate from high school. That's when I
jumped up and hugged him fiercely, as far as I can remember.&quot; &quot;That's
what I remember also, so it must be the truth.&quot; Jake said with an amused
look.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Daria needed a
moment to collect her thoughts, then she smirked also. &quot;Then you lived
happily ever after, I expect?&quot; Jake's face became serious again.
&quot;Sadly, we didn't. You see, I acted impulsively to rescue Amy from
endangering her life and her future just because of domestic problems. I also
did it because I was absolutely sure that it was the best solution.&quot; Amy
reached over and took his hand, but drew back when she saw Daria's frown.
&quot;It was the right thing to do and I'll be in Jake's debt as long as I
live.&quot; she said after a moment. &quot;But the right thing still can be
wrong if the third party, whose consent is needed and silently expected,
suddenly gets angry because she wasn't asked.&quot; &quot;What do you
mean?&quot; Daria asked. &quot;When Helen came home the following Friday, she
found me living in the room that was meant to be a study for her weekend
homework and a possible future nursery for their children.&quot; Amy said.
&quot;That night, she and Jake had a long discussion which ended with him
losing his temper, telling Helen she was as ignorant about my welfare as Mom'd
been, that she was away most of the week anyway and that the money for the rent
came from his paycheck.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Jake looked down on
the table, then he continued. &quot;I stood by my decision and in the end,
Helen had to accept it. What I failed to see at that time was the simple fact
that, after being separated from me for most of the week, Helen wanted to be
together with me for the weekends and that having her sister in the small
apartment wasn't her idea of marital closeness.&quot; &quot;Thanks, I'm getting
the picture.&quot; Daria said with a defensive gesture. Jake shrugged.
&quot;You wanted to hear the story, Daria. Anyway, Amy was happy with her new
home and I was glad that I had a person to come home to after work. I'd told
Amy that I didn't care what she did as long as she still went to school, and
she never abused that privilege.&quot; Amy took a small glass of soda the waiter
had just brought her and continued. &quot;After Jake had 'rescued' me from Mom,
I swore to myself that I'd make him proud by succeeding at school and not
causing any problems. I never realized that my presence itself was a problem
for his marriage.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Jake slid back in
his bench to stretch his muscles. &quot;In early 1976, things between me and
Helen got worse when she decided that, due to her workload, she'd reduce coming
home to every third weekend and would only pore over her books if she was home.
Amy sensed that something was wrong, but thought that she could lift my spirits
by taking care of the cooking, cleaning and other chores, which in turn annoyed
Helen when she heard about it. Then, on March the 17<sup>th</sup>, I got an
anonymous letter at work saying that Helen stayed in Middleton over the
weekends because she had fallen in love with a fellow student and slept with
him whenever she could. That evening, I stopped at the liquor shop on the way
home and bought several bottles with the deliberate intention of getting
totally drunk on Martini. Amy came home when I was halfway through the first
pitcher and, when I told her why I was busy getting wasted on a normal day, she
joined me in eliminating the booze.&quot; Daria looked shocked at him and her
aunt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Amy swallowed the remnant
of her soda and looked straight into the eyes of her niece. &quot;I'd had
alcohol before in spite of being underage - I'm sure you've found a way to
taste some too although you're not 21 yet - but I'd never drunk hard stuff like
Martini. I just felt that Jake needed company in drowning his frustrations and
was seriously angry at Helen for betraying the man who'd been so kind and
friendly to me. It took me about two glasses to tell him that and another two
before I told him I hoped to find a man like him sometime in the future. After
the second pitcher, I tried to comfort him by physical contact.&quot;</span></p>

minute of silence, Daria finally spoke, fixing first her father, then Amy.
&quot;So what you're telling me is that, being alone in a small apartment,
under the influence of much alcohol and in an emotionally problematic
situation, you two... turned to each other?&quot; Jake nodded. &quot;This was
the only time? Ever?&quot; Amy drew a pained grimace. &quot;If you insist on
getting the details, we did 'it' several times, according to the number of
condoms on the floor.&quot; &quot;Blerch.&quot; Jake sighed. &quot;However, we
had a rude awakening when Helen came home the next morning and found me in bed
with her sister. I tried to explain it to her and showed her the letter, which she
recognized as being written by a girl who'd been her arch-enemy in high school.
She solemnly vowed that there was no other man in her life and I made clear
that I'd felt neglected when she stayed at Middleton instead of coming home. In
the end, we managed to make up.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;And what
happened with you?&quot; Daria asked Amy. When Amy did not answer, she asked
again. &quot;Aunt Amy? What about...?&quot; Jake interrupted. &quot;Daria, you
have to understand Helen's situation. Whatever our motivations had been, having
Amy move in with us had resulted with me and her sleeping together... and she
only had our word that it had never happened before, not to forget.&quot;
&quot;Coming from two people who had just cheated on her.&quot; Daria remarked.
&quot;Exactly. It took her a while and long talks with each of us separately to
be convinced, and nobody could say for sure that the same thing couldn't happen
again as long as the basic situation wasn't changed.&quot; Daria stared at her
father, who looked down, then at her still silent aunt. &quot;They didn't throw
you out, did they?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Amy swallowed hard,
then she spoke quietly. &quot;While Helen talked to Jake in the kitchen, I sat
on their bed and tried to face the facts. Jake had given me a home when I was
on the brink of running away, and my way of saying 'thank you' had been to
sleep with him and thus destroying his marriage to my own sister. I was sure
that, when they returned to the bedroom, they would throw me out on the street
where I belonged right after announcing their inevitable break-up.&quot; She
wiped a tear from her left eye. &quot;When I learnt that they'd made up, I was
so relieved that I would've done anything they asked, however hard it would be
for myself.&quot; Amy swallowed again. &quot;Back then, I thought that Helen's
conditions were remarkably fair, regarding what I had done to them.&quot; Daria
leant forward. &quot;What were Mom's conditions?&quot; She looked at Jake.
&quot;Did you know them?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Jake handed Amy a
napkin before he answered his daughter's question. &quot;Yes, I knew what she
wanted - and I agreed, since I thought them to be the only way to save my
marriage.&quot; He sighed. &quot;Helen demanded I should apply for a transfer
to the Middleton branch office my firm had and use my vacation to look for a
new apartment there. Amy would continue living in our apartment and we would
pay the rent until August, then she would have to move out for college. This
way, she had the chance to graduate from high school and apply for college
without worrying about housing and food while she was still here. I encouraged
her to apply for a scholarship to pay for college and she quickly succeeded to
find one that covered her needs.&quot; &quot;That sounds very fair.&quot; Daria
said. &quot;I thought Mom would've demanded much worse things.&quot; &quot;She
did, kiddo.&quot; &quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Jake laid his arm
around Amy, who was now sobbing into her napkin. &quot;I didn't learn about the
other condition Helen forced on Amy for not telling her folks about this until
at Erin's wedding, when I asked my drunken wife why Amy hadn't visited us more
often - and she gave me the reason. In exchange for silence, Amy had to disappear
from our life until Helen could be sure that she wouldn't be a danger for our
marriage anymore.&quot; Daria gasped. &quot;What did Mom mean by that
exactly?&quot; &quot;Amy thought that Helen had just meant that she shouldn't
apply for college at Middleton or in the state of New York, but Helen soon made
clear that it meant much more. Amy went to a west coast college for three
years, made her BA and planned to change to Brown University for her
postgraduate studies in late 1980. When she announced this at Rita's second wedding,
Helen threatened to divulge the secret to the other family members if Amy came
east again. Finally, Amy gave in and continued her studies at Berkeley
instead.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:

her father. &quot;You mean... after several years apart, Mom still considered
Amy a danger to your marriage?&quot; Jake shrugged. &quot;I can't see another
explanation for her </span><span style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>behavior</span><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>. Don't forget that we still
didn't have kids in 1980, because Helen had wanted to finish law school before
bearing a child. Being the son of a failed relationship, I accepted that even
though I believed we could do better than our own parents.&quot; Daria smiled
weakly. &quot;You did.&quot; &quot;Thanks, kiddo. Anyway, we'd just learnt
before going to Rita's wedding that Helen was pregnant with you, but decided
not to steal Rita's thunder - although your mother would've loved to, believe
me. I can only guess Helen feared that if Amy would settle near Middleton
again, history would repeat just when she was bearing my child.&quot;</span></p>

and signalled to Jake she would continue. &quot;I stayed in California until
1986. By then, you and Quinn had arrived - with less than two years between
your births, which showed to the whole family that Helen and Jake's marriage
was as happy as they could wish. In April 1986, I got an offer to become
assistant lecturer at New York State with the option of a permanent slot after
two years, so I called Helen and practically begged her to allow me to take
that post. She accepted immediately, telling me she had no problem with me
moving to the northeast. No offence, Daria, but I should've known my sister
better than to be fooled by her sweet words.&quot; &quot;I don't
understand.&quot; Daria said. Jake looked at her sadly. &quot;We moved to Highland in May 1986, Daria.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:

angry. &quot;So you came back east... and we moved to Texas? That's about the
meanest, foulest...&quot; Amy interrupted her. &quot;I think you're right,
Daria. I felt the same when I flew over to find a suitable apartment and
stopped by at Mom's just to hear that Helen had known about their move to Texas since February.&quot; She paused. &quot;Daria, I don't want to sound resentful, but
the fact that my own sister still judged me capable of stealing her husband -
one decade after Jake and I spent one lousy night together while being totally
wasted - really hurt me. I established myself at NY State and tried to forget
the fact that I had ever slept with Jake, who now lived with my stupid sister
somewhere in the desert of western Texas. It went surprisingly well - until Mom
celebrated her sixtieth birthday in 1988 and no one could pull out of showing
up.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:

the waiter to bring another round of coffee and milkshakes, then he turned to
his daughter. &quot;I don't know if you remember it, kiddo. It was almost the
same situation like now, with everyone being forced to call off things
considered to be important - I think my ears never fully recovered from Quinn's
shriek as I told her she couldn't attend her best friend's birthday - and Helen
would've probably been on edge even if Amy hadn't been there - but she
was.&quot; Amy took over while Jake gulped the rest of his coffee. &quot;When I
arrived, Mom stood in front of her house and was busy welcoming Helen and you
kids; Jake was still in the car. I parked, said hello, and gave everyone a
short hug: first Mom, then Helen, then you kids... and suddenly Jake stood in
front of me.&quot; </span></p>

for almost ten years and I didn't know about Helen's threats to Amy, so I did
the logic thing: I embraced my sister in-law who hadn't been around for a long
time... until I glanced at Helen's face.&quot; Jake said. &quot;I've known
Helen for twenty-five years now, but I never saw that murderous expression on
her face before - or later, for that matter. I released Amy immediately, who
hadn't seen Helen's fiery eyes and mimics, and dove back into the car before
Helen could do anything physical. Amy went into the house with you and Quinn
while I unloaded the car and Helen just sat on the hood without speaking. She
never said anything about it back then, but I saw she was furious.&quot;</span></p>

through the rooms. We drank to Mom's health, to Dad's memory, to the next
generation, but it all seemed to be a gigantic tragic play that didn't end
although everyone desperately wanted it to.&quot; She cleared her throat. </span></p>

brought you and Quinn into the room you shared with Erin and asked me to help
her. When we were out of the room again, she practically pushed me into the
next wall and shouted at me why I kept harassing her and Jake. Until that
moment, I'd always felt that I bore the full guilt for what had happened
between me and Jake, which in turn placed me at Helen's mercy, but that was too
much. I brushed off her hands and shoved her away, then I told her it'd never
been my intention to steal Jake from her. We went out of the house and talked
for several hours until Jake came out and told us that Mom was at the brink of
disowning us for walking out of her party. Since then, I've met Jake, Helen and
you two several times and as far as I can see from here, I'm not jeopardizing
Helen's marriage anymore - if I ever did so.&quot;</span></p>

the mall that made dad suddenly tongue-tied?&quot; Jake smiled as he stood up
also and motioned for the check. &quot;When Amy succeeded getting her licence,
I decided that this needed a celebration. Like a certain other person present,
she had a weakness for corny theme restaurants, so she and I dragged Helen into
'James Bond's Best Beef Burgers' here in the mall, which had the stupidest
marketing idea I ever saw being realized - and I've been a consultant for over
twenty years now. We had a great time and even got a souvenir photo made. As
far as I remember, Helen defined how to look bored by her expression.&quot;
Daria laughed as Jake drew his wallet and paid the check. As they went out,
Jake laid his arm around Daria. &quot;Please don't tell anyone what you've

200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Amy hesitated before
answering. &quot;Do you know you inherited Helen's skill to see the weak link
in a long chain of arguments?&quot; &quot;That's exactly what I meant, Amy. Mom
might've flipped out finding you and Dad in bed together and I fully believe
that she guilt-tripped you into thinking that everything was your fault. But
this doesn't explain the fact that Mom wanted to keep you away from her husband
for years and I know you aren't that afraid of Grandma to throw yourself at
Mom's mercy instead. I think she's realized something twenty years ago which I
realized today while hearing the story. It wasn't just the common loneliness
and the alcohol- you loved him back then, didn't you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Amy tightened her
grip around the wheel and took a deep breath. &quot;I still love him, Daria.
Jake was kind and gentle to me when my mother and my sisters were either
hostile or ignorant - and I can't tell what hurt more. I believe you've been
there yourself, if only for some time.&quot; Daria nodded silently. &quot;The
only close relative who was always there for me was my Dad; when he died, I
cried for several days and nights until Mom said I wouldn't be allowed to go to
the funeral if I kept on crying. I always dreamt of having an elder brother
instead of two elder sisters, especially since those sisters were Rita and
Helen. I told you already I looked up to Jake like he was my elder brother; it
wasn't until I moved over to his apartment that I suddenly saw him as more than
that. Sadly, he was married to my sister, the harpy. I've heard that
description of Helen before and used it quite a few times myself during my
childhood, to be exact.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>&quot;I hate to ask
you, but I must know this. Did you deliberately plan anything like what
happened after that ominous letter came?&quot; Daria asked. &quot;Not like
this, Daria. I had some immature girlish daydreams that, one day, Jake would
come to his senses and ask himself why he should be content with my snotty,
bossy and know-it-all sister when he could have me. Living together with Jake
has been an experience I've looked for in college and afterwards without ever
coming close with another man. When I finally got my chance to tell him how I
felt - after about half a gallon of Martini - he was so drunk he was beyond any
chance to understand what I said, let alone remember it later.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:
200%'><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>Amy left the highway
and drove on the opposite ramp to take the same way back. &quot;It's ironic
that you've got so many character traits of Jake as I first met him, yet you
also saw what he failed to see himself after getting the story second-hand from
him and me. I wasn't lying when I told you I felt responsible for the
possibility of their marriage breaking up, but I never lost a word on whose
side I would've been - neither then nor today in the caf&eacute;, as you might've
realized. The reason Helen wanted me out of their life has always been the fact
that she knows I fell in love with her husband and never fully recovered from
screwing up at it.&quot; She looked at Daria. &quot;You haven't asked why I
rarely visited you even after I made peace with Helen. Visiting more often
would've reminded them and me of our common time in Cowton and might've
destroyed the truce we had established after ten years of silence originating
from her side. The fact that Jake was stuck firmly under Helen's heel also
contributed to this. And...&quot; she trailed off, mumbling something almost
inaudible. &quot;And?&quot; Daria asked.</span></p>

pointedly glanced in the left rear-view mirror, then she suddenly looked
straight at her niece, her eyes wet now. &quot;Don't you see? I loved your
father without any real hope of success, but your arrival was the final sign
that Jake would never abandon Helen for me; and as I saw the first photos of
you Mom showed me, I knew that, if he and I would've had a child, it would've
probably looked exactly like you! You were both the testament of my failure and
the promise what might've been if things had worked out different!&quot;</span></p>

aunt, who had shifted her gaze on the road again, then she silently drew a
tissue from her pocket and handed it over. After Amy had slowed down and dried
her eyes, she peered over to her niece. &quot;Thank you, Daria; I think I'm
okay again.&quot; Daria smirked awkwardly. &quot;Yes, crashing with his eldest
child on board might be the wrong thing to show Dad how you feel.&quot; Amy smirked
also. &quot;Well, I'd eliminate one of the two most important things binding
him and Helen together - but risking my own neck doesn't sound so good.&quot;
She pointed to her purse lying between the seats. &quot;I told you about the
photo that was made when I visited this stupid restaurant with Helen and Jake.
Would you like to see it?&quot; &quot;Do you have it with you now?&quot; Amy
nodded. &quot;In the inner zip pocket.&quot; </span></p>

and took out a small, slightly dog-eared photo; after replacing the purse, she
examined it closer. <i><span style='color:green'>Jake and Helen, both in their

Amy...</span> </i>Daria focused on the smiling girl in the middle, then she
compared the image with the 39-year old Amy on the driver's seat, who smirked
at her. &quot;Maybe you better compare it with yourself, Daria; you might find
more similarities.&quot;</span></p>

worn over black tights and brown leather boots on the photo made the likeness
between them even more stunning</span></i><span style='color:green'>.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB>Amy saw
the astonishment in her niece's face and smiled. &quot;I told you you look like
I did when I met your Dad, didn't I?&quot; &quot;Yes, but this... don't
misunderstand me, but I suddenly pity Mom just a little bit.&quot; &quot;Why
that?&quot; Daria grinned. &quot;Well, she did everything to ensure you and Dad
would never again have the chance to... well, you know - and then her own child
grows out to be a copy of you.&quot; &quot;Imagine how you'd look if I'd been
around you more often than I actually was.&quot; Daria laughed. &quot;Judging
from your look back then, I wouldn't only be the bookworm I'm now, but also better
at PE and thus be able to keep pace with my friend Jane, the merciless
jogger.&quot; Amy laughed. &quot;See, that's another similarity: I also had a
friend which ran dents into the local pavements; when I lost a bet at the age
of fifteen, I had to run with her and started liking it.&quot; &quot;What was
the bet about?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;What bets do you think fifteen-year-old girls
make?&quot; &quot;Oops. Forget it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB>The car
left the main street and turned into the street where Evelyn lived. Amy stopped
and pointed to an apartment tower hundred meters down the road right to them.
&quot;That's where Jake and Helen... and I lived in '75 and '76, by the
way.&quot; Daria looked at the unappealing building which had definitely seen
better days. &quot;Charming.&quot; She put the photo back into Amy's purse and
pondered for a moment before she fixed her aunt again. &quot;Dad said you
didn't come to the east U.S. for ten years until we moved to Texas in 1986. Was
he right?&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB>Amy
smirked. &quot;I really stayed away all the time - with one notable exception.
In July '85, I went to Philadelphia to see Live Aid with a friend and stayed in
a hotel for one night before returning to Berkeley again.&quot; Daria started
laughing. &quot;You risked Mom's wrath and the discovery of your night with Dad
- for a concert?&quot; Amy shrugged. &quot;Well, in '85, she'd had nine years
to cool off, and if she'd really gone to Mom with it, tough luck. I was
twenty-six, independent from Mom and on the way to my MA. Besides, it wasn't
just a concert, Daria. You see, Helen and Jake are late hippies who'll never
forgive themselves for missing Woodstock, although Jake was at Altamont at least. When I was your age, the dreams of love and peace had been replaced with
the reality of Watergate, Saigon and My Lai, while the continuing threat of
nuclear annihilation was still strong. Helen's generation had withdrawn into
acid-fueled dreams of a new age, but my generation had seen them fail. Live Aid
was something like the proof that there was something the individual could do
against all this. I believe Joan Baez said 'This is your Woodstock, and it's
long overdue' and I think she was right. I still believe that there are more
children today who own their life to food which was paid with money coming from
Live Aid than to their parents wrestling in the mud at Woodstock, and I'd have
never forgiven myself for missing it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB>She
arrived in front of Evelyn's house and parked the car next to Rita's jeep. When
Daria unfastened her seatbelt, Amy held her back. &quot;Listen, Daria. I know
Jake asked you already in the caf&eacute;, but...&quot; &quot;Don't worry, Amy, I
won't tell him or anyone else about what we talked about.&quot; She paused.
&quot;However, after what you two told me in the caf&eacute;, I expect him to put two
and two together and have an idea why I rode with you.&quot; &quot;That's okay;
as long as doesn't suspect that I love him still - or ever really did - the
general situation hasn't changed. As far as I know, he wanted to tell you after
your 18<sup>th</sup> birthday anyway to explain why Helen and I aren't on the
best of terms.&quot; &quot;Instead of comparing you, her and Rita with me and
Quinn like he's done up to now, you mean.&quot; Amy smirked. &quot;Thereby
giving you the irritating idea that sibling rivalries last forever.&quot;

two females entered the house again, they almost ran into Helen, who was busy wiping
the stained-glass window of the door and now frowned at her daughter and
sister. &quot;Nice to see you two are back. I assume you just forgot that Mom
asked everyone to help with cleaning and tidying up the house.&quot; Daria
glanced at Amy, who smiled awkwardly. &quot;Oops. Thanks for reminding me,
Helen. What do you... sorry, what does Mom want us to do?&quot; &quot;Well, she
said you should help Erin and Brian planting some flowers by the pond...&quot;
&quot;The swamp, you mean,&quot; Amy muttered, &quot;...and Daria, you can help
Jake with cleaning up the attic. Quinn might've done it, but she's afraid of
spiders.&quot; &quot;What does she do instead?&quot; Daria asked. &quot;She's
inventorying Mom's loose photo box with Rita.&quot; &quot;I pity her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB>After
receiving a big garbage bag and a pair of plastic gloves from Evelyn, who sat
in the kitchen drinking tea with Maldwyn, Daria mounted the old ladder to the
attic. When she arrived at its top, she saw her father sitting on a huge oak
crate, reading an old issue of Time. Several boxes, trunks and crates stood
around, but Daria could not see anything lying around which would have
justified two people to clean up. Jake looked up and smirked at her. &quot;Hi,
kiddo. Nice to see you've come to help me with this.&quot; &quot;With
what?&quot; Jake grinned. &quot;With having some time off from your Grandma's
cleaning frenzy. After I single-handedly cleaned the whole six-room cellar ten
years ago at her sixtieth birthday while Rita and her second husband made out
up here, I made a mental note to apply for the attic next time - and I told
Evelyn I needed your help. She hasn't been here for years as far as I know, so
there's nothing to do here besides dusting off, which I did already. Take a
magazine and sit down.&quot; &quot;Good idea.&quot; She scanned the heap of old
magazines in an open box, took one out and sat down next to Jake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;Five
minutes later, Jake laid his magazine aside and cleared his throat. &quot;Say,
Daria... I noticed you wanted to drive with Amy. What did you talk about?&quot;
Daria turned at looked directly at him. &quot;Sorry, but I promised Amy not to
tell you... or Mom, for that matter.&quot; &quot;Then let me guess. After what
you learned today about what happened between me and her, you wanted to hear
her views. Am I right?&quot; &quot;Maybe.&quot; &quot;So let's say you talked
about her side of the story. In this case, she might've told you something
important she thinks I never saw.&quot; &quot;And what would that be... I mean,
given this case?&quot; Jake sighed. &quot;Isn't it obvious, Daria? Amy really
fell in love with me and she still believes I never knew.&quot; &quot;You
know?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB>Jake rose
from the crate and went over to a small window. &quot;I knew it all the time,
Daria. Amy said in the caf&eacute; she told me she wanted to 'find someone like me'
when we got drunk together on that night in '76. Maybe she was already too
drunk herself to remember it correctly or still thinks I was already too wasted
to understand her; but in fact, she told me she loved me.&quot; Daria stared at
him. &quot;Now wait a moment. You understood that... and still slept with your
17-year-old sister-in-law... after she'd told you she loved you?&quot; &quot;It
wasn't so easy, Daria.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB>Daria
fixed her father, who sat down on another crate opposite her. &quot;Give me a
break, Dad. I've heard more family secrets today than ever before. So what
wasn't easy?&quot; Jake inhaled audibly before he sighed again. &quot;The whole
situation wasn't. I honestly believed Helen had really cheated on me - and Amy
had grown on me in the past months while Helen was away most of the time.
Alcohol can cloud your brain, but it can also make you consider things very
clearly. There I was, believing my marriage was about to break up and with the
younger sister of my wife, who was witty, funny... and also much more
easy-going than my absent wife. To sum it up: I was frustrated, hurt and
doubtful.&quot; &quot;Doubtful about what?&quot; &quot;About whether I'd chosen
the right Barksdale woman.&quot; Jake said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB>Daria
gasped. &quot;You really considered leaving Mom for Amy?&quot; &quot;Yes, I did
so... believing Helen had already betrayed me, of course. I've never dared to
imagine what might've happened if Helen hadn't come home the next morning...
but now I believe that, after another week with Amy, it wouldn't have been as
easy to have everyone return to how life had been before as it was after one
night.&quot; &quot;Does Mom know that?&quot; &quot;I never told her, but she
must've felt it somehow. You heard how angry Amy still is about how Helen
blackmailed her to stay away from us - and don't forget that Helen didn't tell
me about that until last year.&quot; &quot;You mean she mistrusted you
also.&quot; Jake nodded slowly. &quot;We had problems for a few years and
might've split up after all if it hadn't been for your birth.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB>Jake
looked at his daughter, anticipating a reply to the revelation he had just
made, but Daria stayed silent for some time, studying the ceiling. Finally she
looked down at Jake again and drew a long breath. &quot;Listen Dad, I've just
one more question, then I'm satisfied. It's pretty personal, so I'd understand
if you refuse to answer it...&quot; &quot;Shoot, kiddo.&quot; Daria hesitated.
&quot;Well... if you and Mom were at odds with each other for years, why didn't
you quit her for Amy or some other woman? Like I said, you don't have to
answer.&quot; Jake managed a smile. &quot;It's okay, Daria. I think there were
probably several reasons to stay with Helen. The first and most important was
the fact that I loved Helen and had married her. I know you and Quinn must be
sick and tired to hear about my father being a bad influence, but he'd screwed
around whenever he got the chance and didn't even care that Mom knew it each
time. I'd hated it and swore to myself I wouldn't become like him. The second
reason was that after all, I was the one who had actually cheated on the other
and felt guilty as hell about it.&quot; He paused.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB>&quot;So
you're saying you stayed with Mom out of loyalty, guilt and love.&quot; Daria
remarked. &quot;That's about it, but there was another reason, Daria. You already
know Helen didn't tell me about blackmailing Amy to keep away from us, so, when
Amy broke off contact and also refused invitations to visit us, I thought she'd
regret what we did and thus wanted to avoid me.&quot; He looked down. &quot;To
be honest with you, I believed that she'd fear seeing me again - and I wouldn't
have blamed her. After Evelyn's sixtieth birthday, Amy and Helen got along
better and I learned that my assumptions had been wrong, but by then we had you
and Quinn, which might've disturbed Amy, because she still seldom visited
us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB>Daria
looked at her father sadly. &quot;She told me today that she seldom visited us
because seeing me as a child reminded her of herself and showed her what
might've happened if she'd been the woman you'd married.&quot; Jake stared at
her, then he slowly wiped his eyes with a shirtsleeve. &quot;Poor girl.&quot;
He coughed. &quot;The others must've finished their works by now. Maybe you'd
like to return to them while I put back the magazines and the crates.&quot;
&quot;Well, I'd rather...&quot; Daria broke off her protest when she saw the
silent plea for solitude in his face. &quot;I'm on my way, Dad. See you.&quot;
She descended the ladder without looking at him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB>When the
family reassembled for supper, Daria was anxiously awaiting some kind of
reaction from her mother about the fact that Daria had been away along with her
father and aunt, but ironically Helen was missing herself. Jake noticed that
Evelyn was visibly peeved about this, so he went back to their room to look for
his wife while the others started eating. Ten minutes later, Daria's parents
came in together, Helen giving her and Amy strange looks before she sat down
and started eating. Quinn looked curiously at her sister, but when Daria's face
remained impassive, her attention returned to the salad in front of her. Evelyn
made sure that everyone got plenty of food - &quot;since you all worked so
hard&quot; she said - so Daria had to eat much although she was not feeling
very hungry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB>As soon as
everyone was finished, Amy pushed back her chair. &quot;How about a game of
scrabble? It's an old family tradition.&quot; Evelyn frowned. &quot;Not
recently, if I remember correctly.&quot; &quot;Well, it was when we were kids
and Dad was alive.&quot; Amy fired back. Evelyn held up her hands. &quot;OK, if
the others want to play too, you can play. I'd appreciate it if someone helped
me with the dishes, however...&quot; &quot;I'll do that.&quot; Rita said
&quot;maybe Helen and Jake can help me.&quot; &quot;Of course, Rita.&quot; Jake
said before Helen could object, then he whispered to his wife. &quot;Would you
prefer to get beaten up at Scrabble by Daria?&quot; Helen nodded and they went
to the kitchen with Rita. Maldwyn said goodbye to the others, promising to come
back the next morning in time for breakfast, so in the end, the scrabble game
featured Daria, Amy, Quinn, Erin, Brain and Delano, and took place at the
dinner table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB>While Amy
laid out the board and Brian was outside getting some beverages, Quinn leant
over to Daria and asked &quot;What's wrong with Mom and Dad? They are somehow
at odds since we're here.&quot; Daria shrugged. &quot;Must be the family
stress.&quot; Delano rubbed his hands as they started. &quot;I must warn you;
I'm considered to be a fairly good player.&quot; Quinn smiled at him. &quot;If
that's true, you just might have a chance against Daria; she used to flatten
everyone else at Scrabble.&quot; &quot;We'll see.&quot; Two minutes later, the
first discussion started when neither Delano nor Erin wanted to accept Daria
laying &quot;shebeen&quot;, which, according to her, meant an unlicensed pub in
Ireland; only after Amy consulted a dictionary and proved that Daria had been
right, they gave in grudgingly. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB>After two
more similar discussions, Daria decided to retire to her bed - to be exact, the
mattress - in her grandfather's former office which was now her grandmother's
sewing room. She brushed her teeth, changed into her sleeping attire and lied
down on the mattress, intent on falling asleep before Quinn might come into the
room too to disturb her. As Daria gazed at the dim ceiling, she recollected the
events of the day and the revelations it had brought. <i><span
style='color:green'>The fact that Jake and Amy had once been a couple and
harboured strong feelings for each other had shocked her and the curiosity to
learn more about it had prevented any serious consideration on her part...

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB>Daria
turned several times to find a better position on the thin mattress and tried
to think about something else, like school, Jane or other matters, but each
time she started to follow another line of thought, the picture of Jake and Amy
in the theme restaurant popped back into her memory. Finally, she rolled on her
back, opened her eyes and contemplated the situation. <i><span
style='color:green'>Both Jake and Amy were still attracted to each other after
all these years, but neither had ever had the courage to tell the other one
since their only chance had ended in a fiasco when Helen had barged in on them.
After that, Helen had made sure that her sister couldn't be a risk to her
marriage anymore by keeping her at the east coast and has also - after several
problematic years - managed to keep Jake by bearing his children.</span></i><span
style='color:green'> </span>Daria tried to imagine how their parents and Amy
had lived in the small flat and how each of the three had suffered from what
had happened. Several images went through her memory: <i><span
style='color:green'>the picture of her parents' wedding, the old apartment
building Amy had shown her, a photo of herself as a baby lying in her mother's
arms, other photos of her family life up to now... </span></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'><span lang=EN-GB>Suddenly
the pictures changed in her mind just as she was finally starting to feel
sleepy: <i><span style='color:green'>Jake embracing a younger Amy at his
wedding instead of Helen, Amy and Jake standing in front of the apartment
building and holding hands, herself lying in Amy's arms as a baby, Amy playing
with a younger Quinn and Daria and a happy Jake standing next to them...</span></i>
She bolted up and stared at the dark wall. <i><span style='color:green'>Now
where in hell did that come from?</span></i><span style='color:green'> </span>she
wondered.<span style='color:green'> <i>Do I really... no, I don't think so.
Grandma's stupid food is beginning to affect me, I think. I should sleep now

the sound of a door opening. She opened her eyes slowly and, after a short
moment of confusion, realized that she was lying next to Jake in her old room
in her parents' house. When she scanned her surroundings, she recognized Rita
standing in the doorframe, clothed in a jumpsuit. Helen sat up and looked at
her sister, who held out a cordless phone. &quot;There's a call for you,
Helen.&quot; Jake had woken up also and heard the last bit; now he gazed at
Rita with sleepy eyes. &quot;Morn'n, Rita. Who'd call Helen here...&quot; he
looked at his watch on the pillow beside him &quot;...at ten past seven in the
morning?&quot; Helen hesitated. &quot;Well... I told Eric he could reach me
here in an absolute emergency..., oh, just gimme the phone.&quot; Rita
complied. &quot;Hello, Eric? Oh, it's nothing... I know you wouldn't if... they
did? Monday morning?! I'll do my best... You think that's the chance for me to
make partner? I'm coming back ASAP... Yeah, see you too.&quot; She switched the
phone off and jumped out of the bed. &quot;I'm sorry, but I gotta return to Lawndale as soon as possible. Can you drive me to the next station now, Jake?&quot; </span></p>

might be less peeved about your unplanned departure.&quot; &quot;Forget it,
Jake. If I leave now, I'll avoid all the complications of prolonged
goodbyes.&quot; Helen said while hurriedly putting on a crumpled blouse.
&quot;You mean you'll rather let me explain at breakfast you stole away in the

looked at Rita. &quot;Can you give me a ride, Rita? I see you're clothed

again at 9:15, he pulled a bathrobe over his pyjamas and went downstairs into
the living-room, where he found Daria sitting on the sofa, leafing through an
old photo book. She looked up when she heard the door open and smirked at the
rumpled attire of her father. &quot;Hello, Dad. Has Mom beaten you to the
bathroom?&quot; &quot;Mom got a phone call from Eric to return early and had Rita
drive her to the train.&quot; Daria frowned. &quot;Didn't you want to drive
her?&quot; &quot;I wanted to, but I suggested to her to stay until she'd had
breakfast with the others. She preferred to ride with her sister.&quot;
&quot;Ouch. So now you're the one to explain her sudden absence to Grandma? I
pity you.&quot; &quot;Yes, I know. At least Rita's involved in this, so Evelyn
can't start about us being the black sheep again.&quot;</span></p>

to his daughter. &quot;What're you looking at?&quot; She showed him the spine
of the book, which said: '1968'. &quot;I wanted to see how Mom looked when she
was my age.&quot; Jake opened the book at random and glanced at a page with
photos of the three sisters at a family banquet: 17-year old, slightly plump
Helen in a black dress, 18-year old Rita wearing a low-cut blue dress and
silver earrings and finally 9-year old Amy in a pink dress, making a face to
the camera. He turned the page and saw another photo of the whole family: Helen
and Rita standing behind a brown-haired man, who sat on a couch with Amy on his
knees. Daria peered at the photo. &quot;Is this Grandpa David?&quot; Jake
nodded. &quot;I've never met him, but from what Amy said, he didn't deserve to
live in a house with four... let's say complicated females. I think Amy never
really recovered from his death - unlike her sisters and her mother, which made
it even worse for her.&quot;</span></p>

&quot;Do you know if anyone else is up already?&quot; &quot;Well, Delano has gone jogging and Erin took Grandma's purse to get fresh rolls and some fruits.
Oh, and Quinn woke up when I did and whined until I agreed to her using the
bathroom first.&quot; She leant back. &quot;To be frank, I didn't intend to
participate in the family bathroom fight anyway, but now Quinn thinks she owes
me.&quot; She smirked. &quot;Might be useful sometime in the future.&quot; Jake
laughed. &quot;Well, her blissful cleansing will be over soon; I'm going to
chase her out of the bathroom.&quot; &quot;Good luck.&quot; Daria returned to

family assembled for breakfast. When Jake announced why neither Helen nor Rita
were present, Evelyn became visibly annoyed, but she refrained from speaking
out her discontent since Jake emphasized the fact that Rita had offered her
sister a ride, which might be a sign of better relations between them. Amy
raised her eyebrows, but Evelyn smiled at her son-in-law. &quot;That's nice,
Jake. Let's hope Helen has a nice trip.&quot; She looked at the old clock
hanging above the sofa. &quot;I'm wondering why Rita isn't back yet, however.
Did you say they left at quarter past seven, Jake?&quot; &quot;Yes, I did. But
maybe Rita's met an old friend, like I did yesterday when I drove Amy to the
mall.&quot; Erin took a bite from her roll. &quot;Maybe Mom's got a problem
with her car again, Grandma. A month ago the jeep's brakes sort of
malfunctioned and Mom almost crashed. I believe that mechanic she dated for a
while fixed it somehow.&quot; Evelyn looked doubtful. &quot;In that case she'd
better have it fixed properly. As soon as she's back, I'll give her money for
that...&quot; As she trailed off, Daria looked at her Dad, knowing he'd think
the same thing like her: <i><span style='color:green'>If Mom were here, she'd
be furious - again.</span></i></span></p>

attention was returning to the food in front of them, the doorbell rang and
Evelyn rose to answer it. When she opened the door, she saw two policemen
standing in front of it: an older, overweight man with captain's bars on his
collar whose nametag said 'Chambers' and a young black-haired officer. The
older man stepped forward. &quot;Good morning, Evelyn. Can I come in?&quot;
Evelyn answered coldly. &quot;Good morning, Ralph. I'd appreciate it if you
could get used to calling me Mrs. Barksdale. What do you want here?&quot; Ralph
stepped back again. &quot;As you wish, Mrs. Barksdale. I'd like to talk to you
- inside.&quot; Now Evelyn looked angry. &quot;But I don't want to talk to you.
Besides, my family's there and...&quot; Erin's face appeared behind her.
&quot;Can I help, Grandma? I heard...&quot; she broke off and stared at Ralph.
&quot;Why're you here, Father?&quot; Ralph smiled for a moment. &quot;Hi, Erin. Nice to see you. I've got to tell your grandmother something important...&quot;
Evelyn interrupted him. &quot;Tell it and then drop dead, Ralph. If it's about
Rita, she isn't here and you know she loathes you now. Now what's so
important?&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;line-height:

&quot;You're making this even more difficult than it is already - for us all,
Evelyn. Believe me, I'd rather be anywhere else now than here.&quot; He took
off his cap and motioned to his subordinate to do the same before he cleared
his throat. &quot;Two hours ago, a jeep swerved off the Highway and collided
with a bridge pillar. Both passengers were killed.&quot; He took a deep breath.
&quot;I regret to inform you that they were identified as your daughters Rita
and Helen.&quot;</span></p>

only remember how fast everyone had jumped up from the table when they heard
Evelyn's scream. Jake was the first one in the hall and saw his snotty and
aristocratic mother-in-law writhing on the floor with Erin crying next to her.
Before he was able to inquire about their agony, Ralph Chambers - Rita's first
husband and Erin's father - pulled him outside to inform him about the death of
his wife and Rita. Daria was the last one to arrive in the hall, having sat at
the far end of the table between Quinn and Amy, so when she finally reached the
scene she found her father sitting alone on the outside stairs, looking like a
ghost. Brian was comforting Erin while Maldwyn sat next to a sobbing Evelyn.
Amy stood next to the door with an arm around Quinn, quietly talking with
Chambers. Daria somehow knew immediately what had happened, so she just stood
there, watching her family mourning. Finally, she walked over to her aunt and
gave her a long hug before saying quietly. &quot;I'll take care of Quinn.
Please go outside to Dad; he needs you.&quot; Amy seemed to consider for a
moment before she released Quinn. As she looked at the lonely man sitting on
the stairs with his back to the others, she wiped a tear from her eye and then
gazed at Daria, mouthing &quot;Thank you&quot; before she went outside to
comfort Jake. </span></p>

solemn row of about three dozen men between 40 and 65 who had been her aunt's

funeral. <i><span style='color:green'>Most of Helen's colleagues had been
there: Eric had nearly been flattened by Jake after telling Horowitz and Vitale
that finding someone to fill Helen's position in the firm would be hard. Jake
had been close enough to hear the next sentence also, which was that Helen had
been the perfect subordinate for Eric: fierce enough to tear up any opponent in

associates before he could beat up the man who'd practically killed his wife
and sister-in-law by ordering Helen back from Cowton with the old promise of a
partnership - and now boasted at her funeral how he'd exploited Helen all the
time. Two weeks later, the local police had received an anonymous hint that
Eric Schrecter, attorney at-law, had bribed judges and jury members in several
cases to ensure the success of his trials - and that he'd used extortion as
well as hired bullies in several cases to reach his objectives. Helen hadn't
been able to become partner, but her notes about what Eric had told her at the
firm's '97 Xmas Party after too much eggnog had been good evidence to have Eric
thrown out of the Maryland Law Association and being sentenced to ten years;
his associates had sacrificed him to save their own skins.</span></i></span></p>

hypothetical questions about widowers who found a new woman and her view on a
mutual love which had been suppressed because it might've destroyed a family,
but which could be realized after the obstacles had disappeared; only after
Quinn's answers had been the ones she'd wanted to hear, Daria had informed her

enjoying the sunny day had hesitated to approach each other - until Daria had
given both the push they had so desperately needed. After many hours of
discussion about loyalty to dead spouses and siblings and the impression their
union might make on Evelyn and the rest of the family, both Jake and Amy had
admitted that there was more than just sympathy between them. In the next weeks,
Amy had come to Lawndale every weekend to spend time with Jake and his

explained when he'd given Amy a simple brown envelope which contained a letter
from the president of Lawndale State College, offering Amy a full professorship
to start after the spring break. Amy had just found the voice to thank Jake before
he asked if she'd like to live with him and the girls in Lawndale. She'd
accepted immediately and had moved over as soon as the winter term had been
over. They had told Erin when she'd called on New Year's Eve, knowing she'd
pass it on to Evelyn, but the old woman had waited until April to give them a
call: when she finally did, her first question after 'Is it true?' had been the
inquiry whether they intended to marry. Jake had told her in his friendliest
