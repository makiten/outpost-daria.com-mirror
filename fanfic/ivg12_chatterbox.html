<br>
MiseryChick: Hi.<br>
<br>
Jakob42: Hi. A/S?<br>
<br>
MiseryChick: 16/f. U?<br>
<br>
Jakob42: 21/m. What do you need adivce for?<br>
<br>
MiseryChick: Everything. :\<br>
<br>
Jakob42: LOL. Cool nickname.<br>
<br>
MiseryChick: Thanks. Kind of a catchphrase for me. Where's yours from?<br>
<br>
Jakob42: After Jakob Dylan. Wallflowers guy. People say I look like him.<br>
<br>
MiseryChick: That's cool.<br>
<br>
Jakob42: So you want to talk about what's bothering you? People say I'm a good listener. :)<br>
<br>
MiseryChick: Yeah I guess. Don't have anyone else to talk to. *sighs* I'm just depressed right now is all. I don't have very many friends, and I'm not very popular. Usually it doesn't bother me, but I'm feeling very down about myself right now.<br>
<br>
Jakob42: OIC. Why do you think it's bothering you now?<br>
<br>
MiseryChick: I dunno. That's what I don't get. Nothing seems to be working out for me right now.<br>
<br>
Jakob42: Really? Like what?<br>
<br>
MiseryChick: I don't get along with my family, my teachers can't stand me, and the other ppl in my class are scared of me. LOL.<br>
<br>
Jakob42: Awww. :( Do you have any friends you can talk to?<br>
<br>
MiseryChick: Well I have a best friend, but that's about it. She's unpopular too, but it never seems to bother her. I can't really talk to her about it.<br>
<br>
Jakob42: Oh. I wish I could help you, but all I can really tell you is that it will all pass eventually.<br>
<br>
MiseryChick: Thanks. But... there's one other thing. I think this is what bothers me the most.<br>
<br>
Jakob42: What's that?<br>
<br>
MiseryChick: Well I feel really weird telling a complete stranger this.<br>
<br>
Jakob42: LOL. I know what you mean. But maybe you could use a new perspective.<br>
<br>
MiseryChick: Maybe. Well there's this guy I really like. I've never felt this way about anyone before, so I guess I'm pretty serious about it. But he's older than I am, and I don't see why he'd care about me. Also, I don't want to tell him because I'm afraid he wouldn't want to be friends anymore if he found out that I like him.<br>
<br>
Jakob42: Ohh. That's tough, I know. I have the same problem.<br>
<br>
MiseryChick: Really?<br>
<br>
Jakob42: Yeah. I'm really into this girl I know who hangs out with me and my friend sometimes. She's younger than I am, but she's really cool, and... I just like her more than I've ever liked anyone before.<br>
<br>
MiseryChick: Why don't you tell her?<br>
<br>
Jakob42: Same reason. I'm scared. I'm really pretty shy.<br>
<br>
MiseryChick: Looks like we're both stuck then. LOL. You never know, though. Maybe she likes you.<br>
<br>
Jakob42: I wish. You should at least hint to this guy that you like him. If he likes you back, he'll catch on. I mean, I'd love it if this girl would say that she liked me. It would like make my life or something. :)<br>
<br>
MiseryChick: Same here. You should tell her.<br>
<br>
Jakob42: Well then.<br>
<br>
MiseryChick: Well then.<br>
<br>
Jakob42: roflmao<br>
<br>
MiseryChick: Dang, I gotta go. Thanks for the advice.<br>
<br>
Jakob42: NP. Hope things work out with your guy.<br>
<br>
