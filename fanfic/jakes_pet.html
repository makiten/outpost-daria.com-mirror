<h2>Jake's Pet</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Hey, guys!&quot; Daria cheerfully said, entering the doorway
with her suitcase. &quot;How was your lottery-won vacation?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen Morgendorffer looked out of the kitchen. &quot;There are no
guys in this house Daria, only me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You know it didn't sound right,&quot; Daria said mildly, &quot;but
there are guys outside the house, and that's probably where Quinn currently is.
Am I right?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen grimaced mildly herself. &quot;Well, almost. Your father
has brought home... a souvenir.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;What, a <i>candiru</i>?&quot; Daria asked, looking at mom.
Seeing how her impression didn't change, she sighed. &quot;Apparently not.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;What's a candiru, Daria?&quot; Helen asked. &quot;Is it some sort of
a disease?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nah, a tropical aquatic parasite that sometimes attacks people
with painful consequences,&quot; Daria said. &quot;Dad didn't urinate while standing
hip-deep in the water, did he?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Of course not - not with the Griffins around!&quot; Helen exclaimed
indignantly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;The Griffins won the trip to Bel&eacute;m too?&quot; Daria looked surprised.
&quot;Hate to be sounding like Quinn, but spill!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen looked embarrassed. &quot;Well, it went like this...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>About a month ago...</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Ah, we're here!&quot; Helen Morgendorffer excitedly turned
around to her husband and younger daughter, Quinn. &quot;Now Jake, Quinn - hey,
where are you going?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Dad to feel the solid ground under his feet again, and I'm
as far away from here as possible - there's one steward that was just asking me
for a date, and I don't like him, 'cause-&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Quinn, you flirted with him to get us different seating accommodations,
didn't you?&quot; Helen said accusingly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Mom, you wanted dad to sit near the window where he could
see <i>how high </i>we actually <i>were</i>?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Well-&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Land! Sweet, solid land! Oh, I like you so! No wonder you
were promised! Land!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lawyer Helen sighed and hastily gave place to
Wife-slash-Mother Helen. &quot;Let's go Quinn, I don't want your father embarrass
himself more than he needs to.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;So, are we all here?&quot; the tour guide said not sternly but
firmly all the same. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yeah,&quot; replied the untuned chorus of the lottery winners
and their companions (if any). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Good,&quot; the tour guide replied. &quot;Please sit on the tour bus
and will take you to your destination...&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Present day</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Whoa-whoa-whoa,&quot; Daria quickly said. &quot;Mom, I don't need
every little detail, like Amanda Lane gave us when Wind and his family got
locked down under in Cuba. If I want every little detail, I'll ask Quinn.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen exhaled a breath of relief. &quot;Thanks God. It was bad
enough with the Griffins in there - Tom Griffin had won that lottery too-&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Mom? The pet?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Ah yes, Jake's pet. You see, Daria, one of the tour's
points was fishing in this restricted section of the Amazon.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoHeader>&quot;And?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoHeader>&quot;And he stepped on a fish. A baby <i>Potamotrygon</i>
or something.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoHeader>&quot;Say what? Mom, they grow up to be
12 inches in diameter!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoHeader>&quot;Say what? Daria, this fish is
one-tenth of what you just said!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoHeader>&quot;Well, it <i>is</i> a baby, as you
said!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoHeader>&quot;Yeah, but <i>12 inches</i>?!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoHeader>There was a silence, which was
broken by Jake's voice, coming from the doorway. &quot;Heya, kiddo!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoHeader>Daria turned around, and looked her
dad straight in the face. &quot;Dad, can I see your fish?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoHeader>&quot;Sure thing kiddo, just follow me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoHeader>And Daria went. She went into her
parents' bedroom, where it was pretty much the same - except for one thing: an
aquarium. A rather large, fresh-water, warm-water aquarium. AN aquarium with a
few water plants growing in it. An aquarium, on whose bottom lay a fine carpet
of sand, wooden chips, and some dry leaves. And upon that carpet-</p>

<p class=MsoHeader>-&quot;Her name is Para,&quot; Jake said, but
Daria only half-registered-</p>

<p class=MsoHeader>-lay a tiny stingray.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader>&quot;How'd you like her?&quot; Jake added. </p>
