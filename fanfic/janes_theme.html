<p>“Hey Daria.” Trent opened the front door mere seconds after Daria had rung
the bell.</p>

<p>“Hey Trent.” She replied.</p>

<p>“Janey’s up in her room.” He moved aside so Daria could pass. He followed
her up the stairs, intent on going back to work on a new Spiral song. They both
paused outside Jane’s half-closed door.</p>

<p>“<i>There’s got to be a morning after…there’s got to be a morning after</i>…”
They could hear Jane’s not-quite melodious voice singing an old seventies love
song.</p>

<p>Daria raised an eyebrow at Trent but he made no indication that he knew what
was going on. She walked in the room but Trent remained in the doorway.</p>

<p>“Jane, I thought you were kidding when you said that was your favorite
song.” Daria said as she walked around to see what Jane was working on. She was
mildly surprised at the bright hues she was using in what Daria hoped was an
abstract painting. Jane usually used darker colors.</p>

<p>Jane stopped painting and turned to Daria. “Well, even we tortured artists
are entitled to a day or two of sunshine.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t been leaving the pain thinner open at night again, have you?”
Daria inquired. “That’s seriously your favorite song?”</p>

<p>Jane smiled a little. “All right, you dragged it out of me, put the torture
devices away. My mom sang that to me when I was five and had this really high
fever. It’s the only time I remember her being really…motherly.” She shrugged
and turned back to her painting.</p>

<p>Daria turned to Trent to see if he confirmed the story. He had a sad smile
Daria attributed to the fact Jane hadn’t had much in the way of loving parents.
She didn’t think Helen had ever sung to her, but she had brought soup and even
taken a precious day off when Daria was six and had a severe case of the
chicken pox.</p>

<p>Trent watched his sister painting and humming to herself.</p>

<p>“Moooooooooom!!!!!” Jane wailed. She was hot and tired and achy.
“Mooooom-ieee! I don’t feel good.”</p>

<p><i>She flopped back on her bed, kicking the sheets off. She kicked and
wiggled a little more, more out of frustration than anything else. They’d
actually gone to the doctor the day before and gotten medication, but it was
Penny who’d taken her and gotten the prescription filled. Jane whimpered into
the darkness. Being sick was not fun.</i></p>

<p><i>Her door opened slightly letting a thin shaft of light fall into the
room. Jane heard soft footsteps. “Mommy?” She couldn’t really tell in the
darkness, and wasn’t entirely sure it wasn’t another fever-dream either.</i></p>

<p><i>She sat up in bed when she heard her mom rummaging on the bedside table,
realizing it was time for more medicine. It tasted yucky, but it made her less
hot and some of the dreams she liked to draw afterwards. She dutifully opened
her mouth and swallowed the fake-cherry ickyness. She lay back down. “Will you
sing for me Mommy? Just until I go to sleep?” She didn’t know what brought her
to ask that. Maybe something she’d seen on Sesame Street.</i></p>

<p><i>“There’s got to be a morning after…If we can hold on through the night…”
Jane fell asleep with a smile, thinking she could definitely hold on. After
all, her mom was finally there, taking care of her like all the other moms.</i></p>

<p>Trent shook himself out of the memory and walked to his room. He has long ago
gotten over the embarrassment that at ten years old, his singing voice had
sounded like their mother’s.</p>
