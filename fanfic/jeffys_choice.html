<p class=MsoNormal>A Daria fanfic in response to a PPMB <i>Iron Chef</i>
Challenge </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The park was quiet. A warm breeze gently wove
its way through the trees bathed in the affable light of the full moon. A
couple of bats darted through the branches snacking on the insects attracted by
the body heat of the three large mammals sitting below on the grass. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joey rooted through the rapidly melting ice in
the small cooler.&nbsp; He pushed aside the cans of soda and bottles of water
extracting two beers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, dudes," he announced. "Only two brews
left. One of you is out of luck."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want another one," Jeffy replied
indifferently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jamie quickly grabbed the can from Jamie.
"What's with you tonight?" he asked pulling the tab from the can. "You've been
awfully quiet since Jodie's party. Before that even."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeffy sighed but did not bother to raise from
the grass or even turn his head. "Just been thinking," he answered quietly
after a moment. "Toss me a water, will ya?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joey handed his friend a bottle of water before
asking. "About what?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Next year," Jeffy said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aw man, c'mon, dude," Joey whined. "Summer's
just started. Don't be talking about school already." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The redhead took a long sip before replying. "Naw,
not the school year. Well, not exactly. I mean, next year. Next June."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jamie frowned in confusion glancing over to Joey
who signaled his own confusion with a small shoulder shrug. "What about it?" Jamie
asked turning back to his friend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm scared," admitted Jeffy bashfully.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joey laughed. "Scared! Of what?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Being the next Kevin Thompson."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jamie joined Joey in laughing but Jeffy remained
serious. "Dudes, it's not funny. Come August, he'll be walking through the
halls of Lawndale High knowing that he's the punch line to a hundred jokes. I
don't think I could face that."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah," Jamie said. "But you're passing."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Barely."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, I'm barely passing but you don't see me crapping
my pants over it," Joey said. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I am," Jeffy countered. "Where am I gonna
be next June even if I pass?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We'll be celebrating the end of school with a
kegger," Joey said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And kicking back waiting to start playing
college football," Jamie added.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, maybe you two but not me," Jeffy shot
back. "Not a single school has expressed any interest in me. Not even a
freaking JC. &nbsp;And I can't walk on anywhere. My parents are strapped to the
limit paying for my sister's college. They can't afford to send me."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jamie rubbed his chin. "So, bust your ass this
year. Have a good season and you'll get a football scholarship."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeffy eyed his friend. "We've been tight too
long to lie to each other. You watched Felix and Pete during spring practice. I
was at the top of my game but they were both still better then me. I'm looking
at being a third stringer this season and they don't give scholarships to
benchwarmers."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joey chugged the rest of his beer. He tossed the
can into the trash bin fifteen feet away. "Two points. So what are you gonna
do?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm gonna talk to Quinn for one thing. See if
she can hook me up with that tutor she used last year," Jeffy answered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think you can cram eleven years of
school into a summer," Jamie quipped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeffy chuckled for the first time. "No, I don't
think so either but I might be able to at least get near where I should be.
Maybe I can learn enough to where I can get some decent grades next year."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can't afford to go to college anyway why
bother?" Joey asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was thinking that I might learn enough to do
okay on the military's basic tests," Jeffy answered. "My cousin learned
electronics in the Navy, ya know. He's making decent money right now." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dude, the military'll take any warm body," Joey
said derisively. "Hell, we're finally gonna be seniors. Enjoy our last year of
being young. Party. Chase girls. Play football."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm quitting the team," Jeffy replied evenly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, dude, no way," exclaimed a shocked Jamie.
"Man, we're the three J's. We've been playing together forever."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, I know and I'm sorry but I'm not Mack,"
Jeffy said contritely. "I know that I'm not smart enough to do good in school
and play football. I gotta pick one or the other and I'm picking school." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dude, that's just flat wrong," Joey snapped
angrily. "You can't walk out on us like that. You're part of the team."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeffy snorted. "I don't think that wearing my
letterman's jacket to a job interview is gonna help me more then being able to
prove I got at least some intelligence."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You got your summer job 'cause you're on the
team," Joey retorted. "All of us did."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, that's true," acknowledged Jeffy calmly.
"And for a summer job it isn't bad but washing and waxing cars at a Ford
dealership isn't exactly a career, ya know. We gotta think about the future. I
don't want to be one of those creepy middle-aged guys like the ones that show
up to our games always talking about their high school playing days because
they haven't done anything else with their lives worth talking about." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joey leaped to his feet. "Let's cut the crap,
okay," he said forcefully glaring at Jeffy. "I mean, who's kidding who? None of
us are brains. So you get slightly better grades next year and I just scrape by.
So what? We're still gonna end up working somewhere bitchin' and moanin' about
our jobs just like everyone else. My old man got pretty good grades back in the
day but he's on the same assembly line with high school dropouts. That's just
the way it is so you might as well enjoy what little time you have left before
you join the rat race. Playing for some college don't mean nothing really if
you don't make the NFL but if it keeps us out of the factory for another four
years, that's pure gravy."&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Joey's got a point," Jamie said quietly as he
raised himself on an elbow. "None of us are exactly Einstein and like I said
earlier, it's too late. You can't suddenly decide that grades matter after
eleven years of blowing them off." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeffy stood. He knocked the grass from his pants
with a causal sweep of his hand before he sighed. "Yeah, it probably is too
late but I'm gonna try anyway. I'll see you guys at work tomorrow."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He nodded to Jamie and squeezed Joey's shoulder
affectionately before turning away. His friends watched incredulously as he
ambled away from them walking straight from the park before turning sharply when
he got to the sidewalk. Without a backward glance, he disappeared from their view.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't believe he just did that," Joey
grumbled grabbing a soda from the cooler. "Man, we need more beer."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jamie fell back to the grass. A small frown
creased his forehead as he linked his hands behind his head. His thoughts
wandered as he stared at the stars. A year suddenly seemed far shorter then it
had just a few minutes earlier.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
