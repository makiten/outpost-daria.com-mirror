<h4>A Case Study of the Psychological Sequel&aelig; of Inadequate Treatment
of Atypical Pustular Psoriasis in an Adolescent Girl with Accompanying 
Intrafamilial Psychodynamic Dysfunction</h2>
<h4>Ferdinand Bardamu, MD.&nbsp;Attending Physician, Cedars of Lawndale</h4>
<p class="firstParagraph">
&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;they say there are no emergencies in 
dermatology&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the idiocies of 
specialization!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;perhaps there are no dermatologic 
conditions that are in themselves life threatening, but let me assure 
you, the <i>sequel&aelig;</i> of skin diseases&mdash;catastrophic! And don't 
let any well-fed, overpaid specialist tell you 
different&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;back in the day when I learned general 
practice the old physicians who'd seen terrible disfigurements from war 
injuries made sure we learned about the psychological consequences of 
scarring injuries and chronic, disfiguring skin 
disease&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but it had gone on too long for this 
kid&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she was a looker once, 
too&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;even if the photos from before the onset of 
the illness showed she was a little wench who thought 
her shit didn't stink&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the mother had that a bit 
of that too&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but the years of caring for her 
daughter had obviously taken their toll&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;too 
bad&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she was still worth looking 
at&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;even if she had the feral features of a 
middle-aged woman who'd gone in for drastic dieting and exercise to keep
her figure&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I'd take a tumble with 
her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&mdash;Is there nothing that you can do for her, Doctor Bardamu? 
</p>
<p>
&mdash;Ms. Griffin, there&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&mdash;Please Doctor, call me Linda.
</p>
<p>
&mdash;Linda, yes. Well, there are many different aspects to your daughter's
condition&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&mdash;God, don't I know it!
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she sank down next to the bed and gently passed 
her hand over the girl's hair&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she practiced that 
move, I'm sure of it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the chart said that in the 
acute phase the psoriasis was on the scalp&mdash;not unusual, but incredibly 
painful&mdash;and face&mdash;that was unusual, and 
horrific&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; she must have hated her daughter when 
she was beautiful&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;take the way she ran 
her hand over her daughter's hair&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;it was light enough 
to seem compassionate to observers but there was enough weight and drag 
in the motion to have caused excruciating pain for the girl in the acute 
phase&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;who knows what she did when no one was 
around&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;an old story&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the 
well torture the sick&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 
</p>
<p>
&mdash;I don't know what's worse&mdash;that the 
drugs&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well, she may not have those terrible sores 
anymore, but she's puffy and put on so much weight! 
</p>
<p>
&mdash;Prednisone will do that, especially at the doses she has to 
take&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but I think we need to 
discuss&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&mdash;But why won't she talk, Doctor? She hasn't said a word to me or 
anyone since&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I can't remember 
when&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I consulted the chart.&nbsp;&mdash;She screamed at a nurse for wearing bad 
shoes eighteen months ago. Nothing for at least six months before that, and 
definitely nothing since. But she has tried&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&mdash;Are you sure there hasn't been some&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<i>brain
damage</i> that could explain it?
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I had to sit down&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she 
sounded almost hopeful, so I had to sit down and try to forget that the 
healthy often hate the sick, that parents often hate their children, and that 
there are people who daily pray that their rich relations develop a fatal 
disease and neglect to update their wills&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;years of 
seeing the worst in people hasn't made it any 
better&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&mdash;Her brain function is normal, Ms. Griffin. 
</p>
<p>
&mdash;Linda, please. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she gave me a smile that must have been her 
standard prelude to seduction&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I realized she 
wanted the kid put away for the rest of her life, that's for 
sure&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she was an 
embarrassment&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&mdash;As I was about to say, Linda (here I gave her a sympathetic glance) 
while Sandi here hasn't spoken to another person since that incident, she has 
tried to communicate recently&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she wrote 
something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a story&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she went pale for an instant and quickly recovered 
an appropriately hopeful mien&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I hate 
people&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I'm no better than anyone 
else&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;it's the lying that bothers 
me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;if she had just said straight up she wanted 
her daughter done with and passed me some cash, I'd have done 
it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;clean too&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;not that 
the Lawndale coroner looks very hard for causes of 
death&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a few years back the moron 
star quarterback&mdash;not Sherman, the other one after him&mdash;dropped dead 
at school, and this after having been in the hospital when he was hit by a 
car&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the coroner's report said heart 
failure&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;let me tell you, you could have sold that 
boy's blood on the street as a testosterone-methamphetamine cocktail unlike 
any other, don't doubt it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;good luck trying to say
that in public&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;football is this rotten town's 
religion&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I took the pages from the chart and gave them to 
her mother&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she read the first one and then got all
choked up&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a first class job, I must 
admit&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but she had to spoil 
it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she began to read her kid's drivel to 
me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;at least when I first read the story
I had the luxury of cringing at the self-congratulation in 
it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;now I was a captive 
audience&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that husky alto of hers didn't make
listening to her daughter's rot any easier&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;

Popular Girl<br /><br />

<p>
&mdash;Oh, Dr. Bardamu! True and modest even at the start!
</p>
<p>
&mdash;There, there, Linda&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;you needn't read it 
to me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I've already&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&mdash;Please, Dr. Bardamu, indulge me? &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and now 
her smile held more insinuations and promises for being so 
desperate&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;so I just nodded and she went 
on&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;
</p>

<blockquote class="SandiStory">
<p class="firstParagraph">
When I woke up the day before I was to go to school, I knew that it would be 
a radiant and wonderful day. Being popular and cute means major work, though, 
and I knew I had responsibilities to other students to maintain my cuteness 
and popularness. 
</p>

<p>
I turned on the makeup mirror and began applying my before-school 
makeup&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;before-class makeup would come later! Every 
popular girl knows the basics of hair spray, eyeliner, lashes, and 
foundation. As President of the Lawndale High School Fashion Club, it is up 
to me to set the best example. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
&mdash;True and beautiful and generous!  What a loss, Doctor, what a loss!
</p>

<p>
&mdash;Um&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;
</p>

<blockquote class="SandiStory">
<p>
Someone knocked on my door. &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; I called out sweetly. 
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It's Sam, your brother!&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh Sam&rdquo; I said &ldquo;I am afraid I am using the 
bathroom. Would you care to wait, dear brother?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course, big sister!&rdquo; Sam said. &ldquo;I know that you have to 
look your best for school!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
My brothers are so understanding!
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
&mdash;How well she got along with her brothers!  They miss her so!
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I nodded and checked the 
chart&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;her brothers had never come to 
visit her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;so much for family 
feeling&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&mdash;Linda, perhaps revisiting how Sandi 
was back in high school might not be best for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
&mdash;Oh, Doctor&mdash;just let me read a bit more to you, she said, shuffling
the pages&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she was savoring 
it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and she wanted to make sure I knew what she saw
in the story&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she saw that her journey through the 
darkness with a disfigured, catatonic daughter might finally be at an 
end&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;
<p>

<blockquote class="SandiStory">

<p>
It was a very sunny day and all of the birds were singing. It was a very long 
walk, but I enjoy long walks in the sunshine because it helps my complexion. 
</p>

<p>
After a long and enjoyable walk to school, I waved to all of the people who 
liked me, even the people who weren't so popular because I'm so popular. My 
three best friends in the world were there. Tiffany Blum-Deckler, a tall girl 
with a nice complexion, the ever helpful Stacy Rowe, and Quinn 
Morgendorffer, a girl who I made it a special priority to befriend as her red 
hair and freckles were so unsightly and I didn't want her to get picked on. 
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hello, Sandi!&rdquo; said Tiffany. &ldquo;Hugs!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hello, Sandi!&rdquo; said Stacy. &ldquo;Hugs!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But where is Quinn, my other good friend?&rdquo; I said, inquiring 
about her health. 
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She's over there with Bret Strand!&rdquo; cried Stacy. &ldquo;You have 
to do something!&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>
And there Quinn was with Bret Strand! She was wearing a top that was way too 
short, and I swear that you could see the outlines of her b-r-a! She had her 
hands all over him! 
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So, Bret, will you like, go out with me? Huh? Huh?&rdquo; Quinn was 
making kissy noises with her lips. 
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don't know, Quinn&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;you just 
seem&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;so forward!&rdquo; Poor 
Bret was looking very uncomfortable. It was a good thing I was there. 
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quinn Morgendorffer! Come here this instant!&rdquo; I said. Sadly, 
Quinn walked over. I walked over to Bret. &ldquo;You must forgive Quinn. She 
comes from a poor family. I want you to be extra super nice to her and not 
take advantage of her! You are better than that!&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I understand, Sandi. It's just that 
Quinn&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;well, Quinn threw herself at me!&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will talk to Quinn.&rdquo; 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
&mdash;Yes, yes! Oh, this is exactly how things were for her in high 
school! &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she handed me back the pages, extending
her arm with an erotic undulation&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; &mdash;She 
was so popular and good and generous! But that was more than eight years 
ago&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;when did you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&mdash;A resident found it earlier this week&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I 
couldn't evaluate the content, but that she was writing about her past as 
if it were the present day...frankly, Ms.  Griffin&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&mdash;Linda, please Doctor.
</p>
<p>
&mdash;Linda, sorry. As I said, that this story was set back prior to the 
onset of her disease&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
</p>
<p>
&mdash;You can say it, Doctor.
</p>
<p>
&mdash;Call me Ferdinand, Linda.
</p>
<p>
&mdash;Yes, Ferdinand. Thank you. I suppose this means some sort of 
severe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<b><i>mental disorder?</i></b>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;there it was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the
glimmer of hope finally visible&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I wasn't about
to deny her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;besides, it was indicated 
anyway&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;how rare and rich for the appropriate
treatment to coincide with your fondest wishes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
&mdash;I can't make that determination myself Linda, but that would be the 
avenue of investigation to take. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;now what a show she put 
on!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;falling back into the chair, clutching the 
papers to her chest, unbuttoning the top button on 
her blouse, letting a single tear fall from her 
eye&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the <b><i>thing</i></b> that had been the 
cause of her shame was finally going to get put somewhere <b><i>out of 
sight,</i></b> where <b><i>it</i></b> wouldn't be an embarrassment for her 
anymore&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I've been attacked by women who wanted 
to trade their charms for medical favors before, but this Griffin woman was 
in a class of her own&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;now she wanted to seal the 
deal&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she got up from the chair and took me by the 
arms&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;her face was practically against 
mine&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I could see she definitely had collagen 
injections in her lips&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;not that I would turn them 
down for that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&mdash;Only the best for Sandi, Ferdinand, only the best! Is there someplace 
where she could have the best care?
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but I didn't fall into a clinch with 
her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;so I'm a sap&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she was 
going to get her wish anyway&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;her daughter would be 
put away&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I didn't want some harpy sinking her claws 
into me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;first I'd be giving her collagen and 
botox for free just so I could get another 
hump&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;next thing you know, it would be prescriptions 
for codeine, oxycodone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;you name it, she'd want 
it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I've been there 
before&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I admit it, I was 
scared&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;maybe it was that she 
was <b><i>so</i></b> good&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I didn't want to be at
the end of her string&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and there was something 
about the story that didn't sit well with 
me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;so I didn't take her up, and that's that! Go 
ahead&mdash;call me a fool, a coward&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I've been
called worse&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and I'm sure if I'd gone down that
road with her, she be dishing out abuse like that and worse, don't doubt 
it!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&mdash;There, there, Linda, I said, patting her on the back. &mdash;I 
can't make that determination. But speak to the attending psychiatrist, Dr. 
Benway. He'll be by to see Sandi on Thursday. He's a good man. 
</p>
<p>
She gave me a perfunctory, chaste hug and pulled away. 
</p>
<p>
&mdash;I will, I will! Thank you, Dr. Bardamu, thank you!
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;we were back on formal terms 
now&mdash;of course!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;old Benway would be the one 
she'd attack with those collagen pillows of 
hers&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;who knows what other 
enhancements he'd get to see?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I don't begrudge him 
that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;after a day of sedating the violently mad, he 
could use a roll in the hay&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
She went on: 
</p>
<p>
&mdash;You don't know what a relief it is to know that 
Sandi&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she caught 
herself&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;it was beautiful to watch, the 
slight change in facial expression as her mind redacted her honest wishes 
and instead assembled a socially appropriate lie&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&mdash;that Sandi will be getting <i>the right kind of care,</i> at last! 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and with that she dashed out of the 
room&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I looked at the kid, peered into her dead 
eyes, regarded her puffy complexion, her bloated 
form&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she had been president of the Lawndale High 
School Fashion Club, and now here she was, a thick, catatonic 
monstrosity&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;all because a case of atypical 
pustular psoriasis hadn't been treated aggressively enough when it was first 
diagnosed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I brought the chart to the nurse's 
station&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the resident who had discovered the story 
was reviewing another patient's chart&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;maybe what 
was bothering me about the story was all a 
coincidence&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;maybe this was just another example of 
everyone's rottenness&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I'm not the only physician who 
hates the sick, the way they're coddled these 
days&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but most of the younger ones delude 
themselves&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I figured I ask her about the
Griffin girl&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&mdash;Dr. Sloane, may I have a minute? 
</p>
<p>
&mdash;Dr. Bardamu! Of course! 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she was a bubbly thing, perfect for 
dermatology&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;marvelous red hair, and you'd swear 
she had her scrubs tailored to her figure&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and it 
was a good one, too&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&mdash;I just met with the Griffin girl's mother&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&mdash;I know! It's <i>such</i> a sad case! I just feel for that poor girl! I 
mean, I look at her and I think, <i>there, but for the grace of God, like 
that could have been me, Quinn Sloane.</i> I can't believe that her family 
doctor didn't take such a severe case of psoriasis seriously&mdash;and to get 
it on the face! So unusual! You know, they told us that there were no 
emergencies in dermatology, but I think that's a very narrow view of what 
constitutes an emergency&mdash;you have to consider the patient as a 
person, not a collection of symptoms, duh!
</p>
<p>
&mdash;I'm inclined to agree, Doctor&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;tell me again, 
how did you find this story the patient wrote?
</p>
<p>
She shrugged. &mdash;The sheets were just scattered over her bed and she had 
the pencil gripped in her hand. I gathered it alltogether, 
and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She shrugged again, and let out a brief 
sigh. &mdash;It's just so, <i>so</i> sad!
</p>
<p>
&mdash;Indeed, I replied nodding. &mdash;Say, didn't you tell me you're from 
Lawndale yourself? You're about the same age&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;did 
you go to the same high school as the Griffin girl?
</p>
<p>
She rolled her eyes. &mdash;Pul-LEEZE, Doctor! she said, laughing. &mdash;I 
went to Lawndale High, but I would have <i>nothing</i> to do with the popular 
crowd. I had my sister, who's <i>very gifted,</i> and she was all the company 
I needed.
</p>
<p>
&mdash;Your sister?
</p>
<p>
&mdash;I never told you my sister is Daria Morgendorffer? 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she was beaming as she said 
this.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;she wanted me to be 
impressed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and I was, but not for the reasons she
thought&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but they were only suspicions
anyway&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and why disappoint such a beautiful young
thing? &mdash;The novelist and columnist?
</p>
<p>
&mdash;The same. I can't tell you how fortunate I was to grow up in a 
household with so much intellectual stimulation&mdash;I mean, like a doctor 
can only help her patients, but someone like Daria has influence beyond the 
people she sees. She paused and looked up and away from me in that attitude 
people strike when they're about to flatter themselves with a statement of 
their essential goodness. &mdash;I only hope that as a physician that I can 
like give back to society even a tiny fraction of the good my sister has, she 
sighed.
</p>
<p>
&mdash;Impressive, Doctor. I read her column daily. Tell her I'm a great fan.
</p>
&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I had other patients to attend to, so I said my 
goodbyes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;lucky indeed!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I 
checked the handwriting on the story against Dr. Sloane's 
handwriting&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;they were different, but both were
the sort of decorative curvy penmanship cultivated
in high school by attractive girls&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I could conclude
nothing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but I didn't believe for a second that
Sloane hadn't been one of the popular crowd back in her 
day&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and whether or not the story was a forgery,
it made sense that the Griffin girl hated her and the feeling
was mutual&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;then there was the business
about Sloane's sister being Daria Morgendorffer&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I
wondered if either of them ever had the time to speak to the 
other&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and I found Daria Morgendorffer's column 
grating&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;it was cheap cynicism of someone who'd never 
been personally touched by human depravity&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but that 
was her good fortune&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;some people can't have enough 
good fortune&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Quinn Sloane, not only married to a 
rich man, but the sister of a famous writer&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I
used to think that Lawndale was a lousy suburb with nothing to distinguish 
it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but then again, how special is a place if the 
best thing you can say about it is that someone famous <i>left</i> there?

Hello! This is Sandi Griffin of the Lawndale High School Fashion Club! I wrote 
the original story attributed to my sickly self in Scissors' story, but I want 
to remind everyone that this is a work of FICTION!!! Any resemblance to 
anyone living or dead is purely coincidental, because we all have parents who 
care about us very much, especially those of us whose parents are lawyers and 
who I just found out are very willing to sue. (I made up with the person I'm 
talking about, by the way, so you can JUST SHUT UP, BROOKE, NO ONE WANTS TO 
HEAR FROM YOU!)

<p class="firstParagraph">
You, as an unfashionable person, might wonder why I allowed myself to be 
portrayed as suffering an icky skin disease. I did this as a public 
service. Even popular people have to deal with skin care issues. SKIN CARE IS 
IMPORTANT! If you have oily skin, you must make sure that your products are 
not too strong or they will activate your glands. I would also avoid laser 
surgery, because some of us out there (named in the above paragraph) are always 
looking for a quick fix, you know who you are. Anyway, you can learn about 
proper skin care in our Fashion Club Seminars in Mrs. Bennett's room 
from 4 pm to 5 pm the third Friday of each month unless the football game 
starts early.

Both the narrator and style of this story&mdash;so far as I'm able to 
imitate the latter&mdash;are taken from the works of the French novelist, 
Louis-Ferdinand C&eacute;line. Its title is a play on the title of 
C&eacute;line's first novel, <b><i>Journey to the End of the Night.</i></b>
</p>

<p class="firstParagraph">
Dr. Benway is an allusion to the character of the same name from the novels
of William S. Burroughs.

The passage <i>&ldquo;a few years back the moron star 
quarterback&mdash;not Sherman, the other one after him&mdash;dropped dead 
at school, and this after having been in the hospital when he was hit by 
a car&rdquo;</i> refers to a work of Halloween fan art by The Great 
Saiyaman also orginally posted at the Sh33p's Fluff, but currently 
(and unfortunately) unavailable due to hosting issues.

The author would like to thank Sh33p Fluff posters Angelinhel and The Angst 
Guy for their words of encouragement.
