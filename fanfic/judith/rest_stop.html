A '<u>Judith Strikes</u>!' fic, by Brother Grimace</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>(NOTE: This fic takes place <u>immediately</u> after <u>The Best Halloween
Ever</u>. It is a follow-up, of sorts, to my fic <u>Tapped Potentials</u>.) </i><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
"So... have you come to <i>kill me?"</i><br>
<br>
Judith lifted her head as she untangled herself from her red cloak, and saw the
hated image of one of her doppelgangers raise up from the bed where she lay in
shadows, and thin beams of bluish-white moonlight. <br>
<br>
"Yeah," Judith breathed out, slow and angry. "Pretty much."<br>
<br>
"I suppose that it was bound to happen eventually," Daria continued, no sign of
fear in her eyes as Judith rose from the floor as if she were ascending from
Hell itself. "How do you plan to do it?"<br>
<br>
"After what I just went through in this room," Judith hissed, "I'm thinking <i>long
and slow,</i> with lots of screaming &ndash; and the use of <i><u>many</u></i>
implements."<br>
<br>
The involuntary shudder of pleasure that visibly went through Daria at her
words made Judith actually step back. <br>
<br>
"My thoughts exactly," Daria purred, running the fingers of her left hand
through her masses of auburn hair as she watched the cloak flow around Judith
as it fastened itself around the woman's neck. "If I am to die today, may I be
allowed to choose the manner of my execution?"<br>
<br>
Judith felt her breath catch in her throat as she saw her counterpart rise from
her bed into moonlight; the fact that Daria wore an off-white gown that could
charitably be called 'translucent'...<br>
<br>
This Daria was physically <i>perfect. </i><br>
<br>
"How about death by 'bunga-bunga?" Daria said pleasantly, almost teasingly,
moving towards Judith in a way that would make an outside viewer think that
Judith was the one in danger... of a sort. "You can torture me all you want..."<br>
<br>
For the first time that she could remember, Judith actually hesitated at the
sight of one of her counterparts, drinking in the sight of beauty &ndash; of an
animal-like feminine quality, gentle, and yet forward and direct, which
radiated from Daria like heat from a raging fire with every step she took &ndash;
until the two women were so close that Judith could breath in the slight hints
of clean, that comes from freshly bathing, and the gentle, sweet scent of Daria
herself...<br>
<br>
<i>"Don't <u>touch</u> me!" </i><br>
<br>
The words leapt from Judith's lips, seeming to fly forth as though they were a
shield &ndash; a shield erected by her subconscious to block the other woman from
moving any further, as if she were an imminent threat. <i>"<u>Don't</u>!"</i><br>
<br>
Daria's lips parted slightly &ndash; <i>her lips, so much like my own,</i> Judith
thought, but so much more; minuscule changes, she didn't know what they were, but
they made it so difficult to look away as they opened slightly more, closed,
and opened again as Daria spoke. "What's wrong?" <br>
<br>
The uncomfortably beautiful reflection of herself in the moonlight made Judith
flinch as Daria raised a hand to touch her &ndash; and Judith stepped back
immediately. "Oh. <i>That.</i> You don't have to worry about that <i><u>here</u>."</i><br>
<br>
Daria reached forward; Judith's eyes widened in complete horror as she
instinctively grabbed Daria's right wrist with her own left hand before she
realized what she had done &ndash; horror that swiftly turned to stunned disbelief as
she looked from her hand into Daria's eyes, glanced back down and then back to
Daria, confused almost beyond words.<br>
<br>
The counterpart's gazes connected &ndash; one dumbfounded, and one, serene. <br>
<br>
"I don't &ndash; this &ndash; we should be &ndash; <i><u>How</u>-?" </i><br>
<br>
Judith's words came out haltingly, and then, were cut off completely as Daria
leaned forward to press her lips to Judith's, sending shock, disbelief and the
unceasing torrents of anger that flowed without ending inside her to the edge
of consciousness as the soft and the moist and the warm of Daria's kiss acted
like a gentle balm, a medicine that took away pain, the pressure of thought,
and all the worlds from her mind's eye...<br>
<br>
Judith had absolutely no idea how she had crossed the room, how she and Daria
had found themselves in the bed of her high school years, of how anything she
had ever done before in this bed could be as welcome as the feel of Daria's
lips on hers... a peculiar sound penetrated the warming, anesthetic haze
shrouding both Judith's body and mind, sounds familiar and yet remote from
experience... until she realized that it was the sounds of her own gentle moans
of pleasure.<br>
<br>
She realized that she had grasped Daria's wrist once more; lifting her head
from the pillow where it rested, Judith saw that she had stopped Daria from
pulling the zipper of her catsuit open. <br>
<br>
The sharpness of Judith's tone caused Daria to glance up. "Don't!" <br>
<br>
The woman in the nightgown smiled at her counterpart as she gently caressed the
nape of her neck, exposed already by the slightly opened zipper; Daria kissed
the tip of Judith's nose, and made a line of gentle kisses down her cheek to
Judith's right ear. <br>
<br>
"You don't have to be afraid," Daria's whisper was soft in her ear. "I'll take
care of you."<br>
<br>
Daria's hand reached again for the pull-tab of the zipper; once again, Judith
stopped her. <br>
<br>
"Don't," she said, her word almost a plea. <i>"Please."</i><br>
<br>
Daria smiled down at her. "I'll take care of you," she spoke once again. "I
promise."<br>
<br>
Judith looked into Daria's eyes for a long time; she gave a barely noticeable
nod, and turned her head away as Daria began to unzip Judith's garb &ndash;<br>
<br>
For the first time that she could remember in many years, Judith felt a tear
slip down her left cheek as she felt the grotesque scar that was her locket &ndash;
now seared permanently into her flesh, just below the hollow of her neck&ndash;
exposed to the cool night air. <br>
<br>
"It's okay," Daria said, looking from the locket to Judith as she reached out
and turned her head back. "It doesn't matter."<br>
<br>
Shame &ndash; but surprisingly, not anger or hatred &ndash; made Judith's skin flush a bold
crimson as Daria traced a slow, thin line on the underside of Judith's right
breast with an index finger; her back flexed slightly as her breath caught in
her throat, and a sudden, strangled sound of disbelief escaped her as Judith
felt Daria's finger stroked past the locket, and she tried to turn away.<br>
<br>
Daria drew her counterpart back down to the bed; Judith didn't resist as they
kissed once more. "It doesn't matter to me," Daria repeated, as she stroked
Judith's neck. <br>
<br>
Judith moved Daria's hand away from the locket. "Please," she said. "It matters
to me."<br>
<br>
A tiny smile crossed Daria's face; Judith's eyes widened as Daria put her hand
to her chest, and a soft blue light flowed out into the room-<br>
<br>
Judith glanced down to see that the spot on her chest where the locket had
nestled itself was once again soft and unmarred by the piece of jewelry, or the
burn scars that had surrounded it. "Oh," she whispered, wonder on her face.
"Oh, my... how?"<br>
<br>
She looked up to Daria. "Why?"<br>
<br>
Daria smiled. "Because it matters to <i>you.</i>"<br>
<br>
Judith hesitated momentarily as Daria leaned forward once more, but didn't draw
away or resist as their lips met, or as the kiss they shared grew deeper... dark
emotions fell away from the young woman as easily as her clothing did, and for
an all-too brief time afterward, Judith knew nothing but warmth, and joy, and
peace.<br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>You're the first one,</i> Judith thought, looking at a sleeping Daria as she
sat in the desk chair across the room from the bed several minutes ago. T<i>he
first one I haven't tried to kill, or left to die, or in unimaginable torment. </i><br>
<br>
<i>You're the first &ndash; Oh, God -</i><br>
<br>
Judith's scream of agony brought Daria instantly out of sleep. Shading her eyes
against the explosion of blue-white light, and grimacing as the smell of
burning flesh permeated the room, she began to rise from the bed as she saw
Judith screaming in the center of the light, her cloak flowing around her as if
buffeted by a great wind.<br>
<br>
Daria could have sworn that &ndash; just before she disappeared into the light
without a trace &ndash; Judith had reached out to her...<br>
<br>
Before she could get both feet on the floor, a pinkish ring of energy spun into
existence in front of the closet door, and Daria looked up as three persons &ndash;
an attractive twenty-something blonde in blue-motif fatigues, and two men in
bulky, translucent-blue armor that made them look like soldiers in a sci-fi
movie &ndash; stepped through into the room. "Daria! Are you okay?"<br>
<br>
Daria was about to answer, but the way that the two Ringbearers in life-force
armor were staring at her as if their eyes were about to pop out made her reach
back for a blanket. "Her locket reactivated itself as if it had a mind of its
own, or as if there was a fail-safe-"<br>
<br>
"No &ndash; that was the Prophecy, asserting itself," Priscilla Henry &ndash; <i><u>Valkyrie</u></i>,
as most of the Corps of Ringbearers knew her &ndash; replied. "I guess that our
countermeasures to stop the locket didn't work."<br>
<br>
"Well, it wasn't a total waste," one of the <i>Warhammers</i> spoke up, still
looking back from Daria to her bed and back. "At least you calmed her down for
a while-"<br>
<br>
Valkyrie didn't even look back as she pointed her right hand at the Warhammer,
and he yelped as a purplish ring of energy opened up beneath him and sucked him
through. <br>
<br>
"I'll go back to the Liberty Island Citadel and report your status here," the
other Warhammer said quickly, before he disappeared in a flash of disappearing
darkness.<br>
<br>
"At least we know that the Focus works," Valkyrie said, ignoring the
Warhammer's exits as she went over to the desk and picked up an
expensive-looking fountain pen from the desktop. "It temporarily dispelled all
of the emotional pain and suppressed the sociopathic qualities that Judith was
experiencing, and left her a normal young woman who needed to be comforted."<br>
<br>
"I healed her, Priscilla," Daria said, sitting back down on the bed. "With me,
here, she wasn't &ndash; she wasn't &ndash; <i><u>that</u></i> &ndash; she was just..."<br>
<br>
Daria looked up as Priscilla sat down next to her. "I could feel who she was
inside, without all of that anger, without being all twisted up inside," she
said. "She... I wish that it had worked, Priscilla. With my gifted powers, I
could have kept healing her, and kept that thing still until we found some way
to separate her without killing her."<br>
<br>
The two women were silent for a moment. "Did you actually feel something from
her?" Valkyrie asked.<br>
<br>
"Yes. She did, too," the auburn-haired woman said. "It was strange; I knew that
I would probably have to sleep with her when she came through &ndash; but I didn't
realize that we'd - <i>connect...</i>"<br>
<br>
Daria looked her directly in the eye. "Oh, God. Talk about being narcissistic."<br>
<br>
She got up, and began to pace. "A few hours alone with 'myself', and I'm
feeling this way... with everything we've all gone through here, leave it to good
ol' Daria Morgendorffer to find something <i>new and unusual</i> and start
having feelings for an <u>alternate-universe</u> version of myself, even if I'm
just following orders to 'distract her by any means necessary, for as long as
possible.'"<br>
<br>
She stamped one foot on the floor. "Damnit, couldn't it have at least been a
male version of me?"<br>
<br>
"Stop complaining &ndash; at least about the physical part," Valkyrie replied. "Ever
since I decided to take a posting here for the foreseeable future &ndash; and you
guys let me move into the spare room &ndash; I've had a chance to hear you 'in
action' on occasion. 'Darius', 'Dorian', 'Judith' &ndash; you'd still have found a
way to scream. and scream until the cows come home."<br>
<br>
"That might be just the thing, then," she continued, as Daria gave her a cross
look. "I thought this might be a good idea..."<br>
<br>
Daria locked an accusing glare on her friend. "What did you do?"<br>
<br>
"Nothing," was the response. " I just figured that, if nothing else, we can
screw with the Prophecy, if you and she connected."<br>
<br>
Daria went dead still. "What?"<br>
<br>
"We figure we might be able to throw a monkey-wrench in on two points," the
blonde told Daria. "There's a line in the prophecy about how 'the Shadow brings
about its multiple destruction', but if Judith actually feels anything for you
&ndash; especially with the intensity of how you Darias love &ndash; then she won't be able
to kill <i>you</i>, of act in any way to cause your death, without it
emotionally destroying <i>her</i>. Also... going by the way these concepts are
structured, having Judith feel deep emotion for you fundamentally changes who
she is."<br>
<br>
Priscilla smiled. "One of the nice things about Daria Morgendorffer-"<br>
<br>
Daria huffed in dismay. "I hate being spoken of in the third person when I'm in
the conversation."<br>
<br>
"-Is that she's the 'either-or' type of girl," the blonde concluded. "She likes
or she doesn't. She loves intensely, or she doesn't love at all. She's either
Shadow-"<br>
<br>
"Or 'Light'," Daria said, her face brightening &ndash; and just as fast, crinkling
with uncertainty. "That's really pretty thin. That's 'B-grade horror movie
psychology principles' thin."<br>
<br>
"Apparently, you don't realize just how potentially completely screwed we all
really are," Valkyrie pointed out with unusual bluntness. "I'm a 'Cinematic' -
that's a specialist in <i>Gardner Principle</i>-related activities and beings -
and with the way this woman is jumping from universe to universe, not only is
there the <u>very real possibility</u> that she's going to open up a portal
into one of those realities-"<br>
<br>
The blonde rose from her seat. "Where those 'B-grade horror movie psychology
principles' are the <i>Holy Gospel</i> that those worlds run upon. <i><u>THAT</u>
means those creatures and things actually exist there, and have a chance of
breaking through to one of <u>our</u> worlds</i> &ndash; but that the principles that
one of those realities runs on &ndash; and how to use them to our advantage - may be
all that saves All There Is," she snapped. "You get me?"<br>
<br>
Daria was still as she nodded, and then walked over to the window, where the
morning sun was just beginning to rise. "You know, with what happened two years
ago, I thought that we'd already lived through the end of the world," she said,
looking outside. "Surprise. That was just the thirty-second promo trailer, if
what you're saying is true."<br>
<br>
Valkyrie walked over to stand next to Daria &ndash; and both looked out over a
landscape better suited for an apocalyptic film, as the street as far ac she
could see was crowded with vehicles that looked as if they were now makeshift
homes, hundreds upon hundreds of people milling around as they began their new
day... in the distance, the thick energy beam from the shield generator array at
the former Halcyon Hills Corporate Park was visible as it flowed upward to
create the massive energy dome that covered the landscape for twenty miles out
from the City of Lawndale, shielding everything beneath from the catastrophic
solar storms of the <i>Daylight Crisis.</i> "So, I should hope that you're
right &ndash; and that Judith has let a one-night stand develop very quickly into a
bond."<br>
<br>
"It happens in films," Valkyrie said, managing a small smile. "In one reality,
a universal-class being called Michael Korvac was beaten because in one moment,
the expression of woman he loved showed that she was afraid for him because she
didn't think that he was strong enough to prevail. That momentary lapse &ndash; and
the self-doubt he held in that moment - was all the other side needed to bring
him down."<br>
<br>
She looked at Daria. "Who knows? Maybe there'll come a time when Judith seeing
you &ndash; or realizing that you could die &ndash; is all that stands between the
possibility of omniversal destruction."<br>
<br>
"You're putting a lot of faith into how much one night in bed with me can mean
to someone," Daria observed. <br>
<br>
"I've seen the women and men other Darias have had in their lives, and the
lengths those people went through for those Darias," the other woman returned.
"I believe my faith is justified."<br>
<br>
Daria looked back out the window. "I hope so," she said, watching as she saw
the masses of people start to follow a group of Ringbearers who flew overhead,
heading towards the massive Area Relief Center that had been made from a
re-furbished Cranberry Commons &ndash; for the foreseeable future, the only place for
the vast majority to receive food, water, medical care and the basic essentials
of life. "As horrible as the world is now &ndash; I don't want to think of worse than
this... or nothing at all."<br>
<br>
