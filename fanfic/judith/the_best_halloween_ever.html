<br>
A '<u>Judith Strikes</u>!' fic by Brother Grimace</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The young woman known as Judith barely had time to scream as Daria
Morgendorffer's spring-loaded bed flipped over, around on one side, and smacked
her face-first into a padded wall in the blink of an eye!<br>
<br>
"GAH-!" Judith choked out, as the bed fell away from her. "DA-"<br>
<br>
The curse was choked away as the bed slammed back into her, driving her back
into the wall! "You little <i>bi-"</i><br>
<br>
The bed struck again with a room-rattling <b>WHAM! </b><br>
<br>
"I'm gonna <i>ki-"</i><br>
<br>
<b>WHAM! </b><br>
<br>
"You're gonna <i>pay-"</i><br>
<br>
<b>WHAM! </b><br>
<br>
<i>"Burn-" </i><br>
<br>
<b>WHAM!</b> <br>
<br>
<i>"Your-"</i><br>
<br>
<b>WHAM!</b> <br>
<br>
<i>"House-"</i><br>
<br>
<b>WHAM!</b><br>
<br>
<i>"To the <u>ground</u>-!"</i><br>
<br>
<b>WHAM! BAM! SLAM! BAM! WHAM! WHAM! SLAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!</b> <br>
<br>
<i>&quot;People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect,
but actually from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big
ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey... stuff...&quot;</i> Judith mumbled, words
and spit dribbling from her mouth. <br>
<br>
Even the red cloak that Judith wore seemed shaken as she took a single,
unsteady half-step away from the padded wall, where a perfect impression of the
back of her body was visible. <br>
<br>
<i>&quot;The case for antidisestablishmentarianism has never been more
threadbare... ah... ah... ah... oh, <u>sh</u>-"</i><br>
<br>
Judith's eyes went wide as her foot settled solidly upon the floor - and a very
loud <i>CLICK!</i> echoed through the room-<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! </b><br>
<br>
<b>WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! </b><br>
<br>
<b>WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! </b><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>WHAM!</span>
</b><br>
<br>
<br>
The bed settled back into its original position as Judith, actually able to
carry a tune, began to sing in a punch-drunk manner. <i>"Cause you know that if
you live in your imagination... tomorrow you'll be everybody's fascination... in my
victory... just remember me... when I make it <u>shineeeeeee</u>..."</i><br>
<br>
Judith shook her head clear; a determined glare in her eyes. "Oooooooh... I <i><u>hate</u></i>
realities like this!" she hissed. "First things first, though."<br>
<br>
Crossing the room &ndash; and watching her step for other surprises &ndash; Judith easily
dodged the spring-loaded executioner's axe, the hurled boulder from the closet
and the jury summons as she made her way to Daria's desk, and took the spare
pair of glasses in the top drawer. <br>
<br>
Placing the glasses inside her cloak, she then drew from within an energy
pistol so mean and evil in appearance that the sun actually went behind a thick
cloud formation when rays of sunlight coming through the window sparkled off
the weapon. <br>
<br>
"Now, let's see," Judith said, and the chorus of seven Benedictine monks over
in the corner began to sing <i>Ave Satani</i> as she clicked through the
weapon's settings. "<u>Toasty Warm</u>, <u>For Hot Beverages Only</u>, <u>Tanned</u>,
<u>Ouch-That Stings,</u> <u>Where's The Aloe Ointment</u>, <u>It REALLY HURTS</u>,
<u>Grilled Like A Cheese Sandwich</u>, <u>If I Could Spend Time In A Broiler</u>,
<u>Smoking Hot Babe</u>, <u>Burning Man Dance Fever</u>, <u>Water Only Makes It
Worse</u>, <u>Oh <i>God</i> Make It Stop</u>, <u>Welcome to Pompeii</u>, <u>Carbon-14,000
Degrees</u>, and '<u>Here's Zeus &ndash; <i>LIVE</i>!"</u><br>
<br>
The monks &ndash; and their unseen musical accompaniment &ndash; continued to perform, the
music building upon itself as the dial on the weapon clicked and locked on '<u>Here's
Zeus &ndash; <i>LIVE</i></u>!' <br>
<br>
Judith pulled a second identical weapon from her cloak; the second weapon made
a rapid series of audible clicks as the young woman held them close. "Now," she
said, an evil smile covering her face, "Let's see just how hot the 'Barksdale
women' really are."<br>
<br>
Holding both weapons at the ready as she passed through the door to the
bathroom that Daria and Quinn shared, Judith prepared to kick open the door &ndash;<br>
<br>
"Daria &ndash; what do you think of my costume?"<br>
<br>
A sound that could only have been a scream rocked the bathroom as Quinn Morgendorffer
&ndash; dressed in a life-size 'Hello Kitty' costume &ndash; suddenly appeared at the door.
<br>
<br>
"GAWD, Daria, what's your damage?" Quinn huffed, as the cloak pulled a
shrieking Judith (who dropped both weapons) from the bathroom in its mad dash
to escape the human-sized cat-figure. "You're so weird &ndash; even on Halloween!"<br>
<br>
The bubbly redhead looked down at the dropped weapons, and held them up. "Well,
at least you know how to make up a costume," she continued, looking down the
barrel of one of the weapons. "This is really cool-"<br>
<br>
Quinn's eyes went wide as a platypus, wearing a stylish fedora and a silver
ring on its right flipper, appeared from nowhere, grabbed the weapons &ndash; tipped
his hat to her - and disappeared! <br>
<br>
"MOM!" Quinn squeaked, all but flying from the bathroom as she raced through
her room and downstairs. "MOM! Daria and Jane are upstairs doing weird things
again with weird outer garments and plastic models of sci-fi movie guns and
weird animals from Australia &ndash; but the platypus did have good taste in
haberdashery, and good manners...!"<br>
<br>
Quinn's squeals rang down the hall as Daria Morgendorffer (Jane Lane beside
her) opened the door to her room &ndash; and both stopped as they saw Judith hanging
upside down, glaring at them as she (and her cloak) hung suspended upside down
in duct-tape cocoons in the middle of the room. <br>
<br>
They shrugged in unison.<br>
<br>
"Meh," they said as one, walking inside.<br>
<br>
Daria closed the door as Jane (dressed in the wet black leather look of
'Trinity' from <i>The Matrix</i>) walked over and looked Judith over, ignoring
the way the inverted young woman looked at her with surprise before glaring
with hate at Daria. "Oh, jeez, <i>amiga,</i>" she said, " not <i>another</i>
evil counterpart from another dimension trying to kill you, torture you or have
her sordid way with you and not invite me in for a three-way?"<br>
<br>
Daria (dressed as Pippi Longstocking) ignored Judith as she shook her head. "I
don't care how many times you say it, Lane &ndash; you're not going to get a movie
role just because you say that you're a lesbian."<br>
<br>
"Well, who says that I can't enjoy clam chowder as much as a sausage-fest?"
Jane said suggestively, waggling her eyebrows, "Besides &ndash; if they think that
I'm a lesbian, imagine just how many casting calls I'd get to go on... and the
food they'll toss my way. After all, <i>'E.F.' trumps 'F.F."</i><br>
<br>
The currently unbound, bespectacled young woman looked at Jane. "E.F.?"<br>
<br>
Jane looked Judith over, and smiled as she turned back to Daria. "Yeah &ndash; <i>'Eat
First.'</i> That's the one thing I miss about dating Tom. All of the free dinners."<br>
<br>
Daria rolled her eyes. "You're sick."<br>
<br>
Jane snapped her fingers &ndash; and the monks broke out into a soulful chorus of <i>'Sexual
Healing'</i> (accompanied by excellent backup music as they danced) as Jane
began to slowly dance around Judith.<br>
<br>
Daria shook her head as Jane, running her hands across her body in a playfully
seductive manner as she let them slide slowly over her hips and up to her neck,
had an obvious effect on Judith (as the front of her catsuit showed). "Well,"
she said, glancing back in Judith's direction. "I guess someone here doesn't
have a problem with that idea."<br>
<br>
"Hey, Daria!" Jane laughed. "I've got an idea! If you've got a chocolate bar
and can skip out of here for fifteen minutes, maybe we can tame this wild
beast!"<br>
<br>
"Yeah, yeah," Daria sighed. "Let's get rid of her, so we can get to the party
at the Zon."<br>
<br>
Jane practically bounced on air. "Ooh &ndash; let me do it, let me do it!"<br>
<br>
Daria dropped her head. "Well, since it was your idea..."<br>
<br>
The smile on her face lighting up the room, Jane raised her hands in the air
and clapped twice &ndash; and then, punctuated it with a loud, throaty 'UHH!' as she
thrust her hips forward. <br>
<br>
In response, a pair of mechanical arms reached down from the ceiling and turned
Judith right-side up &ndash; followed by a third arm that gently took the pair of
glasses that Judith off her face.<br>
<br>
The girls watched with satisfaction as another arm came down and slapped Judith
soundly; the pair of arms that held Judith moved her across the room and held
her in front of the closet (her glasses replaced by the arm that took them)
where yet another arm came down to open the door, while the arm that slapped
her swatted Judith into the closet!<br>
<br>
A brilliant blue flash erupted from the closet, followed by another as two of
the mechanical arms balled up the cloak, and the left-handed one threw it into
the closet behind Judith!<br>
<br>
"Nice speed," Jane said, as the right-handed arm gave the other a 'thumbs-up'. <br>
<br>
"Sounds like it," Daria agreed. <br>
<br>
"Yeah, but we'd better teach those things some control before they kill someone
with that fastball," Jane noted. <br>
<br>
The arms all disappeared as Quinn bounded into the room, followed by Helen
Morgendorffer (wearing her Lara Croft outfit). "Well, Quinn?" Helen asked,
looking annoyed.<br>
<br>
Quinn's eyes widened, and her mouth dropped open at the sight of the
(otherwise) normality of Daria's room. "But &ndash; but I saw it!" <br>
<br>
Helen dragged Quinn out of the room. "Come on, Quinn," she told her younger
daughter. "It's Halloween &ndash; so your father won't mind if I put a little
something extra in your warm milk to calm you down."<br>
<br>
Daria smiled as Helen glanced back at her and Jane. "Girls &ndash; why not come down
for some Halloween-theme snacks? We can't let all the paralegals eat them all."<br>
<br>
"We'll be right down," Daria said.<br>
<br>
As the door closed, the two girls turned to one another. "Halloween treats,
your sister gets annoyed and we have fun with an evil counterpart," Jane said.
"What's not to love?"<br>
<br>
Daria nodded in agreement. "This really is the best Halloween ever!"<br>
<br>
