<P><TT>Title: "Just Add Connor" Fic #1</TT></P>

<P><TT>Summary: Daria and Jane befriend a new student at Lawndale High.
But, after Daria spends a day with him, the old feud with Jane over Tom
resurfaces. Will this new student tear apart Lawndale's strongest friendship?
Or will our favorite cynics take him under their wings?</TT></P>

<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick note from the author:
It's winter now, in fact, the story starts the Tuesday back from Thanksgiving
break, so everyone's going to have attire for the season. The Fashion Club
will still be decked out in their season four garb, only winter-fied (is
that a word?), and Brittany and Kevin still in their cheering and football
uniforms. Jane's wearing the same black v-neck and red shirt she always
wears, but now has gray cargos. Daria is wearing her outfit from "The
Road Warrior," black T-shirt and blue jeans, with her normal green
jacket. Any other major changes I'll be sure to let you know, but other
than that, use your imagination.</TT></P>

<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, remember that this
is an introductory fanfic. It's gonna be longer and suck more than the
follow-ups because of having to establish a character and that character's
relationships with the others. So, try to cut me some slack, okay? And
as always, any comments and constructive criticisms is appreciated. Oh,
and click the link on the new guys name. You need to know what he looks
like, or else a joke in the middle of Act I won't make sense.</TT></P>

<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and one more thing,
I wrote this before the whole Daria/Tom thing in eps. #412-#413, and there's
no waayyy I'm writing it again. So all of my followup fics are going to
be as if that whole thing never happened, ok? Happy reading.</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Ms. Li is talking to a group 4 of new students. Zoom in on a male
student, Connor Jablonski, 17, about 5'8, spiky black hair, and green eyes.
Definitely good looking. He has on a faded black hooded sweatshirt jacket,
with a black T-shirt under it, kinda baggy dark blue jeans, and black boots.
His face is expressionless.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Ms. Li: (continuous)...so to make sure no new Lawndale High student
feels alienated, you will each be taking a psychological exam.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (under his breath) Goody.</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Dr. Manson is sitting at a round table, Connor is across from her,
slouched down in the chair.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Dr. Manson: Ok Clint...</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (cutting off) Connor.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Dr. Manson: Right, sorry Connor. So now, Clint, (holds up picture
of two people talking) What do you see in this picture?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: People walking down the sidewalk bursting into flames.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Dr. Manson: Um...no...Clint, it's two people talking.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: It's Connor. And the last time I took one of these they
said I could see whatever I want.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Dr. Manson: This isn't that kind of a test Clint. Now, can you tell
me what they're talking about?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (sounding out every letter) It's C-O-N-N-O-R. And there
aren't any words... so no I can't.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Dr. Manson: No no no, you're supposed to make up a conversation
for them to be having.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Then they're talking about how it would be cool if everyone
walking down the street spontaneously combusted.</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Dr. Manson frowns, Connor smirks]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Scene 3</TT></P>

<P><TT>INT: </TT></P>

<P><TT>Lawndale High/Morning/Tuesday/Mr. DiMartino's Room</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Mr. DiMartino is in the front addressing the students. Daria and
Jane are in their normal seats beside each other in the second row back.
Connor enters the room and hands Mr. DiMartino a piece of paper.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Mr. DiMartino: Ok CLASS, we have a new STUdent joining us toDAY.
Connor Jab...Jabloon...um...Ja...</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (sighs and rolls his eyes) Jablonski.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Mr. DiMartino: Right, that's what I SAID. Connor, take the seat
behind DARia.</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Connor looks confused, the look on his face says 'I'm new here
you idiot, I don't know any body's name']</TT></P>

<P><TT>Mr. DiMartino: (annoyed) The one in the second row son. (Connor
still looks confused) OVER THERE! (Mr. DiMartino points to the vacant seat
behind Daria)</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Connor nods and walks over and sits behind Daria]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Mr. DiMartino: Well ConNOR, perhaps you think it RUDE to be asked
a QUESTion on your first day. HowEVER, I do not. Last week we startED a
unit on World War ONE. Now (evil laugh) would you care to tell us the HIStory
of GAS WARfare during this PERiod?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: There was no history. Gas warfare was introduced during
this period.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Mr. DiMartino: Good. But would you CARE to ELABerate on the subject
Mr. JABooski?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (sighs) It's JabLONski. And the first use of gas was attributed
to the Germans on the Russian front in 1915.About 520 pressurized cylinders
were brought to the front and, following an artillery barrage, a five mile
wide cloud of greenish-yellow chlorine gas was released on the wind to
drift down over the French trenches. The defenders were overcome with violent
nausea, shortness of breath and blindness and were able to offer little
resistance to the offensive. Panic, fear and death were wide spread. The
British replied in kind at Loos in September of the same year. Both sides
soon learned to deliver their deadly vapors through exploding artillery
shells. Even more feared than chlorine was diphosgene or "mustard
gas" against which gas masks were useless.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Mr. DiMartino: Good. Perhaps...suspiciously good...</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: (looking sidelong at Daria) Looks like you've got a little
competition Daria.</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Mr. O'Neil is in the front addressing the class on Shakespeare
in his melodramatic way, when Connor walks in]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Mr. O'Neil: (nervous) Um c-c-can I h-help you?</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Connor hands Mr. O'Neil a piece of paper. He unfolds it]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Mr. O'Neil: (cheery...creepishly cheery) Oh, you must be the new
student! Class, this is our new student, Connor Jab...Jab...(tries to read
the name, not getting it right)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (sighs) Jablonski.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Mr. O'Neil: Right, Jablonski. Why don't you take a seat behind Daria,
right over there. (Makes sure to point the seat out)</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Connor walks back and sits down. The lesson continues.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>INT: </TT></P>

<P><TT>Lawndale High/Before Lunch/Tuesday/Hallway</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Daria and Jane are standing at Jane's locker while she puts her
stuff in it.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: (in the middle of telling a joke) ...so the monkey ask the
porcupine to join the cult and then...</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: (sees the Fashion Club walking down the hall) Speaking of
cults...</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Cut to view of the fashion club]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Sandi: Hey Quinn, isn't that your weird cousin or whatever.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Quinn: (sees Daria) Um yea.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Sandi: (evil grin) Why don't we go say hi.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Quinn: Um I don't think we need to do that Sandi.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Sandi: Well if *you* seem to know what we *need* to do, Quinn, perhaps
*you* think *you* would be a better president of the Fashion Club.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Quinn: (fake sincere) Oh *no* Sandi, I could *never* be a better
president than *you*.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Sandi: Then let's go.</TT></P>

<P><TT>[The FC walks over to Daria and Jane]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Sandi: (to Daria) Hey Quinn's cousin or whatever. (she shoves the
books out of Daria's hands) Maybe you should watch where you're going.
(the FC walks away and laughs)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Vultures.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: (picking up her books) Ignore them and they'll eventually
leave us alone.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Uh huh. And we've been ignoring them for how long?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: (knows she's beat) Shut up.</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Cut to view of Connor, who is standing around the corner, he witnessed
the whole thing, and obviously thinks that the Fashion Club are jerks.
He looks at a piece of paper, zoom in on the paper (it has the number 227
and the numbers 34-4-2 written on it). Connor searches for his locker.
He follows the row till he gets to number 227, which is right beside Jane's.
Daria and Jane are still standing there, Jane finishes putting her stuff
away and they leave. Connor tries the combination of his locker then tries
to open it. It doesn't work. He tries again, still won't open. He tries
again and when it doesn't work, he bangs his head on the locker, it opens.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor:(raises an eyebrow) Well...there's a cliche. (shrugs and
puts away the books from his first two classes)</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Blink182, "Fentoozler" plays in background. Daria and
Jane are standing in line to get their lunch.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: (once again attempting her joke)...so then after the monkey
convinces the porcupine to join the cult...</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Jane, you've been in the middle of the same joke all morning.
Does this even have a point? (Jane shrugs and picks up a thing of jello)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: (surveying the jello) When did they start making brown jello?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: They didn't.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Yuck. (puts the jello back) So anyway, you coming to the Mystik
Spiral gig Friday?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Unless the high commander summands me back before then.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: I'll count you in then. At the Zen.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Surprise, surprise.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Hey, it's the only place in town worth playing.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: It's the only place in town that would pay them.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Bingo. Oh, there won't be enough room in the Tank, so we'll
have to take Trent's car</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Trent's car?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Yeah. Trent said I could drive it. Don't worry, he just had
a tune up last week.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Good. (beat) Wait a minute. You're driving?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: There's no way you are. I've heard stories. (Daria rolls her
eyes and Jane smirks)</TT></P>

<P><TT>CUT TO:</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Connor is sitting at one end of a table alone, picking at a salad.
A group of four or five football jocks come up to the table.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jock #1: Hey punk! (grabs Connor by the collar of his jacket) This
is our table. Get lost!</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jock #2: Yea beat it loser!</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Connor picks up his tray and walks away, the jocks laughing as
the sit down. Connor walks to the back of the cafeteria to the only empty
space he can find, which is the other end of Daria and Jane's table.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (kind of quiet but still loud enough to get Jane's attention)
excuse me? Mind if I sit over here? (motion to the opposite end of the
table)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: (shrugs) Knock yourself out. (Connor sits. Jane turns back
to Daria, who she was explaining a theory to.) So anyway, you see? School
actually is, by definition, hell.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (to himself, but loud enough for both Daria and Jane to
hear) Hell is just a word. Reality is much worse. </TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: (chuckles, Connor looks up, obviously he didn't mean to say
that out loud) Good one, come on down. (motions for him to come down to
their end.)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Are you sure?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Sure.</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Connor moves down and takes a seat beside Daria.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: (extending her hand) I'm Jane Lane, artiste extrordanar.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (shakes Jane's hand) Connor.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: (motions to Daria) And this is my partner in crime, Daria.
Cynic, outcast, and committed fan of late night game shows.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Funny. (looks at Jane with the "remind me to kill you
later" look)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (shyly, in a way that is strangely familiar to the way Daria
talks to Trent) Um..hey.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Hey. (notices Quinn out of the corner of her eye) Uh oh.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: (also notices) Fashion junkie 3 o'clock.</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Quinn walks up to them]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Quinn: Okay Daria, what's this?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: A table, Quinn. There's one much like it over there. Away
from us.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Quinn: (ignores Daria's remark) The Fashion Club keeps asking me
why this guy is sitting with you? He's cute.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (disbelief) Uh huh.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Quinn: You know, in a creepy sort of way. (looking at Connor) I
wonder when he'll ask me out.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: How insulted would you be if I said never?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Quinn: Very.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: We wouldn't want that now would we. (Quinn nods) In that
case...(pretends to think)...not even if we were the last people on earth.
(Quinn gives him a weird look) (pause....) There would still be goats.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Quinn: EEEWWWWWW (she storms back to the FC table, Daria and Jane
smirk)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Woah, impressive.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Never seen anyone do that before.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: What?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Reject my sister.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: That's you're sister?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Unfortunately.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (puts his hand on her shoulder, sympathetic) I'm sorry.</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Rage Against The Machine, "Guerilla Radio" plays in background.
Daria, Jane, and Connor are standing around in front of the school.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (continuing something) ...and after my dad got transferred
we had to move again. Well, the move was rough on my mom to begin with,
because there weren't any legal offices hiring and the city already had
more than enough lawyers on there side, but I think what put the cap on
things was when mom came home from the store one afternoon and dad was
with his secretary. In their bed.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Damn. But that still doesn't explain what you're doing here.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Dad got the house. He had the best team of lawyers in the
city, and since he was the only one in the family making money, it made
the case even easier.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: So why come to Lawndale? Nothing available in hell?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (smirks) A friend of my mom's owns a legal firm in town
and gave her a job. Some place with like eight partners. Schrector, Schretor
something something.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Well now isn't that coincidental.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: What?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: My mom works at the same firm.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Really? Cool.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jodie: Hey Jane. Daria.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Whatever it is, no.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jodie: (sighs) Come on Daria. I'm not trying to rope you into any
more activities. I just haven't had the chance to welcome the new student.
(to Connor, extends her hand) Hi, I'm Jodie Landon, and this is Michael.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Mack: Everyone calls me Mack.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Hey. Connor. (shakes their hands)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jodie: We would stay and talk but I need to get to the student council
meeting. Later. (Jodie and Mack leave)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (looks a little confused) That was strange.</TT></P>

president had to declare my room a disaster area. (Daria and Jane smirk)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Shall we say tomorrow then?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Sure, if you don't mind.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: No way. Quinn has the Fashion Club over all week. Trying
to make up for wearing the wrong color nail polish last Friday.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Giving all her stuff away again?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: She's not giving away any of <I>her </I>stuff. (beat) Just
Jake's gold card. </TT></P>

some new strings before our gig Friday night.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Yes, yes. I heard. (hands him the 10)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Trent: (takes it) Thanks. So, you two still coming to the gig Friday?
We could use roadies.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Yeah we'll be there. But call us roadies again and you die.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Trent: Would you rather be called groupies?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Fine. We're roadies. </TT></P>

<P><TT>Trent: Cool. Gotta go rehearse. Later. (exits)</TT></P>

little competent company.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (wasn't really paying attention, staring at Daria who didn't
notice) Huh?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: To the gig. Friday. At the Zen.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Me? </TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: You're the only Connor here right? Unless Daria renamed one
of her voices. (Daria rolls her eyes)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (you can tell he's never been asked to do something like
that before) Um...ok....if you're sure you want me to.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Sure. The more the marrier. </TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Ok cool. (looks at his watch) Crap, I gotta go. Mom'll want
to give me the third degree when I get home.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Yeah I better go too.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Yeah, Helen can't stand to bond when no one's there.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (shy, once again, similar to how Daria acts around Trent)
So uhh...where do you live?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: About two blocks down the road.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Cool. The apartment building's about five or six. I'll walk
you home.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Ok. (stands up) Later Jane.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Later. (Daria and Connor leave. Jane watches them leave, then
gets a look that says she's considering something...but then shakes her
head) Nah.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Depends on how you define good. Good as in "they try
their best and that's what's important" then yes. Good as in "they
can play organized music with good, meaningful lyrics" then no.</TT></P>

of the seventh circle of hell thus far?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (smirks) Well....it's not as bad as I thought it would be.
I mean, there's nothing here and the school's full of shallow people who
care more about their shoes than themselves, but meeting you sort of canceled
them all out. (stops for a second, realizing what he said) Umm...</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: (blushing but not near as much as she would have if Trent
said that) Thanks.</TT></P>

take of his coat for Daria aw in't that so cute you wanna puke) Here.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Um nothing. How did you get this number?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: It's easy when you have a phone book. Well actually, I used
the web. But that makes me sound like a geek.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: (jokingly) I thought you were a geek. </TT></P>

in Lawndale.</TT></P>

for her.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Guess so.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Yeah. Um anyway...(very shyly, and if you don't know by

um...do something..today. You know....since uhh...Jane's busy with that
uhh...Tom and all...</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Um ok sure. Like what?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor:(shy) I was kind of thinking you could uh...show me around.
But we'll figure it out when I get there. (they both smirk) I'm still new
y'know. Well uh...I'll see you in about two hours. Is that ok?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: My uncle used to own a funeral home. It burnt down in a
fire, but he didn't really want to rebuild. So he got rid of all the hearses
and such. Gave me this one.</TT></P>

done today, it'll never get done. I'm booked solid the whole month. (Mack's
expression shows he's upset about this) And I needed a day to spend with
Mack, since we never see each other.</TT></P>

Get your quality time while you can. We're all going to die come the millenium
you know.</TT></P>

to see you on a date?</TT></P>

keel over. (looks towards Jodie and Mack) And I know what would make it
even better.</TT></P>

what's going on. (walks up to Daria, Connor, Jodie, and Mack, the Fashion

look like a date.</TT></P>

of bricks.</TT></P>

down.</TT></P>

smirks)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Tom: What?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Daria. At the mall. With Connor.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Tom: So, nothing wrong with going somewhere with a friend.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: He just moved here. She's known him for five days.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Tom: I don't see the big deal. We knew each other for less than
five minutes.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: This is Daria we're talking about here. We were completely
different.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Tom: Not really. You're acting just like she did when we....wait
a minute. You're worried that this guy's gonna replace you, aren't you?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: (defensive) No! And I did not replace her.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Tom: No, but you rearranged priorities.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: So?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Tom: So, you're afraid that's what Daria's going to do.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Nah. Daria knows the value of a friend.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Tom: I know. And right now, she's the only one that guy has. </TT></P>

<P><TT>Jake: GAH!! Damnit! Not again!</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Daria and Connor exchange glances.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: I better go help Jake untangle himself from the lights.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (notices something in the front yard) Is that a plastic
candy cane?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: (sighs, obviously not fond of it) Yes.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: I never pictured you one for holiday spirit.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: I'm not. But my family...</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Quinn comes out of the house with a large file folder full of papers.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Quinn: Daddy, I finished my list like you told me to...(notices
Daria and Connor) Oh, you're back.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (sees the folder) That's all a list?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Quinn: No! Of course not! This is only one fourth of it. (Connor
raises an eyebrow, Daria shakes her head)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Don't ask.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jake: You have a list too, kiddo?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: (sarcasm, surprise surprise) Yeah, it's hidden in my unicorn
trinket box. Let me run up and get it.</TT></P>

by the window.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Thanks again for inviting me in. Mom's having a client over
for dinner. I'm pretty sure she'd just as soon not have me around.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: What makes you think that?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: She said she'd just as soon not have me around. (Daria smirks)</TT></P>

<P><TT>[There's a knock at the door.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Helen: (OS) Daria.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: You have reached the room of Daria Morgandorffer. She's not
in right now, but if you'd leave your name and request, she'll be sure
not to get back to you. (Connor smirks)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Helen: (OS) Very funny Daria. (opens the door) I would appreciate
it if you'd stop...(sees Connor, in shock that there's a guy with her)
Oh, I didn't know you had company. </TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Yes. I would like you to meet the high commander. My mission
is over, I can now return home. (Connor smirks, Helen sighs)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (decides it would be for the best if he introduced himself)
Hey, Mrs. Morgandorffer. (extends a hand) I'm Connor.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Helen: Hello. (shakes his hand) Daria, I came to tell you dinner
was ready. Perhaps your friend would like to stay?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: (obviously uncomfortable about this) Well...uh...</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (to the rescue) I would love to, Mrs. Morgandorffer, but
actually, I was hoping I could take Daria to dinner tonight. If that's
okay with you, of course.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Helen: (in shock) Well...sure. I...suppose that would be alright...</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Thanks. (to Daria) C'mon, we better go. It was nice meeting
you Mrs. Morgandorffer.</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Jane and Tom are sitting across from each other in a corner both.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: (oblivious to everything except the subject at hand) I still
can't believe she would hang out with him after knowing him five days.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Tom: (getting tired of this) I still can't believe you're talking
about this.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: (oblivious) I mean, yes, he did come to the gig last night,
but that was completely different...</TT></P>

<P><TT>Tom: You were there?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: ...I was there. (catches on) Hey! That's not the only reason.
(Tom looks at her) Okay, okay. So maybe it is. It's just weird you know.
It's not like her.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Tom: Did you ever stop to think that maybe she likes hanging out
with him? He seems like a nice guy.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: (shrugs) I guess. I can't really talk about this without being
hypocritical, can I?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Tom: Not really. (Jane smirks a little)</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Jodie and Mack come through the doors and see Jane and Tom. They
walk over to them.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Have a seat. (she and Tom scoot down)</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Mack sits beside Tom and Jodie has a seat beside Jane.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Mack: So what's this evening's topic of conversation?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Just talking about Daria's change of pace.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Mack: Huh?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Tom: Jane thinks Daria's acting weird because she's been hanging
out with Connor all day.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Not weird. Just not like her.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jodie: That does make sense. I've never seen her take so well to
a person so quickly.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Mack: (shrugs) Maybe she likes him.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Ha! It takes her longer than this to earn a person's trust,
let alone like them.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Mack: Yeah, but how long did it take you to like Tom?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jodie: He's got a point. Maybe Daria just likes to be with a guy
that has an interest in spending time with her.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Mack: (wants to share his information, but knows he can't) Yeah.
Maybe she just wants to feel like you. (the others look at him) What? (sees
Daria and Connor enter the Pizza King) And speaking of which...</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Daria and Connor notice them and walk up to the booth.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Hey guys.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jodie: Hey. We were just...(Jane elbows her)...not talking about
you at all.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: (mumbles) That was smooth.</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Daria and Connor exchange glances.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Do you mind if we join you?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Or would you like to not talk about us some more?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: (uncomfortable laugh) Have a seat.</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Jane, Jodie, Tom, and Mack scoot down. Daria sits on the side with
the girls, Connor with the guys.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: (a sorry attempt at conversation) So, you two been together
all day?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Yeah, so? You've been with Tom all day.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Well I didn't say anything was wrong with it.</TT></P>

<P><TT>[The others look quite uncomfortable.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jodie: (desperate for a change of subject) So, Daria, I though you
had to stay home tonight?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: (smirks) Got out of that one.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Mack: How'd you manage that?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: I kissed up to her mom.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Mack: What's that have to do with her?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Told her I wanted to take Daria to dinner.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Put her in shock. (Daria and Connor smirk)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Guess you had to be there.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: (couldn't say a worse thing right now) So, basically Connor's
just here to help you put people into a state of shock?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: (getting a tad angry) What?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: (ok, so she could say something worse) Yeah, pretending to
be on a date to humiliate Princess Grace, then pretending to take you out
so you can get out of spending the evening at home. </TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Well, I am paying so technically...</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: (interrupts, getting very angry, but still remaining calm)
So, let me get this straight, you can go out with Tom whenever you damn
well feel like it, and leave me with nothing but the cracks in my ceiling.
And yet, I'm not allowed have another friend because makes you feel left
out because you're forced to spend time with your boyfriend.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: (getting defensive) Now wait just a minute here Daria...</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: I'm sick of waiting just a minute. I'm out of here. (gets
up and walks out)</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Daria?</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Everyone looks at Jane.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (gets in front of Daria and starts walking backwards) I
know it's probably not my business, but what happened back there?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: You're right, it isn't any of your business.</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Connor gives her one of those "do you want to talk about it"
looks.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Pineapple and clam. Definitely no more seafood on pizza.</TT></P>

<P><TT>[The others try to smirk, but no luck.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Tom: Yeah, that was gross, but I wasn't talking about the pizza.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: What then?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Mack: I think he was talking about that whole thing with Daria.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: (doesn't want to talk about that) Oh, that. No big deal.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jodie: No big deal? You just started World War III with your best
friend.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: It'll blow over.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Tom: Just like last time?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Uh...yes?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Tom: Face it Jane. You two never got over the last time.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Mack: What was that about anyway?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Daria thought I replaced her when I met Tom. But we got over
that.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Not replacing really...</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (obviously knows the feeling) Daria, people always get like
that when they start a relationship or even just meet someone new, but
you can never replace a best friend. I know how it feels. (told ya) Being
the third wheel and everything, but it doesn't last long. I mean, you two
have been fine for the time I've known you. All five days...but still...</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: That's true, but I already said I was over all of that.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (shrugs) Someone must not be over it if you're fighting
again.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: I guess.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: The situation's just reversed this time.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: What?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Jane feels threatened by you spending time with me. She
thinks your rearranging priorities. She doesn't want it to happen again
because of what happened last time. Why else would she have said that stuff
about me?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Yeah, you have a point. But she shouldn't have a problem
with you. You just moved here. No offense, but you're far from being a
priority.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (smirks) You always know how to make a guy feel special
don't you. (Daria smirks) But, Jane had just met Tom, and you had a problem
with it right?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Yeah, but it was a new thing then. Like you said, this has
all happened before. And it's not like I'm going to start dating you or
anything.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (slightly disappointed, but not showing it) Yeah. Well...maybe
you should try telling her that, then.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: (sighs) You're right. Thanks, Connor.</TT></P>

past Jane, who watched from down the hall, and Sandi nods approvingly.
Jane raises an eyebrow then looks sort of regretful.]</TT></P>

water. Daria is standing around the corner with an empty bottle of spring
water.]</TT></P>

that happen.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: It doesn't involve you. Why are you so concerned anyway?</TT></P>

two destroy each other and not do anything. Plus, it's all because of me
anyway.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: What upset Jane in the first place was you hanging out with
me.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: What upset Jane was how I acted when she first started dating
Tom. The tension always been there. That was just an excuse.</TT></P>

other soaked, you'd think the tension would be worn off.</TT></P>

<P><TT>CUT TO:</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Split screen of Daria and Jane.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Ah, so those private lines do pay off. No perky Quinn first
thing in the morning.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Jane?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: The one and only. Listen Daria, I just wanted to...</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Apologize.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Yeah.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Me too. I shouldn't have said that thing about you not letting
me have another person around.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: And I shouldn't have said that stuff about Connor just being
around to freak people out.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: And I shouldn't have made that voodoo doll. </TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: I'd like to know how you did that. Anyway, I shouldn't have
done all that stuff I did either.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Yeah. It was a little...immature.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Yeah. And you know something's wrong when the Fashion Club
supports you.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: You too huh?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Yeah. So...truce?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: (shrugs) Sure. Truce.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: So what do you say, pizza this afternoon?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Sure.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Scene 12</TT></P>

<P><TT>INT:</TT></P>

<P><TT>Pizza King/Afternoon/Saturday</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Connor, Tom, Jodie, and Mack are in a booth.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Think they've worked it out yet?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Tom: I don't know. Maybe. I haven't heard any sirens today.</TT></P>

<P><TT>[The others smirk a little. Jodie sees something out of the corner
of her eye and smiles.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jodie: I think that answers your question. </TT></P>

<P><TT>[Jodie jestures to Daria and Jane, who have just walked it. Jane
is laughing her head off. Daria is carrying a Sandi voodoo doll.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: You have got to show me how you do that!</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: When you're ready.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: (notices the others at a booth) Hey guys. (Daria and Jane
walk up to them) Care if we sit?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Tom: Sure.</TT></P>

<P><TT>[They scoot down. The order is now, on one side, Mack, Tom, Jane.
The other side, Jodie, Connor, Daria.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Listen guys, we're really sorry.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Yeah. We came to the conclusion that our actions the past
week have been juvenile and immature.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: And uh...I'm sorry about the whole water and spray paint thing.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: I still haven't got that out. </TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: (smirks) Sorry.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Listen, I'm sorry too.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: For what?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: For being the excuse used to start this whole thing.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: It was a thoughtless excuse. Meant nothing by it.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (smirks) Yeah I know. But maybe I should ask before intruding
on a group of friends. (brief pause) So what do you say? Take me in?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Daria?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Hey, anyone who can make Mr. O'Neil cry is ok by me. </TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Alright then. Welcome to Lawndale. (Connor smiles)</TT></P>

<P><TT>[The Fashion Club enter.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Jane: Hey, Daria, show that thing at it's best.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: No problem.</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Daria takes a pin and sticks in it the foot of the Sandi doll.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Sandi: OW! (trips and falls face first into a large pepperoni, sausage,
and extra cheese pizza. Quinn stifles a laugh but looks at Daria sort of
approvingly)</TT></P>

<P><TT>[Jodie, Mack, Tom, and Jane are cracking up. Daria and Connor look
at each other and smirk.]</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: Is this normal?</TT></P>

<P><TT>Sandi: (OS) This is a velvet blouse!</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: Yes. This is a normal day.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Connor: (smirks at Daria) I think I might like it here.</TT></P>

<P><TT>Daria: (looks at Jane, Tom, Mack, and Jodie still laughing their
butts off) Welcome to the club. (Connor smiles)</TT></P>

<P><TT>THE END</TT></P>

<P><TT>End Notes:</TT></P>

<P><TT>Well, this was my first fanfic, and the first in a series of fanfics
starting the original gang, plus Connor Jablonski. <BR>
<BR>
1) Obviously, you can tell the title of this is a play on Just Add Water.
It's the best I could think of. <BR>
<BR>
2) There's a few references to past Daria episodes, but anyone who's actually
reading fanfic has to be familiar with the show. <BR>
<BR>
3) The whole resurfacing of the 'Tom' feud was basically to show how Connor
felt that he had intruded on something. I didn't cover that very well.
<BR>
<BR>
4) And I&nbsp;put Jodie and Mack in here so often because I&nbsp;personally
admire them. Aside from Daria and Jane, they seem like the only sane people
at Lawndale. I thought that they deserved more of a role.&nbsp;</TT></P>

<P><TT>In later fics I'll elaborate more on the end notes, but since this
is the first one, I really don't see a need for anything other than that.
Once again, any questions, comments, or suggestion can be e-mailed to me
at <A HREF="mailto:swing_kid17@hotmail.com">swing_kid17@hotmail.com</A>
</TT></P>

<P><TT>Thanks for reading even though it wasn't good,</TT></P>

me off."&nbsp;- Myself</TT></P>
