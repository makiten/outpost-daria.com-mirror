<ul><sup><font size=4><font color="#2020A0">   Lying lifeless on my bedroom floor. Staring at my ceiling and counting the cracks. Nothing to do but lay here and stare.....damn!Quinn's complaining is muffled by my thick padded walls within my room.My hair is flying in my face from the light breeze coming from the floor vent of the AC. The phone rings and I hesitate to answer it knowing that it's probably not for me anyway.Mom yells out for me to answer the phone but I didn't realize it until I hear someone banging on my door telling me to open the hell up.I get up from the comfortable spot on my floor that took me so long to find and answered the door.It was Jane and for a brief moment I was glad to see the only friend I've made since I moved to this boring town in the 'burbs.When we work together who knows what might happen.By looking at her blue eyes and the grin on her blood red painted lips I could tell that she was up to something I knew it.Turns out that there was a big party going on at the near grunge club that her  brother just so happen to be playing at tonight and she wanted to know if I could join her.Knowing how much I hated to go to social events I said O.K. Why the hell not I would rather hear loud, eardrum popping music then hear Princess gold card whine over a broken nail anyday.Come to think of it, I would rather hear jackhammers hit the pavement then hear Quinn say anything!anyday! Jane mentioned that the doors start to open at 8pm so we had 5 hours and 30 minutes to kill.We didn't decide on what we wanted to do until we found out that our favorite T.V tabloid wasn't coming on today and my little sisters clique of fashion-obsessed idiots were coming over probably to discuss whether they should wear pink tank-tops or neon green mini skirts for their Saturday mall raid.Who cares. Anyway,in short, since we found out that nothing good was coming on T.V and nothing good was coming over to discuss nothing important, we made a quick departure to the nearby pizzaria.On our little stroll we talked about current events, told jokes, and flicked off a passing Ferrari with my sister's (cousin's to them and everyone else at school.)fashion fanatics inside.By the time we arrived at the pizza parlor our appetites were at a record high and we've allready decided on what we wanted so there would be no need for us to wait in line. Or so we thought, we walked in the door Kevin and Brittany where in the front of the line trying to decide whether pepperoni and sausage were the same thing or if mushrooms were those little disgusting fish that they would try to pass for olives on a pizza.After 20 minutes of complaining we finally made it to the front of the line.We didn't care what we ordered as long as it would be ready under 15 minutes! Once we got our orders we headed to a near by table.There must be a school game going on or something because it was never this crowed in here before and the only table left was right in front of the dumb jock and his bride to be.As long as we didn't make ourselves noticeable they wouldn't bother us. And since we're unpopular that wouldn't be much of a problem. We needed some conversation material but since we already talked about current events on our way here, we decided to pick the first topic that came to our minds at talk about that. Since I was the one who came up with the idea she had to pick the subject, We decided on "Computers Coming to Life on a Full Moon and Eating Children." At first the conversation was a little dull until we picked up the pace. Unfortunately, we were rudely interrupted by the high pitched squealing of an inane cheer leader yelling at her idiotic QB boyfriend for checking out some firery red head in dark blue Capri pants. He tried to convince her that he was just trying to read the menu from a distance when suddenly she got in his way.Not satisfied with his response she hurled her cup of Cherry soda in his face. As she stomped off Kevin didn't realize that someone was behind him and shook his head. Cherry soda flew every where but mainly on Jane who was sitting right behind him. Soda was all over her red jacket and a small amount on mine. Not being able to see beyond the Cherry Coke, I took off my glasses to get rid of the spilt soda . As I polished my glasses I suggested that we should leave before we started a riot. She agreed but first Jane suggested that we headed to her house for a while , she didn't want to walk around town smelling like a soft drink.</font></font></sup></ul>

<p><sup><font size=4><font color="#2020A0">   We walked into the front door of the Lane institution and went upstairs so she could change. Looking at my watch it appeared that we had 3 more hours to waste. So I went in her room to watch T.V . Flicking through the channels all I could find was infomercials, news about another presidential scandal , and a woman talking about her problem "down there". Until I finally found something worth human viewing about people who sent in videos about pissed off animals attacking people or using them as sex toys. The fluorescent lights coming from the screen would have hypnotized me if I didn't hear footsteps coming down the hall. Out of boredom I began to say something stupid and pointless until I realized that it wasn't my best friend I was talking to but HER BROTHER!  My face lit up when I realized that I just made an ass of myself. He stood there and stared at me and I stared at him. This cotinued for a while until he grinned and walked off. He was gone but I was still in awe. Jane walked in ,drying her hair, and noticed that I was staring at the door. She threw a pillow at me, removing me out of a deep trance. After I launched the pillow back at her we settled down and watched TV.</font></font></sup>
<p><sup><font size=4><font color="#2020A0">Two hours have passed since we turned on the television. Jane has fallen asleep leaving me alone for 12 minutes until she rolled over and fell off the bed. I stared at her for a minute and tried not to laugh. Determined to get even, she asked me to go and wake up Trent. She won that time, but after what happened earlier, I couldn't wake him up. But I couldn't tell Jane about it either so I got up and unwillingly walked out of her room.</font></font></sup>
<p><sup><font size=4><font color="#2020A0">        I t has been 2 minutes since I left Jane's room and I was standing in front of Trent's room trying to psych myself up into knocking on his door. Finally after 3 minutes of self encouragement I open the door and prayed to God that nothing was going to jump out at me. And there he was just lying there on his bed fast asleep. All I could do was stand there. I couldn't move, I couldn't speak and if I tried to say anything the words wouldn't come out fast enough. I watched his pale green shirt rise and fall as he lightly snored. The sun was just going down and its last rays of light reflected off of his short jet black hair and his goatee so perfectly. At that moment I felt like I was in heaven, everything seemed so perfect until........HEY TRENT! WAKE UP! As he slowly came out of his twenty-year nap, I quickly with no second thought, got the hell out of there. I ran down the hall back to Jane's room and I was welcomed with a mischievous grin. " You took to long. I thought that you probably got lost or something so I woke him up myself. Hope you didn't mind." She said trying to keep an innocent face. I saw right through the angel act and ignored her. Trent came into the room and told us that he was ready to go as soon as Jesse came along with "The Tank". The sound of that name made Jane's heart skip a beat. She tried to keep a straight face but Trent and I noticed her cheeks begin to turn red. We laughed at her and went down stairs to wait for our ride. As soon as we got down stairs the doorbell rang. Trent answered the door and Jane stood there like a deer caught in headlights. This tall, long haired, brunette was standing at the door wearing a leather vest with matching pants and no shirt. " Hey man we got the equipment in The tank, you ready to go?" He said. Trent agreed and signaled to us that we were about to leave. I got ready to walk out of the door when I realized that Jane was still standing by the stairs staring into Jesse's green eyes. Trent, Jesse and I stood and stared at her until one of us went to pull her to the door so we could leave.Trent and Jesse sat in the front while Jane and I took the back with all of the equipment. I would have taken shotgun but that would mean Jane trying to put the move on Jesse but I wasn't going to give her that kind of satisfaction. And there was no way in hell I was going to allow Jane to sit in the front with Trent. We arrived at the club they where supposed to play at. With a name like "The Zen" it had to be a grunge club.Trent and Jesse went in to meet the rest of their band members to set up. We would have followed if it weren't for the extremely stale smell that came from the inside when Trent swung the doors open. So we stayed outside for a while. " Saw you staring at Jesse back at the house." I said trying to be mean. But leave it to Jane to always have a good come back." Shut up you should talk I had to toss a pillow at you in order to get your attention from staring at the door." Jane said as she turned at me and grined.Damn! That was two in a row. I had a good remark that I was going to fling back at her but why bother. I looked up at the night sky and admired the stars for a while when I suddenly heard "Do you ever think you &amp;Trent will ever get together? " Jane questioned. I looked at her and grinned "We might but right now it's not so clear." She nodded in response and faintly smiled back "We should go inside now I hear the crowd starting to shout" she said as she turned for the door. I took my last intake of fresh air and followed up right behind her.</font></font></sup>
<p><sup><font size=4><font color="#2020A0">     The crowd was going wild as a previous band got off of the stage." Thank you very much" the announcer said "And now give a round of a sound for MYSTIK SPIRAL!" The crowd was in a frenzy as the band came up to the stage. Jane and I sat at a table in the back just in case some drunk rocker wanted to start a moshpit we would be clear out of the way. Trent opened the song and the band followed up. The crowd went wild, Jane was staring deeply into Jesse's eyes but tried not to look too obvious so she would turn her head every time she felt herself fall into some hypnotic trance. The band played on for hours until they were out of songs. Later on they joined us to watched the other bands perform and, just like I suspected, some drunk yelled out "MOSHPIT" and everyone was on the floor. Thinking that this might turn into some kind of huge fight, we all decided to leave.</font></font></sup>
<p><sup><font size=4><font color="#2020A0"> So that was basically it Trent dropped me off at home and Jane caught me blushing. For some odd ass reason I think that I might hear this at school tomorrow. It's starting to get late I should get to sleep now before I wake up tomorrow and fall asleep in the shower again or worse I might even try to hold a conversation with my folks and nobody wants that. There are plenty more tales in my life and this is just one but if anyone finds out I might have to change my personality to an unpopular teenage misfit..............OOPS! Too late.</font></font><font color="#2020A0"></font></sup>
