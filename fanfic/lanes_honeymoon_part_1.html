<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.5pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.5pt'>Amanda Lane returns from her
second honeymoon from Cuba, seeking legal help. Helen Morgendorffer is more is
more than eager to comply, but first even she needs to know &quot;why?&quot; And so
begins a tale of woe and misery. (1<sup>st</sup> part out of 2, presumably)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>It was suppertime at the
Morgendorffers' household, when there was a knock on the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;Now who could <i>that</i>
be?&quot; Quinn wondered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;Why won't you open it and
find out?&quot; Daria suggested.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;I would, but you see, I've
told Zachary that I won't be home tonight, and I am, so if it is he testing if
I am-&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;Jake. Open the door,&quot; Helen
said wearily. Sometimes she wished that she could weld Daria and Quinn into one
person. Apart they were good girls, but when they sat side by side ready for
comparison - that was more than Helen could bear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Meanwhile, Jake has opened
the door. Jane Lane stood outside. &quot;Hey, Jane-o!&quot; Jake said cheerfully. &quot;Nice
to see you, but we're eating, so can you come back later? No offence.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;None taken,&quot; Jane assured
him. &quot;But it's my mom, you see? She wants to see Daria's mom 'cause she's a
lawyer.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;Oh. Wait a sec then.&quot; Jake
turned around and yelled: &quot;Helen! Amanda's here, and wants to see you as a
lawyer!!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;Let her in!&quot; Helen yelled
back, always eager for a new client.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Smiling, Jake turned to Jane.
&quot;Yo, Jane-o! Let your mother in.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Moments after, Jane and Jake
let-in Amanda Lane. The older Lane woman kept muttering about <i>Bahia de
Guantanamo</i> and <i>Le Habana</i> over and over again. &quot;What's going-on?&quot; Daria
and Helen asked Jane, while Jake poured Amanda some tea: the poor woman clearly
needed it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;Well, the background story
is like this. Wind and his latest bride, Sheila went on a honeymoon in Cuba.
Mom and dad decided to have their second honeymoon there as well and went with
Wind and his bride.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;Yeah, we flew from Boston to
Ottawa to Paris to Havana to Guantanamo,&quot; Amanda said. &quot;Well, Wind and Sheila
did. Me and Vince did leave-out Paris, because of... nevermind. Anyways, as soon
as we have landed there, all went waky.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;You see,&quot; Amanda swallowed
some more tea and continued, &quot;while Vincent is a wonderful father and husband
(Jane made some noise that was quickly stifled by Daria), every once in a while
he gets hyperactive and just wants to do something - sort of like a
short-circuiting of the brain, you see?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;Yeah, Helen's like that with
family bonding,&quot; Jake said. Helen gave him a death glare, but Amanda ignored
them and continued.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;Now when we came to the
place of our honeymoons (a resort near the city of Guantanamo), Vincent
instantly decides that we all are to have fun. And that includes Nikki and
Angela - Sheila's kids from her first marriage.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;So that makes it what? Six
people?&quot; Daria asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;Let's see. Me and Vince.
Wind and Sheila and her kids. Yes. Six. Six Lanes that went to Cuba,&quot; Amanda
wept.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;Amanda! Get a grip on
yourself! How can I help you if you constantly break-down!&quot; Helen berated the
other woman. Amanda semi-composed herself and continued. &quot;So first Vince sees
sky diving - for a hundred and fifty dollars you can go sky-diving, and for
forty-five more bucks you'll be recorded on a video camera as well. Vince
immediately got enamoured with that idea, but I stood firm, so we had row -
just the first one. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>So then I persuade Vince to
keep off the planes for a while, and we'll go riding motorcycles as well.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;You know how to ride a
motorcycle?&quot; Jane asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;I remember when Wind brought
home a motorcycle. It had a stationary engine that couldn't work or something.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;No, Jane, your brothers
cannot ride a motorcycle. Nor I. Nor your father. Despite him stating that
that's as easy as riding an ordinary bike. And those cycles down there have
speed selectors on their handlebars or whatever they're called, and you must
move the selector forwards to go really fast, or backwards to stop. But when
it's your first time you somehow don't remember those things when the cycle
gets moving.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Now your father went first,
and lets admit it, he's no longer as young as he had been. He didn't enter the
first turning point on the route correctly, and got thrown out of the seat. And
there was a single lamppost in the whole route, but it wasn't round like ours,
but angular. And naturally, your father hit it front-on.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;Did he bruise anything?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;I'll get to that later. Firstly,
your brother Wind went next and did the same thing. Only he got scratches all
over his arms and legs, and your father says he's okay, so we worry about your
brother instead. By 'we' I mean me and Sheila. Nikki and Angela are too young
for that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Anyways we leave the track
and go to our hotel room. Your father and brother got a full list of activities
planned for us for our stay.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;For how long did you stay?&quot;
Helen asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;I'm not sure. We planned to
stay for ten days, but we didn't. Anyways, we go back to our hotel room, and
your father feels funny, and he checks his pressure and it's 170 - too high for
the likes of him. And so we call the doctor, and after twenty minutes a doctor
comes - an Afro-American that, well, looks like one of those silver-screen
characters, a racial stereotype if there ever was one. And <i>he</i> takes out
his blood pressure monitor, and it doesn't work and he hits it a couple of
times, and it finally shows that Vince's blood pressure is 120!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>'That's strange,' Vince says,
'but maybe my blood pressure did drop or something. Still, can I have a check
in the hospital?' The doctor agrees, so Vincent is taken for a hospital
check-up, and we're off for more fun-filled activities!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;Did you sky-dive?&quot; Quinn
asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;No, not I. I kept Angela and
Nikki company on the ground. Wind took Sheila though, only she didn't want to
dive, and he almost pushed her out of the plane, and they had a terrible
argument, and they might be divorcing each other or something - but I digress.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Anyways, we return, and there's
a phone call from the hospital. Apparently, Vincent got a fractured sternum and
it cannot be put in plaster, and we've got to call medical insurance - here's
its' card, Helen - and to contact it we've got to go through Havana, then
Paris, Ottawa, Boston - the whole thing. Make it another 200 dollars. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Anyways, we contact it, and
they supposedly agree to cover Vince's injury. Good. So off we go again - the
five of us - to swim on speed-boats in Guantanamo Bay. I've never been more
frightened in my life! Again, there's this speed selector bit - to change
speeds you've got to use both hands, which means taking them off the steering
wheel-&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;Sounds dangerous,&quot; Jake
remarked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;It is,&quot; Amanda agreed. &quot;And
that whoreson boat goes not parallel to the water surface, but at an angle, and
there splashes and spray everywhere, and I cannot see very well, and there are
only two seats on each boat, so I'm stuck with Nikki, who's in danger of
falling-out - only it's just the beginning. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>We leave the bay and go down
this river - it's as narrow as our living room, and it's marked with sticks
that show where to go, and if you fall-out of the boat, there are caimans in
the river, so you get the picture.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;Caimans?&quot; re-asked Helen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;Crocodiles mom,&quot; Daria
elaborated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;Oh.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;So finally we cast ashore,&quot;
Amanda continued, &quot;and go up some forest path to this native farm. The road's
disgusting - clay mixed with mud! And me, Nikki and Wind are walking forwards,
and Sheila wears not running shoes but platform ones, and she is carrying
Angela, who is twisting and crawling, and wants to go down, but Sheila can't
allow that 'cause the road's like quicksand, if you don't move immediately
you'll get sucked down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>And then we come to the farm.
It's not very impressive. I've seen some adobe villages in New Mexico, and they
were much better looking. So after a while, when Wind made a video for Vincent
on turkeys' mating, we go back down the same sweltering forest path, and one of
Sheila's platform shoes gets sucked down in the mud, and so she has to make the
better part of the return journey with one foot naked and her baby daughter in
her arms. Me, I'm sticking with Nikki.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Then, we arrive back at
boats. Now you see, once you're out in the bay, there's a possibility that
you'll get lost, 'cause you can't see the shores once you're out in the bay, so
I ask one of the guides if I can go immediately after him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;There were guides?&quot; Helen
asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;Yes, yes, two of them,
hotel-sponsored. One was in the front, leading us, while the other one covered
our retreat. And since I was afraid of getting lost, I went after the leading
guide, taking Angela with me. And so, we entered the bay, and looked around -
no one! Only me and the guide. And suddenly the guide began going around in
circles, bigger and bigger ones, and I frantically followed him, fearing of
losing him and getting completely lost, because of all the splashes and spray
and no sight of the shore. Only four hours later the rest of the group
catches-up with us. Apparently, Wind's, Sheila's and Nikki's motor boat which
was going right behind us, got tangled in the seaweeds, and had to be
untangled, and Wind and Sheila were arguing all the time...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>And so we come back to the
hotel, where Vince is waiting for us. Apparently, the insurance company is
refusing to pay for us, and we've got to cover the medical bill itself - $800
dollars! We refuse, and decide to leave. Only the plane on which we decided to
leave was 8 hours late. And when we finally arrived at Havana, we discovered an
interesting thing. The plane on which I was going (Vince was supposed to come
with me but he couldn't now because of his sternum) was going straight from
Havana to Boston. No problem there. But the plane that was supposed to take
Wind and his new family to Boston - it also stayed eight hours late. Only... the
registration went-on correctly, and those who were eight hours late - not just
Wind, Sheila, and her kids - got their tickets cancelled and even erased from
the computer!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Then the Cuban doctors
catch-up to us, reinforced with some local KGB agents or something, and demand
now 1800 American dollars for us, or 'Yankee no go home!' And so I flew
straight here, and don't know for whom to go - the Cuban consul, the manager of
&quot;Air France&quot; company, then there are Wind and Sheila's pets - a dog and two
cats, I think - who must be taken off their temporary owners hands before
they're euthansized or something... God, Helen, what am I to do? My hurt husband
and a lot of other relatives are stuck down in Cuba in some un-pedigree roach
motel!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Helen let down a low whistle.
&quot;That's a nasty predicament all right. Don't worry, I'll take you to the firm,
and there we'll be able to get your family out - somehow.&quot; Helen got up and
looked at her husband. &quot;Jake, I advise you not to wait for me for supper. I've
got a feeling that I won't be coming home soon.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;But what about your
portion?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;Give it to Jean, would you?&quot;
Helen suggested. &quot;Come on Amanda, we've got a long journey ahead.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The door closed behind the
two women. The rest of Morgendorffers and Jane exchanged looks. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&quot;Well,&quot; Jane finally spoke,
&quot;well. If she's gone, <i>can</i> I have her supper?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Endnotes. I'm not a big fan
of endnotes, but this time I feel that they're a necessity. You see, this story
isn't a figment of my imagination, but a real story that happened to the family
of a friend of my family (and I even know his name, but I won't tell it). Everything
that the story talked about happened to them, only the cracked sternum didn't happen
to the son but to the friend's father, and the kids were most definitely his. Now
as for the story's resolution, I can't be sure. I guess I'll leave the second
part in hiatus for a while, till I know how the real life (which really <i>is</i>
stranger than fiction) problem resolves. Bacner.</span></p>
