<BR>stupid people can be and how much friends can really mean to a person. 
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR> Jane's been wonderful, I never thought that one person's existence could 
<BR>make life so much of a difference from one before hand. Highland has given me 
<BR>just lost memories, Lawndale has given me memories and a future to look 
<BR>towards on. 
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>Tom, my first... boyfriend, that is. He's teached me that boys aren't so 
<BR>insensitive. It was a chance that I had taken yet luck was good to me. 
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR> I hope, most seriously, that my last days in Lawndale will be memorable.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0">

<BR>The sun was up and I was down. My friends would be leaving Lawndale. Daria 
<BR>said she's looking forward to leaving this dump, I didn't believe her though. 
<BR>I'm staying unfortunately. I hadn't been accepted into the collage that I had 
<BR>wanted and now I'm waiting for my chance. 
<BR>
<BR>Tom and Daria will be going to different collages. He said it would be good 
<BR>for them to search more grounds, meaning he would E-mail her whenever he got 
<BR>the chance, and of course Daria, hating this, would reply right back. 
<BR>
<BR>I know that staying here for the time being will be better. I hope so.

<BR>So much has happened in the past year or so. I met a girl at a club, pretty 
<BR>original huh? Well, it changed my life.
<BR>
<BR>My parents are insisting that I should go to a top class collage, my 
<BR>girlfriend thought it would be good to set my folks a couple hundred dollars 
<BR>back but I just wanted to be a teacher, not a collage professor. 
<BR>
<BR>Daria is nervous about leaving, she isn't showing it but she was the one who 
<BR>wanted to go to different collages so that we would put our full attention to 
<BR>our studies. Fat chance, I know the first week, we'll be E-mailing each other 
<BR>every other hour. 
<BR>
<BR>Jane isn't going to collage unfortunately, well... until she gets that 
<BR>acceptance into an art collage, she will be staying in Lawndale for the time 
<BR>being. 
<BR>
<BR>I've lived here my entire life, but I believe that this past year has changed 
<BR>everything in it. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><B>
