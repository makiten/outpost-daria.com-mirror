LAWNDALE MARMALADE

While I ain't sure what Lady Marmalade is copyrighted,
I know Daria is the registered trademark of MTV and
Viacom, whatever you like it not, eh?

(Our story takes place in The Pizza Prince--er, King--where
we see Daria and Jane eating their fill of pizza, while Neil
Young's Sample & Hold plays in the background.)

Daria: What a day. I never thought I'd see the day when
Brittany would get arrested on assult and battery charges
for hurting Kevin.

Jane: You got to admit, she WAS breaking Lawndale's anti
assult laws. How much you wanna bet her folks, along with
her fellow cheerleaders will bail her out?

Daria: Bet heavily on it. Even so, her case comes up Saturday.

Jane: You had to admit, she had it coming.

(Nearby, at another table, we see The Fashion Club--Sandi, Stacy
and Tiffany--laugh their heads off over something Quinn said.)

Sandi: Quinn, that is THE most craziest story I heard in years.

Tiffany: You sure the outfits we wore in the dream were satiny?

Quinn: Does a bear growl in the woods?

Stacy: What do you think, Sandi?

Sandi: When it comes to satin lingerie as a Fashion Do, that rates
an A+.

Quinn: Gee, thanks.

Sandi: (sigh) Like, we've all had some of the craziest dreams, but yours,
Quinn, tops them all.

Stacy: I wish I could dream like that.

Tiffany: Amen.

(Back at their table, Daria and Jane can't help but overhear what
Quinn is saying.)

Jane: Did you hear that?

Daria: Who wouldn't? Quinn dreaming of satin lingerie? She must've dreamt
she was modeling for Victoria's Secret.

Quinn (turning to Daria): Which is just what me, and The Fashion Club were
wearing in my dream.

Sandi: Like, what's the idea of you two brains listening in on our
conversation?

Daria: Would you believe I was related to J. Edgar Hoover?

Jane: Besides, my sister Penny used to date spies in South America.

Tiffany: Penny.......Lane? Your folks must've been Beatles freaks--brr.

Jane: As a matter of fact, they were.

Stacy: Go ahead, Quinn--tell those two your dream you had.

Sandi: Quinn, you out of your mind? Those brains don't want to hear such a
STUU----------PID story.

Jane: Why not? At least, it'll pass the mundane time we got here in Lawndale.

Daria: Even we brains could use a diversion--it beats standing 'round here
like no life fools.

Quinn (after a pause): OK......you asked for it. Last night, I dreamt that me,
Sandi, Stacy and Tiffany were on the stage in that place that Jane's brother's
band always plays....

Jane: The Zen.

Quinn: Right, The Zen. Anyhow, Trent's girlfriend....

Daria: Monique.

Quinn: Monique comes on stage, and......

(While Quinn is talking, the scene shimmers to the story, inside The Zen,
where Monique is talking to the crowd.)

Monique: Welcome back, my friends, to the show that never ends. Ladies and
gentlemen--The Fashion Club!!

(The curtain opens revealing The Fashion Club with their instruments, and
wearing Victoria's Secret satin lingerie--Sandi, on her bass guitar, in a
white bustier, with garter straps and white thigh high stockings, Tiffany, on
her 6 string guitar, wearing a blue green satin bra, panty, garter belt and
thigh highs, Quinn, with her organs and synthesizers, wearing a red satin
bustier with garter straps and thigh highs, and Stacy on her drums, wearing a
similar satin bra/panty/garter belt/thigh high ensamble like Tiffany's, only
in a peach color. After a pause, Sandi talks to the crowd.)

Sandi: Like, we're The Fashion Club, and no, we ain't thinking of changing
our name!! Soul sisters, unite!!

(With that in mind, The Fashion Club plays Lady Marmalade--as if you didn't
know.)

Sandi, Quinn, Tiffany & Stacy:
Where’s all my soul sisters
Let me hear ya flow sisters
Hey sister, go sister
Soul sister, flow sister
Hey sister, go sister

Sandi:
He met Marmelade down at old Moulin Rouge
Strutting her stuff on the street
She said, “Hello, hey Joe.
You wanna give it a go?”

When I can spend yours

And I'm sorry

Getting love from the dudes
Four bad butt chicks
From the Moulin Rouge

Sandi, Quinn, Tiffany & Stacy:

Tiffany:

Money and the garter belts

When I can spend yours
Disagree, well that's you
And I'm sorry
I'ma keep playing
These cats out like Atari
Wear high heeled shoes,
Getting love from the dudes
Four bad butt chicks
From the Moulin Rouge

Sandi, Quinn, Tiffany & Stacy:

Diamonds in the glass

Meaning of expensive taste

Roar until he cried

Sandi, Quinn, Tiffany & Stacy:

(The Fashion Club finishes up, before taking their bows
before the cheering crowd. After that, the scene shimmers
back to The Pizza King, and the end of Quinn's tale.)

Quinn: .......and that was how my dream ended.

Jane (laughing): Boy oh boy, Sandi was right--that is THE most craziest
story, if not the craziest dream.

Sandi: I could've told you that.

Daria: You must've seen that Moulin Rouge film--THAT would trigger a
dream like that.

Quinn: DA-ARIAA!! That film is SO unfashionable--along with that one Aussie
diva that starred in it!!

Sandi: It sucked.

Tiffany: Only geeks and sex freaks would see that.

Stacy: Un grand stinkeroo.

Daria: I wouldn't doubt that. (to Jane) Let's go bail Eep-Eep The Road Runner
out from the hoosgow.

Jane: Maybe Trent can spare some bucks on the side.

(Outside The Pizza King,we see The Partners In Crime head down the sidewalk.)

Jane: Y' know.........it's times like these I wish Tom had the same dream
Quinn had--only with me, Jodie, Brittany and you on the stage.

Daria: No thanks. Jodie and Brittany, they'd be cut out for that sort of
thing, but we'd be stupid to wear that satin lingerie.

Jane: Don't knock it if you haven't tried it.

Daria: On the other hand, we'd give The Fashion Club a run for their money.

Jane: Not to mention give Upchuck a lot of ulcers.

Daria: Do we dare call such a dream, Lawndale Maramalade?

Jane: Hey--why not?

(The scene changes to the credits and the alter egos of the Daria crew--Jane
as Mohatma Ghandi, Daria as Sheryl Crow, Quinn as a bag lady, Tiffany as a hot
dog vendor, Stacy as Jillian Barberie and Sandi as a Dutch girl in a fancy
dress --while--what else?--Labelle's version of Lady Marmalade plays.)

OWARI (THE END)
