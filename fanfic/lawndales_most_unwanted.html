<P><B>It is the morning of the first day of the fall semester and the beginning
of the senior year for both Daria and Jane. Daria is kind of depressed
because over the summer Trent has been dating this other girl that he met
at one of his concerts, which confirms more and more that to Trent she
is nothing more than his friend and his sister, Jane’s best friend, to
make matters worse even Jane has a new boyfriend, this only makes Daria
feel a greater sense of loneliness since she had never really dated before,
and is sick of seeing Quinn always remind her of what she doesn’t have,
a boyfriend. This year there may be some very significant changes for Daria
when a new mystery man comes into her life.</B></P>

<P>Jane: Cheer up Daria, you have been moping around ever since Trent has
started seeing Claire. I’m sure you will probably meet a really great guy
soon and you’ll forget about Trent, soon after you will both realize that
you are with the wrong people and your relationship with Trent will go
back to what it has always been, with you speechless as usual and he will
continue to be oblivious.</P>

<P>Daria: What makes you think this year will be any different from last
year here at Lawndale high. I still see the same people and they still
ignore me as always. Look there’s Quinn surrounded by the Fashion Club
and her three J fan club. At least you’re lucky enough to have Tom.</P>

<P><B>At that moment there comes a very handsome English guy (by handsome
I mean he makes Brad Pitt look ordinary by comparison)he has dark blond
hair, blue eyes, straight white teeth, he is six one, muscular build, and
classic facial features, he is driving a Jaguar Convertible in classic
Jade, his clothing looks like it came out of <U>GQ Magazine</U>, he is
seventeen, is part of the senior class and he is an honor student. As his
car enters the student parking lot Quinn and the rest of the Fashion Club
head his direction to make sure that they are noticed before he gets a
chance to meet any other girl. Even Daria can’t deny that he is gorgeous,
but then she thinks “Why do I even bother I’m not only out of his league
but even in my fantasies I see him totally ignoring me and then asking
Quinn out.”</B></P>

<P>Jane: Daria do you see something you like?</P>

<P>Daria: I was just looking at that sports car, I might save up to get
one like it.</P>

<P>Jane: I guess the money you made at the nut stand should give you enough
for a down payment. Why the sudden interest in sports cars?</P>

<P>Daria: Just kick the concrete out from underneath me, okay?</P>

<P>Jane: Come on Daria, admit it, you find that new guy cute.</P>

<P>Daria: Yeah Jane, just one more thing I can’t have.</P>

<P>Jane: Daria, he’s new there’s always a chance he may like you.</P>

<P>Daria: What planet are you from? We’re out of his league.</P>

<P>Jane: Speak for yourself.</P>

<P><B>It is the last period of the day, which is Daria and Jane’s math
class , pre trigonometry and for some strange reason Kevin is also in that
class ( It pays to be the QB, you don’t even have to know how to count
to a hundred and you can still take pre trigonometry and get a C. Due to
Brittany’s complaints he decided not to wear is football jersey all the
time so he is dressed in a pair of jeans, a polo tee shirt and a pair of
Nikes.). The regular teacher could not come for the first day and they
could not get a substitute on such short notice so they decide to use the
best student from the honor math class which is trigonometry and statistics.
The name of this student is Chad Carrington, who also happens to be the
very handsome English guy with the Jaguar Convertible.</B></P>

<P>Ms. Li: Miss Bennet was unable to make it today, because her husband
had to be hospitalized suddenly.</P>

<P>Daria: (Thinking) I guess he saw one chart too many and finally lost
his mind.</P>

<P>Ms. Li: Your substitute teacher will be Chad Carrington who happens
to be an honor student from one of the most prestigious schools in England.
So pay attention and work hard and you all will be of to a good start this
year.</P>

<P>Jane: (Thinking) I wonder if he has a personality to match his looks.</P>

<P>Daria: (Thinking) Great, a brain with looks, now I can celebrate the
total demise of my self esteem . Who ever said life was fair?</P>

<P>Chad: Hello class, we will begin today’s lesson with some basic algebra.
I will put the first equation on the board and I will have you answer it
Kevin. ( writes positive 20 minus a negative 40)</P>

<P>Kevin: (He is scratching his head and looking blankly at he black board,
then decides to speak) Okay so it is twenty minus forty, you know what
you got your numbers mixed up because it should be forty minus twenty.</P>

<P>Chad: This is basic algebra Kevin not basic math.</P>

<P>Kevin: I don’t get it.</P>

<P>Chad: I believe you might be in sports, am I right.</P>

<P>Kevin: Yeah I’m the QB. That means quarter back.</P>

<P>Chad: You are a football player then. Okay lets pretend the black board
is the playing field and the left side of the field is where the opposing
team will be and that will range from a negative ten to a negative one
hundred and the right side of the field is where the home team is playing
it will range from ten to one hundred.</P>

<P>Kevin: You don’t have to explain this to me I already know how to play
football, what I don’t know is math.</P>

<P>Chad: (Thinking) He doesn’t know how to think either. (To Kevin) I ‘m
using the football field as an example to show you how to do this math
problem. Anyway lets say you are on the negative side of the field and
you are standing on negative forty.</P>

<P>Kevin: I can’t walk on walls.</P>

<P>Chad: Imagine the black board is a field and you are standing on negative
forty and you have to get the ball to the to the player who is on negative
twenty. How many yards will you run?</P>

<P>Kevin: That’s easy I will have to run twenty yards, to where my team
mate is which would be negative twenty.</P>

<P>Chad: Now try the problem.</P>

<P>Kevin: Then 20 minus forty would be negative twenty.</P>

<P>Chad: Very good Kevin, you answered it correctly.</P>

<P>Kevin: Thanks maybe now I won’t only be good at football, not that I
want to be a brain or anything.</P>

<P>Chad: Kevin believe me, you have nothing to worry about, your brain
is the least obvious of all your body parts.</P>

<P>Daria: (Thinking) That’s assuming he has one.</P>

<P>Chad (Walks over to Daria) Daria how about coming to the board and answering
question two.</P>

<P>Daria: (Walks up to the board and answers the question perfectly) I
guess that’s it.</P>

<P>Chad: Excellent.</P>

<P>Daria: (She smiles then remembers he’s out of her league.) Jane I’m
kind of surprised he’s humble despite all his virtues. Maybe he’s not shallow
as well.</P>

<P>Jane: What happened to I’m out of his league? I wouldn’t get my hopes
up if I were you.</P>

<P>Daria: I can dream, then again everyone in my fantasies are idiots as
well. Your right.</P>

<P>Chad: (Thinking about Daria) Finally someone I can have an intelligent
conversation with. Dream on Chad, she’s too cool for you. </P>

<P><B>Chad couldn’t help but remember about his life, a year earlier when
he came from the school he loved back in England to live in Lawndale where
he attended one of Lawndale’s best private schools, which is Cherry Grove,
At Cherry Grove Chad started out as one of the popular kids because of
his style of dress and his car, things that he found of no value and he
felt that people who liked you only because you had these things were shallow
and he wasn’t interested in being their friend. Despite his popularity
he became friends with the school’s biggest outcast, a boy named Peter
who was also an honor student, being Peter’s friend also made Chad an outcast,
but Chad didn’t care when it came to his friends he preferred quality over
quantity, and although Peter still hangs out with Chad occasionally he
now lives in another state which for Chad means to be alone again or as
he calls it to be “Lawndale’s Most Unwanted”. Despite his good looks Chad
had never dated before, he had many friends in his school back in England
but no girlfriend. It’s just that Chad has low self esteem, mainly because
of his ego maniacal fashion magazine editor mother who always made Chad
feel worthless. She always told him, he wasn’t good enough because he wasn’t
constantly updating his wardrobe to her standards, she also did not like
the idea of having a brain for a son with a 220 IQ. Being smart was very
highly regarded in his school back in England, but in a public high school
in Lawndale being smart is considered the worse social decease anyone could
have, but this did not matter to Chad although it made him an outcast.
Now the time has come when Chad would soon meet his match, Daria.</B></P>

<P><B>At the pizza place where they usually hang out Jane and Daria are
seated at their usual table with a slice of pizza and a drink in front
of each of them.</B></P>

<P>Jane: Earth to Daria, you are in a daze. Don’t tell me you are still
thinking about that guy. You know better than to waste your time on impossible
dreams. </P>

<P>Daria: Jane I can’t help it, I guess I’m kind of attracted to him. You
know what really makes my blood boil Jane. The fact that probably by the
end of this week Chad will be over at my house to pick up Quinn to go on
a date. I guess my life is just one humiliation after another.</P>

<P>Jane: Daria what makes you so sure he would want to date Quinn. He’s
very intelligent. I think he may just be able to overcome Quinn.</P>

<P>Daria: Quinn has a way of making even the wisest of the wise into total
idiots and I figure Chad is no exception to the rule.</P>

<P><B>While Daria and Jane are eating pizza “It Only Rock And Roll” by
the Rolling Stones is playing on the radio.</B></P>

<P>Radio: I know its only Rock and Roll but I like it.</P>

<P>Daria: I know this song is really old and I don’t like it.</P>

<P>Jane: I guess you don’t like Classic Rock very much.</P>

<P>Daria: To me some Classic Rock songs are just an excuse that some nostalgia
buffs have to keep playing old, out of date songs on the radio. On the
other hand, I have to admit people still wrote original songs in those
days, not like today when lazy musicians take perfectly good songs, talk
over the lyrics and claim it was theirs. I still listen to the Beatles
their music is timeless.</P>

<P><B>At that moment Chad walks into the pizza parlor by himself carrying
his back pack and a copy of Kurt Vonnegut’s book <I>Welcome To The Monkey
House</I> which is a collection of short stories by Kurt Vonnegut. He sits
in the booth behind Daria and Jane and orders a whole cheese pizza.</B></P>

<P>Daria: Haven’t I been tortured enough. Why does he keep appearing everywhere
I go? I’m sick of being reminded of what I can’t have.</P>

<P>Jane: Chad may be dreamy, but isn’t it strange that he is usually alone
most of the time.</P>

<P>Daria: He’s new in town he probably has not had time to make friends
with anyone.</P>

<P>Jane: Then if that is so, how do you explain Quinn, who when arriving
to Lawndale High suddenly became the popular girl.</P>

<P>Daria: Chad’s an honor student which means he’s probably more selective
about the friends he chooses than Quinn is.</P>

<P>Jane: Speaking of Quinn, despite the fact that her and her fashion friends
have been trying to get a little closer to Chad, he hasn’t asked her out
yet.</P>

<P>Daria: Maybe he has a girlfriend in England, maybe that’s why he’s alone
most of the time. Jane do you think you could get a closer look at what
he’s reading, I want to know what kind of books he likes so I can go to
the library and check them out.</P>

<P>Jane: I can’t see from where I’m sitting.</P>

<P>Daria: Let me try with this compact mirror Quinn gave me when she tried
to get me to accept one of her famous makeovers.</P>

<P><B>Meanwhile Chad is thinking.</B></P>

<P>Chad: (Thinking) I can’t believe I had the nerve to follow her all the
way to her after school hang out. Now that I’m here I’m too scared to walk
up to her and let her know that I would like get to know her better, and
maybe go out sometime. I’m afraid I will get nervous and sound like a idiot.</P>

<P><B>At that moment Kevin and Brittany walk in to the pizza parlor and
go to Chad’s table.</B></P>

<P>Brittany: Hi Chad, I was wondering if you would like to go to my party
Saturday. I hope you bring your Jag.</P>

<P>Chad: Are you inviting me or my Jag?</P>

<P><B>Meanwhile Daria and Jane are listening and are curious about the
outcome of Kevin and Brittany’s chat with Chad.</B></P>

<P>Jane: It looks like this is going to be interesting.</P>

<P>Daria: Tell me about, lets see how he deals with Tweedle Dum and Tweedle
Dee.</P>

<P><B>Close up of Brittany, Kevin and Chad’s conversation</B></P>

<P>Brittany: Chad I’m inviting you of course.</P>

<P>Chad: I’m glad to hear that because when I go to parties I usually like
to arrive in my jalopy.</P>

<P>Brittany: You will dress nice though.</P>

<P>Chad: Actually I wanted to try out these new commando pants I bought
at the Army-Navy Store.</P>

<P>Brittany: Eek! you know what, I don’t think I will be having a party
this Saturday, its just that I need to get something, if I could only remember
what it is.</P>

<P>Chad: You can begin by getting some tact.</P>

<P>Daria: (Thinking) He’s even good at sarcasm. I think I’m in love.</P>

<P>Brittany: Why are you being so mean, I was only inviting you to my party
to thank you for what you did for my Kevy this morning. It was so nice
of you to help him with his math. Then maybe you’re not so nice after all.</P>

<P>Chad: You were inviting me to your party as some sort of pay back not
because you want to be my friend.</P>

<P>Brittany: I don’t see the problem, I do it all the time, I even invited
Daria to one of my parties because she helped me in art class.</P>

<P>Chad: Brittany for your information you should invite people to your
parties because you like and care about them not because you’re throwing
them a crumb for some favor that they did for you at school. People have
feelings, they are not servants who you pay back by granting them the favor
of your company.</P>

<P>Kevin: Hey! that’s my girlfriend you’re talking to, how about showing
more respect. I’m the QB.</P>

<P>Chad: Yes you really are <I>quite barbaric</I>.</P>

<P>Kevin: So now you are trying to talk nicely to me. Come on Brittany
lets go.</P>

<P>Brittany: I should know better than to trust a brain. Lets go Kevy,
we can have our own party.</P>

<P><B>Chad then sits in his booth looking very depressed, now that he realizes
that the students at Lawndale are not that different from the ones at Cherry
Grove. While Chad is deep in his thoughts Daria and Jane comment on what
just happened.</B></P>

<P>Jane: Kevin and Brittany had it coming to them and we were here to witness
it. I’m going home happy tonight.</P>

<P>Daria: On the other hand I am even more frustrated.</P>

<P>Jane: Why?</P>

<P>Daria: Every time he opens his mouth he always says the right thing,
which makes him only more and more attractive to me. I wish he wasn’t so
perfect, that way I could stop feeling so attracted to him. Why couldn’t
he just act like a jerk? That way I could just forget about him.</P>

<P>Jane: Daria didn’t you notice that when Brittany mentioned inviting
you to her party as an exchange for a favor you did for her, he got especially
mad. He cares about how they treat you. Maybe he wants to be your friend.</P>

<P>Daria: Just because he treats other human beings decently doesn’t necessarily
mean he would want to go out with me. Even in the movies Louis Lane never
got to stay with Superman.</P>

<P><B>At that moment Chad gets the pizza he ordered and decides to go to
Daria and Jane’s table to see if they want to share it with him.</B></P>

<P>Chad: Hello, this pizza a bit too much for me, would you like to help
me eat it and maybe we can talk for a while.</P>

<P>Daria: (Thinking) When is he going to stop torturing me. (To Chad) Yeah
sure.</P>

<P>Jane: Come join us, the more the merrier. Although I doubt we will be
able to finish of that pizza.</P>

<P>Chad: We’ll take whatever is left over and pretend it’s a Frisbee. I
guess you couldn’t help but overhear my little chat with Kevin and Brittany.</P>

<P>Jane: The nerve of them trying to invite you to her party in exchange
for helping Kevin this morning.</P>

<P>Chad: I don’t get it, I was just doing my job. What really bothers me
is that they think that spending time with them is like some big prize.
It is times like theses when I really miss my old school in England.</P>

<P>Jane: Anyone special you left behind in merry old England.</P>

<P>Chad: No I don’t have a girlfriend here or in England if that’s what
you’re wondering. I’m kind of going solo these days.</P>

<P>Daria (Thinking) I am going to dump whatever is left over from that
pizza on Jane’s head if she doesn’t stop asking such embarrassing questions.
Then again it is kind of nice to know that he doesn’t have a girlfriend.
On the other hand that only makes it easier for Quinn to date him. </P>

<P><B>At that moment Chad gets a call from his butler on his cellular phone
asking him to go home in a hurry.</B></P>

<P>Chad: Sorry girls, I guess I have to go now, see you at school.</P>

<P>Jane: Good-bye Chad see you around.</P>

<P>Daria: Bye, see you.</P>

<P><B>Chad picks up his Kurt Vonnegut book and back pack and leaves the
pizza parlor.</B></P>

<P>Jane: I don’t understand Daria, first you are frustrated because you
think Chad would not give us the time of day, then when he finally decides
to have a friendly conversation with us, you clam up. Open up, guys have
insecurities to.</P>

<P>Daria: I know what you mean but I can’t help it, I get so nervous when
I’m around a guy I like.</P>

<P>Jane: Yeah, I remember how you would always clam up around Trent to.
You will have to deal with Chad though, since we all go to the same school.</P>

<P>Daria: Why did you ask him if he had a special someone in England?</P>

<P>Jane: I was just trying to do you a favor, to remove all doubts. Now
we know that you do have a definite possibility of dating Chad.</P>

<P>Daria: What makes you think he wants to go out with me.</P>

<P>Jane: I believe he followed us here and he was using the pizza as a
way to get to know us better.</P>

<P>Daria: I guess the best way to get to a girl’s heart is through pizza.
They should include that in all the dating manuals. All I know is that
I’m very confused and I’m not very sure where I stand with Chad. As far
as dating him goes I wouldn’t bet on it until he actually does ask me out.</P>

<P>Jane: Lets just say tomorrow is a brand new day and today was very interesting.</P>

<P><B>Daria and Jane are at their first period class which is music appreciation
and they don’t know it yet but Chad is also in this class and he agreed
with the teacher earlier to play and to sing three songs about love, growing
up and teenage life at the dawn of the new millennium for an extra credit
assignment. The songs are Chicago’s “Just You Me” Supertramp’s “The Logical
Song” and “Life On The Fast Lane” by the Eagles. (Let us not forget Daria
is not crazy about all classic rock songs. Will Chad change her mind?)
He also brought a special guest, his friend, Peter Sullivan from Cherry
Grove who will be helping him play these three songs live to the students
of Lawndale High's Music Appreciation Class. </B></P>

<P>Chad: (Singing the last verse of “Life On The Fast Lane”) “Doctor says
he’s coming but you got to pay him cash.”</P>

<P>Daria: (Thinking) Things haven’t change that much since the seventies.</P>

<P>Chad: Now I will sing “The Logical Song” by Supertramp.</P>

<P>Kevin: You mean a tramp wrote that song.</P>

<P>Chad: No Mr. QB, Supertramp is a pop group that was very popular in
the late seventies. Anyway this song expresses how I feel about growing
up. “When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful, A miracle.
Oh it was beautiful, magical, and all the birds in the trees, well they’d
be singing so happily, joyfully, playfully, watching me. But then they
sent me away to teach me how to be sensible, logical, responsible, practical,
and they showed me a world where I could be so dependable, clinical, intellectual,
cynical. There are times when all the world’s asleep, the questions run
too deep for such a simple man.</P>

<P>Daria (Thinking) That’s weird I feel that way sometimes. Great, maybe
he can even read my mind.</P>

<P>Chad: For my final song I will sing “Just You And Me” a love song written
by Chicago back in 1973. “You are my love and my life. You are my inspiration.
Just you and me, simple and free. Baby you’re everything I ever dreamed
of. Give me your own special smile, promise you’ll never leave me. Just
you and me simple and free. Life is so easy when you’re beside me. Oh girl,
come hold me close never release me, oh baby don’t release me. Open your
arms let my love in. Let me in, let me in. Love me tonight, love me forever
and ever. You know I can’t forget you.” </P>

<P>Daria: (Thinking) Even though it’s classic rock I really like it, it’s
one of the best love songs I’ve ever heard. God I wish he would stop torturing
me this way.</P>

<P><B>Chad finishes his songs and the class leaves to go to the next period,
except for Chad who stays with Peter to pick up their instruments. Ms.
Li sees Daria and Jane and asks them if they could get something from the
closet in the music room. When Daria and Jane walk in Chad and Peter do
not notice them so they start conversing with each other since they think
there is no one else in the room with them. Daria and Jane do what comes
naturally which is to stay in the closet and eavesdrop on Chad and Peter.</B></P>

<P>Peter: Chad how do you like your new school.</P>

<P>Chad: As a school they’re OK, as a student body they are so so, but
as individuals most of them suck.</P>

<P>Peter: Chad, maybe you should try to be less critical of others.</P>

<P>Chad: Actually I was just being honest, I guess I’m just Lawndales most
unwanted. Pete I just want to thank you for helping me out today. I wish
you didn’t live so far away.</P>

<P>Peter: You know I got to get back to my new town, I do look forward
to seeing Jenifer again. </P>

<P>Chad: You are so lucky to have her Pete. I on the other hand have a
feeling I may be going solo for yet another year.</P>

<P>Daria (Thinking) I wish I could tell him how I feel, let him know that
he doesn’t have to be alone.</P>

<P>Peter: Anyone would think that a guy like you would have at least half
a dozen girls trying to get his attention. Lets face it you have the looks
and the right car.</P>

<P>Chad: I don’t want a girl who wants me just on the basis of physical
appearance, the car I drive or anything else that would be considered superficial.
In fact this girl invited me to her party, then she changed her mind when
I told her I was bringing my jalopy and was planning on wearing my commando
pants. Its just that I want someone who wants me for myself, besides I
don’t think I’m that great looking anyway.</P>

<P>Peter: You suffer from the worst combination.</P>

<P>Chad: What do you mean?</P>

<P>Peter: You are not only smart, but you are also very sensitive as well.
Besides you don’t even have a jalopy.</P>

<P>Chad: There is this one girl, I like. She is really smart and knows
how to stand up to some of the so called cool people. I followed her and
her friend to the pizza parlor yesterday and when I finally got to talk
to her and her friend, Oliver had to call, its just that my stupid cat
got into the air vent again so I had to leave. She was part of our audience
today.</P>

<P>Jane: Daria see I told you he followed us to the pizza parlor yesterday.
</P>

<P>Daria: Jane be quite, I’m trying to eavesdrop here.</P>

<P>Peter: What is her name?</P>

<P>Chad: Her name is Daria.</P>

<P>Jane: Its looks like your love life will be improving really fast.</P>

<P>Daria: Ok why do you always have to be right.</P>

<P>Peter: Do you find Daria attractive?</P>

<P>Chad: Yes very attractive, she also has a lot of style and she is so
cool. I get so nervous whenever I’m around her, she also doesn’t talk very
much when I’m around which makes it hard to break the ice.</P>

<P>Jane: See Daria, I told you guys have insecurities to.</P>

<P>Peter: Chad, its like you have everything that anyone could envy, and
yet you are screwed up anyway.</P>

<P>Chad: I guess the world is my oyster but I can’t seem to open it.</P>

<P>Peter: Maybe with Daria’s help you can both get that oyster open together.</P>

<P>Daria (Thinking) I wouldn’t count on it.</P>

<P>Chad: If we can’t get it open we can pretend its a Frisbee and play
catch with it.</P>

<P>Peter: No matter what I say you always make a sarcastic remark, is there
anything I can do to make you feel better.</P>

<P>Chad: Yes there is. Please don’t buy this month’s issue of <U>GG Magazine</U>
because that is where my photo spread is being featured. I’m hoping they
will sell the least issues possible that way GG doesn’t find using me as
a model very feasible.. (note: GG stands for Gorgeous Guys)</P>

<P>Daria: Jane we are going to the news stand after school to check out
<U>GG Magazine </U>I must see that photo spread.</P>

<P>Peter: I guess you are still sore at your mother for making you model
last summer. On the other hand I’m sure you didn’t have too much trouble
accepting that Jag she gave you.</P>

<P>Chad: The only reason she gave me a Jag is because the thought of her
son driving a more modest car would severely damage her ego, pride and
vanity.</P>

<P>Peter: I guess you were a dutiful son who wanted to please his mom.</P>

<P>Chad: Ok so I’m not perfect. I still wouldn’t mind having a Honda or
a Ford at least with those cars I would know who my real friends are.</P>

<P>Peter: Didn’t your mother give you a Jag because you asked for one.</P>

<P>Chad: I never asked for a car. I was planning on buying a Honda CRX
or any other non pretentious car, then my mother learned of my car buying
plans from my father, and rushed to get me the Jag.</P>

<P>Peter: What was your reaction?</P>

<P>Chad: I told her, “Well mom you got me a car that finally lives up to
your vain standards”.</P>

<P>Peter: What did she say?</P>

<P>Chad: “Gee Chad you are an ungrateful son, I was only looking out for
your best interest.” Then I told her “For your vanity as well”</P>

<P>Peter: Why do you have to be such a martyr to principle you are a teenage
boy not Ghandi.</P>

<P>Chad: He never drove a Jag.</P>

<P>Peter: Enough about the Jag. Does this Daria like any other guy?</P>

<P>Chad: I know she does have crush on her best friend’s brother, he has
a band called Mystik Spiral.</P>

<P>Peter: Mystic Spiral, you know that sounds like one of those Doors cover
bands that play at brew pubs. Are they any good?</P>

<P>Chad: They have a nice sound, the leader of the band, and the guy Daria
has a crush on, Trent writes his own material, who knows maybe they’ll
be the next Pearl Jam. Then again he probably doesn’t have a job, still
lives with his parents and sleeps all day, which makes him a pretty cool
guy, how can I compete with that. She’s cool and I don’t blame her for
wanting a cool guy. The problem is I don’t think I’m very cool myself.</P>

<P>Daria (Thinking) I don’t mind lowering my standards. Wait a minute my
standards are not that high to begin with.</P>

<P>Peter: Chad what you need is more confidence and you are cool really
cool. Not to mention a great friend and one hell of a musician. More importantly
you have integrity and I’m sure you will treat any girl you date like a
princess.</P>

<P>Chad: Of course I will treat her right. Who knows maybe I’m not the
guy of her dreams but I may be the guy who can make some of her dreams
come true.</P>

<P>Daria (Thinking) I agree, you can start by going out with me on Friday
night. Bring me a dozen roses, maybe we can go to Chez Pierre. Oh no I’m
starting to think like Quinn. </P>

<P>Jane: How does Chad know about Trent and how does he know that you like
him.</P>

<P>Peter: How did you learn of this Trent.</P>

<P>Chad: I overheard Daria and her friend talking in the hallway on the
way to my chemistry class. That’s how I knew they were going to be at the
pizza parlor after school. That evening I went to one of Mystik Spiral’s
gigs at The Zen. </P>

<P>Peter: How did you manage to keep yourself incognito?</P>

<P>Chad: I wore a black cap, dark glasses, a fake mustache and a fake cast.</P>

<P>Peter: I can just imagine that scene. Lets see; first we have Daria
looking up at the stage admiring our dear Trent, then there you are in
the background all alone wearing your sunglasses at night, wishing you
could be with Daria. Just like in that eighties song. How sweet.</P>

<P>Chad: Now lets turn the knife counter clockwise. Besides the song I
kept hearing in my head was “She’s So High”. You know what if you were
my analyst I’d stop going to you by now.</P>

<P>Peter: If that is so why do you always call me first when you have a
problem.</P>

<P>Chad: Ok, you got me there. I just wish you weren’t right about everything,
including my relationships.</P>

<P>Peter: Or lack of relationships.</P>

<P>Jane: I knew that guy with the cast looked familiar.</P>

<P>Daria: I saw him to. I had a feeling I knew him from somewhere. Oh no
we have been in this closet for twenty minute, we missed half our English
class.</P>

<P>Jane: At least we learned something today.</P>

<P>Daria: You’re right, guys are a priority. Oh no! I’m starting to sound
like Quinn. If I start to think and act like Quinn. Jane do the right thing
and put me out of my misery.</P>

<P><B>Daria and Jane hurry to at least make it to the last part of their
English class. Chad and Peter go to Chad’s Van to store their instruments.
Chad then goes to his Chemistry class. </B></P>

<P><B>While walking to English Class Jane and Daria comment on Chad’s conversation
with Peter.</B></P>

<P>Jane: We’re you actually admiring Trent from the audience as Peter puts
it.</P>

<P>Daria: You wouldn’t get mad if I told you that while I was at The Zen
I wasn’t only thinking about Trent, I was thinking about Chad as well and
what happened at the pizza place. I can’t get him out of my mind. </P>

<P>Jane: Daria, how could I not understand you. Trent has been dating Claire
and that gives you the right to find someone else to go out with. Besides
I think Chad is really very right for you. Listening to him talk to his
friend today made me realize how much you and Chad have in common.</P>

<P>Daria: So you think we have a lot in common?</P>

<P>Jane: Come on, when I listen to Chad it is almost like listening to
many of the things you say. He’s deep, doesn’t like superficiality, he
is very humble and from what I can see he knows how to be a true friend.</P>

<P>Daria: Thanks Jane. You’re also a great friend as well.</P>

<P><B>Later that day Chad is unknowingly standing in front of Daria’s locker.</B></P>

<P>Daria: Excuse me Chad, but you’re in front of my locker and I need to
get my books for my next class.</P>

<P>Chad: Sorry for blocking your locker. By the way I was wondering.</P>

<P><B>At that moment Ms. Li tells Daria that her mother wants her on the
phone. So she goes to Ms Li’s office feeling really frustrated.</B></P>

<P>Daria: Hi mom, what do you need?</P>

<P>Helen: Daria, I will be out of town on business and your father is also
out of town, therefore you will all be eating out for the next few days
and I just want to let you know that I have left you money on your dresser.
You took a while to get to the phone, were you doing anything important
right now?</P>

<P>Daria: I was talking to this very good looking guy over at my locker
and he was almost going to ask me out when you called.</P>

<P>Helen: Oh Daria, I wish you were not so sarcastic all the time.</P>

<P>Daria: You know mom you would have never had said that if Quinn told
you that a cute guy was asking her out. No not pretty little Quinn who
is always a hit with every boy she meets. You just failed parenting 101
for the second time.</P>

<P>Helen: Daria I didn’t mean anything by that, its just that to you life
is one big sarcastic remark after another. Believe me I don’t think guys
only ask Quinn out. What is his name?</P>

<P>Daria: Never mind Mom, Good-bye.</P>

<P><B>Daria leave the phone with tears in her eyes and a great deal of
anger. </B></P>

<P>Daria: (Thinking) Why can’t everyone be like Chad. Why can’t other people
find me cool and attractive.</P>

<P>Jane: Daria, Chad had to go somewhere. Are you ok?</P>

<P>Daria: Did he say where he was going?</P>

<P>Jane: No he didn’t but he said he will talk to you later.</P>

<P>Daria: Great, maybe he changed his mind and decided he wasn’t interested
in me after all.</P>

<P>Jane: I seriously doubt that. Don’t you remember his conversation with
his friend.</P>

<P>Daria: It’s just that mom really hurt my feelings today.</P>

<P>Jane: What did she say or what did she not say?</P>

<P>Daria: When she asked me what I was doing now, I told her that I was
being asked out by this very good looking guy over at my locker. That’s
when she told me to stop being so sarcastic. She wouldn’t have said that
if Quinn had told her the same news.</P>

<P>Jane: I think she just thought that you were being what you usually
are and that is sarcastic.</P>

<P>Daria: You could also add normally unpopular with guys. I should have
known my sarcasm would one day backfire on me.</P>

<P>Jane: I think he really likes you, he’s just shy. You have been crying,
am I right.</P>

<P>Daria: Yes I have. I feel like I got a glimpse of heaven and then have
been thrown back into the frustrating reality that is my life. I want to
see where Chad normally goes for lunch. Maybe I can talk to him then. I
really need to resolve this.</P>

<P><B>Jane and Daria look everywhere for Chad and could not find him. While
they search Chad is preparing a note to put in Daria’s locker inviting
her and Jane to have lunch with him the next day. With his note he includes
the menus from three exclusive pizzeria’s and a Stardust menu with a large
variety of drinks for Daria and Jane to choose from, he also includes his
phone number so they can let him know what they want for lunch. He perfumes
the note with his cologne which is One by Calvin Kline. He slips the note
in her locker. He also scotch tapes a rose to her locker.</B></P>

<P>Daria: It’s like he vanished suddenly, I should have known that all
this was too good to be true.</P>

<P>Jane: We won’t know for sure until we talk to him again.</P>

<P><B>At that moment Daria finds a rose taped to her locker and there’s
a big smile on her face then she opens her locker and she finds the note
Chad left her. She can smell the cologne a mile away.</B></P>

<P>Daria: Today is full of surprises, look an envelope with more cologne
than in the bottle. I wonder who its from?</P>

<P>Jane: Hurry it up! Open it! I have to know who its from. I bet its from
Chad.</P>

<P><B>Daria opens the note and it says Dear Daria, I was going to ask you
out earlier when we were talking by your locker, since I didn’t get the
chance, I was wondering if you would like to join me for lunch tomorrow.
I will make it my treat. I know you and your friend Jane like pizza so
I included menus from three of the best pizzerias in Lawndale, I also included
a Stardust coffee menu so you can order any beverage you want. Here is
my number so you can call me tonight with your order, my phone number is
789-3476. I will take your order, give it to my butler Oliver and he will
bring us our lunch. I would like to dine Al Fresco so please meet me for
lunch at the yard outside the front of the school, that is where I usually
have lunch. I would have told you all this personally but it’s just that
I have to leave school early to pick my father up from the airport. Please
call me, that way we can talk.. Sincerely yours, Chad Carrington. </B></P>

<P>Jane: What a beautiful rose. Why don’t you show it to Quinn. In fact
here’s your chance. She is coming this way with the fashion club. Make
her suffer.</P>

<P>Daria: You know what, now that I have the opportunity to make Quinn
suffer, I don’t really feel like doing it. I’m too happy and I don’t want
to ruin the moment with an argument with Quinn.</P>

<P>Jane: Just because now you have a boyfriend, that doesn’t mean you have
to soften up. He likes the fact that you stand up to the really stuck up
people and Quinn is the most stuck up of them all.</P>

<P>Daria: I know, but even if I did show it to her, she wouldn’t believe
me. I think I will have greater satisfaction when he comes to pick me up
at my house. Then again who cares about revenge. I might date this year
and I feel really good. Today has been emotional roller coaster ride to
say the least.</P>

<P><B>While Daria and Jane are at Mr. DeMartino’s Social Studies class.
Daria is hardly listening and her thoughts are only of Chad as she writes
Chad's name over and over again on her binder. She even writes Chad and
Daria with a little heart around it. </B></P>

<P>Daria (Thinking) I better pay attention before I get into trouble. Now
I now I know why Quinn is so dumb. Guys really do take up a lot of brain
power.</P>

<P>Mr. DeMartino: Daria, tell me the name of the last battle that Napoleon
fought in and was finally defeated.</P>

<P>Daria: Yes, what was the question.</P>

<P>Mr. DeMartino: The question was what was the name of the last battle
Napoleon fought in and was finally defeated.</P>

<P>Daria: Waterloo like the Abba song. OOPS did I say that.</P>

<P>Mr. DeMartino: Even though the answer is correct you will need more
than Abba songs to pass tomorrow’s test.</P>

<P>Daria: Sorry, I’m not quite myself today.</P>

<P>Kevin: Daria, does this mean you’re not a brain anymore. By the way
what was the name of that Abba song, I may need to know it for the test
tomorrow.</P>

<P>Daria: Just read the chapter Kevin, and my brain is just on hiatus for
the day, it will be back full force tomorrow, I hope.</P>

<P><B>It is the late afternoon and Daria is over at Jane’s house, they
are looking a Chad photo spread in <U>GG Magazine</U>. </B></P>

<P>Jane: You can’t deny that he does look good in his photo spread in GG
Magazine. Don’t you think this would be a good time to call him with our
pizza order for tomorrow.</P>

<P>Daria: I want to call him, but I don’t have the nerve, Jane.</P>

<P>Jane: Ok I will call him and I’ll tell him you suddenly have laryngitis.
Come on Daria, if you want to get a little closer to Chad you are going
to have to call him. Here’s the number.</P>

<P><B>Daria Then dial Chad’s number, feeling more and more nervous with
every number she presses. She then stands there breathless as the phone
rings. Then after two rings Chad answers the phone.</B></P>

<P>Chad: Hello, it’s Chad Carrington.</P>

<P>Daria: Hi it’s me, Daria, I’m calling with the pizza order for Jane
and me.</P>

<P>Chad: So you decided to join me for lunch tomorrow. That’s great! So
what will you be having?</P>

<P>Daria: Jane and I would like a pepperoni pizza, and two cokes.</P>

<P>Chad: Two cokes, so you don’t want a latte or a frappucino, Stardust
only serves the best coffee beverages around.</P>

<P>Daria: That’s ok, two cokes will be fine.</P>

<P>Chad: So how are you doing tonight?</P>

<P>Daria: I’m ok.</P>

<P>Chad: So let me guess, you are calling me from your friend, Jane’s house.
Am I right.</P>

<P>Daria: Yes you are right. How did you guess that?</P>

<P>Chad: I figured you and your friend Jane were kind of partners in crime
and I guess that would include any new people in your lives.</P>

<P>Daria: Its just that at my house it is sometimes difficult to use the
phone with my sister Quinn on it all the time.</P>

<P>Chad: Your sister wouldn’t happen to be Quinn Morgendorffer would it?
Its just that she introduced herself to me the moment I parked my car in
the parking lot the first day of school, and when I asked if she had any
brothers or sister she told me she was an only child.</P>

<P>Daria: Well yes Quinn Morgendorffer is my sister and this isn’t going
to be easy on my self esteem but let me explain Quinn’s reason for telling
you that.</P>

<P>Chad: Before you begin to explain Quinn’s reason for telling me that,
let me tell you a little about myself. I assure you will feel much better
when I tell you about my dear brother, Vincent.</P>

<P>Daria: So you have a brother, very well tell me about your dear brother,
Vincent.</P>

<P>Chad: My brother Vincent is two years older than me and a lot better
looking than I am.</P>

<P>Daria: Excuse me, you have a brother that is even better looking than
you. Does your family use a geneticist?</P>

<P>Chad: No my family doesn’t. Its just that until a year ago, I was only
five foot one, had very thick glasses was as thin as a rail, and lets not
forget I was always a brain. Believe me I wasn’t much to look. Anyhow my
brother was always good looking since almost the day he was born and well
having a brother like me was not that great for his image so what he would
do is when he told his friends I was his brother he would always say that
I came from the shallow end of the gene pool which I found very insulting
considering he is one of the dumbest people on this planet. I used to think
he was the dumbest person until I met Kevin and Brittany. I remember one
time talking to one of my mother’s employees about Surrealism and my brother
thought we were talking about what we were having for dinner that night.</P>

<P>Daria: Are you making all this up because you feel sorry for me, because
from what I can see you are six foot one, you don’t wear glasses and you
are very muscular. You must have made quite a transformation, to look the
way you do today. I’m sorry but I find your story a bit hard to believe,
people don’t just become model material overnight. Besides I don’t need
any of your pity, I can handle my stuck up sister very well myself, thank
you.</P>

<P>Chad: Daria please don’t get mad, I’m not telling you this out of pity.
What I’m telling you is the truth, the painful truth about myself, about
my life and the acrimonious relationship between my brother and I. It’s
just that last summer my mother gave me a ultimatum which was to either
model for GG Magazine or take violin lessons. Since I hate the violin I
choose to go with modeling. Due to the fact that I had to model for GG
Magazine I had to look the part, therefore I had no choice but to get contact
lenses and they were torture because they would make my eyes itch so badly.
I also had to do bench pressing at least four hours every day since early
spring this year to get more muscular, and it wasn’t until last year that
I reached my present height. What I’m trying to say is that for whatever
reason Quinn wants people to believe she’s an only child, I think she is
very stupid and insensitive for doing that. I think she should be proud
to have a sister like you. I would really love to have you for a sister.
On the other hand I wouldn’t be able to date you then and that would really
suck. I really like you Daria, I find you very attractive and you are so
cool. Besides I wasn’t insinuating that Quinn’s reasons for lying and my
brothers reasons for giving me hell were appearance oriented in both cases,
I was just trying to tell you that many of us have very unkind siblings,
who hurt our feelings on a regular basis.</P>

<P>Daria: So if you did not have to model for <U>GG Magazine </U>you would
still be wearing glasses today and you wouldn’t be quite as muscular as
you are now. </P>

<P>Chad: That is right Daria, I would look very different the only thing
that would be the same would be my height. Although I do wonder, if I did
have thick glasses and was still as thin as a rail would you still join
me for lunch tomorrow.</P>

<P>Daria: Why do you even have to ask? Of course I would join you for lunch
tomorrow. I want you to know I’m not hung up on looks and what I like about
you has more to do with the type of person you are than what you look like.
Since we’re on the subject, do you really find me attractive.</P>

<P>Chad: Yes very, I like girls who are petite and have a wicked smile
like yours and I&nbsp;really dig those Doctor Martin boots you wear.</P>

<P>Daria: Thanks. I was wondering, if you don’t have to model anymore for
<U>GG Magazine</U> why do you still wear contact lenses?</P>

<P>Chad: I figured I went through all the itching that comes with wearing
contacts for the first few weeks and now I’m used to them, so why wear
glasses. On the other hand if you prefer me with glasses I will stop wearing
my contact lenses right now and I will wear my glasses from this moment
forward.</P>

<P>Daria: That’s ok. I once tried contacts myself, but I was unable to
get past the itching stage, I guess I just didn’t have something really
overpowering to motivate me such as the threat of having to take violin
lessons. One thing I don’t understand, if Quinn introduced herself to you
how come you haven’t asked her out yet.</P>

<P>Chad: I guess I’m just not interested in Quinn. I know she is your sister
and everything , so please don’t get mad, but its just that she reminds
me of all the people my mother works with, which are the elite of the fashion
industry, and the most shallow people in the world, in my opinion.</P>

<P>Daria: What does your mother do for a living and why do you feel such
disdain for the fashion industry?</P>

<P>Chad: My mother is an ego maniacal fashion magazine editor for <U>Waif
Magazine</U>, and she was also a super model in her younger days. I wouldn’t
have such contempt for the fashion industry if my mother hadn’t dragged
to all those fashion conventions every summer of my life since I was a
baby. What’s most ironic is that most guys think I’m very lucky because
I’m always surrounded by super models, and believe me its a nightmare disguised
as a paradise situation, because with few exceptions most super models
I have talked to are shallow, self absorbed, narcissistic, unscrupulous
and not very bright.</P>

<P>Daria: Sounds like the ideal job for Quinn, she has all the right qualifications.
Is your brother Vincent in the fashion industry.</P>

<P>Chad: Yes my brother is a fashion photographer.</P>

<P>Daria: Maybe if Quinn becomes a model your brother and her could get
together and that would be our revenge.</P>

<P>Chad: That is never going to happen, see my brother dabbles in the love
that dares not speak its name.</P>

<P>Daria: Excuse me.</P>

<P>Chad: My brother is gay. You know what is most ironic. </P>

<P>Daria: What.</P>

<P>Chad: The fact that my brother has even more guys after him than Quinn
does. </P>

<P>Daria: Did you and Vincent live together while you where growing up.</P>

<P>Chad: No, my parents got a divorce when I was two and my brother stayed
with my mother and I live with my father most of the year. I’m very glad
because if mom would have had her way I would also be studying a career
geared towards the fashion industry. Did you know that when she discovered
my career plans she even sent me to an analyst to correct the error of
my ways.</P>

<P>Daria: An analyst.</P>

<P>Chad: You know one of those doctors your parents send you to when you
are not acting the way they want you to act, you know, to make you conform.</P>

<P>Daria: What career is this, that has your mother so alarmed that she
even sent you to a shrink.</P>

<P>Chad: I want to be an FBI Agent and capture serial killers.</P>

<P>Daria: You wouldn’t happen to be a regular viewer of <I>The Strange
Files</I>, you know the show that made the FBI seem interesting.</P>

<P>Chad: Yes I do watch <I>The Strange Files</I>, but that is not the reason
I want to be an FBI Agent. When I was a boy I used to read all the adventures
of Sherlock Holmes, or anything else that was related to detective work.
I always found detective work fascinating, and its all I ever wanted to
do since I was five.</P>

<P>Daria: I guess in a way I also find detective work fascinating, I have
even written stories about this female detective I created her name is
Meledy Powers. Anyway, I always thought a guy like you would not have any
hang-ups, yet it seems I’m wrong. Don’t you ever look in the mirror and
when you do aren’t you happy with what you see.</P>

<P>Chad: Yes I do look in mirrors and every time I see my reflection all
I can see is a lonely guy with many insecurities staring back at me. I
still cry when I see movies like Gattaca or City Of Angels because like
the main characters in those movies I’ve always felt like an outsider.
What makes you think I have it made Daria?</P>

<P>Daria: Well you’re one of those really privileged people who are lucky
enough to be considered cute, you even modeled for <U>GG Magazine.</U></P>

<P>Chad: Modeling for <U>GG Magazine</U> was just one more thing that my
mother did to humiliate me. I had to use almost a whole bottle of Visine
daily in order for my eyes to look acceptable because they would itch so
badly from trying to get use to wearing contact lenses. I also had a trainer
that would make me work out till my muscles literally burned with pain.
What I found most difficult was when the photographer would tell me to
make love to the camera, which was a very tall order since I have never
even kissed a girl before. OOPS did I say that. </P>

<P>Daria: Yes I’m afraid you did.</P>

<P>Chad: Well, yes you are the first girl I’ve ever asked out, and I guess
I’m probably guy number twenty one on your list.</P>

<P>Daria: Actually you’re guy number thirty-five. Just kidding, I don’t
have a whole lot of dating experience either. I’m very flattered that I’m
the first girl you ever asked out.</P>

<P>Chad: Thanks. I was wondering if I could pick you up at your house tomorrow
morning that way we can talk on the way to school, I will also pick up
Jane of course. Would you like that? All I need is for you to give me your
address, and can I&nbsp;also have your phone number.</P>

<P>Daria: (Thinking) This would really make Quinn suffer. (To Chad) I think
that’s a great idea my address is 4890 Lawndale Park Way (Note To Reader:
I made that address up if you do know Daria’s real address let me know
at once) and my phone number is 682-9633 See you tomorrow.</P>

<P>Chad: Good-bye and I will be there at 7:45 AM. Bye Jane I hope you found
our conversation interesting.</P>

<P>Daria: What makes you think Jane can hear you.</P>

<P>Chad: I can tell by the background noise that you have the phone on
speaker mode. </P>

<P>Jane: Sorry Chad, I promise I’ll keep this conversation private.</P>

<P>Chad: Don’t worry I trust you, Jane. Bye Girls.</P>

<P>Jane and Daria: Good-bye Chad. (Daria hangs up and turns the speaker
mode of.)</P>

<P>Jane: I will go with you and Chad to school tomorrow morning. After
tomorrow I was wondering if I could go with Tom, he has been after me,
to let him take me to school for a whole month.</P>

<P>Daria: How come you haven’t mentioned this to me before.</P>

<P>Jane: I know how you feel about Tom, and I didn’t want to make you feel
that I was abandoning you.</P>

<P>Daria: I see, so now that I’m going to be going out with Chad, you decided
its time to go our separate ways.</P>

<P>Jane: Daria, of course I never meant it like that, you are my best friend,
and we will still hang out together a lot, but we have to realize that
there will be times when Chad may want to spend time with you, just you.</P>

<P>Daria: Part of me really wants to go out with Chad, but another part
of me does not want things to change. See even though Trent is dating Claire
I was hoping he’d break up with her and maybe I could go out with him,
and maybe we would stay together, and that way you and Trent would always
be part of my life.</P>

<P>Jane: Trent and I will always be part of your life no matter what. I
will always be your best friend and Trent will always care about you. I
do think you should give Chad a chance though. Its like he told his friend,
“He may not be the guy of your dreams but he may be the one who can make
some of your dreams come true” come on don’t you want to be treated like
a princess by a guy who would even make Quinn drool, not to mention green
with envy. Besides maybe you should show Trent that he can’t take you for
granted.</P>

<P>Daria: Wouldn’t I be using him then.</P>

<P>Jane: No you wouldn’t , you really like him, you’re just afraid of change
that’s all. You are not shallow.</P>

<P>Daria: Thanks I feel much better now. I’m going home now see you tomorrow.</P>

<P>Jane: Bye see you tomorrow, and hey everything is going to be all right,
or even better, the expression on Quinn’s face when Chad comes to your
door to pick you up will make me wish I had my Polaroid with me.</P>

<P><B>Chad arrives with Jane in his Jag at Daria’s house. He is wearing
a pair of white denim pants, blue denim blouse, really nice white penny
loafers, and his best smile when he goes to pick up Daria at her door,
he then rings the doorbell and Helen who's business trip was cancelled
opens the door.</B></P>

<P>Helen: Hello who are you?</P>

<P>Chad: Good Morning Mrs. Morgendorffer, I’m Chad Carrington and I’m here
to pick up your daughter (before Chad can finish his sentence, Helen calls
Quinn.)</P>

<P>Helen: Quinn, come to the door.</P>

<P>Chad: But I’m here for your other daughter, Daria.</P>

<P>Helen: Oh no, I blew it again.</P>

<P><B>Quinn comes to the door and sees Chad.</B></P>

<P>Quinn: Hi Chad, I guess you finally came to your senses and decided
to pay me a visit.</P>

<P>Chad: Actually Quinn, I never left my senses in the first place, I’m
here to pick up Daria, you know Daria your sister.</P>

<P>Quinn: So is this some kind of a joke you’re playing on me.</P>

<P><B>At that moment Daria appears</B></P>

<P>Daria: No I think the joke is on you this time Quinn. Hi Chad.</P>

<P>Chad: Hello Daria, here a little something for you (He give her a beautiful
red rose).</P>

<P><B>Quinn now looks like she wants to drop of the planet, she can’t believe
what she’s seeing not only did Chad not ask her out, but he even prefers
Daria’s company instead and to top it of he even brings her flowers.</B></P>

<P>Daria: Hi mom, I guess as to parenting 101 this is the third strike,
which means your out.</P>

<P>Quinn and Chad: What?</P>

<P>Helen: Never mind.</P>

<P>Chad: Daria may I carry your books to the car for you?</P>

<P>Daria: Thanks, but that’s ok I usually carry a back pack.</P>

<P><B>When Chad and Daria reach his car that is parked on the curve he
opens the door for her and then he gets in his car. They all talk on the
way to school. Later on While Chad is walking with Daria and Jane down
the hallway of the school to Daria and Jane’s first period class, Chad
is giving them instructions on how to find where he usually has lunch.</B></P>

<P>Chad: After you exit the side door of the school, you go to the grass
and then you follow the signs I left for you to find me, they’re meant
to keep the popular people away, so they won’t bother me.</P>

<P><B>Meanwhile Quinn and the rest of the fashion club are walking towards
Chad and Daria as they walk down the hallway.</B></P>

<P>Sandi: Look its that new boy. What is he doing with that weirdo cousin
of yours, Quinn?</P>

<P>Quinn: Will Sandi since I told him I didn’t want to date him, he decided
that he was going to use Daria to convince me to go out with him.</P>

<P><B>As Chad, Daria and Jane pass by them Chad decides to speak.</B></P>

<P>Chad: Hello Quinn, hi Sandi, Tiffany, and hi Stacy I’m sure you know
my girlfriend Daria, since she is Quinn’s older sister.</P>

<P><B>At this moment Quinn and the rest of the fashion club are in total
shock and are all thinking what planet is this guy from.</B></P>

<P>Sandi: So this means you are dating Daria and are you not trying to
find a way to get Quinn to go out with you.</P>

<P>Chad: Exactly.</P>

<P><B>The fashion club leave Quinn alone and Quinn who is totally embarrassed
runs the other way to hide in her favorite hiding place, the girl’s bathroom.
Despite the fact that Quinn got what she deserved, Daria can’t help but
feel pity towards her.</B></P>

<P>Chad: Well Daria I guess that went pretty well.</P>

<P>Daria: Look Chad, despite the fact that Quinn got what she deserved,
I can’t help but feel sorry for her right now. Besides I didn’t know that
you considered me, your girlfriend.</P>

<P>Chad: Well you are a girl and you are my friend. Besides I didn’t mean
to be unkind to Quinn and all I did was tell her friends the truth. I think
the reason Sandi asked me that question is because Quinn was making up
another lie to keep herself from looking bad at your expense and I just
wasn’t going to allow that to happen, I care about you Daria and I care
about how they treat you.</P>

<P>Daria: I appreciate that Chad, I know that your reasons are good. It’s
just that I’m very certain that Quinn is in real emotional anguish right
now.</P>

<P>Chad: Very well, I will try to be kinder to Quinn in the future, but
before you start mourning for your sister don’t forget all the emotional
anguish she has put you through. In your case you never did anything to
deserve it and yet she was still insensitive towards you.</P>

<P>Jane: That’s true, Daria he does have a point, Quinn had it coming to
her.</P>

<P>Daria: I agree, but that’s the difference between me and Quinn I actually
care about how my actions affect others even those people are worthy of
my contempt.</P>

<P>Chad: I’m glad to hear that you are so compassionate, I guess you have
given me one more reason to like you even more. Anyhow here’s your class.
Remember to watch for the signs I put up on the side of the school leading
to my lunch spot.</P>

<P>Daria: Ok then I’ll look for the signs. I guess we all have to go our
separate ways now, see you at lunch.</P>

<P>Chad: Good-bye and good luck finding me.</P>

<P><B>Its lunch time and Daria and Jane go to find where Chad has lunch.
First they run into a sign that says “BEWARE OF INSANE BOY HE ONLY ATTACKS
POPULAR PEOPLE”, then they run into another sign that says “NOBODY HERE
BUT LAWNDALE’S MOST UNWANTED”.</B></P>

<P>Jane: Chad is a really friendly guy, isn’t he.</P>

<P>Daria: I even like him more now. I might ask him if I can borrow some
of his signs, for when the fashion club comes to visit Quinn.</P>

<P>Jane: But the fashion club never goes near your part of the house anyway.</P>

<P>Daria: They may start wanting to hang around my part of the house when
Chad comes to visit and having to watch Sandi try to seduce Chad is going
to make me want to vomit.</P>

<P><B>Daria and Jane, finally see Chad as he welcomes them, then they come
across a beautiful picnic area set up with the pizzas Jane and Daria wanted
plus their drinks and a whole bunch of other goodies to munch on.</B></P>

<P>Chad: Hello Daria, Hello Jane, I would like you to meet my butler, Oliver.</P>

<P>Oliver: Hello girls, it is my pleasure to make you acquaintance.</P>

<P>Daria: Hello Oliver, it nice to meet you.</P>

<P>Jane: Hi Oliver, nice meeting you.</P>

<P>Chad: Help yourself to whatever you like. Oliver and I were discussing
the music I listen to, he says my music is too morbid. He doesn’t like
the song “All The Young Dudes” by World Party.</P>

<P>Oliver: It’s just that the first line of that song talks about how this
young man’s friend, Billy wants to commit suicide by the time he is twenty-five.</P>

<P>Chad: Come on Oliver suicide is a favorite pastime of American boys
they do it all the time, you should check the statistics.</P>

<P>Oliver: That’s another thing I can’t stand, Chad, every time you open
your mouth it is to say yet another sarcastic remark. I just hope that
these new friends of yours show how fun it is to be a teenager.</P>

<P>Jane: I’m sure Daria will show Chad how to be a happy, vibrant teenager,
maybe she’ll play him some of her Beach Boys or Partridge Family CDs.(NOTE:
Partridge Family was a tv family who sang together in the early seventies
the leader of the band was David Casidy)</P>

<P>Daria: I’m sure Jane will have a great time showing Chad some of her
Brady Bunch reruns that she watches all the time.</P>

<P>Oliver: I’m so glad to hear that. It’s just that if Chad keeps listening
to such depressing music like the soundtrack from <I>The</I> <I>Strange
Files </I>he is going to severely damage his brain.</P>

<P>Chad: Oliver don’t worry about my brain, we are in Lawndale now, I don’t
need one.</P>

<P>Daria: I guess you find most of the people around here are very dumb.
A very accurate assessment, I definitely agree.</P>

<P>Oliver: Why are you young people always so cynical these days.</P>

<P>Chad: Because we live in a very frustrating world Oliver, would you
believe that they are making me take a self esteem class for four weeks
after school.</P>

<P>Jane: Daria and I also had to take a self esteem class, welcome to the
club. What was the answer you gave to Ms. Manson when she showed you the
cue card with a guy and a girl talking?</P>

<P>Chad: I told her that they were making plans to bomb the next fashion
convention in Paris. I couldn't help but remember all those fashion conventions
my mother made me go to.</P>

<P>Daria: Maybe we can help you get out sooner, see Jane took the self
esteem class six times and she might still have her notes.</P>

<P>Chad: Jane do you still have your notes and why did you have to take
it six times, you are such a smart girl.</P>

<P>Jane: Yes I still have my notes and I guess at that time in my life
having low self esteem made me feel special.</P>

<P>Chad: But Jane being insane makes me feel special and you don’t see
me in an asylum.</P>

<P>Oliver: That’s because I haven’t committed you yet.</P>

<P>Chad: If you do, I will tell them that you are the reason for my malady.</P>

<P>Oliver: I wish you were not so sarcastic all the time Chad, and that
show you watch <I>The Strange Files</I> and the fact that your refer to
yourself as a phile makes me sometimes think you live in a drawer of a
filing cabinet.</P>

<P>Chad: As a matter of fact I do, you can find me between crazy and demented.
</P>

<P>Daria: But they both mean the same thing.</P>

<P>Chad: My point exactly. Anyway I really want to hangout with you after
school today but I’d hate make you wait an hour until I get out of my self
esteem class.</P>

<P>Daria: That’s Ok Chad we don’t mind waiting for you. Jane if you want
you can go home, I’ll wait up for Chad myself .</P>

<P>Jane: That’s Ok, Daria I’d rather stick around, besides Tom is going
to be hanging out with the guys all afternoon.</P>

<P>Chad: So you have a boyfriend Jane.</P>

<P>Jane: Yes.</P>

<P>Chad: Have you known him very long.</P>

<P>Jane: Just a few months.</P>

<P>Daria: That would be two months, three weeks and two days to be exact.</P>

<P>Chad: I get the feeling Tom’s not your favorite person.</P>

<P>Daria: Actually he’s a nice guy, its just that when Jane started going
out with Tom I started feeling kind of lonely.</P>

<P>Chad: I understand how you feel I had a very lonely six months when
my best friend Peter moved to another state. I started having quite a few
hobbies since then, but I was still lonely never the less. Now that I met
you I feel so much happier and I don’t feel lonely anymore do you feel
the same way.</P>

<P>Daria: Yes I do.</P>

<P><B>After Chad’s self esteem class Daria and Jane are deciding where
to go to eat.</B></P>

<P>Daria: Pizza after school.</P>

<P>Chad: Daria we already had pizza for lunch, how about if I take you
somewhere special.</P>

<P>Daria: Where.</P>

<P>Chad: Come on Daria, I want it to be a surprise.</P>

<P>Daria: When it comes to food I don’t like surprises.</P>

<P>Jane: Come on Daria, we have pizza everyday, lets try something new
it will be fun.</P>

<P><B>After being on the road for a while Daria, Chad and Jane are in front
of Emiko’s House of Sushi. They walk up to the door and the doorman points
to Daria and Jane’s boots, Chad already took his shoes of, and Daria and
Jane look at each other.</B></P>

<P>Daria: Jane, I guess this means we have to take our boots of.</P>

<P><B>Jane and Daria take of their boots and Daria smells something funny
and realizes its Jane’s feet.</B></P>

<P>Daria: Did something die in your boots?</P>

<P>Jane: No, I wasn’t planning on this, I forgot to change my odor eaters
again.</P>

<P>Daria: When did you last change them.</P>

<P>Jane: Four month ago. I guess you change yours often because I don’t
smell anything.</P>

<P>Daria: Due to the fact that I always try to avoid humiliation, I put
a new odor eater in my Doctor Martins every week, I guess being paranoid
is finally paying of.</P>

<P><B>Daria, Chad and Jane walk in to the restaurant and everybody turns
their heads towards Jane’s feet and have an expression on their faces of
what’s that smells. Chad, Jane and Daria are seated on the floor of their
table. Then the guy at the next table asks the waitress a question in Japanese.</B></P>

<P>Guy At Next Table: The sushi’s not fresh it has this really strange
smell.</P>

<P><B>Then the waitress whispers in his ear in Japanese.</B></P>

<P>Waitress: It not the sushi its that American girl’s feet, she forgot
to use her odor eaters.</P>

<P><B>Jane starts to get really embarrassed. Then the waitress hands them
little towels to clean their hands and Jane uses hers to clean her feet,
and the waitress looks at her funny, but the smell is gone and Jane is
relieve.</B></P>

<P>Daria: First we took of our boots and now we are sitting on the floor,
what’s next the raw fish. OOPS I didn’t mean it that way.</P>

<P>Chad: You will really love the Sushi here Daria, it is almost as good
as the kind you eat at Japan.</P>

<P>Daria: But we are not in Japan.</P>

<P>Chad: I’m going to order you the sushi, sashimi sampler, you will really
like this.</P>

<P>Jane: Do you mean to tell me that after I went through all this humiliation
you do not want to try the sushi, the things I do for you Daria, the things
I do for you.</P>

<P>Daria: Its called getting even.</P>

<P>Waitress: What will you be having.</P>

<P>Chad: Three sushi, sashimi samplers please, with everything.</P>

<P>Daria: Please make sure its not moving.</P>

<P><B>The waitress gives Daria a strange look. After a while the sushi
arrives. Chad and Jane begin to eat and Daria is sitting still just staring
at her plate. She can even see the tentacles from the octopus.</B></P>

<P>Chad: Please try some Daria, just for me, you will like it, its really
delicious.</P>

<P><B>Daria picks up her chops sticks and tries to figure out how to hold
them and she is not very successful so she pokes the sushi with one of
the chops sticks, dips it in too much wasabi and tries to put it in her
mouth, and has that expression on her face of get me some water fast. So
after finally swallowing that piece of sushi she tries it without the wasabi
and has an expression on her face of this might be the finest Japanese
cuisine in town but I don’t like raw fish.</B></P>

<P>Chad: Its OK Daria you don’t have to eat it if you don’t want to, how
about some teriyaki chicken instead, the chef puts on a really good show.</P>

<P>Daria: That sounds much safer, thanks Chad for being so understanding,
I’m sorry about the sushi.</P>

<P><B>Chad asks the waitress to pack up their left over sushi.</B></P>

<P>Daria: Chad I would like to take mine home.</P>

<P>Chad: But you don’t like sushi.</P>

<P>Daria: I want to take it home to Quinn so she can try some.</P>

<P>Chad: Aren’t you a nice older sister.</P>

<P>Jane: Daria, does Quinn know what sushi is.</P>

<P>Daria: No and that’s the beauty of it.</P>

<P><B>Chad, Daria and Jane go over to the table where the chef is preparing
the teriyaki chicken. The chef starts swirling the knives around and Daria
starts to look kind of scared.</B></P>

<P>Daria: Are you sure this is safe Chad. I’m not really fond of having
body parts in my food.</P>

<P>Chad: Don’t worry these guys can do this in their sleep.</P>

<P>Daria: I guess I’ll just have to start living dangerously now.</P>

<P>Jane: At least the food is cooked, besides I’m having a blast watching
that chef do his thing.</P>

<P>Daria: Jane how about you trading places with me, that way you can watch
the chef more closely.</P>

<P>Jane: Gee Daria and I thought you were my best friend, and now you are
putting my life in danger.</P>

<P>Daria: Come on Jane, this is going to be fun.</P>

<P>Chad: Aren’t you two enjoying the show, the fire is next.</P>

<P>Daria: So now they are going to set us on fire.</P>

<P><B>Then the chef put some oil on the grill and fire appears and Daria
and Jane look really scared. </B></P>

<P>Daria: I didn’t know any meal could be this dangerous.</P>

<P><B>The chef serves them their food and they all eat with no problems.</B></P>

<P>Chad: I would like it very much if we could all go over to my house
now, I want to show you my basement, its really cool.</P>

<P>Daria: Ok, What’s so special about your basement.</P>

<P>Chad: I thought having a basement was important to teenagers in America,
that’s what I see in <I>That 70’s Show</I>.</P>

<P>Daria: I see you like to copy what you see on TV.</P>

<P>Chad: Since I don’t know very many people its one of the only ways I
have of figuring out what is considered cool.</P>

<P>Daria: Chad, regardless of what you may think, I think you are very
cool and a lot of fun to be around.</P>

<P>Jane: Yeah Chad, I really like hanging out with you, maybe you, Daria,
me and Tom can double date sometime.</P>

<P>Chad: I really like that idea, lets do it sometime.</P>

<P><B>After a short time on the road, they all arrive to Chad’s mansion.
The mansion has an enormous driveway a beautiful garden complete with gazebo.
The mansion itself is hugh, and is a combination of brick and dark mahogany
wood, it must have at least twenty bedrooms, it has an indoor and outdoor
swimming pool, tennis court and a stable for horses.</B></P>

<P>Daria: Are you a cousin of Prince Charles?</P>

<P>Chad: No, both my father and mother are very wealthy. My father also
has a house in England. I hope you like my home.</P>

<P>Jane: Its beautiful, so when do we get to check out your basement.</P>

<P>Chad: Yeah lets check it out.</P>

<P><B>Chad, Daria and Jane enter Chad’s home and they pass by his enormous
living room with high vaulted ceiling, and dining room that has one of
those long tables with many chairs and a beautiful flower arrangement on
the table. They then go down one flight of stairs to his magnificent basement
which has a small gym with wooden floor for Chad to roller blade, a music
room with a state of the art sound system, and screens to put slides and
movies while listening to music, and he also has a hobby room where he
develops the photos he takes at the cemetery and then makes surrational
images by combining them with photographs of other objects like the ones
Scott Mutter does for his calendars, yes even Chad’s taste in art is morbid.</B></P>

<P>Daria: Your basement definitely beats Eric Foreman’s basement in <I>That
70’s Show.</I></P>

<P>Chad: I’m glad you like it maybe we can rollerblade in my gym room sometime
or maybe we can all hang out at the cemetery and take photographs.</P>

<P>Jane: Yeah the cemetery is one of our favorite hangouts, we like to
go there when we get depressed.</P>

<P>Chad: I know that my taste is kind of morbid, let me show you my room
I’m sure you will like the art in there.</P>

<P>Daria: You wouldn’t happen to have your own guillotine would you? I
once asked my parents for one and they got me a microscope instead.</P>

<P>Chad: I once asked my father for an electric chair for when Vincent
comes to visit and he denied my request as well, but my room does have
other things that you may find disturbing so you won’t be disappointed.</P>

<P><B>They all go up two flights of stairs to Chad’s room which has double
doors and is enormous, 20 by 30 feet, it has a hugh king-size bed in the
center, beautiful mahogany wood night stands and dresser. On the walls
he has posters by Alan M Clark ( Alan M Clark is an artist who specializes
in horror pictures, he has done such works of arts like, Doctors, which
is a picture of someone or something laying on a table with many weird
people surrounding this victim) Chad also has several pictures by Salvador
Dali, and he many of the surrational images he had made from the photographs
he took at the cemetery up on his wall as well as a chair in the corner
with a styrofoam ax hanging over it. He also has four bookshelves with
all the books that Stephen King has ever written and all the novels Robin
Cooke has written as well along with many other books on other subjects
plus a whole set of encyclopedias on unexplained phenomenon and every episode
guide for the <I>Strange Files</I>.</B></P>

<P>Chad: When I first got that chair it had a real ax but my father wouldn’t
allow it so I have to go with a Styrofoam ax instead, how boring.</P>

<P>Jane: I think you would really like Daria’s room she even has padded
walls.</P>

<P>Chad: Daria, you mean pretending you’re insane makes you feel special
to.</P>

<P>Daria: No Chad, my room use to belong to a schizophrenic shut in before
my family and I moved there.</P>

<P>Chad: So you decided to keep the padded walls, have your parents threatened
to redecorate.</P>

<P>Daria: Yes they have on several occasions.</P>

<P>Chad: I once asked my father for padded walls but he said I was already
too strange and that I should consider getting more positive tastes or
he would make me go to a analyst at least once a week.</P>

<P>Daria: Well I think my parents already gave up on me, I like making
them suffer.</P>

<P>Chad: I really like the way you think Daria.</P>

<P>Daria: Thanks.</P>

<P><B>After visiting Chad’s home, Chad takes Jane and Daria back to their
houses and when Daria gets home she goes to where Quinn is and offers her
some of her left over sushi.</B></P>

<P>Daria: Hi Quinn, since you had such a bad morning I brought you some
sushi from Emiko's House Of Sushi to make it up to you.</P>

<P>Quinn: Who are you and what have you done with Daria? Is this a trick.</P>

<P>Daria: No I just want you to try some, they say its the best in town.</P>

<P>Quinn: Ok. (She tries a piece diped in wasabi) yum this is really good,
thanks Daria.</P>

<P>Daria: Just wondering, do you know what sushi is?</P>

<P>Quinn: Of course I do, sushi is raw fish prepared a special way served
over rice, Mathew and I always get some when we go out.</P>

<P>Daria: (Thinking) Damm.</P>

<P><B>The phone rings.</B></P>

<P>Daria: Hello this is Daria Morgendorffer.</P>

<P>Chad: Hi its me, Chad, I was wondering if we can go out dancing at this
club that features only disco music, I bet you must be one hell of a dancer.</P>

<P>Daria: (Thinking) Oh no, another one of those dates from the twilight
zone, can’t he just go to dinner and a movie like everyone else. (to Chad)
Sure Chad but I’m not a really good dancer.</P>

<P>Chad: Don’t worry I will show you a couple of really good moves and
maybe tomorow we can go horse back riding.</P>

<P>Daria: Sure and maybe next week we can go sky diving.</P>

<P>Chad: Thats a great idea, I'll make arrangements to hire a pilot to
fly us over some grassy field.</P>

<P><B>It's 7:00 PM and Chad comes over to pick up Daria, he even brings
her a beautiful bouquet of red roses and is wearing a stunning black suit.
Daria is wearing a pink dress and high heeled black sandles that Quinn
helped her select when they both went to an emergency trip to the mall
that afternoon, of course she promised to help Quinn with her homework
for the next month, which means she would pretty much have to do most of
Quinn's homework for her. Later that evening Chad and Daria are slow dancing.</B></P>

<P>Chad: Remember I&nbsp;once told you I've&nbsp;never kissed a girl. Well
I&nbsp;would really like to change that and only you can help me do that.</P>

<P>Daria: OK, I'll help you end those I&nbsp;have never kissed a girl days.</P>

<P><B>Chad holds her even closer as they slow dance and then he presses
his lips against hers and they give each other a very passionate first
kiss, one that no matter what happens later on in their lives, they will
never forget that kiss or the times they spent together.</B></P>

<P>The End</P>

<P>I would like to give special thanks to my best friend Maggie Avendano
for collaborating with me on the part of the story in which Daria, Jane
