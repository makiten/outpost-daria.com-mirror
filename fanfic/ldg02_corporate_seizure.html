<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria was headed to the public library to
continue her education there, since she was still suspended.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The wounds had been inflicted on areas that
were covered by clothing, so she didn't imagine having to face awkward
questions from her parental units. But there might be problems come her first
PE sessions after her suspension ended, although the continuing pain in her
fingers (she claimed to have tripped and accidentally bent her fingers back in
the fall) might allow her to skip PE.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane had also been suspended, but had also
gone to ground, which had limited Daria's options as to who she could discuss
these problems with, since Tom didn't know anything about any of the things she
had become aware of. Attempting to describe the situation would most likely
drive him away. The only people that left were Sandi and Quinn, who wouldn't
want to be seen hanging around Daria, and would probably drive Daria nuts with
their talk of fashion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Things were beginning to suck big time.</span></p>

voice. <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>, looking (and sounding) like
Stacy, was standing behind her, smiling, looking like the person she had
hollowed out and occupied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria frowned for a few seconds, then

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Quinn looked at the poster and said "I

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, unless someone like Daria ends up on

Sandi was looking, and saw Angela walking away with her hands possibly in the
'I have found another way that will make me very, very right and very, very
popular' position (which strangely seemed to resemble the sort of hand rubbing
villains are portrayed as doing)</span></p>

Nathan could do anything, Tiffany had turned the fire towards him. He tried to

was one of those long nose lighters, she had used her nail files under nail
scraper to open the valve on the top, then she had used the lighter to spark
the escaping gas.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span lang=EN-GB>Now
she lifted the tip of the lighter to burn through the 3mm rope that had been on
her wrists for the past two weeks. The nylon rope melted and ignited, she felt
immense pain, but it was about the same in intensity as the sores where the
rope had been cutting into her skin, and nothing next to the blood rushing back
into her hands. Her wrists were finally loose, that left her elbows, which were
too tightly bound for her to just shrug off, she looked at the raging fires,
those would burn off skin and muscle before freeing her elbows, she needed to
get a smaller flame in there.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span lang=EN-GB>She
looked at her stuff which had been thrown into a corner, she walked over there,

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I then had to pick apart the beam with my
nail file, that took for fuckin' ever, good thing the fires didn't have the
fuel to ignite the structure. And then I saw the sores on my arms which were
pretty deep, I decided I didn't want anyone to see them and start asking
questions, so I pulled all the money out of my account and I got a street
surgeon to disguise the wounds. I returned home, telling my parents I had run
off because school was getting to me. They bought it, but I couldn't find the
number for the watchers council, so I continued to work on my own. Then I was
activated, I guessed that meant another slayer got KIA'd. Then I was found by
Faith and <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place>,
they told me that <a

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yes, I'm surprised the people who made the
first vampire slayer didn't think of that," said Giles, he then continued "you were
very lucky with the street surgeon, a lot of them would have ended up
increasing the damage."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I know, I just wanted any reminders gone,"
said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What about the mental reminders,
nightmares, anxiety attacks, has anything like that presented?" asked Giles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Used to, but those seem to have gotten
better," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Hmm ... you're talking at normal speed now
without the magic, Faith said she had <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Willow</st1:place></st1:City>
speed your time frame?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany looked down at the floor, she then
brought up the words "I was doing this drug I found that slows the brain while
allowing me to fight, hence the reduced nightmares and anxiety attacks."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Do you feel you can come off that now?"
asked Giles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I can try, I have been unable to replenish
my supplies in the past couple of days, but I think I can come off those now,"
said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You can always get help if you feel you
need it, there are plenty of institutions within our theatre of war that offer
counselling and preserve client anonymity," said Giles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I know," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right, well, now there's the question of
what to do with you, do you feel up to returning to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
w:st="on">Lawndale</st1:City></st1:place>?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I don't know ... oh, crap, my parents, I've
disappeared again, what do I tell them?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Oh, they think you're helping the FBI with
something you supposedly witnessed when you were missing, and that you won't be
able to tell them about it, but feel free to make something up for them if you
feel you have to."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Thanks ... I really made a mess in <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Lawndale</st1:City></st1:place>, my friends,
Quinn and Sandi, they're mad at me for interrogating Quinn's sister," said
Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yes, Faith mentioned that, the vampire you
were after is her friend, <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Jane
  Lane</st1:address></st1:Street>?" asked Giles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yes, she was Daria's friend, Daria can't
accept that Jane is dead, and that the thing that replaced her is some vicious
killer ... it's not Daria's fault, I should have left her alone and concentrated
on other vamps ... speaking of, I should return to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
w:st="on">Lawndale</st1:place></st1:City> soon," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Are you sure you're up to it?" asked
Giles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No ... but I won't make things better by
hiding out over here, I could probably use a watcher though, I've missed the
input," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Very well then, I have someone who has
originated from the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and he is now qualified to work as a
watcher," said Giles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"And now we're on our way back to Lawndale,
where the courageous Faith and Tiffany faced off against impossible odds to save
the planet from the self destructing old one." said Andrew with irritating
enthusiasm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Where the brave Tiffany had to use her
wits to escape a nest of cruel vampires-" started Andrew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Only to be interrupted by Tiffany saying
"Yeah, a little louder, I don't think the passengers right at the back can hear
you blab my confidence away."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Andrew looked at her infuriated face with a
deep sense of shame.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Errm ... sorry," he finally said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany pressed her head back into her seat
and said "just out of curiosity, what knowledge is needed to qualify you to be
a watcher anyway?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Well ... Okay, that was stupid of me just
now, but I have proven myself capable of being a watcher," replied Andrew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right, just try to cut back on the
melodrama, 'sides, Daria helped us save the world. I just hope she can tolerate
my presence when we get back. have you been made aware of what happened prior
to me and Faith receiving the equipment from <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place>?" asked Tiffany, she then added "Yes
or no only," as he opened his mouth to speak.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yes," he finally said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I was obsessed with Jane for some reason,
and I got mad at Daria for her interference. Doesn't help that I had been
medicating myself with those pills. Oh, that reminds me, now I'm off the meds,
if I'm asleep when we land, do not touch me, I might break your arm before I'm
awake enough to realise I'm not in that nest," she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right," said Andrew, he looked out the
window and saw it getting dark.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane entered the apartment and headed for
the kitchen, she glanced around the apartment, seeing those creepy dolls with
the blindfolds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It turned out that the entire north side of
this block of apartments was occupied by vampires. Some were gangsters (having
great strength and a certain moral flexibility being advantages in that field
of work). Some were 'blood whores', feeding off people who paid for the
experience (getting paid for what you do and enjoy anyway is understandably
attractive). And others had more legitimate jobs on the night shift (Dayshift
for those working on the <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New York</st1:place></st1:State>
underground). She worked at a butchers mostly receiving goods, shelf stacking,
cleaning. Part of her pay was in animal blood, of which she had a batch now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She put it in the fridge and got an older
tub out and poured it into a mug. She added a load of cinnamon to it, her
latest experiment to see if she could get a better taste, and stuck it in the
microwave for 5 minutes low power.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She leant against the kitchen counter and
looked in the direction of her roommate's room, where her roommate was probably
sleeping under a now bloodless corpse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Her thing seemed to be pulling a man, and
feeding off him while he fucked her, and not revealing her name.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She had asked the girls name numerous times
since she had moved in, but had received insane rambling singsong ... gibberish
for an answer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Insane girl's half of the rent came from
her victim's wallets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Hopefully the IRS won't do them for failing

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Occasionally, one of the vamps will kill
the landlord, happened every 3 weeks apparently. They'd also cook the books so
that the ones that were recorded as having been behind on payments were
instantly ahead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane was barely tolerated by the other
vamps, her attitude towards taking lives made them think she was some sort of
traitor, or insane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The unnamed girl started talking to her
latest victim.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>'I'm insane???' Jane thought sarcastically.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She wondered how Daria was doing without
her, their falling out over the Tom situation had demonstrated Daria's
dependence on Jane for emotional support, and now Jane was on the run because
of some vigilante vampire hunter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She had told Jane to go somewhere SHE
wouldn't think of ... She was expecting Tiffany to torture her for answers. ... She
had to find out the situation, but ... nah, no way Tiffany would have access to
call tracing equipment ... or if she did, she'd use it for a paperweight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She picked up the phone and dialled the
number.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Mystic pound, for all your stray demon

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Hey Amiga," said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Hi, how've you been?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, got a north facing apartment, got a
job, butchers, lots of free blood, and I got an insane vamp for a roommate who
won't tell me her name, you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Well, my suspension's nearly over, I'll be
back at school tomorrow. Some really weird shit happened after you left,
Tiffany came after me looking for you, using shocks and cuts, then <st1:place
w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place> had a rather unpleasant chat about a perceived
assassination attempt. Now she's lost most of her powers, still has enhanced
strength, but she can't function in this world, and after what she did to me,
I'm thinking of introducing her to hard narcotics and pimping her off for about
five bucks a shag," Daria said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Ouch, what did she do to you?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Tenderised me, then she stretched my back
out, almost to failure point. I just hope she catches something really nasty
and dies a slow torturous death," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"And you're back at school tomorrow?" asked
Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yep, I'm just dreading facing Morris alone,"
said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Double Ouch ... On the plus side, I saw
American Pop Idol 2 was going to be held at your school. Maybe Kevin and
Brittany will enter and get a new one ripped out of their ego by Cowel and that
green guy, assuming he's as mean," said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria laughed and said "Yeah, that might
make me feel better, Emphasise the might though."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"How about the Fashion Club? Quinn or Sandi
crying, or Sta- Illyria or Tiffany turning Cowel into hamburger meat? Mayhem,
mayhem, mayhem? Anyway, I'll call again tomorrow," said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, bye," said Daria, then Jane hung up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria was glad that Jane was okay, it had
been two weeks since Jane had left, and she had been seriously worried for her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane hadn't revealed her location, and
Daria thought that prudent, even though she had the impression that the slayers
had lost interest in Jane, it seemed a bad idea to tempt fate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The plane pulled into the terminal, and the

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Except Andrew and Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany was asleep, and her advice was

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>But if he didn't wake her soon, one of the

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He braced himself and tapped the back of

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Any nightmares?" he asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No actually, maybe those pills had served
a useful purpose after all," they got their stuff and disembarked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria entered the kitchen looking a little
spacey.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Daria? You look awful!" said Helen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What?" asked Daria, before blinking, she
then headed to the toaster to make herself some pop tarts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Daria, you look like you've been up all
night, what were you doing?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria turned to Helen again, shook her
head, said "What?" before finally returning to her task of making breakfast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Quinn entered the room and said "'morning
Daria, ready for your first day back?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria blinked at her a few times and said
"What?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Ah," said Quinn, before checking the
kettle, switching it on, and loading a cup with 6 spoonfuls of Nescafe dilithium
residue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Um, Quinn honey? Isn't that a touch
excessive?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Quinn looked at Daria and said "actually,
this not might be enough," before adding two more spoonfuls.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria responded to the toaster ejecting the
pop tarts three seconds after the event.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Soon as the kettle switched off, Quinn
poured the water into the cup, stirred it a few times, and managed to get the
cup to Daria's lips just before she got the pop tart there. Hopefully the lack
of food in front would get the caffeine where it's needed in about two seconds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria shuddered, and her mind was at
military.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Whoa, thanks Quinn." said Daria, she then
took the cup from Quinn and consumed the coffee and the pop tart as Helen asked
"You ready to return to school?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I suppose." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You're not going to trash the library or
something else, are you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"First off, that was Jane, and she only did
that accidentally while trying to defend herself," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"If that's the story you would like to
maintain-" started Helen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>But Daria interrupted with "Besides, the
amount of effort needed to shift one of those book cases ... "</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Helen thought about it and said "Oh yeah ...
Okay, fair enough."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You get any sleep at all last night
Daria?" asked Quinn as they walked to school.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, I slept one out of five seconds,"
said Daria "stupid post traumatic stress disorder."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You might think about getting help,"
suggested Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Thought about it, rejected it, on account
that the second I start talking about Illyria possessing Stacy and abducting me
to another dimension, slowing time, and the fact Tiffany was interrogating me
in pursuit of a vampire, I'll start getting treated for schizophrenia," said
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Oh, right ... You talk to Jane at all?"
asked Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, talked to her last night. She's
fine, got a crazy vampire roommate, a job at a butchers, north facing apartment,
so no direct sunlight ever," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Unless Al Qaeda hit her city with one of
those missing suitcase nukes," said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria looked at her and asked "Have you
been watching the history channel?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"This isn't history, this is the present, I
was watching that survival program that the SAS guy was doing," said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Still a documentary, you're not worried
about it making you unpopular?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Not if people don't find out ab- ... " Quinn
froze, looking worried.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Relax, not gonna blackmail you, not in the
mood ... wonder what that's about?" said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Marcus Hamilton appeared beside them
"Morgendorffer and Morgendorffer, I see you're headed off to school, so I'll
make this quick. Daria, the crystal you used to help you protect your fair
town, is property of Wolfram and Hart, I have been asked to retrieve it."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Erm ... <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>'s
come at me again, the crystal is the only advantage I have over her," said
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Well, if that's the way you feel on the
matter, I'm sure we can come to some sort of arrangement," said Marcus as he
circled around to Daria's side.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He then grabbed Daria by her throat and
lifted her about 30cm into the air without any tell whatsoever, and as Daria
struggled to get his hand off her, he retrieved the crystal from her pocket. He
then said "<st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place> is a minor irritation
compared to what my firm will do if you try to interfere with our operations
again. You should have returned the crystal immediately, I think under the
circumstances I was being Very polite. That will not happen in future, is that
understood?" he asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria tried to say yes, but couldn't, she
nodded as far as she could.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Excellent, I'll let you get back to what
you were doing then," he then dropped Daria on her ass and disappeared
(possibly using the crystal rather than any other magic)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Quinn helped Daria to her feet as she
coughed and recovered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You okay Daria?" asked Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Fine ... next time I'm on E-bay, I'll start
looking for a non-metallic gun. I've really had it up to here with everyone
else being able to attack me at will," said Daria, as she rubbed her throat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As Daria approached the school, she saw two
people she didn't want to see.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Tiffany's back," commented Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"She was absent?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"For the duration of your suspension," said
Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"And <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>?"
asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Showed up every day, looking like Stacy. She
kept her distance from Sandi and me, but I still wish she would just disappear
for good," said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany approached them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What does she want?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany stopped one point five metres from
them, standing with her mouth slightly open as if she was trying to come up
with something to say.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany finally said "That stuff I did to
you that night, I shouldn't have. I'm sorry I did that. I'm not going to ask
you to forgive me for it, and I won't do anything like that again ... I'll be
gone now ... as far as my required presence at school will allow ... " she then
headed into school.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria and Quinn looked at each other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"At least she was contrite," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"She was talking faster, without moving
like a character on fast forward," said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"So when she tortured me, she may not have
been firing in all cylinders?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I suppose," said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That's not getting her off," said Daria,
before also heading into school.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>A few seconds later, Quinn followed.</span></p>

that holding dimension, since he was one of those people that Angel felt
deserved that kind of thing, but then, he also felt Knox could to (Gunn had
brought him along especially for this after they had found out he had intended
to infect Winifred with Illyria, and while someone else was still dead from

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Wesley, we've been in evil inc. for the

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Fred, this is different, your direct

Andrew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Unusual, everyone was surprised to hear my
real voice. Sandi, Quinn, and Daria look at me like I'm something they wiped
off their ass, and <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place> had the nerve to
attempt to use Stacy's form to convince me we're friends," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Illyria, the ancient god king of the

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Andrew thought about it, then said "no,"

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This was not the sort of thing that brought

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She opened her eyes and looked around.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She was in a cage, it was gloss white
(possibly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powder_coating">powder coated</a>
carbon steel), twenty millimetre bars spaced fifteen centimetres apart, cage
measuring zero point six metres cubed. The floor was made of what looked like plain
steel sheet, the floor was slightly concave (pyramid like) with a hole in the
centre, she couldn't see the floor through it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There were other cages, same dimensions,
all on casters, like she figured hers was. Underneath the centre of the cages
there was some sort of gutter leading to a small plastic jar, she guessed for
collecting urine samples from their occupants. The room was well lit,
breezeblock wall painted white, grey painted floor with yellow lines marking a
passage way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The lids of the cages she could see had a
padlock on the roof connecting two rings together, it looked too strong for
her, but she wasn't waiting for some guards to show up if she didn't have to. She
got on her back and pressed her feet against the ceiling of her cage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Well, Tiffany's back, she apologised for

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"So she was abducted from a motor vehicle ...

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You mean the kind of help, like, say, a

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Jane isn't interested in getting back at

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Then, deciding the best way to get them to

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Faith nodded and said "well that was a

experiencing an anxiety attack (she had barely avoided taking peoples heads off
for bumping into her or otherwise startling her just after she returned home
from that vampire nest), waking up in a cage slightly bigger than her bedside
unit with no clothes on should surely have her futilely struggling to escape.
But she was instead feeling irritation, and was patiently waiting to gather
information prior to attempting an escape.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Probably the sedatives, they have probably
yet to fully clear out of her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She also recognised that waiting too long
could cause the conditions necessary for a successful escape to expire, they
could close off escape routes, she could be injured in such a way that reduces
her mobility or her senses. Tiffany was not into gambling, and she was being
forced to by her captivity, failure to initiate an escape at the correct time
would most likely result in her death. It was like being forced to walk across
a minefield without so much as a bayonet and being forbidden from using any
means of detecting the mines other than stepping on them. You don't walk,
you're dead, your only hope is to take an otherwise insane risk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>And then there was the possibility that
there was no way to escape, no opportunity would arise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>A brunette woman in a grey striped business
suit with a scar circling her neck and a skinny brunette woman in a white lab
coat and glasses walked into view, accompanied by two men in SAS costumes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Fred, meet Tiffany Blum Deckler, don't let
her appearance fool you, Girl's not entirely human."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>'Fred' knelt in front of the cage and
looked in, asking "what is it you want me to do with her?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Find the source of her strength, find a
way to neutralise it with a chemical, mystical, or biological agent that can be
placed in water, food, whatever," said the woman in the grey suit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Fred? ... <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
w:st="on">Willow</st1:place></st1:City> called her friend Fred ... Tiffany
mentally slapped her forehead and thought 'of course, Wolfram and Hart!!!
Hopefully Fred will help me escape'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right, I'm going to need a moment to think
about how to proceed here. How did you come across her?" said Fred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We captured her. She is one of a group of
people who have been causing our firm a lot of trouble lately," said the woman
in grey, before squatting in front of the cage and saying "but now you are
going to help us solve the problems your group has created, aren't you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany didn't respond, she wasn't going to
escape on begging or insulting, just like last time, she was going to have to
await an opportunity to escape, and take it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"The mechanic found this when he lifted the
car overhead," said Andrew as he handed Daria the item.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You know, if you had contacted the police,
you might have some answers by now," said Daria as she turned the item over in
her hands.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The item had what looked like skateboard
wheels, some motors, a cylinder, and a battery pack. There were two probes
sticking out the front, and the hollow drill that had been used to deliver the
sedative to the car. There was also an array of cameras.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria turned it upside down and mouthed
"Any radiation?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I haven't checked," said Andrew, he then
continued "All I know is how I found it, and the mechanic said the cars
electronics were fried. Why did you mouth the question, Daria?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No reason," she said, then she asked "got
a stainless steel box big enough to enclose this thing?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane was headed home after a night of
taking goods for the butchers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She had just gotten on the tube when she
felt something burn her back. "Arrgh," she turned to see a South American girl
dressed in a blue overall, purple jumper, holding a wooden cross with a
sharpened base. She turned the cross so the point came out between the middle
and ring fingers. Jane deflected the weapon as she made to stab Jane with it. She
kicked the girl's right knee away from her, the girl kicked Jane back with her
left foot, Jane bounced off some seats and landed head first on the opposite
row, the girl was coming at her again. Jane kicked the girl back and flipped
backwards, landing in a fighting pose, she then pulled a <a
href="http://world.guns.ru/smg/smg22-e.htm">MAC 10</a>, the girl froze, being
too far away to reach the weapon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane waved her back and as the girl
complied, Jane got to her bag of blood tubs, she picked that up and waited for
the train to stop.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The doors opened, Jane waited a little
more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Then she jumped out just as the doors were
closing, waiting until the train was clear before stowing her weapon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"So, another Vampire clich&eacute; rings true,
and, I'm going to have to move again, aren't I?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"This looks like an expensive piece of kit,
are there any large corporate entities your organisation have annoyed?" asked
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Faith, Andrew, and <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place> looked at each other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, what about Tiffany, she make any
long term enemies?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>After breaking into the high school science
lab, they had established that the device was not emitting any RF radiation, so
they felt safe to talk around it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"There's Jane," said Faith.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"She has no interest in Tiffany, and if she
did, Tiffany would have stayed in the car, but would have lost her mind. Which
would be decorating the cars interior about now, and I haven't seen anything
that will convince me she's capable of killing someone," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Vampires are capable of incredible sadism,"
said Faith.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I can guarantee you that the vampire
version of a person is nothing like the person they were," said <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Willow</st1:place></st1:City>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria turned to them "Have you guys ever
encountered a vampire?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Faith started counting off fingers while <st1:City
w:st="on">Willow</st1:City> shrugged, Faith and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
w:st="on">Willow</st1:place></st1:City> then, in unison, said "a lot."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right, because Jane was exactly as I had
always known her, only now her teeth are occasionally pointy. If she was as
mean as you say she is supposed to be, there are a bunch of people that would
have turned up dead and bloodless by now," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You see her all the time?" asked Faith.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No ... look, what you're saying about her,
as far as I can tell doesn't track ... ... Hang on, Illyria found her refusal to
kill unusual, said something about her having a soul," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"WHAT???" shouted Faith.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria shook her head and turned back to the
device, she then said "I'm gonna open this thing up, maybe there will be
something inside that will-"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Faith interrupted Daria saying "ARE YOU
TELLING ME JANE HAS A SOUL?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria looked up surprised "well, yes, I am
... Why, what's with the dramatics?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Faith walked back to her original position
waving her arms in frustration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria turned to Andrew and <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place> and asked "well?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Vampires with souls, tend to be good,
those without tend to be evil. We only knew of two with souls, and, if you're
right, we now know of three," said <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Willow</st1:place></st1:City>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria looked between them, then asked "does
that mean, that if I had told one of you of this fact, that JANE COULD HAVE
STAYED HERE AND GOTTEN ON WITH HER LIFE INSTEAD OF HAVING TO GO ON THE RUN?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Faith turned to her, then asked "got anything
on that device?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Not yet, I'm gonna open it up, but first I
want to get an X-ray of it, make sure there are no explosives. I'll have to
make an X-ray tube-" started Daria, but Willow said "No need, excuse me." She
stepped in around Daria and closed her eyes as if in meditation, she then said
"no explosives."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria looked at <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
w:st="on">Willow</st1:place></st1:City> fro a couple of seconds and said "Okay
then," and then opened the device.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As the chassis came off, Daria put on a
pair of gloves and started removing the circuit boards.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"All these devices look store bought, I'm
gonna fume it for prints, but those won't be of use unless we can access <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Fingerprint_Identification_System">AFIS</a>,"
said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Ooh, that's my job," Willow said, as she
set up her laptop and hooked it up to her cell phone while Daria moved the
parts to the fume box.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Faith leaned close to willow and asked
"AFIS?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Automated Fingerprint Identification
System," replied <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Willow</st1:place></st1:City>,
to which Faith Whispered "Ah."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"So, this is my job," said Winifred, as she
prepared to carry out her first series of tests.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The first series of tests were going to be
fluid and tissue samples. Hopefully this would buy her enough time to figure
out how to get Tiffany out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She suspected if it was just Lilah and the
suits, she could make stuff up, but there was also John Foley, her assistant. She
figured the guy knew his science, and would be able to spot if she was
attempting to bullshit them, so she would have to at least take samples and
perform the appropriate experiments while plotting Tiffany's escape.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She didn't know if Lilah knew she knew, but
Winifred knew good and well Tiffany was a vampire slayer. <st1:City w:st="on">Willow</st1:City>
had told her about Tiffany in the infirmary at the LA branch ... would <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Willow</st1:place></st1:City> now think SHE had
gone dark side now? Obviously the watchers council no longer trusted them, that
had become apparent when Andrew had come to pick up Dana, but now <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place> would be extra
suspicious of her from now on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The cage was wheeled in by two goons. They
then closed the door to the lab, one of them produced the key for the padlock,
the other pulled a tazer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The guy opening the door glanced at the guy
with the tazer, before pulling the lid open.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany stood up slowly, knowing now was
not the time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Where do you want her?" he asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"On this table," she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Winifred glanced at the window overlooking
the lab, Lilah and a couple of other suits were standing there. Winifred didn't
know how long she could go without carrying out a destructive test on Tiffany,
but if she acted before she had a plan of action, she'll most likely get
herself killed without Tiffany getting any less trapped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany stepped out of the cage and sat on
the bed, she placed her limbs in the restraints, Winifred was the obvious
candidate to strap her down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Wrists, elbows, shoulders, neck (brace),
waist, knees, and ankle straps were applied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, I'll need to take a number of fluid
and tissue samples. I'll be as gentle as I can," she said, before picking up a
double ended needle and an evacuated tube.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"A friend of mine knows another girl called
Fred, perhaps you know of her. There can't be that many in a single corporation,"
said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Your friend's name Willow Rosenberg?" she
said as she wiped the extraction site with ethanol and inserted the needle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Why, yes it is," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Oh, then I'm that same Fred," she said, as
she drew the blood sample.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I don't suppose there's any chance I can

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No, sorry, they tend to do worse than fire

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria said "Okay ... " then she got up and
headed for the store room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She then returned with a spray bottle of Luminal
and a cotton bud saying "this is a bit of a long shot, but I'm not sure what
else to try right now," she sprayed each board with it, and watched for any
florescence (the main lights were off anyway so they don't draw too much
attention)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Here we go," she swabbed the bright spot </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"But don't we need a special ... DNA thingy

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yep, it's in the security room, <st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The last two tissue extractions had been
bone marrow extractions, which couldn't have been done under anaesthesia
because it could have interfered with the tests. She would perform the relevant
experiments, but she would do them very slowly, and, when she had an idea how
to get Tiffany out, prepare the devices she would need.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Then there was the question of how far
Tiffany would trust her, after the pain she had caused her. Tiffany held down
her expressions of pain, but had shown serious distress, and it was Winifred
who had caused it. That sat very uncomfortably with her, then there was the
fact that Tiffany was a slayer, one of the good guys ... yeah, like that's any
different from how it would be if she were just a random stranger picked off
the street.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>On the plus side, her being a slayer meant
that Tiffany could bring something to the escape. All Winifred had to do was to
make Tiffany Tazer proof, and give her the means to cut through the doors. She
suddenly had an Idea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"It just occurred to me, it might be useful
to get an ova from her, John, could you get the fertility kit?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She should have the first escape aid ready
by the next time she would see Tiffany, but in order to enable Tiffany to use
it, she would have to carry out a procedure that would A: give her an excuse to
have her hands on Tiffany's crotch, and B: give her an excuse to lubricate it
so the escape aid could be inserted in no time flat, that would mean doing a
procedure that would ... suddenly Winifred wasn't feeling so clever, since sexual
assaults tend to be a special kind of torture, this would have some seriously
persistent consequences.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This wasn't even following orders (as if
that was ever an excuse), this procedure was on her own initiative, she felt
like some kind of rapist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Rape was perceived as an act of theft at one
time (and still is in some places), of course, that was where women were
thought of as property, not people, but she was going to steal an ova from
Tiffany, indecently assaulting her, in full view and at the pleasure of the
forces of evil, any more symbolism, and the act would develop a noticeable
gravity well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>But Tiffany did as she knew they obviously
wanted her to do, she sat on the table (the bottom half of which was removed to
improve access) and laid back, placing her legs in the stirrups, exposing and
slightly spreading her slit in front of the evil Lawyers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany focused on something on the ceiling
at Winifred went to work, strapping her down, and then rubbing some sort of lubricant
into her genitals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It had taken some effort to force herself
to allow herself to be strapped down in this manner, it was obvious they were
going to do something to her genitals. She doubted there would be any
scientific value to them raping her, but having them poking around inside her
genitals, possibly obtaining a tissue sample from there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They could even be planning to impregnate
her with a demon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Actually that last one makes no sense ... But
then Tiffany wasn't a scientist, so she didn't know what they wanted to do with
her, only that it could end with something scaly and spiny slicing her cervix
and vagina into red tagliatelli as it leaves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>'Yeah, thanks brain, that makes me feel
much better'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Something slid into her and opened her up,
letting air into her vagina, Tiffany ignored it, like she would ignore an itch
until she was alone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Something slid through her cervix into her
uterus, making her think once again of the possibility of being impregnated
with a demon of some description. She ignored the activity and her fear to the
best of her ability, even when she felt air being sucked in around the needle '-nothing's
happening, nothing's happening, nothing's happening, nothing's happening-' she
thought over and over as the equipment was removed, then something slid in
underneath the speculum as it was removed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>'-nothing's happening, nothing's happening,
nothing's happening-'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, we're done for now," said Winifred,
as she started undoing the restraints, while Tiffany puzzled over the object that
was still in her vagina "If I can't find the ova, we'll give her an oestrogen
shot and try again later."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany's first instinct was to remove the
item to see what it was, but if Winifred had placed it there, either for an
experiment or to help her, or maybe she just forgot to remove it ... no, that
last one makes no sense, however absent minded Winifred might appear, but the
first two. Either case, she figured she shouldn't remove it in view of the bad
guys.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The last of the restraints were undone and
Tiffany sat up. She looked at Winifred and the goons for a second, for any
hint, but she saw none, so she got back in the cage, electing to wait until she
was alone before taking a look at the item.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>That solved the first problem, but there
was still the fact that the goons always closed this big metal door behind
them, when they brought Tiffany in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The door was a sliding door, moved by hand
and secured by a single bolt 20cm into the wall electromechanically by a card
swipe system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Now, this was getting into territory where
her involvement would become overt. She had to destroy that locking mechanism,
and it would have to happen after the cage opened. She needed Tiffany to be out
of the cage first, but it would have to happen shortly after that. She couldn't
plausibly delay getting Tiffany restrained for the next round of experiments
for more than 15 seconds, at the most. That meant she would have to command the
device herself, remotely or manually.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It would also help if she could get Tiffany
a thermal lance, it wouldn't need too much oxygen, just enough for her to cut
through two locks before getting to an emergency exit, but that seemed
unworkable. She would have to supply Tiffany with some explosives and delay or
remote Fuzes, she could make those, or she could steal them, but either option
would be difficult to pull off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There was another option.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane finished her creation. It looked like
a short mean looking creature with spiny arms and legs, and huge fuck off

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Hi Daria, your Mom gave me your cell phone

said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, I'm actually headed to <st1:State

Tiffany got captured by Wolfram and Hart," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Great, then I can return to <st1:City

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What? Why? I mean ... You got Stockholm

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Apparently if she knows you have a soul,

Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Watcher?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"The watchers are the slayers command and

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The guards entered the storage room again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany was pretty sure she was the only
thing in the room right now for anyone to come and get.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She had done as the instructions had said,
and had memorised the map, and was concealing the equipment underneath her leg,
as soon as they open the cage, her escape attempt would begin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Assuming Winifred wasn't just fucking with
her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This was a wonderful time for such a
possibility to occur to her, Winifred had given her something that could as
easily be a placebo as real, if it didn't work, the escape would end in about a
second flat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Or it could be real and the map fake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The guards arrived at her location and
started wheeling her to the lab.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She didn't know what she would do if
Winifred was just playing with her ... except kill Winifred, that would be the
obvious priority, but other than that ...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She had to trust her, everyone kept saying
that Angel's group could no longer be trusted, but Tiffany really had no choice
other than to trust Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Winifred had done some analyzing, but she
had also been making explosive devices and escape aids.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The explosive devices consisted of one
linear <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaped_charge">shaped charge</a>
(using lead instead of copper because lead foil was all she could find) powered
by RDX with a thimbleful of benzene, detonated by a packet of lead azide at the
back, ignited by an exposed bulb filament, fuzed to a microphone. It would
initiate the device when she set off her rape alarm and threw it at it, it had
been calibrated to 65Db for 100ms, the alarm would chuck out over 100Db for a
lot longer than that. The device would (hopefully, as this was the biggest
beaker she could find) sever the bolt that held the door closed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>In addition to the door opener, she had
rigged two AP/sugar smoke bombs. These were placed next to the door opener (but
would not obstruct the lead stream) where the compression wave would be intense
enough to detonate the AP, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANFO">ANFO</a>.
This would produce a slower wave, so she (and Tiffany) at their distance,
shouldn't be in danger from the blast overpressure, and the glass from the door
opener would be pulverised to the consistency of minced garlic, so provided
neither of them looked at it, shrapnel should not be a problem. The glass from
the smoke bombs on the other hand, would be in bigger pieces, but would be
directed away from Winifred by the door opener, or slowed down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Winifred was one of those people who had
sent in emails to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Cook">Norman
cook</a> guessing the precise location, composition, and size of explosive
charge in each of the blasts in the Gangster tripping video.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As for the rest of Tiffany's escape, she
had made 3 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_lance">thermal lances</a>,
these consisted of a nozzle of rolled up magnesium foil stuck down the throat
of a 500ml conical flask filled with AP and containing a smaller vessel filled
with sulphuric acid. The acid would liberate a large volume of oxygen from the
AP, there was also a pyrotechnic mix that would ignite the magnesium, this
would create a really hot oxygen jet that could cut concrete if needed, and
some lead azide to set everything off, all this activated by a static line
going down the magnesium nozzle to the lead azide charge. She would have to
instruct Tiffany on how to use these, and do it pretty damn quick.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She had also obtained a respirator, in case
they try to sedate her with gas on the way out, and a big syringe filled with
adrenaline and stims in case they shot tranq darts at her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As for her own survival ... Winifred
shrugged, she would be located and sucked out of this dimension by the SPs, and
go through the same shit Lindsey went through.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She hadn't gone through anything like that,
not on Pylea, not when <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place> had her. She
could barely hold on when Illyria had her, and what she was about to endure was
going to be something like a thousand times worse, lasting possibly infinity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She was just going to have to avoid thinking
about it until it was too late, that's all she was going to have to do, and
hope anyone looking for her was bright enough to figure out what she would have
done to enable them to locate her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The door opened and the cage was wheeled
in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We're going to be using the MRI now, I
want to get a picture of how her muscles work, what they consume," said
Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They nodded and closed the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Winifred got the rape alarm ready, she
figured she might have to throw it at the charge to get it close enough. She
watched out for any sign that they were reading any tells she might have,
remaining still, focusing on looking calm as the goons prepared to open the
cage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Winifred thought about what would happen if
the fuze failed, it would be obvious she was up to something, they wouldn't
know what, just that she was acting bizarrely, at the least, they might think
she was creating a diversion for Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Would that give her the freedom to manually
cook off the detonating charge with that book of matches in her pocket?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The lid was unlocked and pulled open.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Winifred pulled the alarm from her pocket,
the static line wrapped around her middle finger, she shot put it towards the
beakers and dropped to the floor as she felt the line pull on her finger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The noise filled the air, and suddenly
there was a flash and a large quantity of smoke. Winifred felt her skeleton jar
at the same time, she also noticed the floor now looked suspiciously like the
ceiling and felt a smooth flat surface sliding against her back, and realised
she had been knocked over by the blast. She slid to a stop near the MRI, and
got up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The alarm smashed into the wall underneath
the observation window, having been chucked over there by the compression wave,
which had also detonated the smoke charges. She ran to the cage which had been
shielded from the blast by the table in the middle of the room. The guards had
been slammed against the wall, but they had quickly recovered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany jumped out of her cage. She
couldn't propel it into one of the goons because they were within 120</span><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Symbol;mso-ascii-font-family:"Times New Roman";

lang=EN-GB> of each other, on the latch side of the cage, the lid would
obstruct her trajectory. She had to engage them directly, the first one went
down as Tiffany smacked him in the chest, then in his face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The second guy shot his tazer at her, but
found it was not doing anything, even though he clearly remembered checking the
batteries. Tiffany grabbed him and shoved his face into her knee.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"This way Tiffany," said Winifred, waving
her into the smoke, and leading her to the cupboard near the door, she grabbed
the respirator saying "put this on."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As Tiffany complied, she grabbed the
syringe "this is a stimulant: They hit you with a dart, take it," she suddenly
realised she hadn't thought about how she was supposed to carry it and fight,
she had tied a ribbon around the thermal lances which would act as a sling, but
had done nothing for the syringe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She took off her lab coat and handed it to Tiffany,
putting the syringe on the pocket, she then grabbed the thermal lances "these
will cut through steel, pull the string, press the nozzle against the door. Sorry
I don't have a visor for you, you'll just have to look out the corner of your
eye or something," she then pushed at the door, it moved "you memorised the map
I gave you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yes," said Tiffany as she got the lab coat
on and grabbed the thermal lances.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Good, get moving," she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"And you?" asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I'm on it, just go," said Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right, thanks," Tiffany said, before
running off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Winifred decided to at least attempt to
escape, but suddenly notices a swirling light overhead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She sat back down and shrugged saying "ah,

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Andrews's phone rang "hello?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Danny here, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
w:st="on">Tracy</st1:City></st1:place> just called, it seems an Asian girl in
nothing but a lab coat and a Respirator just broke out of Wolfram and Hart. She's
running at the kind of speed that suggests enhanced strength. It might be your
missing slayer."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Thanks," said Andrew, he then told the
others what had just happened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They were well into <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
w:st="on">New York</st1:place></st1:State> now, maybe they wouldn't have to go
up against the forces of Wolfram and Hart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany removed the respirator and stuffed
it into one of the lab coat pockets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The coat wasn't really done up, it was
flying behind her as she ran along the streets of wherever the fuck this was,
trying to get as much distance as possible between her and the evil law firm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She ducked into an alley and scaled a
drainpipe to the roof of a block of apartments, she then started leaping from
roof to roof, and finally stopped on the 24<sup>th</sup> roof.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She ripped the roof access door off its
hinges and entered the building, setting it against the frame as she entered. She
then picked the tazer darts out of her skin and closed the lab coat around her,
considering her next move.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Fred had really come through for her, she
had provided a skin ointment that made the first 3 mm of skin highly conductive
(oddly enough, the nervous system in the affected skin still functioned),
creating a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage">faraday birthday
suit</a>, then she had to use one of those flasks to cut a door. She hadn't
needed the stimulants, and they hadn't attempted to use any kind of gaseous
sedative, but it was still good to be prepared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She had to get into contact with the
watchers council. She had memorised the number this time. She figured it was a
good idea after last time, but she hadn't figured on having to use it so soon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She headed down stairs, and found a pay
phone in the lobby. She looked around, and broke the coin store, she caught the
quarters as they fell from the machine, and piled them on top of the phone, she
then dialled the number.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They arrived at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
w:st="on">Tracy</st1:City></st1:place>'s apartment, and knocked. The man that
answered the door asked who they were.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I'm Andrew, this is Faith, <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Willow</st1:place></st1:City>, and Daria," said
Andrew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
w:st="on">Tracy</st1:place></st1:City> will be along soon, she lost sight of
Tiffany about an hour ago," said Daniel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They all entered the apartment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Andrews's phone rang again, it was Giles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Hello?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Andrew, I just got a call from Tiffany."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany waited in the Lobby as instructed. Faith
and <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place>
entered the building, and Tiffany got up to greet them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You naked under that lab coat?" asked
Faith.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"As a Jaybird ... Or indeed, any bird," said
Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"How did you get out?" asked <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Fred helped me," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Fred was there?" asked Faith.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, I asked her how she was getting out,
said she was on it, didn't really believe her, but I wasn't about to throw her
attempt to help me in her face," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on"><span lang=EN-GB>Willow</span></st1:City></st1:place><span
lang=EN-GB> and Faith looked sad and angry respectively.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Is there any chance she's alive?" asked
Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span lang=EN-GB>Willow</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
lang=EN-GB> said "yes," the same instant Faith said "No,", they looked at each
other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"There's no way they'd let her off that
easy, she's probably in a hell dimension of some kind," said <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
w:st="on">Willow</st1:place></st1:City>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, how do we get there?" asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I don't know, we need to return to base
first, maybe <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Tracy</st1:place></st1:City>
will lend you some clothes," said Faith.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They headed out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daniel called <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There was no answer again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He hung up again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"She's never this late, I think she's been
captured," he said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Andrews's phone rang "it's Faith," he said,
he then answered it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Hello."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Andrew, we got Tiffany and are returning
to base. We got a problem though, call the council and find out what you can about
hell dimensions, the ones Wolfram and Hart are known to rule in particular,"
said Faith.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Faith, why? What are we-" he was cut off
"Hello? ... everyone's always doing that, why do they keep doing that?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Faith knocked on the door, and Daniel answered,
he let them in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I don't suppose any of you saw <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Tracy</st1:City></st1:place> on the way in, did
you?" he asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No, I guess we got two people to extract
from hell," said Faith.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Andrew was sat at Daniels computer going
through all the information Giles had sent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, but which hell do we look in first?"
asked Andrew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"How many hell dimensions can there be?"
asked Faith.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Infinity," answered Daria and <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Willow</st1:place></st1:City> at the same time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They looked at each other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, can we at least make the number
finite?" asked Faith.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Without another Wolfram and Hart sleeper,
I doubt it," said <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Willow</st1:place></st1:City>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I take it Fred's the only one?" asked
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Well, not exactly, there's Angel, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Gunn">Gunn</a>, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorne_%28Angel%29">Lorne</a>, Wesley, and
Spike, they run the <st1:City w:st="on">Los Angeles</st1:City> branch," said <st1:City

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, so maybe one of them could be of use,"
said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We don't exactly trust them since they
started working for Wolfram and Hart," said Andrew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Well, if they are our best chance of
getting him out of the hell dimension, then surely they're worth a call," said
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Him?" asked <st1:City w:st="on">Willow</st1:City>,
Daria looked at her funny as <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place>
said "There's only Fred ... Oh, Fred's short for Winifred."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Ah," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"And I guess Daria's right, if we're going
to find out how to get them out, we're going to have to talk to them," said <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Willow</st1:place></st1:City>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daniels phone rang, he looked at it "Hey,

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>When Jane had gotten back from work, she
found her roommate and two vampires with crossbow pistols in the apartment with
<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Tracy</st1:City></st1:place> tied up, being
held in the armchair by her room mate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Her roommate had said "Jane, Jane, Jane, if
you wish to remain in your present form, you will have to show some sign that
you are one of us."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane said "Alright," before pulling up her
shorts, walking forward, then dropping while drawing her Mac 10, she fired a burst
at each vamp. They dropped their weapons and collapsed, same with her roommate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She then entered her room, picked up her
MIG unit, the spare bottles and wire spools, her sculpture, and headed out, she
picked up the slayer, and headed out, saying "getting sick of this place anyway."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>After taking the lift to the ground floor
and getting to the sidewalk, she sat the slayer on the ground and cut the ropes
on her hands, she then said "you can cut the rest of the ropes yourself,"
before picking up her stuff again and walking off, using her palm sized mirror
to watch the slayer again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She got 4 metres away before she noticed
the slayer was not moving. She stopped and turned to her, then she returned. The
slayer looked tired, and unusually pink ...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Since me and my roommate were vampires, <a

were never a threat to us. And the place goes through so many landlords in a
month, none of them can be expected to get them looked at anyway," said Jane as
Faith and Daniel drove them back to base.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Vampires don't die from gunshot wounds,

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We're bullet proof? Cool, almost offsets

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Heyyyyy, I knowwwww youuuuu," slurred <st1:City

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Oooohhh, okayyyyyyy," <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"How did you get the drop on her anyway?"
asked Faith.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"A mirror," said Jane, producing her palm

how's that going?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We found her, now we're looking for Fred,

said Faith.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, where was Fred last seen?" asked

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

Angela.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Voices," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Oh good, I love that song," said Angela.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>'Probably not the Disturbed version,' thought

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Hi, Lorne here, I just read a thought that

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"She needed a plausible reason to

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I see ... She thought something about Fred

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, Fred sprung a slayer she had been

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Well, I once saved the world from a really

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, see what you can get, also, we'll

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"There are some things that guns don't work

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"But we just about never use guns," said <st1:City

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Fine," Faith and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, can you look like a police officer?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right then, that gives us our armoured
vehicle and our guns, how much do power sprays and sheets and extrusions of

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There was a knock on Daria's door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"The room you are trying to access is

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Quinn entered and said "Daria, did you have
to do that?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Of course I did, it's in my program," said
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"DARIA, THIS ISN'T FUNNY, YOU DESTROYED
THIS TOWN'S POPULARITY WITH THAT STUNT OF YOURS, I DIDN'T EVEN GET A CHANCE TO
DO MY ROUTINE!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Your routine is full of bugs and viruses,"
said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Quinn stomped out slamming the door after

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"HEY, WHY HAVE WE STOPPED?" asked one of
the SWAT team members.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That's Faith Lehane in my wing mirror,
she's a wanted felon," said Sergeant Vincent Higgens.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right," they got out the back and
surrounded Faith.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Then they saw some red head girl with black
eyeballs chanting something, and suddenly they were all surrounded in a mist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Faith put on the respirator Tiffany had
kept.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Higgins came out the back and reverted to
Illyria, and started helping Faith and <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place>
strip the officers of their weapons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Once they had them on board, they were off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The alley was the only place they had to
work on their flamethrower, since the landlord took one look at the armloads of
gasoline cans and said "Uh-uh, no way, you are not bringing THAT into the
building," so Jane, Daria, and the two watchers set up there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane's flamethrower was just about
complete.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She placed the last pipe on the base of the
left fuel tank and said looked away saying "Eyes," before tacking it on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She then pulled her visor down and
completed the weld.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The device looked a lot more menacing than
Daria would have expected, the generator was at the top of the pack, the power
spray was at the bottom, the 8L fuel stores on the sides, a chef's blowtorch on
the flame holder that replaced the nozzle that would have otherwise created a
flat aerosol.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane hooked up the last hosepipe to the
tank and tightened the clip around it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She then turned off the generator and
worked on the wiring to the power spray, letting the tank cool before she even
thought about charging.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Jesus, that looks heavy," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yes indeedy," Jane said, she started cocooning
the terminals in PVC tape, then she said "we're ready to give it a go now,"
said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:City w:st="on"><span lang=EN-GB>Tracy</span></st1:City><span

here,"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"RIGHT HANG ON," said Jane, as she and
Daria charged the flamethrower.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They then picked up all their equipment
(Jane put the flamethrower on her back) and headed to the front of the alley,
Jane activated the generator, and turned on the power spray, she turned back to
the Alley, activating the torch, she squeezed the trigger, waiting for the air
to leave, then an enormous flame shot out into the alley, the gasoline formed a
large puddle of fire 25 metres into the alley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Groovy," said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane, Daria, and Tracy went to the APC,

off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, a dozen <a

grenade launchers with CS rounds, and two <a

off to a good start," said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Dibs on the minimi," said Tracy, grabbing
one of the machine guns, cocking it, and accidentally poking the muzzle in the
back of Illyria's head, causing Illyria to look back at Tracy, Tracy lifted the
barrel, looking a little embarrassed, and shrugged "sorry,"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"So how are we crossing dimensions then?"
asked Daria as she examined her M4.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Oh, there's a tunnel nearby that will take
us straight to it," said Lorne.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"And Fred," asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I'll do a locator spell," said <st1:City

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay then, to hell with us," said Daria.</span></p>

drove around in search of the correct house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Damn it, my locator spell's not working,"

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That case, we keep driving until we find
her," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That could take ages," said <st1:City

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah ... did Fred know what she was getting
into?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah," replied Lorne.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, Tiffany, that lab, did you see
anything marked radioactive?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No, I was kind of distracted by the being
in pain, and being restrained tit-ass naked in front of the forces of evil,"
replied Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria started looking around the APC and

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That won't be very good through terrain," <st1:City

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:place w:st="on"><span lang=EN-GB>Illyria</span></st1:place><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She was obviously useful to them, and Daria

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You alright Freddykins?" asked Lorne.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No, not really, my body just kept going
into that basement and that <a href="http://www.cityofangel.com/characters/">demon</a>

said Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"They could make a lot of money on the

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I would SO love to have a go at that demon

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Daria, we have a problem," said <st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Or maybe that one where you hang the guy

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria grabbed her Radio "I'm listening."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>A deathly silence descended upon them as

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Everyone said "Yes."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Or Lilah 'Career minion' Morgan," said Winifred,

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"There's a fire in the basement of the

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They shot and rammed a large number of
vehicles on their way back, then they had to fight their way back in, Illyria
strafed the middle of the bad guy queue as she landed, then she resumed her

others abandoned the APC, Daria and Lorne included.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They had to shoot replacement family units,

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Faith and Tiffany kept batting this big

the fire, saying "Don't knock him out, it's almost up to temperature."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, we got about 5 minutes before the
house is too weak to not collapse on our asses," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, new plan," said Winifred, leaving
the poker and grabbing a cats paw off the wall, walking over to where Faith and
Tiffany were playing pass the demon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I guess one of us stays," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That would make the trip a touch pointless,

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:place w:st="on"><span lang=EN-GB>Illyria</span></st1:place><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The demon walked to the table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Now why didn't I think of that?" asked
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Because you're not as smart as you think
you are," said Jane, as Lorne and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Willow</st1:place></st1:City>
walked through the fire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Great, I really am in hell," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Suddenly two columns of goons in SAS gear
ran in through a door off to the side, they took positions behind the cars,
aiming MP5s at the group, they had tone before any of them could think to raise
their M4s, they did halfway though.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Two men entered, one had black hair,
wearing a purple shirt, black trousers, a black trench coat, and the other was
lightly built, dark brown hair, wearing Jeans and a black jumper, both had
serious looks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Winifred went to hug the thinner guy, who
was looking at the cat's paw Winifred still held, she hugged Him, and he relaxed
into it, as the other guy told the goons to take a break.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria looked at him and said "And for those

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yes, trying to bring down the beast from

that prompted a snort from <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Willow</st1:place></st1:City>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Fred should be safe now, we extracted
Lindsey a while back, they didn't come after him, as for Tiffany, I suspect her
capture was for the purpose of attempting to corrupt Fred, if that was the

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Any advice on evading roving bands of

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Ahh, Miss Morgendorffer, I should have

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Jesus, that's strange," said Daniel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, the whole organisation is a total
mind fuck, I can understand violence, scientific research into the enemy, all
those things, but what I don't understand is letting the enemy work like this.
I would have thought either the senior partners would have tried to express
tighter control on Angel's crew, or Angel would be more active in his sabotage."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That's the legal theatre for you," said
Daniel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, anyway, be with you soon, I hope,"

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Where's she going?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Should one of us follow?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No, she'll drag us down with her if she's

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"EXCUSE ME, YOU CAN'T GO THERE," she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The demon girl walked up to her and said
"You presume to restrict MY movements, half-breed?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Angel and Marcus then emerged from the
office, Marcus walked off, Angel noticed <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>
at Harmony's desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"<st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>, are
you looking for someone?" he asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We need to talk," she said, walking into
his office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You are infiltrating the Wolf, the Ram,
and the Hart in order to destroy their organisation," stated <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Angel shrugged and said "Pretty much."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Then you will need my help," stated <st1:place
w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"How can you help?" asked Angel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Before I was interred in the deeper well,
I ruled a vast empire spanning many worlds, and many dimensions. I have great
experience you could not imagine, and could teach you what you need to know to
destroy them," said <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"The world ... worlds, have changed a lot
since your time, what can you teach me?" asked Angel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"For a start, some basic military doctrine.
You'll never win like this," she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Like what?" asked Angel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You are trapped in the web of the Wolf,
the Ram and the Hart. The senior partners as you know them, they laugh at you,
make you perform the tasks they lay out for you, dropping treats such as the
illusion of progress," said <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Uh-huh, and your advice?" asked Angel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Do you want to win?" asked <st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"<st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>,
of course I want to win, that's why I'm here, that's why I'm working to bring
down the beast from within," said Angel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You don't seem to want to win badly
enough, you are a slave to an insane construct. You are moral, a true ruler is
as moral as a hurricane, empty, but for the voice of his gale. You have so much
power around you, yet you quibble at it's price. If you wish to win a war, you
must serve no master but your ambition," said <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Serve no master but your ambition?" asked
Angel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yes, get the power you need, and use it. Cause
as much damage as you can. I also wish to destroy the Wolf, the Ram, and the
Hart, that is why I participated in the operation to free your minion. It was a
chance to cause some damage to the Wolf, the Ram, and the Hart, and to examine
potential allies against them," said <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Thank you, <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>,
I will consider your advice," said Angel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You had better, I want to see the Wolf,
the Ram, and the Hart, and their empire burn to the ground," said <st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria had left the cafeteria in search of
Illyria, she went over to the reception desk "excuse me, Harmony, have you
seen-" she then saw <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place> emerge from the
office off to the left of the desk "oh, never mind, found her." Daria then went
to meet <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place> "thought I'd better go find
you, Tiffany has been in contact with Giles. He's going to cover our air fare
to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Lawndale</st1:place></st1:City>,"
said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I will not be joining you, I can infiltrate
any organisation, that should include airlines," said <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay then, I am wondering if you have
attempted to maintain the illusion that Stacy is alive to her parents," said
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That required little effort, in fact, when
I demonstrated my true form to them, they dismissed it as a figment of their
imagination," said <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right, they will find your absence
alarming though," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Their alarm is immaterial," said <st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, well, good luck then," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Thank you," said <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>A few weeks later, Daria received a
visitor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It was Marcus Hamilton.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Do you remember what I said about
interfering with Wolfram and Hart affairs?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yes," replied Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Now you've gotten yourself arrested over
the theft of the SWAT APC you left in the holding dimension, which I dutifully
returned to the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:State w:st="on">New York</st1:State></st1:place>
police department. It was quite a surprise to find your prints were already on
AFIS. However, there is a way Wolfram and Hart can see their way round to
getting you out of here," said Marcus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That's fascinating, but Heather and I have
really fallen in love, it would just ruin our relationship so much if one got
out and the other didn't," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, well, thank you for your time, Miss
Morgendorffer." Marcus left the room, and the guards entered to take Daria back
to her cell.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Are you sure you don't want to get some
lunch?" asked Heather.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I am certain," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, then, catch you later," she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>After she was gone, Daria opened a panel in
her side and plugged it into one of the cells power outlets, as the other Daria
had instructed, she was careful to hide the fact she was a robot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Well, I was wondering if you feel up to

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Well, I could use a little more time to

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Tiffany is getting frustrated with Andrew.
I'm about to send him on vacation to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region

Giles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Would I be temping until Andrew gets those

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
