<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Synopsis: Daria returns to Lawndale to watch Tiffany, and an old former friend of Willows also shows her face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Legal: Daria belongs to MTV, Angel and
Buffy belongs to Mutant enemy, and there's a reference to 'Drop The Dead
Donkey' in there too. Oh, and there are lyrics from a Rob Zombie song in there

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"DARIA? I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN PRISON!"
shrieked Angela.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Daria? Who's this Daria?" asked the woman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She looked like Daria. Exact same hair
colour, exact same glasses. But she was dressed in grey trousers, a pink fuzzy
jumper, and her hair was in a braided ponytail. Also her voice had a wider
bandwidth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Angela looked at her trying to work it out
in her mind. The woman stared back in puzzlement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Is this a test? Are you playing the role
of a disruptive library patron?" asked the woman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Library?" asked Angela.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, the place I'm applying for
management of. Where the books live, ... "</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Oh, the library, you're ... " she flipped
through her personal organiser and looked up again "Joy Merryweather?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That's me. Who's this Daria you thought I
was?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Oh, just some, ... Uh, have a seat, Miss
Merryweather" said Angela.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It was a watcher clich&eacute; that they usually
ended up running libraries, but it was a functional one, since they could
easily stock it with the information of their trade.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria had also copied the watchers council
database of demons and organisations, known alternate dimensions, magics, etc.
and would receive an update from a courier she knew personally. One who
traveled around picking up and dropping off updates. The only time information
was passed over the internet was in an emergency, the majority of the
communications were spoof messages. Since the majority were such utter
bullshit, the minority that were real were unread by spies because they had all
given up. That was the theory, anyway, but spies that timed their eavesdropping
just right would possibly get what they need.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She concentrated on the pen in her desk organizer,
trying to get it to move. It finally happened, she stopped it about a metre
overhead. She heard someone enter the library, breaking her concentration, the
pen dropped back into the desk organizer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Well Helllloooooo my-" started Upchuck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Arch nemesis if you continue that train of
thought" replied Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Fffff-" Upchuck started, but couldn't
finish because he felt his bladder discharge. He stared down at himself
horrified, he then placed the book he was returning on the desk and ran off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jodie entered the library, and looked at
her saying "Daria?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, somebody tell me who Daria is? Because
I obviously look like her, and Angela said something about her being in prison.
I want to know about my double" said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"If you're not her, ... "</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I'm Joy Merryweather" said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I'm Jodie Landon. Daria Morgendorffer was
a student here, but she was involved in the theft of police property, including
an APC and some guns. She is now in prison for the next 15 years"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right, thank you"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You're welcome" said Jodie, before heading
off in search of a book.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What have any of these texts got to do
with my mission?" asked Illyria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That will become apparent later" said
Wesley, as he worked on his assigned task.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Illyria</span><span lang=EN-GB> approached
Wesley and stood on his desk, grabbing his head by the ears so his face was
aimed directly at hers and said "You are attempting to distract me from my
mission. You're not even working on the destruction of the Wolf, the Ram, and
the Hart. You have become seduced by their resources and wish to support your
masters" stated Illyria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yes, I'm keeping you distracted, but your
assumption about my desire to destroy the Wolf, the Ram, and the Hart is flat
out wrong. We will find a way, but Angel doesn't want you anywhere near our
plan, now-" Wesley pushed the muzzle of one of his pistols into her chest and
said "-remove your hands from my body, or you can sit out the mission feeding
the worms"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Illyria</span><span lang=EN-GB> frowned at
him for a few seconds, then shoved his head back, propelling him into the
window with enough energy to make the sound of head against glass painful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She then stood up, stepped off the desk,
and left.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Hey Illyria, how goes it with Wesley?"
asked the one named Gunn, as he approached Illyria's table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"He keeps me from contributing to the
mission he claims he's committed to. Are you also going to waste my time?"
asked Illyria, only pausing her consumption of Petri dishes long enough to
answer his question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Gunn sat down opposite her, and said
"considering what you did to Fred, you should consider yourself lucky he hasn't
instead decided to examine the effects of firearms on your body. And I'd help
him, or have a go myself when he was finished."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What I did to Fred was based on the
reasonable assumption that she was involved with an assassination attempt against
me. I have long been an adversary of the Wolf, the Ram, and the Hart, and she
was in charge of your practical sciences department. She also had the weapon I
saw Daria aiming at me in my fragmented timeline. I had to find out how this
weapon worked, I no longer consider her a threat."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Gunn thought about his response. He
couldn't believe she just claimed probable cause without the slightest hint of
contrition as if this was an internal affairs investigation. His friend, his
former girlfriend, the girl he loved, was just a suspect to her, and she
expected the same perspective of everyone else.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Illyria, did people ever apologise in your
day?" asked Gunn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"They did, hoping I would spare them."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Gunn stood up, smacking the table with his
hands, causing some of the Petri dishes to bounce of Illyria's plate and said
"DAMN IT ILLYRIA, YOU ARE NOT THE CENTRE OF THE UNIVERSE! IF YOU WANT TO
CONSOLIDATE ALLIANCES, YOU HAVE TO TREAT OTHERS AS EQUALS! YOU CAN NOT ASSUME,
THAT EVERYONE WILL WORSHIP AND OBEY"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Obviously" observed Illyria as she placed
the stray Petri dishes back on her plate. This was the second time someone came
to her with this kind of advice "I am prepared to negotiate the terms of my
entrance into an alliance with your organisation."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Oh really?" asked Gunn, he put his hands
in his pockets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I wish to remain able to fight, and in
control of my mental faculties. But as long as the reprisal Fred determines
does not remove either, I am willing to consider the price." said Illyria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Gunn looked at her, considering her
proposal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Angel will have to oversee such a
negotiation" he said, he then left.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Illyria</span><span lang=EN-GB> would be
patient, but she would have to consider plans that did not involve Angel and
his team as allies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She had rarely needed other forces than
those she had commanded in her day. Now she had to offer something that they
wanted; Something that she could possibly barely afford. Chances were that Angel's
organisation may demand too much and she would have to break off negotiations. She
was going to win one way or another, and there was no point in rushing it. A
poorly executed attack could get her killed instead, but since she was pretty
much immortal (discounting artificial factors). She had as long as the Wolf,
the Ram, and the Hart had.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria returned to her current place of
residence: Penny's room at Jane's house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"So, how was your first day?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Swell, starting to get the hang of it." said
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Librarianining?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Telekenesis"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Magic?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yep"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Seem to be getting the hang of it quickly."
said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, Willow said the same thing, and
expressed concern."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There was a knock on the door. Daria
answered it, and let Tiffany in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Miss Merryweather" said Tiffany, as she
entered. She was dressed in camouflage trousers, a jacket, and with a pair of
steel toed boots. She had a small sports bag hanging off her shoulder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Hey Tiff, what's with the change?" asked
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Didn't seem much point remaining
fashionable: No dates, no friends wanting much to do with me. I figured I might
as well dress for work" said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right, I'm still trying to catch up on
your logs. Andrew's narration is either a fiendishly cleaver anti-spy tactic,
or he's as convinced of his thrilling narration abilities as Upchuck is of his
pulling power. I could blow it off and join you on patrol, you could fill me in
on any significant events." Daria suggested.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Can you fight?" asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Well, my hand to hand skills are still at
the novice level, but I could always bring something to help me out." said
Daria, grabbing her other jacket off the wall and the holster under it. It was
a back holster and ammo belt for a sawn off shotgun, she put the harness on.
"I'm saving for an automatic shotgun."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I thought vampires couldn't be killed by
gunshot wounds" said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Nope, it's stake through the heart,
ignition, prolonged contact with crucifixes, sunlight and holy water, and, ... "
she pulled one of the rounds (brass base, red case, with a yellow stripe around
the front) from her ammo belt saying "decapitation"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"With a, ... 12 gauge?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Nope, Fin stabilised high explosive." said
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Are those legal?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Council swung a permit, but I had to
manufacture the ammunition myself. Luckily your mom had the necessary tools in
the basement. I only had to bring the blank cartridges, propellant, and
materials to make the shell and filler." said Daria. She then continued "They
won't reimburse me for an automatic shotgun though; I'm having to save up for
that"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What was the thing Willow expressed
concern over?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Apparently she presented megalomania as a
result of her rapidly increasing skill, started taking insane risks: Editing
her girlfriend's memory, flicking the main breaker on and off by telekenisis. Almost
ended up incinerating the planet when said girlfriend was wasted by some
wannabe gangster." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Whoa, that sounds, ... What about you?"
asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I suppose, I'll have to maintain vigilance.
Besides, Willow's a good guy again, and using magic responsibly, so I suppose
the problem shouldn't be insurmountable. I just got to be careful, I guess. There
are differences between the kinds of magics I'll be learning to use, telekenisis
is simply moving stuff with my thoughts. That's a relatively safe one. The
harder ones are the spells, because they tend to have instant results and alter
reality, materialise objects. There's also the energy itself, that's one of the
biggest problems." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"How so?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Well, mystical energy is barely understood
by practitioners of magics, and the amount of energy a single person can wield
is extreme. You remember what happened with Illyria, the explosive yield we
were looking at?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, would have been like some sort of
nuclear explosion." said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No, it wouldn't. Nukes draw their energy
from the annihilation of matter; energy equals mass times the speed of light
squared. Mystical energy goes way beyond that. It's not the kind of thing you
can ever translate from matter: You can call upon it, channel it, use it, it
hangs just outside our perception." Daria explained.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, well, if it's likely to be so
powerful, do you really think you should be messing with it?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"It's a useful tool in combat. I'm not one
to turn down ammunition if I can use it. I'm also reading up on Willows notes
about what happened with her. It seems she was introduced to a person who
supplied her with some sort of ready to use energy, gave her a mystical version
of a sugar rush, got her hooked on that. She was presenting poor judgement
before that, but that seemed to be the point where it eliminated her sense of
caution, added a dependence on this guys energy to the mix." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Again, doesn't that make it the sort of
thing you should avoid?" Jane asked again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Not if it can help me do my job. I'll keep
in mind how unstable magic is, develop my skill, and, hope I can avoid making a
large part of the planet disappear."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She didn't need magic to pull a man. In
fact, she could pull several at once. But Amy was getting bored with the whole
whore act, so she just used her magics to get as many as possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She would get a couple of them to blow her,
the rest were for her minions to use. Some of them had the M factor that
qualified them for turning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>M for megalomania.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amy didn't know what effect being turned
might have on her magical ability, so she didn't go for it herself. Besides,
she wanted to hang onto her daylight mobility. Still, she needed an army, and
since she had something to keep vampires interested (a steady supply of human
snacks), they seemed perfect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As long as the sun wasn't shining, but she
was getting good at weather spells, so she could usually create the right
conditions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She entered the house that she had gotten
the owners of to invite the vamps into and met her senior officers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Oooh, got some pretty dolls for me to play
with." said Drusilla.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, whatever, you nut" said Erin, as she and Brian got up off the couch to pick out their meals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Don't be so hard on Dru, Erin, we're all a
little crazy" said Amy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Mmmm, I like this one. He smells of
galvanised haemoglobin" commented Drusilla as she picked one out of the crowd.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Although some crazies are more equal than
others." Amy admitted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, well, we're undead and loving it,
provided we can actually start taking over the world. We going to go to work
now?" asked Erin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Sure, tonight we'll turn all the cops in
this town, then we'll do the same to the day shift" said Amy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;"-So, I was like, 'you were saying?', then
these two cops showed up and had me put down my weapon. I had to wait for them
to get real close before I could do anything. I had to throw one into the other
in order to get them off their game, but in the process the vamp legged it. I
could do little else but also get some distance" said Tiffany, concluding one
of the more interesting reports.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Not a lot of activity going on here."
observed Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Not a lot of Hellmouths in our world."
Tiffany replied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"It's a pity most the slayers have family
that can't for whatever reason be involved. If we could improve our mobility,
there'd be enough of us to go state by state." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Would that be effective?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I dunno, but I think we would be more
effective if we could move more of our forces around." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"The fact that we don't, as a force for
good, have legal recognition and authority is another issue." said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Not a lot we can do about that. The Watchers
Council isn't secretive because our tactics depend on it, it's secretive to
keep us all from being confined to psychiatric wards." Daria countered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>PC Sarah Park was about to leave for work
when there was a knock on the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She answered it, a woman with long black
hair dressed in a long flowing skirt and fuck all else was standing there.
"Hello my child. I am Drusilla, the fairy god queen, here on a mission of love.
May I come in?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Sarah looked at her for a few seconds, and
said "I guess you'd better, come in, have a seat." she turned to go for her
phone to call an ambulance; that woman, on drugs or not, needed help.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She picked up the phone and turned around
to direct the woman to a sofa, but the woman had changed her appearance: Her

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The man answered and Brian introduced

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Androids, turns out Willows expertise of
robotics came from dissecting two robots made by this other Upchuck like guy,
Warren Meers. Both were self propelled real dolls: One named April, the other

Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"By the way, you mind covering yourself

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"But I want to attract more prey, they so

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Which would also draw attention. I can't
stress how important it is that we don't give any warning to the watcher's

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, they do seem a little conspicuous."
said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The trio ahead of them turned a corner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right, I'm on it" said Tiffany, starting

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Hi, I'm with Erin. There's something I

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amy entered the house and said "Erin? ... What are you doing?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I was discussing the latest issues of the

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No, as per your cover, remember? Cover for
getting into cops houses so you can turn them into vampires? Remember?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"All right, All right," said Erin, getting and throwing the magazine into the sofa "you don't have to get snotty about
it." She promptly vamped out and grabbed the stunned woman, and fed off of her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany encountered the three people minus
the other girl, but saw a blonde vampire feeding off a 40ish woman, she would
have to engage that one first. She got inside before Dru and friend could react.
The blond vampire wasn't really paying attention to the front door, so she got
around her and staked her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She pulled the victim into a more
defensible location, looking at the other girl, who was rooted to the spot. Aside
from the blonde she had just killed, Drusilla was the only confirmed vampire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"ERIN! NO!" she heard the distressed cry
from the boy outside, then she heard him shout "AMY, INVITE ME IN!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I don't live here, the resident isn't dead
yet, just unconscious." said 'Amy'. The girl then waved her hand and Tiffany
felt herself fly against the wall, the force pinned her limbs and she felt her
ribcage start to bend.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria skipped sideways, ready to shoot,
Drusilla and Brian turned to her game faced. She shot Drusilla first, but Dru
bowed her head and the projectile struck her forehead instead. The blast caused
a 5cm wide, 1cm deep crater, she collapsed unconscious. Daria fired at Brian
who was distracted by Drusilla's collapse. The projectile struck his top vertebra
from it's 10 o'clock position, having the intended effect of kicking the bone
out of the neck and breaking any connection between the shoulders and the head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria opened the breech with one hand,
grabbing two fresh rounds with the other. The spent cartridges had just fallen
out of the weapon when the girl (presumably the one Brian called Amy) came out,
eyes pitch black, her hand pointed at Daria. Suddenly Daria was pulled down
onto her ass, then onto her back, her arms and legs pinned were they landed. She
felt like she was lying on a neutron star. She saw the girl walk off with
Drusilla over one shoulder, with her hand still pointed at Daria. She was out
of sight before the force abated. Daria took a moment to recover enough to sit
up. She reloaded her sawn off, pocketing the spent cartridges, and got to her
feet. She was about to call Tiffany's name, but decided that having her name
heard at a crime scene would probably be a bad thing, so she entered the house.
She found Tiffany in the woman's bedroom with the woman holding a credit card
over the holes Erin had left. Tiffany had called for an ambulance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She felt fangs puncture her shoulder
"You're awake now are you?" she asked, looking at Drusilla's vamped out face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Drusilla paused in her feeding and Amy
dropped her on the ground, she then got her keys out and opened the front door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The other vamps met her in the hall way,
Drusilla followed Amy, asking "Are you angry at me for stealing your crimson
syrup of life?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amy turned to her and said "Tell you what
Dru, if you can figure out the correct answer to that AND deliver it without
any weird insane rambling, I'll forego punishing you, okay?" she then turned
back to her crew and said "Pack up, we're moving house, anywhere east of here. We
bumped into a Slayer and a demon hunter, took out the Danielsons, and possibly
sent a scout: I saw the same face behind us a few times, so we have to assume
they know our location now. We'll cross to our rear right neighbours back yard,
in case the scout's watching the front."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Angel entered central filing and sought out
the person he was looking for.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Illyria, what are you doing?" asked Angel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Illyria</span><span lang=EN-GB> stood up
straight, looking around, and whispered "Where is she?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Angel cocked his head, and, in a lazy tone,
said "Leery, you smell nothing like Harmony."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Illyria</span><span lang=EN-GB> dropped her
disguise and said "You and your minions will not let me participate in your
mythical attempt to destroy the Wolf, the Ram, and the Hart. The situation
dictates I find another means to accomplish my mission."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Angel sighed and said "You tortured one of
my staff, and recently assaulted another."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"The first time was in response to a highly
probable assassination attempt, the second was down to your minions attempt to
divert my attention with pointless busywork." She replied coldly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"And what will you do after Wolfram and
Hart are gone?" he asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I intend to reclaim what was mine" said Illyria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You are probably aware that none of us
have any intention of reinstating you as a god, especially given the violence
of your rule." said Angel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I made a proposal that your minion Gunn
said he would forward to you" said Illyria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"He mentioned that. The problem is it is
difficult to imagine any punishment making any kind of impression. Your age
prior to your incarceration in the deeper well means you would have the mental
endurance to shrug off anything short of lethal force" said Angel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;"That's the second cop I've been involved
in an incident with" said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That woman Erin was biting?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, I saw her warrant card fall out of
her pocket when I pulled her wallet to get her credit card"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, Drusilla and Amy, I'm assuming
that's Amy Madison, are both considered major players. Amy less so, because of
her young age, but Willow listed her as a mid skill witch who is self centred
and reckless enough to be considered a potential threat, so if she's running
with Drusilla, or Drusilla with her, we have to take that seriously. Erin and
Brian, probably there as minions, that many vamps in one place, Brian, Amy, and
Drusilla converged on that house for whatever reason."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You think they're up to something?" Asked
Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Amy's hanging with Vampires, saved Drusilla's
ass, what I'm wondering is what would they want with cops?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Cops plural?" asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, like I said, it was just a hunt, why
go for someone who's home?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;"And you'd look sweet, on the tandem seat,
of a bicycle made, for two, he-he-he-he." sang Drusilla.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Dru, could you please at least PRETEND to
be paying attention?" asked Amy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What happened to her?" asked one of the
vamps.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Angelus drove her nuts prior to turning
her." said Amy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I mean on the mission?" the vamp asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Explosive round to the head, if you're
wondering about the crater." said Amy, as Drusilla continued to dance and sing
really old songs, she started into 'Don't Dilly Dally On The Way'.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Man, that shot must have really fucked her
up." commented another vamp.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Well, I can't honestly say I noticed any
difference myself" said Amy, desperate to get back on topic, she then turned to
the giggling insane vamp and forced her into a sitting position on the floor
saying "Don't make me squash you into neutronium."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Aww" pouted Drusilla as Amy turned to the
rest of her force.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Now, we got most of the night shift, they
will soon be turning up at work, they will turn the staff present and the
following shifts into vampires. Then each night, they will go around and turn
the rest of this town with door to door enquiries. We get around a third of the
town turned. The rest is food. Although in the long term, we are going to have
to start thinking about how to farm our blood cows, aren't we?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria and Tiffany met up with Jane where
she had phoned in the location of the nest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I haven't seen any movement since Amy and
Drusilla got there." said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, Tiff and I will do a recon, Jane,
you grab your flamethrower and meet us back here." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right" said Jane, before heading off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, and, err, what exactly are we
supposed to do against the gravity queen?" asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Go on a diet." suggested Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Fuuuu-neeeeeey"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They headed across the road to the house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Illyria</span><span lang=EN-GB> stood in
her cell, wondering how long it would be until Angel figured out that she was
essential to his victory over the Wolf, the Ram, and the Hart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Hadn't she been humiliated enough already?
First she infects the wrong body (UPS will regret that to the extent that her
enemies regretted so much as slagging her off in her day). Then she loses her
powers. Then she finds herself having use diplomacy. And now, ... now, ... ... NOW
SHE WAS WAITING FOR SOMEONE ELSE TO DECIDE HER FATE LIKE ONE OF HER SLAVES!!!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The mental outburst was just that, mental,
externally, she didn't move.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The one called Spike walked into view.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Has your leader reached a decision yet?"
asked Illyria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Err, no, they're still rolling the dice up
there, tallying the results. More even numbers than odd, we let you participate.
More odd than even, ... " he grinned and made a cut throat gesture.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Do not mock me, half breed. ... ... I have
offered to submit to the wrath of the one you call Fred, as she was the one who
was wronged."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Uh-huh, well, I've never known her to be
the vengeful kind"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You have obviously not seen her when she
is angered. When the one called Willow removed the talisman from Fred's neck, I
sensed an intense rage, the kind of rage that would compel her to kill people
she loves in order to carry it out. Fred is perfectly capable of designing an
appropriate penalty. Or overstepping it."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You sensed it, huh? What else can you
sense?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Grief, joy, euphoria, distress. Last night
I sensed Wesley and Fred's joy when they engaged in sexual intercourse in one
of the supply closets on the floor below"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Fascinating. ... Who was your shell?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Her name was Stacy Rowe, she was a member
of an organisation known as the Lawndale High Fashion Club"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Fashion Club? That's the sort of thing
Harmony would create."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That was not really where her passion lay,"
said Illyria "she merely joined it to enhance her public figure, to avoid
persecution. She felt highly vulnerable, open to attack. That is the same
reason Knox tried to win my approval. She was Sandi Griffin's Qwa'ha Xahn"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria and Tiffany met back in front of the
house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"See anything?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Nothing, either they're out, holed in the
basement, or have moved off." said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane showed up with her favourite toy
(covered in a big cloth) "Find anything?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Nope, but we need to check inside" said
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay" said Jane, she looked around to see
if they were being watched, then she pulled the cloth off her flamethrower.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It had flames painted all over it's fuel
stores, the frame was painted gloss black, and it had an iridescent finish on
the fuel stores changed from the fire colours to a purple/grey at different
angles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Nice paint job." Tiffany said, impressed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Little worrying though, you haven't named
it have you?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Nope" said Jane as she turned the
generator on, Daria nodded and turned to the front door before Jane finished,
"Haven't thought of a name yet."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria looked at her, as Jane vamped out and
pulled the rip chord on the generator, she then lit the pilot light.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria pulled her own weapon and a
flashlight, and Tiffany pulled her stake. Daria placed her hand on the lock,
opening it with telekinesis. She then entered, flashlight held against the
weapons forearm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria went left, Tiffany went right, Jane
stayed in the middle watching the stairs. Her weapon, though massively
destructive, wasn't much good at point blank because in that time it takes to
catch fire, the target could incapacitate and kill her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There wasn't much furniture that could
conceal a person standing, so Daria cleared the room fairly quickly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany entered the dining room, she
dropped to a low crouch, saw nothing, then lifted to a squat as she checked the
dining room cabinets, all clear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She moved onto the kitchen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She checked all the cupboards that could
conceivably hide a vampire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria met Tiffany near the back door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Nothing" said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Ditto" said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Where next?" asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Basement" Daria replied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria took a position to the left of the
door, and Tiffany pulled it open.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria then skipped down the stairway
getting a look at the basement in full real early. She checked under the stairs
too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She noted a washing machine, a tumble
dryer, and several shelf units, a work shop, and a big cloth covered device in
the centre.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria signalled Tiffany to advance, she
then signalled Tiffany to go around one side of the device, while she went
around the other way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria lowered her weapon and turned back to
the stairway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They re-entered the rest of the house, then
they went up stairs, Jane followed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane stayed at the top of the stairs, while
Daria and Tiffany cleared rooms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They came up with nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Attic?" asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I guess" said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They pulled the counterweighted door down
and released the ladder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria handed the flashlight to Tiffany. Since
this was an obvious ambush point, it would be better if the hand to hand expert
went up first.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany advanced into the attic and Daria
followed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They approached the main cistern and went
their opposite ways around it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Again, nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They returned to the first floor and closed
the attic door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Well, that confirms it, we're going to
have to look for signs of an escape. The plus side is it's night, relatively
little foot traffic to disturb the tracks of our escaping horde of undead."
said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They headed back down stairs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They decided to go out the back way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria's foot kicked an invisible force.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria pushed at the invisible barrier with
her hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Then she headed to the front door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Same results.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, windows, check everything" said
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It took a few minutes for Jane to go
through the upstairs, Daria the ground floor, and Tiffany the basement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They returned to the centre of the lounge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"The chimney?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I don't really feel like appearing on
Americas Dumbest Criminals. Amy must have plans that go beyond annoying us."
said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"A trap?" Tiffany asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, ... we never did check that thing in
the basement, did we?" mused Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They headed downstairs to find out what it
was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria lifted the cloth to find large sacks
of ammonium nitrate, sitting in a pool of something. Daria wiped her fingers in
it and sniffed, it was diesel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She and Tiffany lifted the cloth completely
off and found an electronic box poking out from between two of the sacks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There was a display counting down from 28m42s.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, well, I guess that should have been
expected." said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I don't think we should attempt to defuse
this thing or remove any of these sacks. We need to take down the barrier" said
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Can you do that?" asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I tried earlier, but Amy's way more
powerful; I feel like I need to check my watch against the clock on teletext or
something after that gravity spell. I'll try calling out from the attic, the
distance should hopefully prevent me tripping any RF sensitive components in
the fuse, but I doubt Willow's anywhere near here." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Then try my mom, she has to be a powerful
witch to ensoul me." said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"She in now?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Last I was there." said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They headed upstairs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria asked Jane her mom's number and Jane
gave it to her, but Daria stopped immediately "What?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No signal" said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, then what do we do?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"hmm, ... Amy's spell is using energy, it can
only do that for so long, we need to exhaust it" Daria got up and headed back
down stairs "I don't think we're doing it with force, find a compass."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Why?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I wanna check something." Daria replied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria Jane and Tiffany each picked a room
and looked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"FOUND ONE" called Jane, they met in the
hallway, and Daria looked at it. The needle was turning slowly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"She covered anything magnetic too." said
Daria, she then took the compass to a window and the needle started spinning
really, really fast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"How's that useful?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Magnetic flux is less work to derive from
mystical energy" said Daria "but the collapse of the spell might cause a big
electromagnetic pulse that could trip the fuse even if it isn't designed for RF
sensitivity"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"So, what do we do then?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I need to check one more thing" said
Daria, she then headed downstairs, they followed her down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She entered the basement, "The hearth is
standing on this big stone column. We rip the fire out, place the kitchen table
with enough mass in the cavity underneath it to tamper the blast. That should give
us a place to wait out the blast." said Daria as she returned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We're on it" said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane followed Tiffany as Daria went for the
table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She, Jane and Tiffany then went around
getting every book, board, and immovable lump they could find.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Now help me move the stove from the
kitchen" said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They did.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They loaded everything into the underside
of the table and taped it in place. Then Daria directed the strong girls to
place the stove in front of the hearth, leaving just enough space for them to
squeeze in behind the table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;"My Flamethrower!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"There will be others." Daria told her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Oh? And if it was one of your stories?"
asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, place it in the corner of the
basement that has a clear view of the bomb, that way, no shrapnel. Put it right
up against the walls" said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane ran down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Will that really protect it?" asked
Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I dunno, it should do, but the paint will
probably get roasted" said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane returned and said "5 minutes" before
getting in with them. They had to squeeze together, since they could not allow
the table to transfer any load onto them, and Daria decided to start using her
magnetic skills to try to bring down the field early so they could clear off
the instant it was down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It was a long 5 minutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What if it's a dud?" asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We can't assume that." Daria reasoned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I can't see my watch." said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They waited.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"How do we know five minutes have elapsed?"
asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I'm counting down from 300." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Ah" acknowledged Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They waited a little longer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Suddenly they heard a bang. The table was
thrown against the fireplace, they heard the stove collide with the chimney
stack, and it fell backwards.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They looked up and saw the smoke cloud rising,
and bits of the house in the air falling mostly downwind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They got up and tried to step outside the
property line. It worked "Okay, we need to be gone. Jane, hurry up with your
flamethrower and pick an escape route, then return to base" said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane entered the Lane house with her
Flamethrower on her back, covered once again in its concealing cloth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I don't think I was seen." said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Good" said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane took the device off her back and
examined it, there was no visible sign of damage aside from some dust.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I guess if we're going up against Amy, we
need another witch on board." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I'll talk to mom then." said Jane, headed
to the basement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"And I'll call Willow." said Daria,
grabbing her cell phone again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amanda and Trent entered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"JANE, SHE'S OVER HERE!" shouted Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane returned "Hi mom."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Jane, what happened out there? I was
looking at the stars in the back yard, and I saw this ring of mist moving
through the sky like a nuclear bomb had gone off."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"It wasn't though, the speakers at my gig
would have been blown out by the pulse" said Trent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You know what an EMP is?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I heard the phrase EMP hardened in a few
electronics stores and asked Daria what it meant." said Trent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Mist was a rarefaction zone from the blast
caused by a shit load of ANFO detonating in the basement of a house we were
trapped in. Oh, and by the way, Jane says you're a witch?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yes"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right, We might need your help with
something. See, there's this other, less pleasant witch called Amy Madison. She's
the one who set that spell that trapped us in that house" said Daria as she
waited for her phone to ring.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Who are you calling?" asked Amanda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Another witch, probably better to have two
against her" the phone stopped ringing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Hi Joy." said Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Willow, how far are you from Lawndale right now?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Several thousand miles, I'm in England right now"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, just I've encountered Amy Madison
here, and she's up to something. Last saw her at the scene of a biting carrying
off Drusilla, who I didn't quite kill, but managed to ding slightly."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I'll be right there." said Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;"Damn it" said Amy, upon hearing that no
casualties had been found in the house. She turned off the TV and said "What is
it with good guys? I mean, I could incinerate the surface of the planet and
they'd still be there, 'Hello, Hi mom, I'm on telly.'" she said, before
chucking the remote into the sofa.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"They're like the moat of goldfish
surrounding the giant peach of the round table." said Drusilla.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amy turned to her and then turned back the
way she was facing, and said "At least we got the majority of the Night shift. One
that got away will be thrown in a padded cell when she says she was attacked by
vampires and a witch, I guess we're sorted for now." she landed back on the
couch and told everyone "Get some sleep, get some tail, get some blood if you
can get away with it, just don't get us found for the next 8 hours." before
falling asleep on the couch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The other vamps dispersed to go about
chosen activity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria turned around and looked at her in
bewilderment and, a few seconds later, asked "have you HEARD the shit kids

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>When Daria got to the library, she met
Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Willow should be here this afternoon."
said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, it would help if we had a way to
infiltrate the vampire nest." Tiffany said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, I'd have Jane do it, but Drusilla
knows her. I also think we could do with Illyria's help on this, but her
objectives are to take over the world. I am concerned that she could end up
teaming up with Amy, so it looks like we wait for Willow and see if she can
locate Amy." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What about Amanda Lane?" asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I asked her, but she called no joy after
the 5th map blew up in her face, so we're not going to get anything done until Willow gets here."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Booby traps, gravity, possibly weather,
since she's running with vampires, what else does she have form for?" asked
Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Transmutation of animals, mind fucking
Willow, introducing Willow to Rack, the guy who got her hooked on the mystical
equivalent of crack cocaine, transmutating Buffy Summers into a rat, Amy also
got hooked on Racks magic." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"This Rack, maybe we could locate him?"
asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Nope, he's dead."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, who else could Amy go to?" asked
Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I'm not sure she would go to anyone like
that again. As I said, mystical version of crack, makes you feel powerful, but
you become a slave to it. If Amy was doing that kind of magic, I seriously
doubt she would have the presence of mind to be able to lead a gang, or build a
bomb and accompany it with a snare spell" said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"So she's like that naturally?" asked
Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Most likely." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Most likely?" asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Well, ... Amy's never shown any inclination
beyond her own needs and pleasures before, but that doesn't mean she's working
for someone else necessarily." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"But something feels off to you?" asked
Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah" said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"But you don't know what?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Pretty much" said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amy was awoken by someone entering her
alarm field. She looked up at the vamp leaning over her and pushed him off
telekinetically.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amy got a good look at him. He was in knee
length denim shorts, a Marylyn Manson tee shirt, and had green spiky hair, some
ear and nose rings, and trainers. A lot of dirt was present in his clothes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Who are you?" he asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amy looked around and shouted "DRUSILLA?"
before getting up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She then turned to the vamp and said "I'm
Amy Madison, the boss to you if you wish to remain here, and you are?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The vamp unvamped his face, "Shaun
Littleton"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"And you were just turned today?" asked
Amy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Turned?" he asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"In, to, a, vam, pire." clarified Amy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I'm a vampire? ... Whoahhhhh" he said,
sounding like your stereotypical stoner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amy sighed again and shouted "DRUSILLA! WHERE
THE FUCKING HELL ARE YOU?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Boss lady's upset at something?" asked
Drusilla.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What's this?" asked Amy pointing at the
newest member of their army.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Shaun Littleton, the stars and the voices
told me he's going to be a lot of fun to be around." said Drusilla.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right, voices and stars, ... You could at
least have stayed with him and told him what was going on. I mean, fine, turn
them, I want an army, just be sure to tell them what's what when they wake will
you? And what's with the dirt? You always bury your ones. Why?" asked Amy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I need to, it makes the birth special."
said Drusilla.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Whatever, just don't leave new vamps to
wake up unattended, okay Dru?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I just wish we could have done it by star
light, it doesn't feel right without the starlight" said Dru.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"The sun's a star." said Shaun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, if you like the burning feeling. Sorry,
but the only vampire clich&eacute;s that aren't true are silver, garlic, and
transmutation. ... Except for Dracula, but he's a walking clich&eacute;."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I see, ... So, ... you just need muscle, or
can I, like, blow stuff up too?" asked Shaun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amy looked like she was about to cry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Have you reached a decision about my
proposal that we join forces?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Illyria, I just can't take any chances,
you are a completely unknown quantity, you are a megalomaniac. How can you be
trusted?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"How can the Watcher's Council trust you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What's that got to do with anything?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You have entered the employment of their
enemy; they do not trust you. You are also under the employment of my enemy,
and I trust you. Perhaps you would return the favour"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You still wish to reclaim the world as
your own domain, and will, how did you put it? Serve no master but your
ambition?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You assume that means doing so within a
time scale you can handle. You fail to realise how old I am, and that I intend
to do it in a manner that lasts and generates genuine loyalty, and will ensure
I inherit the combined military assets of this world at their full strength. I
can not do that simply by coercing anyone, not any more. I need to convince
people that I deserve their loyalty, I will conquer through endearment, not
intimidation."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That could take a while." said Angel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Indeed, I estimate 50-200 years."</span></p>

it violently, will you?" asked Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Not sure what to believe, but she might be
reconsidering her policy towards the recruitment minions." said Angel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Or, she's trying to fool everyone into
believing that." said Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Sorry boss." said one of the vampires.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They were just getting ready to resume
operations. It was mainly up to the cops they had turned to start turning other
cops and some of the more suitable criminals into vampires, but they had
another problem, possibly, depending on how big a problem the Slayer thinks she
has.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Willow is coming." said Drusilla, proving
Amy's paranoia to be justified.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right, that case, we need a serious
distraction in order to keep her away. We need to take that slayer out of the
picture, but in such a way that it prevents the others from working on us."
said Amy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"How do we distract her then?" asked
another vampire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

exited the airport, and met Daria at the entrance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I'm starting to remember my way around

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, sorry to drag you here again, but-"
started Daria before Willow cut her off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, I know, Amy Madison, I really,

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"So, how's it going with Tiffany?" asked Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Too early to comment really, this is my

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Is that a gun under your coat?" asked
Kennedy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Sawn off shotgun, FSHE, use it to
decapitate vampires." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"With,&nbsp; fffffishing wire?" asked Kennedy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany was headed to the Lanes when she
noticed a group of vampires chasing Andrea along the road intersecting the
street she was on, heading left.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Game on." she said, pulling her stake, she
started her pursuit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As they approached the park, the group of
vampires (10-15 approximately) fanned to Andrea's left, and they all turned right
into the park through a 2m gate in the hedge line.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She followed them and immediately collided with
two that were waiting at her two o'clock. She staked the first one, and the
second went around to her 4 O'clock. She got the second one and was about to
continue her pursuit when she noticed something wrong.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The two vampires she just staked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They weren't turning to dust.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She turned them face up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They weren't vampires.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Andrea kept running, the vampires fanned in
one direction or another, like they were herding her, but she had absolutely no
idea what to do about it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She then saw Tiffany up ahead running
towards her carrying a wooden baton or stake or something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"TIFFANY, OTHER WAY, GO!" she shouted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany ignored her and grabbed Andrea.
Andrea was spun as Tiffany started engaging the things that had been chasing
her.</span></p>

scattered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany came over to Andrea and asked "you
good there?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Andrea looked up at her and said "Err, ...
what just happened?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You were being chased by a gang who, ... were
on, ... PCP or something" said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>" ... PCP?" asked Andrea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, fucks up the face, ... " Tiffany
sounded about as convincing as the case for a ban on gay marriage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany and Andrea headed out of the park,
but they then heard sirens.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Listen, I got to, ... " Tiffany trailed off
pointing somewhere off to their left.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, okay, I'm good now" said Andrea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany then ran off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Andrea continued on back the way she had
come, hoping that Tiffany hadn't left her without being certain that those
creatures were long gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Andrea encountered some uniformed police
officers as she approached the gate she had entered the park through. Three were
maintaining a perimeter while another two were putting up crime scene tape.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She looked on and saw two bodies with ~3cm

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Ma'am?" one of the officers pointed his
flashlight at her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yes?" she responded a little uncertainly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Did you see anyone running away from this
location earlier?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane and Amanda were discussing something
out back when they got there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Daria, Willow, and, ... " greeted Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Kennedy" said Kennedy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Where's Tiffany?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Dunno, she's running late." said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right, Willow, Jane's mom, Amanda Lane."
introduced Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Hello" said Amanda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Pleased to meet you" said Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, Willow, you have had the most
experience in dealing with Amy Madison, so once Tiffany is here, we'll go over what
we have observed lately and then see if we can formulate a plan." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany entered the house and headed up
stairs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Her parents didn't seem to have noticed her
return, that was good, because she knew full well she was sporting a spaced out
look.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She placed her coat on her chair and sat on
her bed, and stared at the big round mirror on her wall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She didn't think to do anything else.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The phone rang.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Then someone picked up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>A few seconds later, her dad shouted
"TIFFANY, IT'S FOR YOU"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany continued to sit there staring at
herself for a few minutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"TIFFANY?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Eventually Tiffany stood up and walked to
her bedside table and picked up the phone "I got it dad."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She heard the click of the other phone
being returned to it's cradle, and Jane asked "You done colour co-ordinating
your stake with your outfit yet?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I, ... I don't feel like coming tonight"
Tiffany finally said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Oh, alright, no big, we got another slayer
here if you want to take the night off." said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, bye." Tiffany said, she then put the
phone back down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;"Tiff's out, say's she's feeling ill."
said Jane as she returned to the living room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, I would have preferred to do this
with two slayers, but I guess we can cope without her. Now, Amy was directing
vampires to go after cops, is she planning on simply killing them all, turning
them all, and is Lawndale were she intends to fulfil her ambitions, or is this
a diversion for a bigger operation elsewhere?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Amy had some moments, but she's not all
that. Odds are, this is where she intends to carry out her master plan." said Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"12 tons of ANFO to booby trap a house
doesn't sound very covert." said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"On the other hand, it created such a big
crime scene that it would have taken weeks for the police to piece together
enough of us to identify us. And even then the council might not have put it
down to vampires or any mystical forces, it would have been considered outside
their domain. Besides, Osama already congratulated the people that carried out
the bombing." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I wonder what would happen if a major bombing
occurs and both Al Qaeda AND Aryan Nations started fighting for credit?" asked
Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"They'd pick on each other and leave
everyone else alone?" asked Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yes, because that worked so well in Northern Ireland." commented Daria before continuing "Any other leads, anyone?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>No one added anything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay then, we need to physically locate
Amy and her gang, unfortunately, she's seen everyone of us except Jane, who
Drusilla has seen, we don't have anyone we can readily identify as being in her
gang." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We have the cops." said Kennedy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"There's that, Willow, can you hack the
police computers and find out how many cops have failed to report in since last
night?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Quinn knocked on the door of the Deckler
house and waited.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She and Sandi were seriously concerned
about Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany's dad answered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Is Tiffany in?" asked Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"She's in her room, is she alright? Just
she seemed kind of, ... different tonight." he said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I dunno, I'll ask her." said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Quinn and Sandi headed upstairs to
Tiffany's room and knocked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah?" asked Tiffany from behind the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Quinn and Sandi poked their heads through
the doorway, seeing Tiffany lying on her bed in camouflage trousers and a black
tee shirt "Tiffany, can we talk?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, sure, come on in." she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;"I hear you're trying to develop some
magical ability." said Kennedy as she and Daria headed down the street. Kennedy
was feeling for the presence of a powerful witch, which witches could
apparently do. But that had the slight drawback of working both ways, Amy would
know one of them was there. So each witch was accompanied by someone who would
not trip Amy's senses to maintain surveillance while the witch heads away to
phone everyone else to converge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, I've managed to achieve some telekinesis,
great for opening doors, but not really that far above your standard muggle."
said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Kennedy giggled at this and said
"unfortunately that's a good thing in this instance"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, I know. What's your take on the situation
with Angel?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Well, ... I am fascinated with the idea of a
vampire with a soul, before we all went to Sunnydale, they were all evil, now
it's just some."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Whereas my experience ran opposite, I
started off with Vampires being like anybody else, to learning that most
vampires are missing a soul and their evil comes from that. I found that
concept particularly strange since a lot of people with souls are just as evil."
said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;"So, you know anything about that stabbing
at the park earlier this evening?" asked Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Stabbing? ... no, nothing" said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Quinn and Sandi looked at each other, then
Sandi asked "perhaps those bodies were vampires?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"They'd have turned to dust if they were."
said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Are you on something Tiffany?" asked
Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No, ... not right now anyway" replied
Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany had remained where they had found
her, staring at the ceiling looking spacey.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Excuse us a minute." said Quinn, she then
gestured to Sandi to follow her to the floors hallway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>When they closed the door, Tiffany decided
she should try to ascertain what they thought her involvement in the deaths
was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"She looked stoned to you Quinn?" asked
Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, ... you don't think she's doing meths
or something do you?" asked Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Well, she has to be doing something." said
Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What should we do about it?" asked Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Call the cops?" suggested Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That feels wrong." said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"She killed two people, if she doesn't get
help, she'll probably do it again." said Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I just don't want to do that to her,
there's got to be another way." said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, we could wait for her to kill
another bunch of people." said Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Quinn looked at the door again, then said "We
could try another form of intervention, but we would need to play it just right.
The first thing would be to get her off whatever she's doing, that would mean
confining her so she can not access whatever it is she's using" said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, we clean her out, then what?" asked
Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Well, ... I dunno, but we might be able to
come up with something by the time she's clean. What we need to do is get her
to want to stay clean, otherwise when we release her, the same thing will
happen all over." said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"And if we can't think of anything?" asked
Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Then we'll hand her over to the police, I
just don't like the way the police handle drug users, they go over the top and
make things worse." said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Sandi thought about that last point and
said "Okay, we owe her to at least try, but how do you propose to capture her?
She's super strong."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Well, I suppose we'll have to spike her
drink tomorrow, figure out an excuse for her being absent from school and home
that will hold for a couple of weeks. We'll need a place we can take her." said
Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, how about Jane's place?" suggested
Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Good call, we should head over there and
set it up." said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They headed off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany ran as fast as she could, she had
to avoid capture.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She headed out of town into the forest that
surrounded Lawndale, figuring that anywhere inside Lawndale would get her
captured.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Quinn and Sandi want to turn her in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They should.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Yeah, that's right, Tiffany should go down
for it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>And more, 'cause jail alone, ... it's not
like she'd be the one getting her head kicked in, is it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She crossed a road and headed into the
woods.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>All the vampires looked at Amy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right, you lot, get out there, turn right,
tear that witch to shreds."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The vamps just stared at her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"TODAY, ASSHOLES!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They did as instructed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Kennedy headed off to make the call as
Daria headed on to a front yard across the street to watch the house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"KENNEDY! GORILLA! 6 O'CLOCK!" shouted
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Kennedy turned to see about 20 vamps
leaving the house and heading for her, some headed to Daria who had pulled an
Uzi ... or similar machine gun, Kennedy wasn't sure, just it was a machinegun
pistol of some kind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Anyway, she pulled her stake and engaged as
Daria unloaded her first clip into the vampires.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Kennedy didn't mention how that wouldn't
keep, since A: Daria knew that, and B: kind of busy, but at the very least
Daria would ease both their workloads.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria got through her second clip and then
started using her sawn off to decapitate the vamps crowding around Kennedy, the
last three eventually fucked off. Daria then pulled a stake herself and started
killing the vamps she had shot earlier.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Kennedy joined her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>But then Amy emerged from the house and forced
them onto the ground as some more vampires came out behind her and headed to
Kennedy and Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You two just bought yourselves a bargain
deal on pain." she said, throwing so much force at them that they could feel
their hips, rib cages, and skulls start to flex.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>An arrow took out one of the vamps, and Amy
looked around, she then stopped what she was doing and disappeared from view.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria and Kennedy sat up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amanda and Jane (with a bow and quiver) were
coming from one direction, and Willow was coming from another.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You two okay?" asked Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Well, I was concerned I was overweight for
a few seconds, but that feeling's gone now." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That house over there." said Kennedy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They all got up and headed to it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amy called Drusilla and told her to get
everyone out, and call her once they establish a new base. Then she headed off
in search of a warlock, because apparently the prank on that slayer hadn't
slowed them down at all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She wandered the back streets in search of
the local dealers place. She didn't know if she'd still have her first army
when she was done taking Willow out of the picture, but she should still have
her second army. The vampires on the thin blue line had all reported in, so-
"AHA! GOTCHA!" she marched straight through the door, and ended up in a, ...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Whoa, ... " Amy was expecting a dank looking
flat, but this looked more upscale.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You a customer, right?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She turned to one of the goons in the big,
white polished marble foyer with the twin staircases left and right, and
various pictures of naked girls with lightning coming from their fingertips in
expensive looking frames on the walls.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, if you do dark magics" said Amy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right, straight through there, cash only"
said the goon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The witches, ensouled vamp, slayer and
watcher got another 8 vampires before they heard sirens.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Willow</span><span lang=EN-GB> threw a
translucent violet ball of energy at one of the fleeing vampires before doing a
weather spell to create a load of fog.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Then they headed across the fence the
vampires had crossed and headed back to base.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What was that thing you threw at that
vamp?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"A transmutation spell, added two neutrons
to every atom under the impact site, shouldn't have any trouble finding them
now." said Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Neither will the atomic energy authority."
said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Sandi and Quinn arrived at Jane's house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Quinn knocked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They waited.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"So, think we can trust Jane to go along
with this?" asked Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What do you, ... oh, ... well, I think it
might patch things up between those two" said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They saw Jane, Willow, Joy, Amanda and
another girl enter the front yard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Quinn, Sandi." greeted Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Jane, we need to talk to you about
something." said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Alright" they all entered "but make it
quick, we're kind of in the middle of something." said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"It's about Tiffany." said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What about her?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"She's, ... earlier this evening, two people were
killed, we think it was done by Tiffany, and when we visited her later, we
found her to be, ... she looked like she was on something" said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What?" asked Joy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I don't know who else to propose this to,
but we don't want to get the police involved, and I know you two have a
dispute-" said Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>But Jane interrupted "Dispute's over,
apparently I'm only good because my mom put my soul back in me. If she hadn't
done that, I'd be out killing people, and what do you mean she killed two
people?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Two bodies found at the edge of the park
had been stabbed with a big round spike of some kind, y'know, like a stake?"
said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Shit almighty, she accidentally, ... Jane-"
started Joy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>But Jane said "On it" as she picked up the
living room phone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"This 'on drugs' look you said she had, was
it by any chance, an unfocussed stare and 'slightly stoned' speech pattern?"
asked Joy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Well, yes, like that" said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"She was in shock, I mean, ... " said Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I hope she's not doing something-" started
Joy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>But was interrupted by Jane saying "She's
not there."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, we can't look for her and attack a
nest of vampires with Amy Madison covering them, ... Right, vamps first, Tiff
later, Jane, grab your flamethrower, then everyone pile into my car, I'll grab
some extra ammo." Joy said, heading to the basement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Sandi and Quinn looked around them as the
remaining girls headed outside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"HEY, WAIT, WHAT ABOUT TIFFANY?" asked
Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Willow</span><span lang=EN-GB> and the other
girl looked at them, but couldn't answer, so they headed back out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Joy came up to them holding some sort of
harness with a sawn off shotgun holster, and a load of shotgun rounds in loops
around the waist and shoulder straps. She said "Sandi, Quinn, you two have
known Tiffany much longer than any of us here, and since you two are not
trained combatants, you two are the only people I can task with this. I want
you to find Tiffany, assess her condition, stay with her, try to get her to
come here, do not do anything that could alarm her. She ran away without coming
here, she must think we all hate her."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"She ran away after we were there." said
Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We were discussing what to do about her
drug habit, ... Oh hell, what if she overheard?" asked Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You two are still the best people to look
for her, Sandi, either you or Quinn should take this, high explosive rounds. Any
vamps approach you, shoot them in the neck, that'll decapitate them, they'll
turn to dust." Daria said, handing Sandi the harness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Sandi took it and held it saying "Explosive
rounds? What if we get picked up?" asked Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Joy looked around, then she took off her
coat, revealing several clips and a machine pistol stuffed in the waistband of
her trousers. She handed Sandi her cardigan, and put her coat back on saying
"That should go with one of your current ensembles, now go"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Sandi and Quinn looked at each other, then
Sandi put on the harness followed by the cardigan, they then headed out, Daria
waited for Jane to emerge from upstairs with her flamethrower.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Television's all spotty" said one vampire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I think it's pretty" said Drusilla.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Shaun looked at it, saw a whole load of
spots flashing all over the screen, spaced approximately 15mm apart. He said
"Television's not on, move around to the side"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The vampire did so, and fewer dots
appeared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You're radioactive, those dots are the
result of gamma photons striking the phosphor dots on the screen, you feed off
someone from Chernobyl or something?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"How should I know?" asked the vamp.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No, that's got to be hundreds of curies
there, that's real fresh, whatever's in you, and you were turned within the
last few weeks?" Shaun asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That's right" said the vamp.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amy appeared in the room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Boss, this guy's radioactive, it's like he
got hit with a neutron bomb or something" said Shaun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What?" replied Amy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I'm, like, Chernobyl, or, ... what's going
on?" he asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Probably the super friends." said Amy,
thinking, then she said "Alright, you come with me, they haven't located us
yet, and I have a gift for Willow."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I guess vamps are immune to radiation, or
this guy would be a puddle about now, but what about you boss?" asked Shaun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I got better endurance than normal humans,
just stay here." said Amy, as she headed out with her radioactive vampire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;"I think I found them, continue this way."
said Willow, pointing at their 12 O'clock.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria continued onwards.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, I feel her, she's, ... crap, she must
be in flight or something." said Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What? Like on a broom?" asked Jane,
earning a smack on the back of the head from Kennedy, Jane then said "Jesus,
take a joke."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right" said Willow, then she said "when we
get some Pizza, we need to remember not to order any garlic bread."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The three witches giggled and Jane flipped
them all off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Stop, right there." said Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That house?" asked Daria pointing at a
well lit house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah." said Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, Kennedy, Willow, you two will enter
the house and verify that we have in fact found the nest, Jane and I will cover
both sides of the house make sure no one leaves." said Daria, handing Willow
the Geiger counter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They all deployed as ordered, Jane's
flamethrower ready for use.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Willow</span><span lang=EN-GB> and Kennedy
entered through the front. Willow using telekinesis to open the door, Willow established the radioactive vampire was in the basement, and that the house owners
where still alive (the effect that stops vampires from entering dwelling spaces
without permission could be detected by some witches).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Kennedy went one way, Willow the other. They
didn't consider it necessary for anyone to watch the stairs since Daria and
Jane would enforce the killing zone outside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The house was almost pristine, lived in,
but by a family, not by a bunch of vampires.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Willow</span><span lang=EN-GB> and Kennedy
met around the back and they entered the basement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Kennedy somersaulted down the stairs and
found the vampire with the houses occupants, the houses occupants were tied up
with ductape to four camping chairs, husband, wife, two daughters (8 and 12 yo
approximately).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Willow, hold your position" said Kennedy
before going over to them, The vampire pulled a revolver and aimed it at one of
the girls, that caused Kennedy to stop.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Smart girl" said the vampire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Smarter than you" said Kennedy, she then
chanted something and the room was filled with a brilliant white light, this
caused the vampire to react by closing his eyes, his next feeling was one of
getting a stake thrown through his heart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Kennedy?" shouted Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Kennedy returned to the stairs and looked
up at Willow, whose irises were black. As was her hair, and the now visible
veins on her face, there was also a load of weird black and violet arcs emanating
off of her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Also, the presence of Amy was gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Shit, ... right, hang on" Kennedy pulled a
knife and used it to free the man. She then gave him the knife so he could free
the rest of his family and headed up to tend to Willow "Okay, I want to get you
outside now, Okay?" asked Kennedy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, okay, I can do that." said Willow, and they went out the back, where Jane was 3 metres from the left rear corner of
the house. Kennedy then said "it was a trap, just the radioactive vampire, and
Amy's gone"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;"Right" Jane left to tell Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I, ... I can't, ... I, ... ... " Willow was
struggling to focus herself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Kennedy was unsure what to do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane, Daria, and Amanda arrived in the back
yard and Amanda walked over to Willow, she asked "What happened?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I didn't see it, when I went to help that
family in the basement, something happened, then I felt Amy leave" said
Kennedy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"It was her, it was Amy." said Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amanda approached Willow and placed a hand
on her back, chanting something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Everyone watched in silence as Amanda
tended to Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amanda then asked "better?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, thanks." said Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That case, we need to get going, you need
to take the rest of the night off Willow?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yes, that would probably be wise." said Willow, still feeling a little weird.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right, let's go." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Wait, vampire dust." said Kennedy heading
back into the house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She looked through the cupboards and found
a plastic food container. She took that to the basement squeezing past the
people coming out of it. She then picked up the dust telekinetically and moved
it to the container.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She then headed back up stairs where Daria
was checking the people for radiation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"They're clean." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What are you talking about?" asked the
man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We made the vampire radioactive hoping it
would lead us to his nest, it instead came here, you wouldn't happen to have
seen a woman with brown hair accompanying the vampire, would you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yes, she materialised behind me when I
answered the door and made me invite the guy in, then they forced us all into
the basement. He stayed, she disappeared, what's this about the vampire being
radioactive?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria pointed her Geiger counter at the
container in Kennedy's hand, it was chucking out lots of curies "Kennedy, two
things. One, hold that thing telekinetically or your hand will melt. Two, get
that out of here, now"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right" said Kennedy, she held the tub telekinetically
and headed outside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I don't know how long you were with the
vampire, but I suggest you all take the day off, at worst, you'll all feel sore
for a while. Increase your intake of foods known to reduce the possibility of
the onset of cancer, consult your doctor if you have any doubts, now I gotta
go" Daria then left.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The family members looked at each other in
a state of confusion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany heard some activity up ahead, she
briefly wondered weather she wanted to investigate or move on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She decided to investigate, not like she
wanted to be alone with her thoughts in their current genre.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;"We really shouldn't be out here" said
Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Quinn and Sandi had been told by passers by
that they saw an Asian girl in camouflage fatigues run into the woods, so that
was where they were. Quinn had luckily brought a small flashlight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We got protection" said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Sure, if the vamps attack in groups of or
less than two spaced about 15 seconds apart" said Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I doubt Tiffany would want to approach any
vampires if what Joy said was true, that was the reason she accidentally killed
two people" said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Quinn, if Tiffany doesn't want to be
found, and she's in the woods, presumably trained to hide, what possible chance
do we have of finding her?" asked Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I don't know, ... I guess we should still
try anyway." said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany saw two flaming torches behind a
bush, she approached the clearing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The luminescence of the torches didn't
light up much more than approximately 1m radius around the carriers, who were,
... dressed in white robes with pointy hats and with a circle-cross-blood drop
emblem on the breast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>'Aren't there any normal people camping out
in the woods?' Tiffany thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She also noticed the vague shapes of other
Klansmen in an arc at the other side of the clearing and the silhouette of a
crucifix about 1/3<sup>rd</sup> the way in from her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The torches reached the base of the cross,
and suddenly the lack of light was alarmingly reduced, and Tiffany was fairly
certain that if any of them looked, they could- one of the torch bearers looked
right at her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She froze.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Maybe he wasn't seeing her, and if she
stayed still long enough- he pulled a berretta and aimed it at her shouting
"DON'T EVEN THINK OF MOVING!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany more than thought about it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>One back flip away from the bush prompted a
shot, which she felt sting the underside of her left breast, the shockwave
dropped below a painful level about halfway up. She ignored the injury,
anticipating possibly getting dead if she stopped, and as soon as she was on
her feet again, she headed back the way she had come at flat out buster speed. The
second shot missed, the third shot struck her left buttock just behind the
joint, causing her to yelp, but she was still able to move.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>'Useful thing adrenaline' she thought as
the forth and fifth shots sounded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;"Oh-crap-oh-crap-oh-crap-oh-crap" muttered
Sandi as they heard shots from up ahead of them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Quinn shone her flashlight towards the
origin of the shots, but Sandi grabbed it off her, saying "YOU FUCKING INSANE
OR SOMETHING?" as she turned it off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Sorry, just wondering where the shots are
coming from."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They saw flashlights in the distance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What do we do?" asked Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You're asking ME???"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"FOUND HER!" shouted someone, then there were
more shots.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Found her? I hope that's not Tiffany
they're after" said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;"You okay now Willow?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, I'm getting better." said Willow, she was sat on the sofa, rocking back and forth, her eyes still black, but her hair
was returning to it's proper colour.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, ... " Daria walked off to the others
and said "I'm considering calling a halt to the search. We're two people down,
Amy knows we're after her and will probably avoid the nest from now on. We
should instead concentrate on any cops that have been turned into vampires. We
have the list, we take them out, it'll disrupt Amy's plans." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Unless the police vampires are a diversion."
said Kennedy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Even if that is the case, it won't be very
effective. There are only five, possibly six of us here, not a big piece of our
force. They will be pinned down to their homes during the day. As for Amy, we
need to prepare our own battlefield and drag her to it." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, but what about Tiffany?" asked
Kennedy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany could feel the pain from her
gunshot wounds now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>On the plus side, there were now more
reasons not to move than to move, but but her ass and tit really hurt. She was
sure that the shot to her ass bone had done something. She couldn't be sure what,
only that she couldn't imagine an impact of that kind of energy being so benign
as to not at least chip off fragments of bone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Fortunately, she was able to get far enough
out of sight of them to climb a really tall tree, and it was sufficiently leafy
and knarled to hide her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She was seeing Klansmen moving around down
there looking for her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Hopefully they would break off soon, but
considering that someone would have to be incredibly sad to join one of these
genocidal organisations to begin with, it looked more like she would be up that
tree all night, possibly through a large portion of the day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She would just have to wait as long as it
took.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Sandi pulled her cell phone and dialled Jane's
place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There had been a load of noise and
flashlights up ahead, but no gunshots for a while.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Base of Lane." responded Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Sandi whispered "Jane, it's Sandi, we
followed some leads and we're in the forest just north west of town. We think
Tiffany's here somewhere, we also think that she's being chased by an armed mob,
there were shots, and people with flashlights are still moving around. They
haven't found who they are looking for-" suddenly there was a bright light in
their faces and someone saying "let's see those hands"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Sandi and Quinn raised their hands, looking
slightly away from the flashlight and squinting their eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Identify yourselves" asked the stranger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You first." said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Sandi Griffin and Quinn Morgendorffer"
Sandi quickly said, indicating which was which, hoping to defuse the situation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What are you doing here?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We're looking for a friend," Sandi said,
glancing around, one of the people off to the side was dressed in a white robe
and pointy hat, Sandi then added "who is a blonde cheer leader with blue eyes
who will one day bring great glory to the Aryan race." to hopefully further
placate the genocidal psychopaths.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Someone then shouted "FOUND HER!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany shielded her face with her hands as
a number of flashlights were pointed at her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She had seen one focus on the ground near
the tree, then on the tree itself, so she must have been dripping enough blood
to leave a trail, even if not enough for her to notice a drop in blood
pressure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Vampires, of course, would have found the
tree a lot faster, but vampires she could deal with.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Racist goons with semiautomatic firearms,
on the other hand, ...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Get down here." one of them said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany hesitated, trying to think of some
way she could possibly get out of this alive. They were too widely spread for
her to win a hand to hand engagement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Simultaneously, there was another gunshot,
and an intense pain in her left ankle. The movement in response caused her to
slip off the branch. She bounced awkwardly off two other branches on the way
down, landing on her ass. The back of her head struck the ground real hard, and
the whole area felt cold.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Her left ankle was numb. She could feel
pressure on it when she let the weight of her leg rest on it. She imagined the
whole area looked like burger meat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Klansmen with flashlights and pistols of various
descriptions crowded around her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There was no way she was getting out of
this alive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Even if Daria and Jane were looking for
her, they'd have to be insane to attempt to intervene.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Would they be that broken up about it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She had run Jane out of town before
establishing Jane had a soul all along, and she had made a really crap first
impression on Daria with that interrogation, which, let's face it, served
absolutely no purpose. Chasing that one vampire, she had probably let another 5
pig out on innocent people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Plus the unnecessary torture had almost
gotten Faith killed, and could have consequently killed all life on earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>And, oh yes: Those two people in the park.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Not to mention those drugs she did to hide
from reality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She was never a good slayer, she had
probably done more harm than good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, go on then, not like I'm good for
humanity." she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That'll happen, just, you interrupted our
ceremony, so we feel obligated to give you a proper send off." said one of
them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There was another shot, her right hand felt
like someone had driven a stake through it, Tiffany barely responded, not even
moving her hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Two more shots, her other hand, and her
right foot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Someone stepped on her left ankle, that
caused Tiffany to gasp, but she was too depressed to cry out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There was another shot to her right arm and
left leg, just above the ankle and wrist joints.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What's that?" asked one of the Klansmen,
sounding highly alarmed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Is that a twister?" asked another.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No fucking way, we don't get twisters that
far north." said another.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"There's another." said another Klansman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Then there were screams and thuds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany had no Idea what was going on, but
felt an enormous disinterest in it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She kept her eyes closed as all the mayhem
occurred around her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Then she felt something touch her wrists.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Her wrists began to feel better.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She opened her eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She saw, ... </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Willow?" she asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yes, I'm here, you're safe now." She moved
to Tiffany's ankles and did the same thing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany checked her hands, holding them in
front of her face and flexing the fingers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>When Willow stood up again, Tiffany decided
to get up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Her ankles were also completely healed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Willow</span><span lang=EN-GB> then went to
work on her injured breast and buttock.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany looked around at all the dead Klansmen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"So, I guess you got here this evening?"
said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, Amy and me go back: used to be
friends at one point, then she turned evil, tried to make me evil too. Then hit
me with this guilt trip spell, and now she's moved onto some sort of big bad
scheme."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany suddenly noticed that they were at
the Lane house, and she felt her BP crash, she promptly collapsed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Tiffany?" Daria approached.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Hi Daria, sorry about bunking off earlier."
said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Sandi called and said you were being chased
by the Ku Klux Klan." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, I got shot a bunch of times by them
too, but Willow took them out and healed me." Tiffany said as she sat up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Uhhh, she killed them?" asked Kennedy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, what I did was I conjured some
tornadoes and golf ball sized hailstones, like a bunch of miniguns, except they
shot ice instead of lead." said Willow, feeling kind of proud.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right, but now that's done, you'll need to
stop for the rest of the night." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I know, I know, I gotta come back now." said
  Willow as she sat down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We're not supposed to kill humans though."
said Kennedy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Neither are other humans, sounds like Willow used reasonable force, what do you think me and Jane would have had to do if we got
there first?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Hmm" Jane seemed to lose herself in
thought at the idea of dousing a load of genocidal fuckheads in gasoline and
watching them slowly die from 3<sup>rd</sup> degree burns.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Hang on, SANDI said I was being chased by
the Ku Klux Klan?" asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Shit, that's right, where are they?" asked
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The Klansmen, now in plain clothes, were
driving Sandi and Quinn back to town.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They hadn't said a word except to feign
agreement with them about the need to wipe out every non-Aryan race and every
sexual minority off the face of the earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Stop, that's my house." said Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The car pulled up to the kerb, and the two
girls got out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Thanks for the lift." said Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No problem." said the driver.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Look after yourselves." said another, they
all gave the girls a Nazi salute, which the girls returned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They then drove off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The girls slowly walking to the house,
waving and smiling to them, counting the seconds until the cone heads were out
of sight. Then they slouched forward, Quinn saying "Fucking hell, now I know
how the Swiss feel."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Sandi saying "Yeah, I need a shower, a
long, ice cold shower, lasting a couple of, like, ... decades."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Sandi opened the door and the girls
entered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Sandi decided to call Jane's place on her
cell phone as they headed up to Sandi's room. Sandi then told Quinn to phone
her place, let her mother know she was sleeping over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;"Lane the not lame." said Jane as she
picked up the phone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Sandi here, me and Quinn returned home, we
don't know what happened with Tiffany, we got picked up by some Klansmen who
gave us a lift to my place."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Oh, Tiffany's back, Willow sort of, ...
teleported over there, killed the Klansmen, healed Tiffany, and teleported her
back." said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Ah, right, okay then, we done for the
night?" asked Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, thanks." said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Good, 'cause pretending to be racists to
avoid having the ever holy crap beat out of us, ... yuck" said Sandi before
hanging up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane returned to the lounge and said "Sandi
and Quinn are safe, and they weren't happy at having to pretend to be 'one of
them' to get home safely"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Damn, ... I knew they could encounter some
dangerous characters, but I didn't think there were any Klansmen this far north."
said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"So, even running away, I still manage to
hurt people." said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Tiff, those bodies recovered from the
park, they were at least 8 hours dead when they were found." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"They were? ... Then what were they?" asked
Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Zombies. Must have been Amy reanimating
the empty wrappers of a couple of her vampire's meals." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Amy, ... I should have been helping." said
Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yes, ... but I suppose I and those before me
dropped the ball by not discussing the possibility of accidentally killing
non-combatants, in spite of it happening enough times to warrant it, most
recent event prior to tonight being Faith's killing of Sunnydale's deputy mayor."
said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Faith never mentioned that to me." said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Not surprised, wasn't her proudest moment,
set off a chain of bad decisions culminating in her attempt to get Angel to
kill her." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"She did mention torturing Wesley in order
to piss off Angel." said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"She then spent some time in Jail, ... Damn.
... Tiffany, did anyone see you leave the location where the bodies were found?"
asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"There's Andrea." said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right, we'd better check the local news
stations." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We should probably talk to Andrea." said
Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"And make us look evil, and probably get
the police to look at us very closely? No, we do that, we get the police up our
ass, we don't, Tiffany can hide here if a warrant is issued." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"So what do we do then?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We need to take out any vampire cops, we
should be able to do that tomorrow. Kennedy and I will do that, as for Amy, I'm
not really sure what we can do, we might end up calling her out as a result of
our dusting her vampire cops" said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That would be a problem with Willow out." said Kennedy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Willow? That magic Amy used on you, is
that the same stuff Rack was dealing?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yes" said Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"How'd Amy handle it without getting
hooked? I mean, she wants to rule the planet, she can't do it while hooked, can
she?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Well, we don't know for sure what she's
after. But yeah, succumbing to an addictive substance or energy would not be
helpful." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"When you get to a sufficient skill level,
you can compartmentalize the energy and carry it around until you decide to put
it somewhere." said Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Any of you able to do that?" asked Daria
of all three witches.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I can." said Amanda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What about those portal thingies, like the
one that girl almost got sucked through?" asked Kennedy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That was Winifred, if you mean that Sick Sad
World with the stage and the extra dimensional tentacles" said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Oh, ... well, what of it?" Kennedy asked
again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Winifred was showing her parents around her
lab when the phone rang.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Excuse me" she said, before going to her
desk and picking it up "practical sciences"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"There's a 'Joy Merryweather' calling for
you from Lawndale." said Harmony.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I don't know a Joy Merryweather." said
Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, you want to talk to her anyway?"
asked Harmony.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, put her through." said Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Fred?" asked the familiar voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Daria?" asked Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Nope, just her doppelganger." replied Joy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Those are pretty." said Drusilla, as she
moved her hand towards the silver coated plastic discs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Shaun grabbed her wrist to stop her
touching the discs and said "they also need to be sterile for this to work."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The two vampires had basically walked into Lawndale College and killed everyone in the various workshops they now used.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right, they are the guts of your baby."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Making me hungry."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Hmmmm, I'll find some lovely lambs." said
Drusilla as she started off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"As long as they're human lambs."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amy materialised in front of Drusilla and
asked "what have you two been doing?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Shaun looked over his shoulder and said
"making a weapon."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Out of bits of plastic and, ... other bits
of crap?" asked Amy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, out of bits and plastic and other bits
of crap arranged in a way that causes lots of damage." said Shaun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Lots of damage? ... Okay, how exactly will
this cause lots of damage?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"By exploding." said Shaun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amy rolled her eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"And, in the process, committing around 0.2%
of it's mass to energy." he continued.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amy blinked a couple of times and said
"mass to energy, ... as in, ... you making antimatter?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No, antimatter is less stable than magic,
no. This will use lithium hydride. It'll fuse lithium 7 with hydrogen, starting
it electrically. I know your primary plan was to be a little more subtle, but
you might need a plan B with a little more force, especially if the government
becomes aware of the situation and comes after us with mechanised and air
forces. I can get my prototype to work, we can take over a factory, order in
the right machines, start mass production, what do you reckon?" asked Shaun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I reckon I should have been consulted
before you started on this, but I see no reason to stop you. So keep at it, and
let me know when you are ready to test your prototype." Amy said, she then
dematerialised.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I would so love to know the physics that
allows magic to work." said Shaun as he returned to his task.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria opened the front door of their next
address and entered, Amanda having confirmed that the householder was dead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There were some bizarre effects of the
mystical laws of the universe. Vampires can not enter a dwelling without the
dwellers permission, that was what the witches were detecting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Kennedy was working addresses on the other
side of town, and Willow was out of the game in order to come off the dark
magics Amy had thrown at her. And Tiffany needed to be in school or her parents
would start to get even more antsy then they were when she had apparently
climbed out her bedroom window without hearing of anything being wrong.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As for the deaths of the Klansmen, it
looked like the police were having serious trouble figuring out what had caused
it. They hadn't released anything, beyond a shooting involving upwards of 12
people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>No ballistics to match to anything else,
but there might be the possibility that Tiffany's footprints could be matched
to those found at the dump site of the bodies. And the projectiles in the
ground under where she had fallen and her blood prints in the ground would mean
that Tiffany's DNA would be on CODIS by now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>But they were looking for a corpse most
likely, or someone with a number of gunshot wounds to their extremities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She entered the vampire's bedroom and
placed the crucifix on the vampires shoulder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The skin underneath smoked and the vampire
woke up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>At this point Daria staked him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She then left the room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Her shoes had been modified by the addition
of a layer of latex paint to the soles, she would peel those off and incinerate
them later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>So far, Amy hadn't shown herself, but Daria
wasn't going to discount that from happening. If she did, then Amanda would
have a chance. Kennedy would probably get her ass kicked, better than Daria she
may be, but she's still new to this. Right now, Amanda was their most powerful
witch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Quinn and Sandi sat next to Tiffany in
class as they normally did. Stacy's (Illyria's actually, but anyway) seat had
not been filled since she apparently stayed in LA to fight Wolfram and Hart
(Which Daria had described as a multidimensional entity out to corrupt the
world).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Sandi had dropped by Jane's house to return
the sawn off shotgun and ammunition to Joy Merryweather. They met Tiffany
there, and Tiffany said she was all right, but her cheer seemed fake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As class ended, they headed out to the
lunch room and they met Andrea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Hi Tiffany, can we talk?" asked Andrea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Sure" said Tiffany, at the same time Sandi
said "No".</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The two girls looked at each other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Quinn said "trying to lose the snobbish
personas, remember?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Alone, or with my, ... " friends? ... Tiffany
wasn't sure of her status with them right now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Err, ... your call I guess" said Andrea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We know what happened last night." said
Quinn, guessing what she wanted to talk about.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay." said Tiffany, nodding towards the
cafeteria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"After you saved me from those, ... " said
Andrea, wondering what the creatures actually were.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Vampires." said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Vampires, and we separated, I encountered
two bodies and some cops. I told them I didn't see anyone leaving the scene
when they asked. I was wondering, did you, ... I mean, I understand it was, like
an accident or something. ... It was an accident, right?" asked Andrea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany seemed to go pale, even though she
knew full well what Andrea was going to talk about. Tiffany finally said "Yes
and no, ... I thought they were vampires, I staked them, then I realised they
weren't. But it turns out that they were zombies, sent by some witch to fuck
with my head, and it's working."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Zombies? Wouldn't those have been out to
eat someone's brains?" asked Andrea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No, zombies are remote control corpses,
they only eat brains if their zombie master tells them to. In this case, they were
told to come at me and lie down when staked." said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right, ... there's something going down,
isn't there?" asked Andrea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, the witch that reanimated the
corpses, she's trying to build an empire. She's building an army of vampires."
said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Be a very nocturnal empire, ... the sunlight
clich&eacute; is true, right?" asked Andrea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yep, as is holy water, religious symbol,
stake, reflections, and invite." said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right, ... That librarian, looks a lot like
Daria." said Andrea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yes she does." said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>No one said anything for a while.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Andrea then said "Anyway, thanks for saving
  me." and got up and left.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Wolfram and Hart, Angel speaking."
answered Angel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Hi, I'm Joy Merryweather, Tiffany
Deckler's watcher, I was wondering if you could spare Illyria for a couple of
days, possibly a week?" asked a familiar voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Joy Merryweather? ... You want Illyria?" asked Angel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, is that a problem?" asked Joy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No problem, I'll send her over to you"
said Angel, happy to have the demon off his hands.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amy materialised in the room and walked
over to the bed. She lifted the quilt and nodded at the dust, getting more and
more annoyed as this was the 10<sup>th</sup> vampire cop she had found dusted. Willow and the fucking slayers were annihilating her fucking army!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Who else would it be?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Of course, you realise, that this means
war." she said, as she dematerialised.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Oh, hey boss, we're about to test the
prototype." said Shaun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Good, because we're going to need your
wonder weapons after all." said Amy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Something happened?" asked Shaun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, Superfriends took out our share of
the thin blue line, and I want to blow them up." said Amy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay" he turned to one of his assistants
and said "pack up the moulds. If we're successful, we're going to draw a lot of
attention."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You're heading to Lawndale?" asked Spike
as he and Winifred approached the elevator Illyria was entering.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I am." she replied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Then come with me, looks like trouble's
brewing." he entered the elevator with her and her armed escort.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The doors closed and Illyria asked "what is
your mission?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Spike answered "We're to investigate an EMP
that happened there, ... Fred?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"The pattern didn't look mystical, and it
happened on a college campus the same time as an explosion. No radioactivity
has been detected, so I've been tasked with investigating the incident." said
Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Radioactivity, I understand that to be the
name you give to the occurrence of highly ionizing radiation. What is this EMP
you speak of?" asked Illyria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Electromagnetic pulse, it accompanies high
energy explosions such as those caused by nuclear weapons, except this
explosion was well below the minimum I would have expected. Stuff this small,
it's usually something mystical" said Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Perhaps Joy Merryweather will know
something." said Illyria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Excuse me, Joy Merryweather?" asked Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yes, ... I detect amusement from you, why is
this?" asked Illyria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Willow</span><span lang=EN-GB> flicked
through the various channels trying to find something to distract her from her
magical cravings, when Jane walked through.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"How's it going there." asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Quite badly, I can't find anything on. And
I feel like I'm going to go nuts." Said Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Cravings, tell me about it" said Jane as
she sat next to Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Who sired you anyway?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Sired?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Turned you into a vampire" clarified Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Oh, this guy I met, brought him home,
fucked him. We drank each others blood, just seemed like a fun thing to do. Then
I woke up with haemoglobin cravings and no reflection, and that's one of the
things that's gotten Daria excited." Said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"She's a Science nerd?" asked Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"History, but her interests are well
rounded. ... In academia anyway" said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"And you seem to live for art." Said Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I'm thinking of getting into making
swords, now that they are the tools of our trade. I'm fascinated with the
manufacturing techniques for swords, I wanna see if it's possible to apply them
to those Klingon swords" said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Fold or twist?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I think Fold would be better for them,
since it would make it easier to forge weld the components together" said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Huh?" asked Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Well, the-" started Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>But Willow interrupted with "No, Amy, she's
here." there was a noise downstairs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Willow teleported out of the room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane ran to the source of the noise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Willow</span><span lang=EN-GB> materialised
at the same time Amy disappeared to find Daria unconscious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Willow</span><span lang=EN-GB> checked
Daria's life signs. She was extremely annoyed at having to use her still
tainted magic, but she used it to wake Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Willow?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane then entered the basement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Willow</span><span lang=EN-GB> helped Daria
to her feet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Daria? What happened?" asked Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Amy, she 'ported in with some metallic
cylinder and knocked me out" said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"This metallic cylinder, what did it look
like?" asked Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria pointed to a metallic cylinder on the
pottery turntable and said "like that."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There was a knock on the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It occurred to Willow that the device could
be some kind of bomb, so she placed a shield around it and said "You two get
out, I'll see if I can defuse this"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Willow</span><span lang=EN-GB> started
approaching the device when it exploded within the shield.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There was no report because of the shield,
but it was bright, and hot, and there was a crackling noise. Willow had to put
her hand in front of her eyes as she looked for a welding mask, but suddenly
realised she was on fire, so she first teleported the shield and its contents
from this dimension then she put a shield over herself to kill the flames.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She heard a hissing noise, but was unable
to see. She healed her eyes first and saw the room was black except for the
dull red of the pottery table and some glowing embers on the rafters
immediately above the table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria produced and activated a flashlight
and Jane went to the consumer unit. Jane was unable to get the main switch to
latch, she said "Someone unplug the turntable"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Willow</span><span lang=EN-GB> did this
telekinetically and Jane restored power to the house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amanda came down the stairs and looked at
the remains of the turntable and fumed "Amy did this?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yep" said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, that case, she's dead every way
possible." said Amanda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The Willow turned to her and Amanda
immediately set about healing Willow. She separated the clothes from the flesh
underneath and reduced the damage to 1<sup>st</sup> degree burns, but she said
"I keep doing this I won't have much left for Amy."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I can do the rest." said Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They then left the basement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What was that thing?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Any mystical vibes from it?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No." said Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Then my guess would be a nuke." said
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That was too small to be a nuke." said Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"There was too much energy for it to be
chemical, all that heat coming off it. Besides, look at your clothes"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Both Jane and Daria's clothes had been
bleached where they had been exposed to the light. Willow's had been burnt off
around the front, which would look sexy if it weren't for all the burns.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Ultra violet, ... how come I'm not a pile of
dust?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Sun has different mystical properties to
nuclear weapons." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany and Kennedy entered from the back
of the house. Kennedy took one look at Willow and asked "what's going on?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Amy, tried to nuke us, Willow got badly
burned, we'll need to get those looked at." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No, I can heal the burns myself, just get
that bitch will you?" said Willow, as she accepted a towel from Amanda to cover
the areas where her clothes got burned off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Sure thing Willow." said Daria, heading
back to the basement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Trent</span><span lang=EN-GB> entered the
room with Spike, Winifred and Illyria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Red? What happened?" asked Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"A nuke, apparently." said Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"When?" asked Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Just now in the basement." said Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"But, the house and the neighbours houses
are still here." said Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I used a shielding spell to contain it,
then it went off. It was the size of a 440ml can of beer."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That's too small for a nuclear weapon."
said Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No it is not." said Illyria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Did they even have nuclear physics in your
day?" asked Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"In order to cause enough neutrons to hit
the fuel nuclei, you need enough of them in a tight enough space to-" started
Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>But Illyria interrupted with "The process
you are referring to is nuclear fission, it uses elements heavier than Iron that
release energy when split"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"So the device we're looking for uses
fusion?" asked Daria as she emerged from the basement, putting her jacket over
her weapons harness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Daria?" asked Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No, Joy Merryweather." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No, Daria." said Illyria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No, Joy Merryweather." said Daria, nodding
at Illyria, who took it as a signal to go along with Daria's new name.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"As you wish." said Illyria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, but getting back to the device: Do
you have any idea how much energy is needed to initiate fusion?" asked
Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I do, but I am unfamiliar with your units
of measurement." said Illyria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right, and by the way, a Hydrogen bomb is
even bigger than a tactical nuke, so-" started Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"The device you described sounds like an
electrically powered detonator. It probably fires a burst of the particles you
refer to as electrons at a crystal composed of the atoms you refer to as
Lithium and Hydrogen." said Illyria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Winifred thought about this and then
slapped herself on the forehead "OF COURSE!!! Then you'd only need a Marx
generator and some sort of barrel to direct the electrons into the crystal. It
would be difficult to condense a Marx generator into such a small device, but
it's possible."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Great, we know how she made it, now let's
find her and take her out." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"So, plan anyone?" asked Kennedy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah" said Daria, before launching into an
explanation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The group of vampires lead by Robert
entered the alley as they headed out to find new recruits.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This was cut short when they saw an Asian
girl in combat fatigues run at them. The girl threw something at them from 15
metres away, it exploded about a metre over their heads and showered them with
a burning liquid which they accidentally breathed in as the girl drop kicked one
of them, this knocked over two more of the group, the rest then started to get
a clue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The girl picked up Robert and used him as a
club to smack the other vampires around before throwing him hard through a
fence. She then produced a couple of stakes and went about dusting the rest of
them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>By the time Robert was awake enough to get
up, he crept to the hole in the fence and peeked around. He then saw Jack at
the mouth of the alley looking left and right, he then turned and ran to
Robert.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That a slayer?" he asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, I managed to break her arm, but then
she got away" said Jack.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right, we'd better return to base, no way
we're turning people in this state." said Robert as he slowly got to his feet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amy materialised in the new base, a factory
they had taken over. The place was rigged for working with plastics to make
novelty items, some of which used microelectronics to command light patterns, this
turned out to be perfect for what Shaun wanted to do, it would only take a few
modifications to an unused room in order to start churning out nuclear
ordnance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Shaun was going over some designs for
nuclear artillery, these would be the size of a light antitank weapon. Some
vampires were out now procuring black powder and steel pipes. The factory
included a machine shop that Shaun had some vampires working in. They were
making tools that would crimp the steel pipes they were using for motors to
form rocket nozzles, and other items for some sort of explosive activated
battery. Half the science went over Amy's head, but the essence was that the
end product would shoot a bomb equivalent in energy to 1T of TNT at whatever
they wanted gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She had asked Shaun about laser weapons,
but Shaun said it was unlikely he could come up with anything that would be
better than the current generation of machineguns. He said he'd have a go and
see if he could.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amy heard a commotion downstairs. She
teleported down and saw a bunch of vampires brawling. She separated them and
asked "What's going on here?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That's not Jack." one of the vampires
said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Sorry, my nose has been numb since we
encountered the slayer." said another.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>'Jack', who the other vampires were looking
at, stepped forwards and said "that grenade she used must have fucked up my
emissions."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"It didn't affect Robert." said one of the
vampires.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amy tried to probe the vampire magically to
figure out what was going on, but he felt different to a vampire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What are you?" asked Amy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Well, I'm a vampire" said Jack.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amy walked around and saw his reflection in
the window "a vampire with a reflection?" she asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jack shrugged and said "I can not replicate
that effect."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amy tried to grab Jack's likeness
telekinetically, but was unable to affect him. She said "my magics have no
effect on you, looks like we're coaxing answers the old fashioned way." she
signalled for the vampires to grab Jack's likeness and move follow her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She soon felt the presence of another witch
"Amanda Lane" she tried to locate her, but with no success.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She picked up a handy screwdriver and made
an attempt to push it into the intruder's shoulder, the attempt failed when the
intruder kicked her across the room, and set about slaying her army.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She picked up a fire extinguisher, and ran
for the intruder about to smack him over the head. But the intruder
sidestepped, removing the extinguisher and using it to ram her into the pillar
between two of the windows. The ribs where the extinguisher's base had struck
were fractured, and Amy's head swam from the pain. She looked over at the
intruder who dropped whatever disguising spell it was using to become a leather
clad demon girl with blue mottled skin and blue/brown hair in pigtails, looking
like a short gothic Brittany spears. She was about to bring the extinguisher
down on her head when Amy 'ported out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Shaun and Drusilla had just completed the
first 6 warheads when Amy 'ported in, She was in serious pain. She said "We're
under attack." she then walked up to them and teleported them somewhere else. She
said "rebuild my army, and equip it. You have the Email address and password,
keep checking it or you will lose it." before grabbing four of the warheads
(Shaun had explained how the fuses would detonate the warhead 6 seconds after
activation, which she could do magically) and teleporting back to the factory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The vampires on the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor of
the factory (it was a 3 story rectangular building that looked like any office
building from the outside) were surprised when a female vampire with a gaudy
flamethrower and a blonde male vampire with a mundane military green
flamethrower entered and cooked the place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The vampires on the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor were
surprised by the entrance of two female nerds tooled with submachine guns, and
two more girls with stakes entered through the emergency exits.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The girls with the guns incapacitated the
vampires, the other two finished them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Then Amy materialised in the room and threw
two of the nuclear weapons at them. Kennedy failed to notice this, but Daria
saw it, she telekinetically threw the warheads back the way they came.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It was far enough to stop the four girls
getting vaporised, but not enough to stop the compression wave from throwing
them out of the windows at the end of the building. They only just managed to
grab the window sill, and the other end of the building promptly collapsed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Then two more explosions closer to them but
on the floor above them went off. They weren't hit by any of the shrapnel, but
the concrete vapours that were blown down through the hole burned the backs of
the four pairs of hands on the sill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Everyone climbed back in. The floors and
walls were so hot that the girls were further burned when they climbed back in.
They quickly stood up and headed to the stairs, wanting to be out of there
before their shoes got too hot. The fact that they were walking into a crater
to get there was slightly worrying, as was the fact the centre was glowing a
dull red.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Illyria</span><span lang=EN-GB> walked onto
the floor and said "Amy teleported out before I could kill her. What has
happened here?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Amy teleported in and started throwing
fireworks." said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"So where is she now?" asked Kennedy as she
joined them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"On the roof." came Amanda's voice in their
heads.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They all headed upstairs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amy glared at Amanda as they stood on the
larger surviving section of roof, still nursing her busted ribs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"This is not what Magic is for." said
Amanda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Bite me, or better yet, ... " Amy conjured a
ton of rattlesnakes over Amanda's head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amanda Telekinetically threw the snakes
aside, saying "you are weak of power and of will."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I can still kick your ass." said Amy. She
then conjured a fireball and threw it at Amanda, who absorbed it into her hand.
Amanda then conjured an anvil over Amy's head, but Amy threw that off the
building.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amy tried to figure out a way to engage
Amanda, who was clearly extremely powerful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Suddenly Amy felt something hit her and she
has a head rush. She turned around seeing Kennedy, the demon hunter, the Asian
slayer, the blue mottled demon with the pigtails, and a nerd she never met
before standing in a line.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The energy was vaguely familiar. She
started "What do you-" but was interrupted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Klyv mat chyvma, klvma chyt" said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Amy noticed the floor about half a metre in
front of her opening into a portal, it sucked at her. She was about to teleport
out when she heard Daria say "Catch". She looked up and caught the object, a
red grenade. It exploded before she could think to throw it back, and she felt
a searing pain and a bright yellowish light engulf her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Then she fell through the portal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria looked at the others on the roof and
asked "we done?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We are." stated Illyria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Peachy" Daria said. Then she looked around
and asked "where's Jane and Spike?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Suddenly Jane and Spike burst through the
door to the roof ready to incinerate something. Spike asked "What's left?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Nothing" replied Daria, she then said "we
should-"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Willow</span><span lang=EN-GB> was
surprised to hear Daria say "-get out of-" and turned to see the group had
materialised in the lounge beside her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria then looked around at her new
surroundings and said "Yeah, ... this should work"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They also noticed that the burns were
healed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right, I need to get some sleep now, all
that magic wiped me out." said Amanda as she headed up stairs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Hmm, a pity we couldn't get our hands on
one of those nukes." said Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I can help you design them" said Illyria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah? ... Looks like we might have a use for
you after all then." said Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We shouldn't do it at the law firm, I'll
see if I can get us a workshop that can not be monitored by them." said
Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Illyria</span><span lang=EN-GB> turned to
Daria and asked "Do you need me for anything else?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I think we're done for now, thanks for
your help Illyria, it was greatly appreciated"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Your appreciation is irrelevant."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Damn Amiga, Blue makes even you look
sociable." said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Bite me." Said Daria</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Really? Thanks" said Jane, as she vamped
out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Real cute." said Daria, who headed to her
room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I should get home." said Tiffany, she headed
out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Where'd you send her?" asked Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Amy?" asked Winifred, at Willows nod, she
said "somewhere really nasty. Same place I sent my physics professor when I
found out it was him who sent me to Pylea."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Sweet" said Willow "She deserves it after all
the shit she put me through. I'm still having to avoid spell casting and it's
driving me nuts."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Kennedy walked up to her and said "let's
see what we can do about that shall we?". She then sat down and started kissing
  Willow, feeling her up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane looked put off while Spike watched
with a boner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>And Illyria looked bored.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Well, I think I'll just go to bed now
before I see something that really weirds me out." said Jane, heading up
stairs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Spike looked up at her and asked "a bit
early, innit?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane looked back and said "well, what else
is there?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We could go out and kill things." said
Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Now you're talking." said Jane as she
returned to the ground floor and grabbed a stake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I believe I will also join you." said Illyria, who picked up another stake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Winifred looked from the door to the
lesbians, to the door again, and then headed upstairs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>~-~</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria was starting her report when she
heard a knock.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah?" she asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Winifred poked her head around the door and
asked "I was wondering if I could talk to you about something."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria gestured for her to grab a seat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Winifred sat down and asked "how is it you
can have such a rapport with Illyria after what I heard she did to you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Because it was what Tiffany was doing to
me that gave her the idea. Tiffany was doped up on something and was chasing
Jane, unaware at the time Jane had a soul or how frivolous her pursuit of Jane
was. Then when I was released after Illyria was convinced I had no information
for her, and she had just abducted Willow. Faith and Tiffany weren't exactly
sympathetic. So when they showed up again, and my sister distracted them, I got
out and set a trap for them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Good thing it failed, because if I had
succeeded, Illyria would have blown a massive hole in the world and dislodged
it from it's orbit. The moon would also have been affected, it's wonky orbit
would have caused additional problems, I almost killed all life on earth with
my wrath." Said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"And that brings you close to Illyria because, ... ?" prompted Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"It doesn't, in fact, I was pretty mad at
her for the two weeks of my suspension from school. But I now had this reaction
to my anger that it could have disastrous consequences. So when Illyria showed
up in New York in the middle of us planning to extract you from that hell
dimension, it occurred to me to ask her if she could help, and to recruit her
if she could." Said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Do you really believe she can ever be a
force for good?" asked Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Possibly, ... the girl's a child in this
world, and I don't just mean her shell, she's starting from scratch. In order
to gain any power, she needs to earn the loyalty of those around her, I think
she understands that, she also wants Wolfram and Hart gone, in every dimension
they occupy. If she can get them off our planet, it may be possible to keep
them that way long enough for us to become strong enough in force to harass
them from earth until all dimensions are free of them." Said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"A doozy of a challenge." said Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"It will keep her on our side for the time
being. I just hope it doesn't come to a case of our knife in her back first."
Said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Hmm" said Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>After a few seconds of awkward silence,
Daria said "So, you did physics, right?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, still do in fact, most people would
say magic has nothing to do with physics, but it's a part of the universe, so
it's included"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They launched into a conversation about the
physics of magic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Illyria partook in the violence as Spike
and Jane engaged the large formation of half-breeds in the cemetery, she had
briefly accessed Stacy's memory when in response to Spike's question of "you up
for it?", Jane said "in response I'm gonna have to say, MORTAL KOMBAT!", the
memory was linked to a computer game that simulated a pair of combatants
without giving the players much real insight into how to carry out a fight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane had run in with Spike a couple of
seconds behind and they started fighting immediately.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Illyria joined in and the ensouled half
breeds found themselves standing around with nothing to do as Illyria engaged
the remaining hostile half-breeds on her own.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No way we're going to keep up with her"
said Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Unless we have a witch speed us up." said
Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Illyria</span><span lang=EN-GB> eventually
finished the group and returned to Spike and Jane saying "I will find more
enemies to kill. Are you interested or would you two like to act on your mutual
lust?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>That drew "Hey"s from both of them, but
they looked at each other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No live sperm, immunity to STDs, Wadd'ya
think?" asked Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I think we need to find a nice soft grave
to have sex on." said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Illyria</span><span lang=EN-GB> nodded and
headed off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Tiffany?" asked Mr Deckler.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah?" asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Where have you been?" asked Mr Deckler.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Usual: Park, Zen, town centre, here, why,
what's up?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Tiffany, some terrorists blew up a factory
tonight, what if they also do kidnapping?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"They touch me, I guess, I'll just have to,
make them envy the dead, I want to get some sleep now, we done?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Mr Deckler finally said "go to your room"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>After he heard the door close, he returned
to the living room and sat next to Mrs Deckler. He switched on the news,
adjusting the volume so it would drown out a whispered conversation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I'm getting seriously worried about her,
and I don't think the direct approach is going to work" said Mr Deckler.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I hate that we might have to do this."
said Mrs Deckler.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I know, I just want to get rid of those
dreams where Tiffany's stabbing people at random because she's imagining
they're vampires or some other delusion." said Mr Deckler.</span></p>
