href="http://www.stardestroyer.net/Empire/Science/Nuke.html">http://www.stardestroyer.net/Empire/Science/Nuke.html</a>
to steer me right when it comes to conventional nuclear weapons, also Dervish,
Brother Grimace, Roentgen and Ranger Thorne helped me with this, the Bush
Speech was written by Brother Grimace because my one sucked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The hardest part about using a sword was moving her feet
correctly, because the force to accelerate the sword had to go somewhere, but
Daria was getting the hang of it. She had already gotten Tiffany to use it, and
because of her existing proficiency with martial arts, she could pick it up in
about 2 days. But Daria was still having to get her swings right, so she was
still practicing with her katana in the back yard of the Lane house.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Jane was also practicing, but
had been practicing since Tiffany and Andrew had returned to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
w:st="on">Lawndale</st1:City></st1:place>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria had also gotten her automatic shotgun, a <a
href="http://world.guns.ru/shotgun/sh16-e.htm">USAS 12</a> (with 20 round
drums), the weapon looked like a mutant M16 crossed with a <a
href="http://world.guns.ru/smg/smg29-e.htm">tommy gun</a>, she had found it of
use when picking off vampires from a vantage point (this would be to back up
Tiffany in the event that they encountered a larger enemy formation then they
could handle). But she knew that it would be useless if her position got
overrun and Jane wasn't there with her flamethrower to maintain a defensive
perimeter. She did have her Mac in the event she needed to incapacitate a lot
of them, but she would be hard pressed to change the clip in the middle of a
fur ball, even if the next one was taped to the one she was already using. This
had been obvious to her from the start, so she had been training to use the
sword ever since.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Daria checked her watch "where
is she?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Jane looked over at her and said
"I dunno, you don't think she scored some collateral damage again, do you?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Statistically that's rare. Slayers can sense vampires, even
Buffy didn't experience that many fur balls in Sunnydale. I should call her,"

<p class=MsoNormal>"So, I told the watchers council what's up, and we discussed
weather or not to recall me, because if Tiff's out, then there are other
slayers that need my attention," said Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Slayers may not be that mobile,
but you watchers sure are," said Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's not unheard of for potential slayers to never come to
the attention of the Watchers Council, and there are some cases where contact
is impossible to make anyway. Some countries restrict the freedoms of women so
much that any watcher trying to make contact would either get themselves
killed, or themselves and the slayer killed. Other situations that are more
recent are where potentials are in the police or armed forces, that makes
contact neigh impossible since we'd come off as stalkers to the cops or would
have almost no access at all."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"But now all slayers are active, those who are in the police

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria and Jane walked up the street and, using mirror tiles
glued to rings on their fingers, set about identifying the vampires. They had
their swords concealed under their jackets, the handles pointed down, the
swords were held in place by a Velcro strap on the holster that went to a pad
on the hilt. Jane's red shirt concealed the handle, but Daria's jacket stopped
at the waist, so she used her shotgun bag to conceal it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"11 o'clock, the redhead," said Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>The redhead was with two other
girls who weren't vampires, which meant they were prey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"You sure it's this way?" asked
Daria, trying to make them seem lost.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Yeah, I think," said Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Daria got a book out and they
both looked through it as the group passed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Eventually the group had passed,

dark streets, keeping their distance from any possible concealment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>They stayed alert, suddenly
wondering if this was a good idea.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"That's a nest," said Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Sure is," said Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>A human left the nest, this
person had bite marks on his arms, some old.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Blood Whores," said Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Sure are," said Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Do we bother?" asked Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"No, vampire brothels are to be
left alone, this is another reason why we follow before engaging," said Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>They saw Quinn and Sandi run
along the street crossing the front of the brothel, bows in hand and quivers on
their backs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"The fuck?" asked Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They then saw a bunch of vampires, one with two arrows in
his chest, another with three, obviously none of them in the right place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>~-~</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Quinn and Sandi kept running.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"My Mom will KILL me if I come
home late AND dead," said Quinn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"I told you this was a bad idea,"
said Sandi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Did not."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Did too."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They turned a corner and after weaving around some trash
cans, found their exit cut off by a wire fence topped with razor wire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>They looked back and saw the
vampires already blocking the way they had come.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Now what?" asked Sandi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Quinn took another shot at the
inbound vampires.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>She got one, Sandi joined her in
firing, but they quickly ran out of arrows.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The vampires surrounded them. The one with three arrows in
him said "I like my meals nice and tender," as he approached Quinn, who was now
regretting their failure to consider the possibility of having to go hand to
hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then Jane appeared behind him, jumping from dumpster to
dumpster, drawing their attention from them. She jumped onto the gang, using
their shoulders as stepping stones, getting between the gang and the fence. She
then decapitated three at once with her katana.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Get down or get behind me,"
Jane said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Sandi and Quinn moved to Jane,
but they were grabbed by the remaining vampires.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Now what?" asked Quinn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Pull your socks up," said Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane jumped, moving her feet 270 degrees around, winding her
body up for the swing, and at this point Sandi and Quinn got it. They were in a
deep bow by the time the sword passed over them, and moved behind Jane the
instant the vampires turned to dust.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn then looked behind her and saw red hairs mixed with
the dust, she checked her hair, and found it had shortened about 10cm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two vampires picked up the bows that had been abandoned,
pulling two arrows from their friends. They didn't move fast enough to get
their shots in, they did manage to duck Jane's first swing, and the four were
weaving around Jane's attacks. They were not getting a shot in, the vamps
without the bows pulled arrows out of themselves and made to stab Jane. Jane
had not forgotten them. One was decapitated, the other fell on his ass. The
ones with the bows drew, but Jane sliced through the bows before they could
fire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The remaining Vamp that didn't have a bow that was going to
manually stab Jane got decapitated by a HE round from Daria's shotgun, since Daria
was too tired from running to start slicing. So it was left to Jane to finish
the last two, Daria picked up the two arrows and threw them to Sandi and Quinn,
deciding they'd be better off grabbing the vampires attention than becoming
human shields.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane decapitated another, and the last vampire who was well
aware that the girls behind him were now armed, froze as he tried to think his
way out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>He ran out of time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane looked around before holstering her sword, and Daria
walked straight to Quinn saying "ARE YOU COMPLETELY INSANE?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Quinn had no response.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"MOM WOULD HAVE A STROKE IF YOU
TURNED UP DEAD! WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU THINKING?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn looked in surprise at Daria, which wasn't the 'Getting
yelled at for doing something wrong' kind of surprised, that had passed. This
was the 'Did you just say that?' Kind of surprised.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Daria quickly reviewed what she
had just said, and winced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Go home, and tell no one," said
Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Quinn and Sandi headed home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>As soon as they were gone, Jane
turned to Daria and asked "Think she'll tell?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"I don't know, but she'll want
to know for sure weather or not I'm Daria" said Daria, she then said "Come on,
let's go home."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Civus Vail looked up as one if
his guards entered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Excuse me master, but I have an
important matter to discuss with you."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Go on," said Civus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>The guard then lifted his arm
and shot a rocket at him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Civus erected a shield in time, but the shield was set up an
appropriate distance away for a HE warhead, not the nuclear warhead it in fact
was. He was blinded by the flash and felt the blast energy feed back through
the shield into his body, knocking him out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He didn't see the Guard turn back into <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>,
or see her reload the device under her arm from her back pack magazine. The
trigger mechanism automatically extended into her palm, she lifted the cover
off the trigger and shot the second rocket into Civus's chest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place> looked once again
at the launcher strapped to her arm, impressed at Winifred's handiwork: the
device consisted of a back pack that had a magazine full of rockets in their disposable
launching tubes, and a power pack for the underarm launcher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every connection between the rocket package and launcher,
mechanical or command, was magnetic, that allowed rapid assembly, loading, and
firing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another thing Winifred had done was find a way to use the
metal known as sodium in the propellant, this seemed insane to Spike and
Wesley, but Winifred had explained it to Illyria's satisfaction, it had
provided a better rocket fuel for them extending the range of the system
significantly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Humans: kind of weak, but kind of smart. Nothing like the
weapon she was wielding now would have been practical in her time. Humans had
exceeded her expectations by not only banishing the pure demons such as
herself, but also by developing the kind of industrial and technological capabilities
she could never have dreamed of.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>But it did take a few hints from
her to lead Winifred to think of designing this type of warhead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place> was brought back to

<p class=MsoNormal>Two guards entered, having heard the noise on account of not
being deaf and having a nervous system capable of sensing touch. <st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal>Wesley pulled up besides Izzerial's car as it departed, and
Winifred killed the two in the back first, the driver took too long to come up
with any kind of plan (such as smashing the cyclists into the row of cars
parked on that side of them) and ate the last burst after Izzerial.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just a pity there are so many con artists in the trade,

to see Angela Li, accompanied by Val and a camera crew.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The crew were dressed smart-casual. Val was dressed in a
purple suit jacket with a grey shin length skirt, a silver crucifix on one

<p class=MsoNormal>Sandi decided to answer this question. She walked up to Val
saying "well, considering that this was a private conversation amongst
ourselves, and that eavesdropping is rude, and your opinions of us weigh less
than a clean vacuum, my answer will have to be kiss my highly fashionable ass."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yeah, it's not like I'm the leader of anything right now. Doesn't
seem to be any point in resurrecting the fashion club, wasn't any point in it's

<p class=MsoNormal>"You're fine the way you are, Quinn. You never had any

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"HANG ON, how'd you know I was
here before?" asked Val.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria was returning from lunch when she passed Tiffany and
her parents in the hallway. Angela was a few metres behind the Blum-Decklers. She
gestured for her to stop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Soon as the Blum-Decklers were out of sight, she said
"Earlier, when I was giving Val a tour of the school, you decided to antagonise
her on camera."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Yes," replied Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Do you like your job?" asked
Angela.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh lighten up, fundies get laughed at here. This gets to
the public whose opinion you care about, they'll cheer us on because they think
fundamentalists are full of shit, and because it's Val who's presenting. I just
brought some honour to this sacred institution," said Daria, she then smiled
and resumed her course to the library.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I dunno, but I want you to talk to her this evening. Don't
cause an incident, it's more vital you maintain the ability to talk to her,
just gather what information you can get her to volunteer," said Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"It could be something that

<p class=MsoNormal>"Sandi and Quinn are going to talk to Tiffany now, she was
sent home from school today. Apparently something happened between Tiffany leaving
my sight at the start of Easter, and me calling her last night when she was
running late. I'm not sure how to approach her about it right now, she knows I
will support her in the event of an accident such as the one she thought she
had, but I can't compel her to disclose anything to me. I need to find out what
happened in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Barbados</st1:country-region></st1:place>
over the last few weeks." said Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'll get on it, but we're busy here, your slayer isn't the
only one that we have lost contact with. We have hundreds refusing to
acknowledge our calls, and hundreds have just disappeared, we're trying to find
commonalities now. The timing of them all is too tight for this to be
accidental, we believe someone is making a move against us. We've buttoned the Council
premises up tight in case someone tries to hit us, and we're sending a team
from place to place to place chasing leads." said Giles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That's based on having <a

up</a> and most our forces slain by bringers when we went against the First Evil.
Now, it's possible we may have over compensated as a result, but I am not going

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria's right index finger entered view, the finger tip had
been split and retracted back, revealing the tip of some sort of tool, when she

socket under the bed, she then jumped through the window, and all these alarms
started sounding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There were megaphone enhanced voices telling Daria to stop,
heather walked up to the window and watched as Daria looked around, guards

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria then ran to the inner fence, and cut through it with

the window to Angel's office was too stiff for them and they were getting

microphone would have been more appropriate, but they couldn't find one.

coming out).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I felt something was wrong the second I got home, the
occupants aura had altered, I checked on Trent and you to find out if it was
one of you." said Amanda.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Occupants aura, ... " said Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"The occupants aura is the force
that stops uninvited vampires from entering a dwelling." said Amanda.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Right. Okay, and you quickly
found I was the dead one?" said Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes, ... I wasn't pleased that you were dead, but I couldn't
bring myself to slay you. So I rushed out to gather the equipment needed to
return your soul." said Amanda.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"You got home to find something
wrong? What were you returning from?" asked Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"It was a, ... the trip had lasted
several days." said Amanda.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Which means the length of time I could have been running
around without a soul, ... Okay, thanks mom." said Jane, she then left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Daria emerged from the basement
and asked "problem?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Trying to get Angel or Spike, need to find out what they
remember of their time when they were without their souls." said Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Why?" asked Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"My mother re-ensouled me several days after she had
departed on a long trip, so, ... well, ... " Jane gesticulated as she tried to
figure out how to broach the topic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"You're concerned you might have
done something prior to your first memory as a vampire?" asked Daria.</p>

looked at the floor.</p>

asked Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane took a breath and said "There's this boy, 12-14 years
old. I lead him into a dark corner in an arcade, I then cover his mouth and
drink him dry. Been dreaming that a lot lately, first it was fragments, then
it's been getting more and more real. And then today, a woman knocked on the
door, showed me a photo with the boy on it, asking if I had seen him."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Ah." said Daria in response.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>They stood in silence for some

<p class=MsoNormal>"Eww, Joy, ... Listen, we just talked to Tiffany, she thinks

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>She waited for him to sit down
at his desk before initiating her strike.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She lowered her binoculars, startling the seagull that had
perched on her hand, and loaded the first rocket. The small plasma screen in
the side of the handle included a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCIP">CCIP</a>
system calibrated to the rocket's trajectory, and the immense heat of the
exhaust cloud would ensure the target would become visible again within 700
milliseconds of the first impact.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>She shot the first rocket and

cleared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All the windows in that room and neighbouring (sideways, up
and down) floors had been blown out, Marcus stood up and looked out towards her.
She realised the rocket was too slow, she needed to be able to predict his
location at impact to be certain of a kill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>She shot the rocket at the wall
behind Marcus, just as Harmony was approaching the door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'><st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>

the ground.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>He struck the pavement that divided
the carriageways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some people stopped their cars and emerged to render
assistance to Marcus, some of them were looking up at her, since they had seen
the second rocket smoke trail as it had entered the building (nuclear ordnance
not exactly being the quietest items invented).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place> had her solution,
but she found herself considering the opinions of her new allies with regards
to the deaths of non-combatants, the nearest four would be vaporised, those
driving past would range from fatal burns and massive internal haemorrhaging to
shrapnel and various blunt force injuries, some of their vehicles would be
thrown off the road.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But if she allowed Marcus to recover, her mission would be a
failure, and he would reprioritise Angel Investigations as the immediate
threat, and would probably not come unprepared for Angel Investigations new
weapons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Marcus didn't move, neither did the people who had seen her
launch the third rocket, they just stared as the rocket came at them, not
realising they could save themselves, or that they would die if they were that
close to the warhead when it detonated, Illyria couldn't comprehend their lack
of movement, it was totally illogical.</p>

Giles to compare this new information with-" started Daria, but the other
program started flashing. She checked on it, there were 5 missing kids, one of
them had been killed by a vampire, all were found dead too far away or under
conditions that excluded the attack Jane had described.</p>

Daria, but she was interrupted by the ceiling falling down from above them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Except the plaster was being thrown too hard for it to be

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria and Jane started picking the splinters of the batons

<p class=MsoNormal>The smoke rose through the hole in the ceiling, revealing a
hole in the wall behind where the desk had been, and a sort of crater where the
floorboards had been pushed down between the beams, which were bent and
splintered, they no longer looked like they could support someone standing on
them near the crater.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria grabbed her phone and started dialling, there was
another explosion above them, but the greater distance between the roof and

<p class=MsoNormal>Sandi and Quinn were stood around Tiffany's window as they
tried to figure out where those bangs were coming from. They had seen some
smoke rising up, and saw one blast being deflected by something invisible to
them, and Tiffany was just lying on the bed, probably unsure weather what she
heard was in fact real.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Quinn and Sandi did as told, the
Blum-Decklers followed with Tiffany.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once they were all outside, Daria turned to the Blum-Decklers
and said "you believe all this talk from Tiffany about vampires, demons, and
any other weirdness she mentioned to be some sort of hallucination, right?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mr and Mrs Blum-Deckler nodded and Daria said "that's
understandable, but I'm afraid it's all real. You all saw how the mortar fire
followed Tiffany around the house? The First Evil can monitor any place it
chooses to while simultaneously commanding it's minions known as bringers. That's
how it managed to follow Tiffany around the house, tried to take me out earlier
when I made the connection. Now, I need you to come with me, and I can't tell
you where we're going, just get in your car and follow me, Sandi, with them,
Quinn, with me, I have a plan, just have to trust me, okay?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>The Blum-Decklers nodded and
everyone went to their vehicles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Daria headed back to the Lane
house, Jane said "WHAT PLAN? YOU HAVEN'T GOT ONE AT ALL, HAVE YOU?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"I will have one, just trust <st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They arrived back at the lane house, Daria then told Jane to
grab her flamethrower, while she herself would grab whatever ammunition and
firearms she could carry, Quinn was to grab the swords, stakes and other
contact weapons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>The Blum-Decklers pulled up
behind Daria's car and entered the house.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>~-~</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn picked up one of the swords, she couldn't resist
drawing it part way out of its holster, and then giving a reverent "whoa." as
she realised this was one of those ultra sharp swords the Japanese had.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She quickly remembered that they were in a hurry, so she put
it back in its holster and started gathering the swords and axes from the wall
rack.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria emerged from the basement with two Uzi type guns
stuffed in her waistband, a vest full of longer shotgun shells (probably also
explosive), a sports bag full of probably more guns and ammo, and a big fuck
off rifle bag.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Jane came down stairs carrying
that flamethrower.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"We need to get a move on." said
Daria, as she noticed Quinn was still there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Quinn obliged and carried the
weapons out to the car.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria handed the guns to Sandi, and fished 5 long clips out
of the bag, saying "Bringers are dead easy to kill, just watch your ammo, these
things will use up a clip within 2 seconds", she then pointed out the various
controls on the weapon, quickly explained how to use it, and then headed to her
car telling Quinn to drive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>It was now dark enough for Jane
to release the blinds on the windows in the back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Quinn got in the drivers seat
and asked "where to?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Head west for now." said Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Suddenly Daria's phone rang,
then it quit just as Daria went to pick it up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Amanda suddenly experienced a
dizzy spell, saying "okay, I'm wiped. I'm sorry, I haven't been well lately."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Quinn, start evasive action."
said Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Right." said Quinn, as she started
weaving, doing her best to avoid accidentally ruining someone's front lawn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Wonderful." said Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>The Blum-Decklers were weaving
around behind them as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was an explosion behind them, it took out the front
left wheel of the Blum-Decklers car, and lifted it almost over, but the car
came back down again, pointing off to the right, it crashed into a house, Daria
stopped and reversed to them, Amanda seemed to come to life again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Sandi helped the Blum-Decklers
squeeze into Daria's car and asked "What the hell just happened?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Quinn then saw a trail of smoke
overhead moving off to the horizon, another explosion occurred about three
metres over them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Oh, that's just a maverick."
said Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The trail disappeared over the roofs and there was a flash
just over them, followed by a cloud of smoke illuminated by a fire from
underneath.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>They heard the bang several
seconds later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"The robot, right?" asked Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"What?" asked Sandi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Sorry for almost getting you lot killed, but we needed to
take out the bringers now, and since the First Evil could monitor us all, I
needed to make it look like I had no idea what to do about it." said Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Amanda then said "I would have
had to stop shielding us eventually anyway."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Once they were all on board, Quinn
started off again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"So, no more bombardment?" asked
Mr Blum-Deckler.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"For the moment." said Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"So where to?" asked Quinn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Take the next right." said
Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>~-~</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While explaining that she thought was under attack from an
81mm mortar, Daria had tutted '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F16">F16</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM-65">AGM65</a> <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_air_support">CAS</a>' in Morse code,
referring most probably to the F16 fighter/bomber, the AGM65 optically guided
missile, and CAS the mission profile, close air support.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So Robodaria blagged her way onto an airbase, having hacked
her way through the USAFs computers to prepare the aircraft (loaded with an <a
href="http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/equip/an-alq-131.htm">ECM</a> pod,
two drop-tanks on triple pylons with AGM65 Mavericks, and 6 <a
href="http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/dumb/mk82.htm">mk82 1/4T bombs</a>
with retarding fins on triple pylons, plus the <a
href="http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/missile/aim-9.htm">AIM9 Sidewinders</a>
that normally inhabit the wingtip <a
href="http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/equip/lau-7.htm">LAU7</a>s) and had
sent a couple of other aircraft to jam <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWACS">AWACS</a> on an 'Exercise', and got
to Lawndale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next problem had been that there were no longer any
shots being fired, she texted 'where's the party' to Daria, hoping for
instructions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria had been driving through Lawndale at the time, she
started weaving, and at that point, a muzzle flash appeared several blocks away,
it was a mortar on the back of an APC, she immediately pointed the aircraft at
it, locked the AGM65, and fired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Now she needed to hide the
aircraft and wait for further instructions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>She located an airstrip that had
no signs of use what so ever, like it had just ran out of business.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The runway was littered with large pieces of debris, so she
imagined lots of small pieces too, the sort of stuff that could be picked up by
the wheels and thrown into the airframe when she landed, and could get sucked
into the engine when she tried to take off if she was unable to clear it all up
before she was needed again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>She shut off the engine and made
her silent approach, carefully draining the aircrafts inertia as it fell.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>She would hide the aircraft
until it was needed again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Can't get through." said Daria,
as she tried to call Giles again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They were holed up in the Lawndale Magic Box, and Daria had
told Amanda to use some of the inventory to make a shield that Amanda wouldn't
have to use her own power to sustain "-before the First starts using something
in the 200mm high velocity range.", and now Daria was taking a moment to call
Giles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Think they've been blown up
again?" asked Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"No clue, let's check the news,

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes." said Derek Jamalia, the proprietor of the Lawndale
Magic Box, he led Daria upstairs to his office, and turned on the news.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Daria saw the watchers council headquarters
behind a police cordon on CNN with the subtext 'Vampire cult takes hostages'.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"The police are trying to negotiate with the cult leader,
one Rupert Giles, who heads an organisation known as 'The Watchers Council',
which is thought to be involved in a mind control conspiracy. The British Prime
Minister has issued the following statement."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>The image then turned to Tony
Blair and his cabinet in the meeting room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"While I'm still waiting for all the facts to be uncovered,
it looks like we have uncovered a vast conspiracy to corrupt the youth of
several nations, possibly for terroristic purposes. Right now, all my staff are
busy discussing the situation with their counterparts in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">America</st1:country-region>, <st1:place w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>,
and elsewhere. As for the watchers council base, the police are currently
negotiating with the occupants of the building in an attempt to resolve the
situation peacefully, and secure the release of the girls they are holding
hostage. That is all we have for the moment, any questions?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Daria turned to head back down
stairs but found everyone except Amanda and Jane had come upstairs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Yes, Giles mentioned this just
before he was cut off, has the Watchers Council been blown up again?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, but it's under police siege. There's an investigation
going on, they think it's a terrorist cult out to brainwash the worlds youth,
and because the link with terrorism has been assumed, and the watchers council
are thought to be holding hostages, the SAS are most likely planning their
attack right now, and these guys do not have a stun setting if you know what I
mean." said Daria, making sure everyone in the room understood the situation
perfectly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The door opened, it was <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address
w:st="on">Jane Lane</st1:address></st1:Street>, one of the cultists, she said
"What?" in a manner that was more at home with an encounter with an annoying
visitor than Lawndale Police Department's Special Weapons And Tactics unit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>After trying to enter, and

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes, we have a warrant to arrest you and your associates
for the abduction of the Blum-Decklers, Sandi Griffin, and Quinn Morgendorffer,
you need to shut down whatever you have generating this forcefield, and
surrender peacefully, if you resist arrest, you will be in deeper trouble than
what you are thought to be responsible for thus far." said Dave.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Joy looked behind her, thinking
about her response.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That would require you all to leave the area protected by
the shield. And then, because they think we're a cult, they are likely to
dismiss what you say as a conditioned response. You'll all be held for 48 hours
in protective custody or committed for psychiatric examination, that would make
you vulnerable to more bringer attacks, you could even be captured on the way
to the holding facilities and used by the First Evil as hostages." said Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"So we're all going to be

walking across the corridor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He took a couple of seconds to think who it was, because she
was familiar, but not from her- "<st1:place w:st="on">Tara</st1:place>?" he ran
to the room the woman had entered, wondering how- "The First!" he realised, he
entered the room and saw Tara standing near the window looking at a bookshelf

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria looked at her watch and shrugged "until SWAT breech

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, one problem we're probably never going to get over is
the First Evils surveillance capabilities. The reason the operation in
Sunnydale worked is that the First Evil didn't know what Spikes amulet was
going to do, the numbers of<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'> <a

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The android used the ground radar to check each
corresponding location to discover what kind of vehicle they were in, she had
been ordered to prioritise armoured vehicles such as self propelled guns, APCs,
and the like, next would be any group of bringers big enough to be worth using
a bomb on, or worth strafing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Hopefully the air force would be
looking somewhere else for the aircraft, or she'd have to eject too early to do
anything useful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She located the first bringer group that had a corresponding
radar contact, and identified it as an <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M109_howitzer">M109</a> self propelled gun,
there was another contact, that was also an M109.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These were spaced 300 metres apart, there were two other
contacts in the forest on either side of the firebreak, spaced 300 metres
apart, the targets formed a square.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>One of the M109s hatches opened,

<p class=MsoNormal>It was an <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIM-92_Stinger">FIM92 Stinger</a>, the robot
entered a steep dive, but the bringer launched the missile before she was out
of view, calling "Atoll, Atoll" she started dumping flares, and managed to
avoid getting hit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>She then turned towards the
bringer armoured units, arming the mk82s, she then had a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare">triple A</a> warning
light up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She switched to the AGM65s and locked onto the radar source,
but it was concealed by the forest, and the Maverick needed to see the target.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Making a note to next time pack some <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HARM">AGM88</a>s, she switched to guns and
strafed the triple A unit, the radar was knocked out, she then went back to
mk82s and took out the nearest M109 to her, placing the bomb exactly over the
magazine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She then turned and climbed at the same time, putting her
over the other unit, she had to light the burner to prevent a stall, which
would give the bringer with the stingers a beautiful target if that bomb didn't
get them first.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The other concealed target turned on it's radar, the robot
turned on the ECM pod and got on the deck, the SAM light remained off, and she
cleared the triple A unit's kill radius.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>She then turned it off and
pulled a half loop, she strafed the second triple A unit and started looking
for the next targets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next bringer targets were a group of APCs spaced 20
metres apart in a staggered formation on a road south of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal>The robot decided to find out what that vehicle was first,
switching to AGM65s in anticipation of a deserving threat, and staying close
enough to the ground to dive out of view the instant she needed to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was a deserving threat: an <a

<p class=MsoNormal>"Right, <a href="http://world.guns.ru/grenade/gl12-e.htm">LAW

launchers and armed them, the fact they were at a corner meant they didn't have
to worry about flame-grilling those behind them, and while the sewer was a
brick structure, it was backed by tons of dirt, so they weren't worried about
the weapons bringing the place down on them.</p>

vest or any similar armour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The extent of the damage to him was his ribcage was dented
like an empty oil drum struck with a sledgehammer, limbs were dislocated, head
was dislocated, and there was a hole in the middle of the crater where the
copper plate lining the hollow in the charge had been blasted through.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She also remembered Buffy's report that said she had to

symbols, counter clockwise, go!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A number of facts had escaped Faiths attention in the panic
to evade the incoming missile: 1: A C5 galaxy is a big aircraft, meaning that
it's angular inertia was delaying all her control movements, meaning all the
violent movements on the stick amounted to very little movement at the wingtips
and tail. 2: A C5 Galaxy is a big aircraft with zero stealth consideration
built into the design, meaning that it is almost impossible to hide it from ANY
radar, airborne or ground. 3: aerobatics are hazardous to the health of anyone
not strapped down to their seat (as were most the people on the aircraft). 4:
she wasn't strapped in either, she was hanging on to the seat by the only thing
she could grab, which happened to be the ejection seat handle, which had not
been armed, but Faith vs. a measly detent pin tends to result in a win for Faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She saw the C5 in its corkscrew below her, she also noticed
the movement of a bright light off to the side. It was the missile, it struck
the C5 in the tail door below her, Faith reached the decision to leave the seat
and dive into the aircraft.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The aircraft pulled out from beneath her, and she couldn't

started removing them, the first one she pulled out caused something to
explode, the explosion caused her to reflexively shut her eyes and cough as the
smoke entered her lungs, she then felt the seat restraint pull at her hand, she
opened her eyes and looked up, a small parachute had deployed, it was about 1.5
metres in diameter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>It was slowing her down, but she
knew it wasn't enough, the ground was getting alarmingly close.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She reached up and grabbed another pin, closing her eyes and
holding her breath as she pulled it. There was no explosion this time, but she
felt a greater force pull at her and the seat bounce off her legs, she opened
her eyes and saw the main chute over her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>She looked around for the C5.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes you did." said Buffy's exact likeness as she emerged
from the bathroom, then stopped and said "Wait, hang on, no, that was me again,
sorry, my bad, let's see you win when you're all in jail getting picked off by
my acolytes, shall we?" before vanishing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Okay, we need to get out of

said Dawn, referring to the various image altering spells used for various

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria had just walked into the office where the Blum-Decklers
were, Mrs Blum-Deckler said "She's been talking like this for a while now."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Daria walked up to Tiffany and
asked "Hey Tiffany, how's it going?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Tiffany shrugged and said "Very
strangely Daria, this is a rather boring hallucination."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Do you think you're
hallucinating?" asked Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm seeing witches, vampires, robots, and nuclear attacks,
sooooooooo, .... Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm hallucinating." said Tiffany.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Do you remember entering the
funny farm?" asked Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, I woke up there. It scared the crap out of me, Doc
showed me this tape of me talking about vampires and all the rest of it. We
started working on what made me imagine that shit. I thought we had it under
control, it was down to the odd dream, the medication was working. But the
instant I got back to school, it started again." said Tiffany.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Right." Daria looked at Mrs Blum-Deckler
and moved her head to the door indicate she should follow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"What exactly did they do to
Tiffany?" asked Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, first they conducted a drug assisted interrogation,
that's where they found out what we all thought to be delusions. Tiffany denied
it every time she wasn't under the influence of the hypnotic drugs, the doctor
then suggested we try Electroconvulsive therapy. When Tiffany woke up, she had
no memory of the discussions regarding her delusions, she did have rather vivid
dreams, but those seemed to improve with medication." said Mrs Blum-Deckler.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Did she describe the dreams?"
asked Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Vampires chasing her, catching her, biting her, ... ... yeah,
we figured that stuff about being a vampire slayer was just to stop the dreams
from scaring her." said Mrs Blum-Deckler.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Daria nodded, and thought about
what to do next.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"The doctor explained that ECT is less than ideal, and only
suggested it when nothing else seemed to be working, we thought Tiffany was
insane." she said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I understand your position perfectly, seeing the crazy shit
I do, I spend just about every waking second wondering if any of it is real."
said Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I know, I mean, you see these things on the TV, you wonder
how they can cut anything, but I guess movie props are just blunt." said Quinn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>They were looking through the
weapons on the floor where they had been placed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The weapons included all the stuff they had picked up at Jane's
house, the magic box stuff they had taken with them, and the weapons from the
APC (two minimis (machine guns), two M79 grenade launchers, and 14 MP5s, plus 3
clips for each MP5, each minimi had one 200 round box, and there were 20 <a

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then there were Daria's weapons, 3 20 round drums for her
automatic shotgun (Quinn and Sandi were surprised those things existed), 400 of
those high explosive shotgun rounds (are those even legal?), 12 red spherical
grenades (Jane described how it looked when one of those had been used on Amy Madison,
Daria described them as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermite">thermit</a>
grenades with bursting charges), 12 fairly large black grenades with a big
yellow stripe around their equators, 20KG of what looked like <a

remote detonators, 4 controllers for those detonators, some copper foil
(Huh???), 4 Mac 10's with 3 clips each and 500 rounds for them.</p>

them "How're you two holding out?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Look, I know <st1:City w:st="on">Lawndale</st1:City> was

<p class=MsoNormal>"I was on the phone when the nuke hit, EMP induced a current

Sandi, before turning to Linda's likeness and saying "So First, how's it going,
making any progress?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Quite well, actually, as you suspect, very few of your

of Jane who then said "too much perfume shrivelled their tiny little brains
even further, and that's the slayers, with their healing powers, these two-"
the First Evil nodded to Sandi and Quinn and said "-, surprised they can do
anything more than pick fleas off each others heads."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yeah, First Evil, few tips on winding people up," Daria
said as she walked up to Jane's likeness, she then leaned close to her ear and
stage whispered "it only works if no one knows that's what you're doing."
before stepping back and waiting for the First Evil to do something.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Okay, but like I said, everyone else is doing crap, you
can't win alone, hope you enjoy my bringers killing you." with that, the First Evil

to defend themselves... our children, and those who are suffering from mental
difficulties in institutions designed to assist them in their ongoing struggle
to become whole once again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

many years before, these words: This will not stand. We will not bow down
before any aggressor, neither foreign or domestic, neither aged or youthful,
regardless of whether this aggression comes from with our own families, or from
without. We will not stand idly by, hoping against false hope that these

<p class=MsoNormal>Faith watched patiently as Bush tried his best to give
something resembling an intelligent answer to some of the questions,
immediately throwing his actual PR skills into sharp contrast with the skills
of his speech writer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then they got to something a little more relevant: some
terrorists had stolen a 15MT nuclear weapon and used it near <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
w:st="on">Lawndale</st1:place></st1:City>. None of the newscasters or anyone
they talked to knew why it had been used there and not <st1:State w:st="on">New
York</st1:State>, then they got to something else of interest: a battle in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Los Angeles</st1:place></st1:City>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They cut to an aerial view of some back alleys where piles
of dead demons of various sizes lay dead, some of them on fire, most riddled
with holes, all decked out gladiator style.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And there had been an attack on Wolfram and Hart using what
people were speculating were some sort of microscopic nuke. Some experts the
newscasters had talked to were baffled, because they couldn't imagine nuclear
weapons being made so small, yet they can't imagine such small weapons as those
observed to be shot being that powerful using chemical explosives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Faith recalled how a few weeks ago, <st1:City w:st="on">Willow</st1:City>
and Kennedy had returned and reported the use by a vampire gang of some really
small nuclear weapons that were apparently clean, and that <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>
was going to make some for Angel's team. And now Angel's team have gone toe to
toe with the forces of Wolfram and Hart, kinda proves they aren't evil, doesn't
it?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Of course it would be nice if they could make contact
sometime soon, seeing as they are in the fight for THEIR FUCKING LIVES!!! ... ...
AGAIN!!!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was no news of a C5 going down, so Faith was hopeful
that the planeload of slayers was still intact and that it's passengers were
still alive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was this minor problem about Faith being in the middle
of VERY FAR AWAY FROM ANY SUPPORT OF ANY DESCRIPTION WHAT SO EVER to worry
about, but she was cautiously optimistic that she could handle anything that
was thrown her way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>A bottle crashed through the

<p class=MsoNormal>There were about 50 Klansmen standing outside with guns
ranging from Berettas to AKs, and her motel room was now on fire, so she was
going to have to engage them at some point, but she had no way to close the
distance in the time it would take for them to shoot the crap out of her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She decided to go out the back instead, the fire was
creating an emergency exit for her, she just had to wait for the wall to get
weak enough.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Why was the Klan after her for
fuck's sake? Not like she had done anything to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The wall looked weak enough now, so she ran through it,
emerging behind the building, and headed out into the forest behind her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It wasn't much of a forest, it offered little concealment between
trees, but it would do, Faith should have a decent amount of distance before
the Klan realise she's no longer there, then they'll have trouble keeping up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But why? ... Wait, that fucking Klan massacre near Lawndale,
Willow had done that, First must be wearing their ghosts, ... Okay, cone heads
dying, watch Faith vigorously fail to give a fuck, but that had created a
serious problem for her and all the other slayers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>And that's on top of the
bringers, Turok Han, and, ... whatever the fuck <a

<p class=MsoNormal>Gabriel dragged the unconscious girls into the basement of
the midlands boarding school he was visiting, then he grabbed a sledge hammer
and started smashing the stones making up the floor of the old structure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Eventually there was enough cracks and holes for Gabriel to
start removing the stones and he grabbed a shovel, he was pleased with his new
found strength, this kind of work would normally take a crew of 6 an hour, and
that's with pneumatic drills (no way to get even a baby <a

<p class=MsoNormal>When the <a
href="http://www.restlessbtvs.com/trivia/seal-of-danthalzar/">seal of Danthazar</a>
was revealed, Gabriel used a stiff broom to get it sufficiently clean to work,
then he grabbed the first sacrifice and pulled a large knife he had swiped from
the school's kitchen, he ribbed the girls throat out and threw her half onto
the seal so the wound was lower than the rest of her body.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>He did the rest of them, and
waited for the seal to open.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, ... actually, if you can make it rain, heavy, it'll clear

improve our mobility, and we'd be able to change the air in here without fear

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Okay, I'm on it." said Amanda,

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yes, but I don't want you going out too far on your own,

<p class=MsoNormal>Henno looked at the scene. Apparently this is where a person
dressed as a member of the SAS had been seen shooting people before being
wrestled to the ground.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The location was a country house in Westbury, reputed to be
occupied by witches. Magic or technological, though, they apparently had
teleportation systems AND force fields, Henno hoped to catch them with their
pants down, having one of his people held by enemy forces was never good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was getting dark now, and he was about to start issuing
orders when he noticed a number of creatures moving towards the house.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"What the fuck are those." asked

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I don't know, but if they are enemies of our enemy, they
could get the shields raised." replied Henno, he then turned to the rest of his
unit and said "we're going in now, shoot any X-rays you encounter, and those
things if they try anything."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Then they all formed a single
column and went around to start their approach towards the corner of the
building.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The strange thing was that the CSIs working the watchers
council in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">London</st1:place></st1:City>
had confirmed that no one had been shot in the building, by the terrorists or
Red Troop, so it may turn out that the involvement of the SAS was unnecessary
to begin with. But when they had all teleported out, they had taken Rebecca
with them for some reason.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The group was mostly female though, that could have meant
her abduction was a mistake, but considering that this lot had just lost a
bunch of their own to red troop, he had to assume Rebecca was in danger if
alive, and if she was dead, he was going to slot the fucking lot of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Laura Menzies was now in charge of the <a

where <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place>
had teleported Giles and his group of slayers and watchers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>In the next room were seven
slayers, six standing around a big heavy chair to which the seventh was tied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What a fuck up that had been: First of all, Willow
accidentally teleported a member of the special air service along with the
slayers and watchers, then the SAS member had killed Giles and Kennedy, and
then four other slayers before the rest could subdue her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They had held onto her rather than teleport her back now
because this place was a grade A listed building, meaning it was easily
identifiable, so they were busy trying to find somewhere to go.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Suddenly two slayers burst into the room and started saying
"Laura, we have a problem, we have-", before diverting between "-uber vamps-"
and "-special forces-" they got out "-coming at us." before they looked at each
other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Get everyone in here." said Laura before turning to the
witches sat at the table in the room and saying "Get us to any open area at
least 10 miles away."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane entered the premises, abandoned by it's owners and
quickly sought out the blood stores, she got stuck into them immediately the
same time as she started placing blood containers into the shopping bag she had
brought with her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>She eventually headed outside to
the APC with her loot and they headed out to fulfil the next part of the
mission: Weapons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane had upped her intake of blood considerable over the
past few weeks. She found that strange, because there hadn't been much of an
increase in physical activity, she was considering bringing this to Daria's
attention, but being in the middle of a war made that action seem
inappropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Amanda had left the weather
overcast after the 4 hour downpour, because it was just less trouble than
clearing the sky.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The kind of weapons they were looking for was, ... well, ...
everything: Kitchen knives, swords, crossbows, chainsaws, shotguns, Uzis, and
anything that could be turned into a weapon, that would include garden sprays,
vases, crowbars, explosives, anything.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two good things about the nuke was that the fallout was
keeping everyone from being in a position to stop them looting, and the EMP had
wiped out just about every burglar alarm system in the state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now the fallout had been washed away of course, but
apparently just about no one who realised this was willing to chance stepping
outside, and those who didn't were still waiting for someone to tell them it's
all clear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They had exhausted 2/3rds of their ammunition on the
monsters without so much as tickling them, and red troop were now scattered
throughout the building.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"'BECCA?" asked Henno, hoping she knew something useful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Rebecca looked around, then she
picked up one of the katanas that the slayers had left them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>She drew the sword, inspected
it, and then signalled for Henno and Dave to open the door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Henno nodded at Dave, and they jumped back, grabbing their
MP5s out of habit, letting the monsters in, Rebecca spun around and decapitated
each monster as it entered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Each monster turned to dust upon

to the pile of swords and picked up two, throwing one to Dave, he then grabbed
the radio and asked the location of the others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The slayers, protected from identification by their glamour,
made their way to the train station, they needed to hook up with the others and
decide what they needed to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The only known source of Turok Han was hellmouths, and there
was only one hell mouth in the United Kingdom, and given the short span of time
in which all this had come about, that had to be the source of the Turok Han,
so they would need to shut that down, the problem was that the First Evil's
chief of staff, Gabriel Kent, was sure to be there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gabriel boarded the Eurostar, kind of surprised that no
slayers had been sent to watch the station, but getting into a fight at the
station would attract attention and delay the mission, so he decided to be
happy to serve instead, there would be plenty of slayers to kill later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Yeah, what did these people say
about them?" asked Henno.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, one of them referred to them as Turok Han, another
referred to them as Uber Vamps. The former's probably the formal, the girl that
was doing the thing with the shields, she called me a vampire slayer after I
was teleported with them." said Rebecca.</p>

killed at the watchers council headquarters." said Henno.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tiffany kept some distance between herself and the slayers,
which were scattered about the hanger in groups discussing various things, some
were still in pyjamas from the mental hospitals they had been liberated from,
others were dressed in normal street clothes, none of them seemed to notice
her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria or Joy, whatever her name was, had scared the crap out
of her earlier with the name Nathan, it was related to the vampire stuff that
had been haunting her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>The exact symptoms were a cold

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She didn't know why this was, only that her mind didn't want
to go there. In fact, it was fighting tooth and nail to avoid going there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The doctor had told her that she was imagining vampires and
other scary shit, but that assumption was looking shaky, this didn't feel like
a hallucination. She was certain that if this was, then there would be more
going on, combat, lessons, and dumb shit like the APC turning into a bus, the hanger
turning into a hotel, or something weird (not that Amanda's abilities to
teleport and control weather weren't weird, but for some reason it didn't fit
the characteristics of a dream either).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tiffany hadn't read anything on lucid dreaming, but she could
figure out tests that would prove this was a dream, and it was beginning to
look like this was reality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Okay, let's look at this logically, ... Hallucinations are
caused by abnormal brain chemistry, an imbalance of neurotransmitters, abnormal
brain chemistry tends to reduce continuity to the point where it is obvious
what you're seeing isn't real. If you know you're dreaming or hallucinating, it
becomes pretty obvious that's what you're doing."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

the robot, apparently the real Daria's sense of humour was incorporated into
the robot's software.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Errrm, that won't be necessary,

<p class=MsoNormal>Tiffany wasn't sure she wanted to do this. Any reminders

kept alive as a dessert tray. That's something her mind has been suppressing
since she was subjected to electroconvulsive therapy over the Easter break. I
wasn't sure how to remind her without posing a risk to herself and those around
her, right now I'm considering going on a bringer hunt, I don't want to split
my forces for anything other than a multiflank attack, and if I leave a small
force to guard her, that force along with Tiffany would become an easy target.

Han any more time then what they have had already. All shops will probably be
closed now, so we're going to have to steal what we need, which is one petrol
tanker, one flat bed truck, as much ammonium nitrate as will fit on said
flatbed truck, 12 kilos of dynamite or other high explosive, at least 4
suitable blasting caps, 100 metres of 1mm<sup>2</sup> twin flex, 1 car battery,
1 relay, and 1 alarm clock. We have everything else we need, what we'll do is
we'll blow the structure off of the hell mouth, then we drive up with the
tanker and start pouring it's contents into the seal." said Vanessa.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>The slayers headed off to
collect the equipment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Okay, and all those who have
trained using axes?" asked Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>50 slayers raised their hands.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Daria ticked the boxes next to
the names, then said "Alright, thanks."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria had been working on how they could distribute the
weapons, they had a lot of contact weapons such as swords, axes, and knives,
and firearms such as revolvers and shotguns.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The automatic firearms they had obtained were considered
user friendly, but would eat ammo at such a rate that Daria didn't want to
depend on them unless she could be certain they could obtain more ammunition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The minimis were their worst problem when it came to
ammunition: They were belt fed, that meant they would need to get linked
ammunition or save the links. It's not that brass catchers were hard to make,
but Daria would prefer not to make the weapons unwieldy if they could avoid it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Therefore, the assault rifles
and two machineguns were only going to be used for getting them out of a jam.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They would need some kind of artillery. They couldn't steal
any more aircraft, but the bringers couldn't either, neither could anyone use
air support, now the air force was in the air and looking for asses to kick. The
bringers had probably liberated more artillery from their bases, but now the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">US</st1:place></st1:country-region> armed forces
were in the game, the bringers would probably need to get away from them
sharpish.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That meant the bringers were down to portable items such as
mortars, LAWs, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGM-71_TOW">TOW</a>s,
grenade launchers, <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;</span>... yeah, sure they
were going to be going hand to hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Okay, I want us to make a start on killing the bringers,
the problem I have right now is that they have probably been stealing military
weapons for a while. We don't know how well equipped they are likely to be, except
probably better than us. Their arsenal is likely to include anti armour
weapons, guided and unguided. ... We'll need to come up with something on the way
over, the only good news is that we seem to have enough contact weapons for
those who are trained for them, I can distribute them now, those who are least
qualified for hand to hand will be equipped with the automatic weapons,
everyone else gets a shotgun."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They were ready to go, the flatbed loaded with ANFO (using
diesel for the fuel), it was ready to go, all that needed to happen was for the
piece of plastic to be pulled from between the battery contact and the battery
in the alarm clock, and the second hand, located 15s away from the contacts
that would operate the relay and detonate the bomb.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The driver would then activate an ejection system that had
been bodged from fireworks, steel pipes, steel wire, and a parachute. The
device would drag the driver out through the roof to a suitable altitude where
the parachute would deploy, they were hoping it would be at least 500ft, the
parachute was a ram air, so the driver would have a better chance of getting a
safe distance from the hypocentre before the blast wave hit her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The problem was that the ejection system did not look that
reliable, so odds were that the driver would end up in a retrograde orbit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Good luck everyone." she said as she climbed into the
drivers seat and strapped the parachute on, she then started the engine and
headed off, the other slayers got in and on the tanker, which was rigged with a

the truck.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There were ubervamps scattered around, but they were still
able to fight, the slayers on the roof of the tanker were armed with broadswords
and katanas, even if they couldn't decapitate the ubervamps from their
positions, they could keep them from approaching them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They got to the school, or more precisely, it's basement,
the rest of the building had been blown clean off its foundations, the bomb had
pushed the ground down about a metre for about 5 radius around the truck's perimeter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The few ubervamps that had clung to the truck were quickly
decapitated when the slayers jumped off. They got to work immediately, each had
a lighter and a can of deodorant, so that any one of them could light the
petrol when they got it flowing down the seal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ubervamps that were blown clear were returning to the
seal. The slayers got the hose to the hole, and the pump on, the closest slayer
pulled their lighter and deodorant can while the others formed up around her,
she got the fire where it was needed and jumped back as the vapours in the
passageway detonated, blowing a lot of fire into the air.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She then joined the fight to kill as many ubervamps as

two of the other satellite positions and the main group, the slayers under

<p class=MsoNormal>"Leaders of Unknown formation have been identified as Joy
Merryweather and Daria Morgendorffer, both wanted fugitives, mark them down as

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>The slayers had gathered their
haul of weapons and vehicles they had inherited from the bringers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some of the weapons included Hummers with 81mm mortars
mounted in the back, hummers with 50cals, hundreds of M4s and <a

grenade launchers, 20 minimis, hundreds of LAW 80s, 30 stingers, and tons of
ammunition for everything.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Now we can start waging war."
said Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>She then asked "How many of you
have trained to fight in formation?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Several raised their hands, but most didn't. This was
actually typical since before <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Willow</st1:place></st1:City>
activated the lot of them, it was generally assumed the slayer would be working
alone, and therefore all training was designed for single slayers against
everything. It looked like nobody figured that it would be useful to get them
teaming up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Daria would have to write a memo
about that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Okay, the main point of any formation is to ensure that the
enemy can not sneak up behind you, and to ensure that the enemy can not take
everyone out with a single shot, that also means putting enough people on each
position to ensure that if one has to change a clip or do anything that takes
them out of the fight, they are not suddenly vulnerable to attack."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria continued her lecture, but hoped she could keep it
short since there was a limit as to how much the slayers could remember, and
frankly, they didn't have a lot of time, and she didn't want to give the First Evil
any more time.</p>

took Aiden's hand and squeezed it hard saying "Giles and Kennedy were close

"BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG, BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG.", changing empty clips for other
empty clips every now and then.</p>

themselves up on the Cleveland hell mouth, that meant they couldn't do anything
until they had the means to observe the bringer locations, and see what they
were doing as they approached, they could locate the bringers with magics, but
they didn't have a clue what they were packing, that was a big advantage the
first evil had possessed over the slayers because the first evil knew what the
slayers had.</p>

projectiles spend less time in the air, we'll only use artillery on large enemy
formations, but on small enemy units, we're going to drive up shooting at them,
using LAWs and 50cals as the primary weapons. Keep your distance from each
other, keep moving, keep unpredictable, the GPS units Robodaria is getting for
you will be modified to both display known enemy positions and to display your
recent locations, That way you can figure out immediately if you're getting too

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn got to the chorus "I'm all out of faith, this is how I

the classroom turned into a dank, bare apartment with aged furniture and bare
floors.</p>

wearing nothing, arms bound behind her, chain around her neck connecting her to
a floor beam, there were bruises and cuts on her body, some dirt had
accumulated on places.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>It seemed that the First Evil
had one major blind spot: It couldn't lock onto machines.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It needed people to see and hear, it needed life forms to
lock on to, it also couldn't listen into telepathic communications without the
person being in a sleep state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Assuming this was true, the fact that she was going to use
symbology on a GPS screen to represent the various threats and not give them a
direct view over the battlefield should keep the First Evil from locating the
UAVs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She directed the UAVs over the leading dots, and got a look
at them, they were in humm-vees equipped with 50cals, 81mm mortars, and other
infantry weapons, the same equipment as the slayers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fact Amanda was out of action had cost them the
advantage of being able to use telepathic communications to command their
forces, the slayers had radios on them as a backup plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The slayers were driving off to forward positions, she
directed them into a formation that would balance the need for effective
firepower against the need to reduce the possibility of multiple kills with
single shots from the enemy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She had rigged the GPS units so she could send graphic
instructions to the slayers individually, assign them to specific targets. She
had some using mortars, directing three at a time to a single target to improve
the probability of a kill as far as possible, but the First Evil was doing the
same.</p>

could distract the First Evil, eat up some of it's attention, so it would have
a harder time operating it's bringers, which were dependant on it for any
activity right down to breathing. They might not be able to kill the First Evil,

<p class=MsoNormal>It didn't help that Quinn knew this wasn't real. As far as
her perceived body was concerned, she had just been raped and bitten by four
vampires, and this was probably going to stay with her for a while. The pain in

<p class=MsoNormal>They had even had Tiffany sit on her face and had broken a

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>The enemy command system had
been slowed somehow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Robodaria couldn't divert any attention to researching this
at the time, she would have to review the data later and see if she could
replicate or enhance the effect in a future battle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20 slayers had been killed in this battle so far, a couple
of humm vees had been hit by mortars, 4 girls in each one, first was struck on
the front wheel arch, off road, the loss of that wheel had caused it to flip
over, the next round had set off all the ammunition, second had been struck in
the roof over the drivers seat, killing the girls by mincing their vital organs
with the compression wave instantly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A third humm vee had been struck just under the radiator by
a LAW 80, it had flipped over, spilling the mortar rounds and LAW80s out of the
back, when it landed on those, some of the detonators were crushed, causing
detonations and sympathetic detonations of enough ammunition to kill the girls
on the vehicle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another eight slayers had been shot by bringer machinegun
fire, one of Daria's fears had been that the slayers would hesitate if the girl
next to them got shot, but that fear had proven unjustified, they had kept
going.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And now they were on a roll, they had been cleaning up the
battlefield initially, and now they were just slaughtering the bringers
wholesale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Robodaria saw a couple of bringer crews operating M777s
(155mm towed guns), that explained why she had been detecting the shock
profiles of high velocity shells in the battle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She needed to get those decommissioned urgently, because if
the First Evil got those M777 crews working at full speed, they were going to
incur enormous casualties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Luckily, the ratio of friendlies to enemies had increased so
much that she projected arrival at the M777 sites within 10 minutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>The enemy was starting to
retreat though.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Robodaria could not allow them to escape with the M777s, she
altered the formation as best she could to ensure an early arrival at the
bringer firebases.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The First Evil had apparently realised what Robodaria was up
to, and started throwing as many bringers at her formation as possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The First Evil was obviously having trouble concentrating on
the task at hand, because the formation concentrated too much on the tip of the
formation. Robodaria had the forces present to encircle the enemy formation
with a pincer, the tips of which eventually reached the M777 crews. The guns
were captured intact along with their ammunition, she had the slayers on scene
capture the weapons and set them up to start hitting the retreating bringers,
which would not be out of range.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Some of the retreating bringers
stopped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Robodaria didn't have a view of these positions yet, but she
felt it most likely that the three groups that had stopped were other M777
crews, she had to get those bringers killed as soon as possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She quickly ran through how to operate the weapons with the
slayers on the scene while also doing her best to direct other slayers along
the retreating column of bringers, she feared the bringer artillery positions
would be operational before the slayers got off their first shots.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The furthest two positions got blown up, she saw the final
one come into view of her UAVs, it fired at the southern slayer crew, she
ordered those slayers to run while directing her other crew to take out the
final position.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>The other bringer positions came

<p class=MsoNormal>They got on board the appliance, most of the other slayers
had already departed, having gathered a good sized haul of bringer ammo (it was
smaller than the previous haul because this time the bringers had the
opportunity to use some of it)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The only dead slayers they had brought back were the ones
that had been shot, due to the fact they were the only ones already on an
active vehicle. The ones that had been blown up were inconvenient to pick up at
this time, burying the dead was way down Robodaria's list of priorities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Jane got in front of Robodaria

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What irritated Buffy was Daria's influence on the slayers,

<p class=MsoNormal>Robodaria finished the last weld fixing the gun to the bed
of the truck and headed over to where a couple of slayers had been starting on
the magazine, which was looking to be in good shape considering they were doing
this with the trucks moving at 192km/h (120mph).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two M777s were being mounted on the back of two flatbed
trucks they had swiped, using equipment and materials they had also swiped,
thanks to the government advice for everyone to hole up and the news that a
15MT nuke was set off near <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Lawndale</st1:place></st1:City>,
they had pretty much free reign. The cops hadn't given the convoy being led by
a SWAT APC earlier any problems, and now they were being ordered to let the
current convoy through by the army, which was severely understaffed at home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She wondered if the First Evil was planning to go overt
anyway, or if getting the president to invade <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
w:st="on">Iraq</st1:country-region></st1:place> was more a long term strategy
(that assumed that the president needed any prodding from a malevolent spirit
disguised as Jesus Christ)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It occurred to Robodaria that the government might not let
them get away with all the thefts they were carrying out of both civilian and
military equipment and consumables, but survival came first.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A large number of mortars were going to be hoisted on top of
some office and apartment blocks to extend their range, she didn't consider
such an operation worth carrying out with the M777s, they would not be able to
do it fast enough and fit any mechanism that would give them any field of fire
beyond the guns trim, she needed the guns to be manoeuvrable in order to use
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The aim of her strategy was to keep the bringers out of
Cleveland while they sorted the seal, the bringers could possibly do the same thing
with their guns that Robodaria was doing, and would probably have better aim
and a faster rate of fire, but if the first evil was forced to adapt, that was
more time for the slayers to work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>She noted that the slayers
working on the magazine had only done tacking welds, and had gone a little
heavy with the current.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Only one of the slayers in the entire group had any serious
welding experience, she was a coded welder in fact, and she was supervising the
work on the other truck, the one from which she was hearing Janes steady stream
of swear words.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The only welding gear they had been able to swipe was 5
single phase MMA transformers, 3 generators (to one of which she was hooked
up), and 500 2mm cellulosic electrodes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As soon as they were in position, they would hopefully be
able to load these trucks up with the ammunition, and hopefully just telling
these girls how to operate these guns would be enough, because that was all
they were getting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The M777s would only be used against like artillery, because
they didn't have as much ammunition for them as they did for the mortars, the
mortars would be used on everything else, but two guns would not be adequate
coverage, even with Lake Erie behind them, they had a 225<span

fire at any one time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She would probably have to attack first, she could hit and
run, in their current state, the bringer gun crews could only move their guns

it to be of use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The First Evil had not expected things to go this wrong with
it's plan, Gabriel had kept from telling it how it's impatience had been the
source of it's problems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Seriously, the First Evil was totally immortal: Had, like,
forever to carry out it's objectives, why not wait until everyone forgets it
exists?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Anyway, he didn't care, violence
was fun, as was opening all these seals and releasing all these hoards of Turok
Han.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Just a pity that the Europeans
had suddenly gotten a clue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Americans were having trouble because the First Evil had
built up the majority of it's bringers there, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
w:st="on">America</st1:country-region></st1:place> having the space to hide
them effectively, and the depletion of armed forces to give them a chance, but
it seemed that the slayers under Daria's command were kicking the bringers asses,
due to that robot. It was giving the slayers the same advantage the first evil
had with it's bringers. Plus that dyke witch <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place> had managed to deplete the First
Evil's attention sufficiently to bring down the bringer's kill ratio to fuck
all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Turok Han, on the other hand, were not dependant on the First
Evil for direct control, the First Evil just needed to tell them where the good
guys were, they would do the rest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Except the last time the First Evil had tried using Turok
Han against an army of slayers, it barely managed to kill any, and that was
with superior numbers, and without the slayers being armed with grenade
launchers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Opportunities to steal weapons from military bases had dried
up completely, the Americans had relocated all their weapons to forward bases,
and the Canadians didn't have the shortages of personal that the Americans had
developed, so they were going in with axes, shotguns, and whatever other
civilian sourced weapons they could find.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Yes we do, they aren't looking

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yeah, I know, I just need to figure out what, ... it's a

thought of something.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Robodaria watched as the bringer
forces just stood there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Their guns were spread far enough apart that if she went
after one group, the other would be able to close on the city and start
shooting at the elevated mortars, so an assault was out until they were done
obstructing the seal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She was also aware that mortal enemies hated stalemates,
they preferred to sort it out, so she had to project possible ways for the
first evil to break the stalemate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She was positioned in the centre of the city with two
slayers and Jane on the converted fire appliance which they had entirely
subverted by converting the water cannon into a flamethrower. It would make an
excellent antipersonnel weapon, but it was lightly armoured (after
modifications consisting of two layers of 6mm Medium Carbon Steel plates spaced
3cm apart and 5cm from the vehicles skin), only equipped to stop 15mm high
velocity rounds, resist 40mm high explosive rounds and 60mm mortar rounds, but
81mm would be too loud and would start damaging equipment and inflicting blunt
force trauma upon the human occupants. And forget resisting LAWs, they would
need reactive armour to stop those, and they just didn't have the time or the
quantity of explosives needed to make it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was better armoured than the hummers, but nowhere near as
manoeuvrable, so it wasn't going to be used in any frontal assault.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bit of a white elephant really, she had only made the thing
because she could, any weapon being better than none, and they had had a rather
pathetic arsenal at that point.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>But it was spacious inside
enough for her to use as a mobile command post.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They had raided a number of rail yards for rails, diamond
impregnated chop saws, and thermite and were using it to obstruct the seal, the
bringers would need a thermal lance to get through.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the reason that the bringers would most likely use
thermal lances, they were also throwing in gravel. The rails would add to the
volume of metal, the iron from the thermite would settle inside the gaps, and
the gravel once incorporated into the obstruction, would resist the thermal
lance, with nothing for the oxygen to react to, the only heat available would
be coming from the lance and the iron above, the molten minerals would just sit
there sapping heat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Robodaria had no intention of allowing the bringers the time
to completely clear the seal, she would leave the city to assault the main body
using both hummers and the M777s simultaneously, she could allow the bringers
to take the city while she went after their towed guns and other siege forces,
and then clear the city of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Only this time, the bringers would probably be taking
hostages just to mess things up. She had not formulated any serious tutorial to
prepare the slayers for that possibility because the First Evil would only
adapt its strategy, but slayers had better aim than the average human, so odds were
that human shields would be a major hindrance to bringers, and not a help. Especially
considering that a large number of potential hostages would be armed to the
teeth legally or not, and holed up in strong locations. So all chasing hostages
would do is keep the bringers where the slayers could shoot them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Of course, some civilians would be easier to take hostage
than others, so the First Evil would do it anyway if the opportunity arose, the
main concern is what the First Evil intended to do about Willow, since it was
her occupying the First Evil's attention that had caused it's severe losses
earlier.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Could it do something about
that?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>And if it couldn't, could it get

<p class=MsoNormal>Right now Riley was talking with the joint chiefs about
getting some of those prototype missiles with those multimode warheads she had
heard of on that documentary on, ... something to do with the military, she
couldn't remember what, just that apparently nothing they had in bulk right now
was quite up to the job. The First Evil rendering any stealth system or tactics
they had worthless, the only thing the First Evil had trouble tracking was
machines, but humans who operated machines, who, for instance, programmed
tomahawks to hit something, would give the game away instantly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the more practical ideas was to fit some SR71s with
AGM62 walleyes or AGM65 Mavericks, since they could take advantage of speed and
altitude to hit enemy positions. But there were problems with both the aircraft
and the weapons, and the fact that just about any high explosive used by their
weapons would cook off if it were carried externally at mach 3, thus defeating
the proposal, and U2s, while having altitude, did not have speed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Captains John Handler and Irma Travis inspected the bombs
rigged to the underside of the SR71, looking at the welds that held the hard
points to the airframe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Apparently this was safer than rigging the F12's internal
bays for bombs, something about the airflow across the bomb bay doors being a
problem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The welds looked neat and everything, but they didn't like
the possibility that they'd rip chunks of the airframe off the vehicle when
they made their bomb runs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>They looked at the bombs
themselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The weapons had been covered in a mild steel skin which held
the firebricks onto the bombs, and the lugs were protected from the airflow, so
the explosives would be protected from the heat. The skin also served to give
the weapons frontal stealth, by the time there was any part the enemy could
lock onto pointed at them, the SR71 would be moving away too fast for the SAMs
to have a hope of hitting them, this was exactly why the SR71 was built like
this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bombs were mk84s fitted with paveway guidance systems which
was also protected by the case. When the bombs were down to mach 2 in velocity,
a length of primacord would be used to strip off the steel case, by which time
they hoped to have a laser painting the SAM sites, as soon as that was dealt
with, they could move in with other aircraft.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Of course there was a slight possibility that the primacord
would damage the paveway guidance system, but this was the only plan they got.</p>

Turok Han couldn't take sunlight. Not that carrying all that aluminium powder

w:st="on">Cleveland</st1:place></st1:City>, but they had, assuming they
followed advice from various survival magazines, stored their own water
supplies anyway, so what was the point?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>She looked at a map of the <st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>She directed the UAV to look at
the towers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The capacity of the towers exceeded that which would have
been expended through the holes in the pavement. The numbers were all wrong,
what use would blowing the pipes be that far from- they needed a high velocity
in the pipes, to carry something.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Explosives, and possibly a
chemical weapon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Narice, relocate to waypoint 1, target the water tower
marked on your display, Lucy, you should have line of sight on that tower,
shoot into the open hatch."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>She heard the acknowledgements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She also saw the bringers start to move into the sectors
that had been protected by the M777 Narice was driving, she had confidence that
she could carry out this strike, and then take out the advancing bringers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Reports of explosions started
coming in, the origins of the explosions there thought by the slayers to be the

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Time on target?" asked Gabriel, not stopping what he was
doing, which was hooking up the devices he had made for production of massive
quantities of hydrogen cyanide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Mortars incoming now, an M777 is being sent to target you,

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>There was an explosion in the
water tower, but it didn't do anything to Gabriel because he was too far from
the hatch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"TIME ON TARGET?" repeated Gabriel as he opened the valves
on the devices leading to the pipe, he then pulled the switches on the devices,
this shattered the sulphuric acid bottles and set off the thermit charges
designed to accelerate the production of hydrogen cyanide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>The gun was in position, the
slayers adjusted the gun's aim the same time as they loaded it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Robodaria directed them to sever the pipe at the ground,
they would have to keep firing until the pipe was severed, she didn't know how
quickly the chemical weapon being used could be deployed, it was probably being
sent into the water grid now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>The girls were getting the
ammunition off at a rate of 1 every 5 seconds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gabriel climbed up the back of the ladder and waited for the
next shot to strike before swinging around and exiting the tower in no time
flat, he then ran for the edge of the tower and jumped off, deploying a
parachute.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He kept the scuba gear on him because if his mission was
successful, he'd be up to his eyeballs in hydrogen cyanide, not lethal with the
First Evil's enhancements, but it would still bite, so he would use the scuba
gear to avoid breathing it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He landed on a street perpendicular to the attack vector of
the gun, but he immediately saw a number of slayers driving at him, they opened
up with 50cals. He evaded, landing through a shop window, he exited the
building and shoved a dumpster ahead of him as he ran out into the street. The
hummer stopped in front of the store, and two slayers with M16s came around the
back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He managed to run down one with the dumpster, the other was
within arms reach as planned, enabling him to deflect the weapon as he grabbed
her neck and pushed her vertebrae out of line with his top two fingers. The
other slayer popped into view, but he killed her before she could get off a
shot. He then ran around the dumpster and hit the second hummer with the loaded
grenade before they had a clue he was there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two slayers that had gone in through the front of the
shop came out. One was dead before she could shoot, the second got a single
burst off, wounding him before his shots killed her. He then ran to them,
grabbing what ammo he could before he had to move, which was about 7 seconds
from now, because the mortar on the roof of that skyscraper was now scoping his
position.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Robodaria directed all the slayers to pull away from the
projected killing zone around the base of the water tower, the gun would do a U
turn and start destroying the bringer guns.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gabriel had disappeared from view, probably running the
sewers. This was a serious problem, he was stronger than the slayers, and
better trained for warfare of every description, and with the First Evil
directing his movements, he would be capable of avoiding any ambush.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That would do for now, but she was also concerned he could
set up culvert bombs underneath the slayers positions. There were a large
number of buildings that had sewer access and materials that could be used in
the manufacture of explosives or equipment that could be converted into
flamethrowers, mortars, or rocket launchers (they'd be far from any military
specification and would from appearance make any other soldier afraid to touch
them, but they'd work).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She asked the slayers working on the obstruction for a
report on their progress, she absolutely couldn't wait for them to finish if it
would take more than 20 minutes, she would have to start moving people out
soon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>The slayers reported 2 hours
until completion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>If they didn't finish before

<p class=MsoNormal>She plugged a videophone into the fire appliances lighter
socket and placed that over the map, she then grabbed an M4M203 (M4 with bolt-on

simply tell the bringers where to steer the missiles, but the missile would
need to guide itself at some point.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That was the major flaw in their plan, the First Evil could
simply have the bringers shoot the missile vertically, and then it would be coming
from an angle that the blackbird won't be radar invisible from, or worse: fit
the missile with a 'winder's heat sensor and enough coolant to deal with the
long flight, the SR71's skin temperature reached past the 500's, that being the
reason the airframe was titanium, not aluminium.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She was sort of tempted to take the aircraft down to an
altitude that would give them enough air for the wings to bite, the problem
with that was that at lower altitudes, the dynamic pressure on the bombs would
put some serious strain on the hard points. And the temperatures reached could
possibly ignite the steel cases on the bombs. The cases were sharp, so the
shock fronts wouldn't cause any damage to the aircrafts skin, but if the cases
came off, the paveway sensors would produce a more severe bow shock, that might
burn a hole in the skin before the device was destroyed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then there was the power steering units for the fore
planes on the front of the bomb, of course this didn't account for the possible
drop in velocity by this time, but she was projecting worst case scenarios
anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

knocked out a couple of days ago by an anti armour weapon to the chest, but all
she had thrown his way was a change in pressure. It might have thrown him

survive the conditions created.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The lack of oxygen wasn't helping him much, in fact, it was
hindering his thought, as was the splitting headache that was caused by being
thrown against the wall of the sewer by the blast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>He felt around the back of the
pipe, and found the device was, ... a cell phone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Robodaria headed to another phone she had set up and
chiselled out some concrete, picking up the fragments with a lump of
Composition 4, she then set it up near the phone so that if Gabriel came from
this direction, he'd get blown up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

her: Gabriel might not wait for her, he could be moving in on the hell mouth

<p class=MsoNormal>The gas explosion could not be repeated within the next few
hours, the gas leaks were going to add to the gas shield rather than set up
another explosion because of the exhaust products filling the sewer network in
the area, Gabriel would head to the hell mouth if able to do so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She retrieved the C4 and chiselled out a deep enough hole

dragging herself out with her hands, her toes skidding up the wall on either

then heard more gunfire, and found Gabriel on the other side of the door. Some
gunshot wounds in his arms and torso, he saw her in time to get a grenade off,
but his aim sucked. Robodaria got hers off just after her view was obstructed by
smoke and dust. The origin of her grenade detonation was too distant for it to
have hit Gabriel, she unloaded the clip on her M16 in an attempt to either hit
him if he was in the corridor, or keep him out of the corridor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The problem was that he was disrupting work, also they were
getting close to dusk, there were likely to be a lot more Turok Han where that
one came from, and while she doubted the slayers would experience any serious
problems against them, they would occupy their attention.</p>

back to work, she could cover all entrances effectively, they needed to get the

<p class=MsoNormal>Robodaria received reports that all enemy agents were dead,
she decided to dispatch a few teams to retrieve the bodies of the dead slayers,
she didn't know where to send the bodies though, she searched for available
lockers in the cities morgues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>They had managed to capture 3

<p class=MsoNormal>As a robot, it was difficult to say anything meaningful
about the deaths, they were simply destroyed combat units. Robodaria could
never relate to the living people she commanded, she was aware of this, but
also aware of the effect on morale the deaths will have had, and that being
commanded by a machine would have eaten some of the patience the slayers would
have had under this kind of distress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There wasn't time to bury the dead, it would be faster to
stick them in the available morgues, then they could carry out whatever funeral
rites were appropriate once the current crisis was solved, at the moment there
was still a large bringer force a couple of hundred miles south of Cleveland. The
air force was now moving in with more normal aircraft, all the serious SAM
units were destroyed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Robodaria remembered when she had stolen that F16 loaded
with AGM65s and mk82s, that had gone rather well, but she had been on equal
terms with the First Evil, it had to instruct the bringers to use the sensors
to locate her because as a machine, she was untraceable without being around
any life forms, the air force would not have that advantage, they would have to
destroy the enemy from outside the ranges of the stingers the enemy probably
had, they were making progress, but they only had 37 aircraft available for
this, and they had limited stores, they were also running out of AGMs and
paveways, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-10_Thunderbolt_II">A10</a>s
didn't have as mush a problem with the stingers, so they could go in and strafe
enemy units.</p>

out, walking over to Jane and Robodaria, saying "'sup?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Not a lot, slayers are relaxing, the police are re-taking
control of the city, bringers are getting killed on mass in Canada, all's going
pretty well, so we've created a few more problems, 'in't that right?" said
Jane, directing the last three words at Robodaria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"The problem is I can not be
certain Gabriel Kent is dead." said Robodaria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria took a couple of seconds, then said "Jane, I've seen
the intelligence we have on these guys, Buffy had dealt what should have been a
fatal injury to Caleb, he jumped right back up and resumed fighting."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"And Gabriel Kent took an
anti-armour rocket to the chest, and jumped right back up and resumed fighting."
added Robodaria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"What did it was splitting the guy right down the middle,
I'd go for pureeing the guy myself though, just to be safe." said Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Okay." said Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I have 20 of slayers on quick reaction alert at all times,
this will continue until I am certain the threat is neutralised or someone else
has picked up the problem." said Robodaria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Right, ... ... If you got a few spare kilobytes per second,
could you start checking on the slayers relatives? And see if you can find out
if Jake Morgendorffer's still alive?" asked Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Robodaria said "Standby." and
stared off into space, looking bored as she started looking online for the
information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After a while, Robodaria said "The Lawndale Police
Department has logged 342 calls from a Jake Morgendorffer asking about Yourself
and Quinn since the bringers kicked off, there is a good chance he is still
alive."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Sweet." said Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"How's Tiffany?" asked Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Sedated, I think she's a danger
to everyone right now, the First Evil really did a number on her."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"What happened?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I had Amanda place Quinn and me in Tiffany's head, and
Tiffany's other self went off like a mine. It trapped all three of us until we
started running out of oxygen, then Tiffany's personalities united, and we all
regained consciousness."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"That's what <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
w:st="on">Willow</st1:place></st1:City> told us." said Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yeah? Did she mention that Tiffany's other self took on the
personas of the vampires that captured her and held her prisoner for several
weeks?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"No."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"When we were trying to get Tiffany to wake up, we had Quinn
trigger a flashback because Tiffany was imagining she was in school, but that
caused the activation of her other selves, and Quinn was with her when those
vampires entered the room, and I couldn't do anything other than watch them
play with her." said Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Jane couldn't come up with a
response.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That's my fucking sister. I allowed her into Tiffany's mind
without looking for, ... I don't know, something that could have indicated that
this could happen."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>The two of them were silent for
now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Robodaria then said "Oh crap."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"What?" asked Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Cops investigated a warehouse break in, they got video
footage of a balding man accompanied by several monstrous creatures. They're
missing quantities of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chlorate">sodium
chlorate</a>, and a number of ingredients that can be used to create <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VX">VX</a>, I've dispatched the alert
slayers."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Sodium chlorate? That sound
familiar." said Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"I use Ammonium perchlorate as
an oxidiser, most chlorates I've heard of can also be used as high explosives."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Pictures have been sent to the command centre, ... it's
Gabriel Kent. He must be headed to the square where slayers are assembled. I'll
intercept him, you two start moving them out of there." said Robodaria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Right." said Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>She and Jane headed off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"The robot just told the slayers guarding the hell mouth to
assist in the operation." said the First Evil as Gabriel and his gaggle of
Turok Han helped him manufacture the nerve agent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"I see." said Gabriel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"If the area is clear, we should
move straight on to blasting the hell mouth."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Right." said Gabriel, he then gestured for the Turok Han to
follow him, as he lifted his wheelbarrow of weed killer and headed off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sandi watched the road moving past as the APC drove down the
road along with the convoy of hummers as they all relocated to another part of
town.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>She then turned to Quinn, who
was looking extremely depressed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Worried about Tiffany?" asked
Sandi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Sort of." said Quinn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"What happened in there
exactly?" asked Sandi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Quinn thought about her answer,
but said "I don't want to talk about it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Sandi looked at Quinn, the tone
of her voice seemed very wrong for Quinn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>She looked over to Daria as she
drove, then Amanda, who was sitting with Jane, neither of them were talking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tiffany had been transferred to an air ambulance, and would
be admitted to a psychiatric ward close to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
w:st="on">Lawndale</st1:place></st1:City> until someone could take over. Her
parents had gone with her, Daria wasn't sure if she should tell her parents
anything, she had instead given her number to the medics and told them to have
the doctor call her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She had also called Buffy, who it turned out was on route
into the area with a couple of SAS members, who had been helping with the
European theatre.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Buffy was going to arrange for one of the Watcher's
Council's Psychiatrists to take over, since they were in on the mystical side
of things while she was in the air. They'd arrive in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
w:st="on">Cleveland</st1:place></st1:City> within 20 minutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Sandi decided to talk to Daria,
since she wasn't getting sweet fuck all from Quinn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Sandi?" Daria asked, obviously
sensing her presence behind her without looking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"What happened in there?" Sandi
simply asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"I told you, I don't want to
breech any confidences, if Quinn doesn't want you to know-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Daria, my friend looks traumatized, I need to know what
happened, ... if something had happened to Jane, you'd need to know what had
happened."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Daria thought about it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At least Sandi hoped she was thinking about it. There was
only one time Sandi could remember when Daria's emotions were written on her
face, and, ... she shuddered as she thought of what had happened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Quinn?" asked Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"What?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"I really think you ought to
tell Sandi what happened in there."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn shuddered and looked down at her feet, her knuckles
turning white as she seemingly tried to crush both her hands simultaneously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Sandi sat down next to her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Quinn eventually said "When
Tiffany started reliving her experience with those vampires, I got stuck with
her."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Sandi tried to think of
something to say, but came up blank.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"It was horrible." said Quinn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Sandi was about to ask for details,
but had trouble thinking of a way to ask for them without upsetting Quinn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sandi hadn't really cared about Quinn's emotional state
prior to now, she had mostly been looking for a way to destroy Quinn's
popularity, but now Quinn looked broken, and all Sandi could think about was
how she could repair her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Except Linda had always told her
that compassion is a sign of weakness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"What are you doing Sandi?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Sandi looked over to the apparition
of her mother.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"That's your enemy, surely
you're not thinking of helping her?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Get fucked." said Sandi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Quinn looked at her, and then
looked at where Sandi was looking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"What?" asked both Quinn and the
First Evil.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"That goes for both of you"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Quinn looked hurt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Sandi realised what Quinn was
thinking and said "not you, I mean the First Evil and my Mom."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Oh." said Quinn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Then Quinn, Amanda and Jane
looked at the spot where the First Evil stood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Disguised as Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Hey Daria, remember the fun we
had betting on the functionality of the Fashion Club?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria glanced back, and then said "Jane, real Jane, I mean,
not First Evil apparition of Jane, ... anyway, bet you twenty it's going to bring
up the manipulation during the bet."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Nah, it's going to bring up my
manipulation." said Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Quinn looked shocked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>The First Evil smirked and said
"I thought the two of you were supposed to be brains."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Come on, you're the First Evil,
and that's the best you can come up with?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, it's kind of difficult to top you in the evil
department, remember that story you wrote for that class assignment where Quinn
runs out into an 8 lane highway because she couldn't be like you?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Remember all the fights me and Quinn engaged in starting
from when we were 3 to that time Illyria and Tiffany had a go at me? It's a
long conflict that's been steadily winding down for years now. Quinn denied she
was my sister for most of high school, Quinn took credit for all of Jane's hard
work at that dance, Quinn drove me 'round the bend with that mime act, Quinn
drove Jane nuts when she got kicked out of every one of her friends houses."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Remember when you took Tom
Sloan from Jane?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Remember when I said I was over
it? Y'know, when I actually meant it?" said Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>The First Evil then became all
demony and disappeared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"I thought that thing was
supposed to be good at head fucks." said Sandi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Only when people aren't aware
that the First Evil is in there." said Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Of course Daria knew that Principle Wood had been aware of
exactly who had told him about Spike, but that was only because his desire for
revenge overwhelmed his caution regarding the first evil.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>-~-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"DAMN IT, I DIDN'T MAKE A
FUCKING DENT!!!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Gabriel glanced at the
apparition and then resumed his work, calmly asking "what did the good guys do
this time?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"DARIA FUCKING MORGENDORFFER, FUCKING RUINED A PERFECTLY

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"That's what you got me for, all they did will be avenged in
time" he said as he placed the item in the cavity, placing the elbow on the
drainpipe near a corner. He then placed another bag of fuel soaked weed killer
on top of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"That's the booster?" asked the First
Evil.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Not quite. I really don't want to be waiting too long here,
so I instead pulverised a load of the stuff and mixed it with kerosene and
coal, put some sand around it to slow the heat down. That should bring a big
chunk of this stuff to 250<span style='font-family:Symbol;mso-ascii-font-family:

booster, but it would take longer to make all the explosives I would need if I
were to try the normal methods." said Gabriel as the Turok Han started placing
more bags on top of the one he had already put down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"When will this be ready?" asked
the First Evil.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"I'd say five more minutes, then
I can light it." said Gabriel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He heard two impacts, he glanced over and saw two
"GRENADES!" he dove behind the pile of bags, but saw the robot at the door on
the side he had gone to, so he was on his feet again, the 40mm grenade struck
his hip, he was thrown sideways, close enough to one of the other grenades to
eat a full third of it's shrapnel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He got to his feet and headed into the corridor. He knew the
robot would have two options: attempt to diffuse the bomb, or attempt to kill
Gabriel. The First Evil was hopefully sending Turok Han to help distract the
robot or finish the bomb and light it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He reached the robot's previous position and glanced in, seeing
the robot with a katana and several piles of dust, one of them in the making.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>He just ran at the robot, and
caught the sword in his hand as she made a slice at him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He then punched the robot in the ribs, the robot let go of
the sword and punched him in the face, sending him backwards. He still held the
sword, he went for the robot, attempting to slice it, but the robot grabbed the
sword and pulled Gabriel in, nutting him in the side of the head. She then
kicked him in the chest, he had let go of the sword. She spun around, but he
intercepted her swing by grabbing her forearms. He then swung her around, three
times before he let go, sending her across the room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He realised that might have been a bad idea when she got up,
loading another grenade into the launcher, and he just about got behind
something before the robot could fire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>He then threw a knife at the
robot's gun, getting it down the barrel of the grenade launcher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The robot didn't fire as he ran at her. She instead shook
the weapon, the knife left the barrel, and she got it pointed at him when he
was a metre away. He deflected the weapon, shoulder butting the robot in the
waist, he then felt a knife enter the back of his head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>He recovered in time to feel a
third bag of weed killer land on him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He raised his head enough to see where the robot was, the
robot brought the M16 up to fire, but only got the grenade off after he had
shoved one of the bags into the air between him and the grenade launcher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>It detonated in mid air.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>He got up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>The room was full of smoke, he
saw movement behind the smoke, the robot was running at him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He picked up a handy piece of rubble from where the floor
had been removed over the hell mouth, and threw it at the robot, but she batted
it off to the side with the back of her fist and continued on in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He used a palm strike on the top of the robot's head, but
that did fuck all, the robot continued on in, punching him in the sternum with
a middle finger second knuckle sticking out, this lifted him off his feet, she
then kneed him in the 'nads, this fractured his pelvis a little.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He bounced off the wall and jumped off to the side when the
robot tried to punch him in the throat, burying her hand in the wall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The robot went vertical, running up the wall and towards him,
her endoskeleton now visible where her skin had been removed by the concrete.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>He used a palm strike to her
chest to send her across the room, he then ran off looking for a weapon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The aircraft they were on, a Concorde that the RAF had
secreted away, couldn't land in the middle of a city, it could land at more
airports since the engines had been replaced with turbofans (they were a little
bit bigger than the turbojets, and had wayyyyyyy more thrust apparently), and
had been fitted with bomb bay doors, through which they would jump.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They had a slide that would extend from the airframe ahead
of the doors so that the airflow doesn't smack them against the back of the
opening, and they'd be jumping from just under 12,000 feet, only opening their
velocity chutes when they were halfway above the altitude where they'd be
outside the glide radius of the site.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Right, everyone, listen up. We just got word, Gabriel's on
the Cleveland hell mouth, the robot's giving out continuous telemetry on it's
own and Gabriel's location, the tactical situation will probably be changing
rapidly and continuously, so everyone, watch your fucking eyeHUDs." said Henno
over the intercom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Everyone else seemed to be all relaxed, Buffy was about the

proper name is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dawn was up in the cockpit with the flight crew and, Aiden
and Henno, she was going to be a spare com for the European crew.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The famed SAS, not looking very military, more like, ...
gangsters or something. The way they kept calling Aiden 'Boss' instead of
'Colonel', their general attitudes were different from the soldiers she had
encountered at the initiative.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not that the initiative crew had been all stoic, all the
time. Perhaps the only army that could conceivably be like that was <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">North Korea</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s armed
forces, or some cult, but these people seemed more like the slayers for some
reason.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The gas mains she had used had been shut off at the source
when the cops started taking back over, so she couldn't use that at all, as if
it was of use earlier.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The batteries on the cell phones she had left lying around
were dead now, so she couldn't monitor Gabriel's movements beyond sound (which
had gotten confusing due to the acoustics of the sewers) chemical analysis of
the air, his sweat, the volatile materials his clothes had picked up from
preparing the bomb.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If she loses track of him, she would have to return to the hell
mouth because that was his logical target, she had sabotaged the device to buy
time in that instance, but there wasn't a lot of time.</p>

as a pull at the wires revealed they were no longer connected to the device
inside.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Now what?" asked the First Evil.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gabriel looked around. He then ran over to a pile of
conduits, he picked up two and jammed them through the pile so they penetrated
the heating charge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He then picked up the car battery he was going to use to
spark the device and the jumper leads. He connected them up to the rods, and
started moving them around.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>When he felt they had come into
contact, he waited.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>The thin contact area should get
hot enough to ignite the mixture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>He started hearing a hissing
noise coming out of the pipe, and eventually he saw smoke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Then he felt something strike
him in the back, and he was thrown forward.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>He got up to see the robot
loading another grenade, she shot him before he could figure out what to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>He ran at her as she loaded a
third, she shot him from about a metre away, he was thrown to the ceiling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The grenades were beating the crap out of him, but he got up
again, there wasn't much the robot could do to the bomb with him there threatening
to kill him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>The robot was pulling sacks off
in twos, trying to get to the heat source.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

to use as a booster charge, he was obviously using impulse explosives to cook
off the charge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gabriel had now run off, she couldn't pursue right now, she
had to leave that to the incoming SAS, and the slayers that were now returning
to the scene now that the deception was over. But the slayers were not as
thoroughly drilled in firearms as the SAS or Gabriel, who is former SBS, are,
they would have to avoid getting too close to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>That unfortunately meant leaving
most of the sewer network for his personal use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The slayers were going to set up in locations that should
contain Gabriel, positions that allowed them to kill him before he was anywhere
near close enough to shoot them with any vague sense of accuracy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>That meant that Gabriel was

<p class=MsoNormal>"All Romeos, I have control, we're approaching the drop

Aiden.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The trap door opened as did the bomb bay doors, dropping
then sliding under the floor and swinging down respectively, the slide extended
from its location and then dropped down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Everyone had started running onto the slide on the first
'go', they were missing the back of the doorframe by about 40cm. That was the
part that made Buffy uneasy, even a slayer could be put in a wheelchair for
some time if they bounced off that doorframe like that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Sandi's with her, and in spite of what I've seen of the way

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh for crying out loud." said Jane, she then walked up to
Daria and grabbed her by the ear, and led her out of the training room, Daria
asking what she thought she was doing and telling her to let go.</p>

looking mildly amused at Buffy's rushed and unprepared state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Buffy looked embarrassed and said "Oh, ... okay, ... I guess
that means we're done.", then she asked "There aren't any other bad guys around
are there?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A truck with stakes bolted to the front and the kind of
window d&eacute;cor that indicated a vampire in the driving seat entered the area and
Wesley got out and asked "what did we miss?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"The final outcome of the epic
global battle." said Henno, as he and the rest of his troop started to walk
off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Okay." he then looked at Buffy
who wasn't moving with the SAS troop and said "anything we can do right now?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>-~-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Shouldn't we feel better now?"
asked Quinn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Maybe that comes later." said
Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Daria's phone rang.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Y'ello?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Robodaria here, Gabriel Kent is now confirmed dead, the <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cleveland</st1:place></st1:City> hell mouth is
secure. Buffy Summers is with me, we are headed to your current location."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Acknowledged." said Daria, and
Robodaria hung up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"What was that?" asked Quinn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"My boss is coming in." said
Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Okay, so, what happens now?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria thought about it and said "Well, we, I mean the slayer
force, not us, because we spent most the battle sitting around in Tiffany's
head, ... We, just saved everyone's ass. But in doing so, caused several hundred
million dollars worth of damage, without the kind of legal protection the
United States Defence Department has. So I guess the next thing that happens to
us would depend on the gratitude of the administration and the understanding of
whatever judges and juries handle the cases."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Quinn nodded, then said "we're
boned."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Can't I talk to Riley?" asked
Buffy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"No, you can't." said George.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Just, this is kind of a big decision. I mean, I'm the
default commander of the Watchers Council, but I don't have the management
experience of Giles, or any of the other watchers-" started Buffy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But George interrupted with "Your Watchers Council is now a
terrorist organisation in our view, and if you are terrorists, you have fewer
legal protections than what we give paedophiles. But if you agree to become our
supernatural division of the National Security Agency, then you are instead
Special Agents with all the legal authority that comes with such positions, now
what are you?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>Buffy sighed and said "we're
national security agents."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"That was the only way we could
stay out of jail?" asked Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yeah, between the massive property destruction, the stolen
police and military property, and <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>
killing several bystanders with Marcus Hamilton, the government was really thin
on patience." said Buffy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"You mean they were laughing
maniacally." said Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You know, Daria, I've had it with you, you always seem to
have a smart ass remark on the tip of your tongue and never seem to take
anything about your job seriously."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Excuse me? Where the fuck do
you get off telling me I don't take my job seriously?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"What is that supposed to mean?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It MEANS I've spent the last couple of days commanding an
entire army group of slayers concerned that I'm going to get a large proportion
of them killed, then watching my sister getting sexually abused by vampires,
and all that time of doing little else but worry. And there you are, telling me
that I'm some sort of cold psycho who lets those under her command die for
fun?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>There was silence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Sorry about that." said Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"No, it's my bad, ... Look, where
are you now?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm waiting for a flight to where they're treating Tiffany.
It's close to <st1:City w:st="on">Lawndale</st1:City>, and I'll be meeting my
dad there, me mom was killed in that nuclear explosion near <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
w:st="on">Lawndale</st1:place></st1:City>, gotta find out what the funeral
arrangements are. Then I guess I prepare for my first day of work at the No
Such Agency."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Buffy chuckled before saying "I am sorry about blowing up at
you earlier, but I just made a snap decision that will have potentially
catastrophic consequences without being given the time to decide what to do. Plus
Giles and Kennedy are among the dead, both of them being close friends."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I got to meet them myself, they were good people. We've all
had a rough couple of days, I hope we can take a couple of weeks off before
showing up to work. It might be useful to talk to Wesley about what Wolfram and
Hart were like."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Yeah, I guess I'll get onto him
then." said Buffy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"I do not understand." said <st1:place
w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"The government of late has been getting increasingly warped.
It says it's for human rights and making the world a nicer place to live in,
but in reality it's motives have been to look like it's doing something about
terrorism without doing something about <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
w:st="on">Israel</st1:country-region></st1:place>'s bad behaviour." said
Wesley.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"In my day, brutality was used
to ensure obedience." said <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It does as long as you have the power. But it's humiliating
for those you oppress, and they'll want you out of power. The problem is that
the current administration can pick on those whose opinion doesn't count and
make out they are up to something or blame them for some major incident." said
Wesley.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-outline-level:1'>"Then they must be killed." said
<st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wesley looked worried, and said "that's probably the wrong
approach. We kill this lot, we could easily end up with someone worse."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Then we must ensure that someone interested in fulfilling
our objectives is in a position to take power when we kill or otherwise depose
the current administration." said <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
