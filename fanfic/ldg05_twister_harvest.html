<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Gambit: not that frog whose secret weapon
is a deck of cards?" said Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No, he's the frog whose secret weapon is
the ability to make things explooooooo- Jane, ... ..." Daria was frozen in mid
sentence as she visibly paled, she then calmly said "Spike, Jane, follow me."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She then shot off at a flat out run away
from the arrow, a panicked, adrenaline fuelled attempt to break the sound
barrier on foot run.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Jane and Spike looked between her and the
arrow, then Jane looked at her watch, saying "SHIT!!!", she grabbed Spike and
pulled him after her as she also ran.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Oh fuckin' 'ell," growled Spike as he got
the hint and put more effort into it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Daria, you know the arrow doesn't weigh
that much right?" asked Jane as she caught up with her friend.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"20 grams, or thereabouts, right?" said
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Right, 0.02 times 900million gives us-"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"900 MILLION??? SHOULD HAVE FIGURED THAT
WAS YOUR MISTAKE!" shouted Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"900 million what?" asked Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Joules per kilo," said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"THE SPEED OF LIGHT SQUARED IS NOT NINE
HUNDRED MILLION, IT'S NINETY THOUSAND TRILLION!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Oh, right, ... and the yield that gives us
is:" said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"APPROXAMATELY TWO POINT THREE MEGATONS!!!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"TWO POINT- JANE, GRAB HER LEFT SIDE!" said
Spike as he came up next to Daria and grabbed her belt and her shoulder, Jane
did the same, and they picked Daria up, carrying her like a battering ram.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"How long do we have?" asked Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Jane glanced at her watch and said "23
seconds."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"That's never going to be enough," said
Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Ideas?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"YEAH, NEVER TRY THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE,
AND QUIT WATCHING <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainiac:_Science_Abuse">BRAINIAC</a>!!!"
yelled Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"HEY! YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TOLD ME ABOUT
IT!!!" responded Jane. Daria had watched the Sick Sad World-like series during
her stay in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"YOU'RE THE ONE WHO STARTED DOWNLOADING
EPISODES!!!" responded Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She then performed a spell that sped them
up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Eventually they were approaching the sort
of distance they needed to be for any cover to be of any use (outside the
fireball radius and with sufficient distance to give an actual shadow)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They encountered a target (A concrete
filled tank), there were a number of craters around it, they had filled with
water, the tank itself had sunk a little due to liquefaction of the soil over
time, this seemed like the best thing they could get behind in the time they
had.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"CAN WE USE THIS?" asked Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"GET US BEHIND THAT TANK!" said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They just about made it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Mud and water was blown into the air, the
tank threatened to turn over on them, but didn't, but the fireball ascended,
and was still pouring out heat by the megawatt when the angle was too steep for
the tank to shade them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The two vampires got up and looked at
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She was unconscious from the heat they were
being exposed to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Oops," said Jane, as she shrugged.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Donald entered the room and yelled "A TWO
MEGATON DETONATION OCCURRED ON ONE OF OUR BOMBING RANGES, THE FUCKING UN IS
GOING APESHIT! WHAT, YOU THINK WE WEREN'T HAVING ENOUGH TROUBLE WITH THE <st1:place

THING???"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Jane and Spike looked at each other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Then Jane asked "How's Daria?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Donald looked at her with a death glare and
asked "how's Daria? ... HOW'S DARIA??? YOU JUST THRUST THIS COUNTRY INTO THE

DARIA???"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yes, ... Well, no, actually, I also lost my </span><span

style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>vaporised</span><span lang=EN-US> in a big

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The enraged </span><span style='mso-ansi-language:

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"So, that blood flavoring, have you always
had a taste for that type of mix?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No, in fact, it's only recently I got such
a taste, is that normal for vampires?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Not as far as I know, we usually prefer
human or otter blood," said Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Right," said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Boss, with respect, this is an
insssssssanely bad idea, ... sir," said Rebecca.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Maybe, but as a Vampire Slayer, you are
uniquely placed to develop a course that best suits the classes you will be
teaching," said Aiden.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Rebecca just about suppressed a groan, this
was an order from a superior officer, but this also struck her as potentially
the biggest gaff since Prince William went to a fancy dress party dressed as a
Nazi, ... no, not potentially, certainly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Rebecca, you're not the only member of the
special air service to have killed a member of the watcher's council or their
slayers," said Aiden.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"They'll remember my face more clearly than
anyone else's, especially if they were at Westbury house," said Rebecca.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Rebecca, you are still the most suitable
person to design the course," said Aiden.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Understood," said Rebecca.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span lang=EN-US>Willow</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
lang=EN-US> visibly fumed, and Buffy looked a little confused.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Buffy's confusion stemmed from the fact
Rebecca hadn't actually told Buffy she was the one who had slotted Kennedy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Aiden sent me to advise the team that will
be teaching firearms proficiency and tactics to your personal, felt that the
fact I was a slayer made me essential to designing the curriculum," Rebecca
stated, trying to keep as neutral as possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay," said Buffy, she then said "I'm
still not entirely happy about this, the instructors are all members of the
team that attacked us, some of us are still grieving the losses, this
arrangement is just asking for trouble."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I know," said Rebecca.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"It might be a good idea to avoid using
live ammo for a while," said Buffy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"We can't, not for all the training, blanks
don't have the recoil impulse characteristics to adequately simulate live fire
conditions, it affects marksmanship, there are situations where we do use
blanks, but we want to get everyone shooting straight first, that has to be
first and a tenth nature," said Rebecca.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span lang=EN-US>Willow</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
lang=EN-US> and Buffy looked at each other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I understand that our presence will be
testing, frankly I'd have picked instructors from another regiment entirely-"
said Rebecca.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"But the Special Air Service is considered
the best combat unit available to us, and this cross training scheme is a
condition of us being able to continue our activities, I understand perfectly,
I just hope the others will, have you formed a lesson plan yet?" said Buffy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"We're going to go with the normal weapons
course for now, see how that works out, see if any alterations need to be made
for that to work," said Rebecca.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Alright, now, we have assembled your first
class, we have purposely avoided personal that witnessed your kills or those
who lost friends to you, but unfortunately, there is one person who will have
to oversee the training for me from our end that has lost someone to your group."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Who?" asked Rebecca.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span lang=EN-US>Willow</span></st1:place></st1:City><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You're healing fast, aren't you?" asked
the doctor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Witch, heal thy self," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I see," mused the doctor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Normally I'd be seeing Tiffany about now,"
said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You're her watcher?" asked the doctor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"What exactly did you do out there?" asked
the doctor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria sighed and said "something the NSA
will want to keep top secret for, ... well, ... ever."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Daria, thank god you're alright!" came
Jakes emotive voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Hi dad," said Daria, as Jake came up and
hugged her "Oww, burns, burns."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Jake jumped back and said "oh, sorry." He
then looked around and asked "Where's Quinn?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Toilet, she's been here for a while."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Oh, ... so, how long have you got off of
work?" asked Jake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Few days I'd imagine."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Have you bleached your hair?" he asked,
noticing that the back of Daria's hair was now a much lighter shade.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Nah, Jane bleached it."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Oh, ... looks nice."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Luckilly they were close enough to <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Lawndale</st1:place></st1:City> for them to
simply drive over. The problem with the NSA though was that they were more
interested in using the watchers as analysts than to command the slayers (only
60% were still situated with their slayers). The slayers were essentially left
to do their own thing, while they answered to the watchers, they mostly only
had phone contact with them, which was less than ideal because that could
interfere with communications of reports, and the NSA weren't the only
organization into illegal phone taps. This was a serious security risk, and it
took longer for the watchers to organize anything with the slayers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>From what Buffy had told her, the <st1:country-region
w:st="on">UK</st1:country-region> let them operate with greater independence, but
this was probably more down to the relative size of the <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United Kingdom</st1:country-region>, it's small size reduced the
logistical problems of accessing or surveying it's personal, or the <st1:country-region
w:st="on">UK</st1:country-region> government was just less paranoid than the <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">US</st1:country-region></st1:place>
government.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Some of the slayers were qualified to
function also as watchers, so that wasn't too bad for them, it just wasn't
helpful to have this new structure imposed on them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Barbra wondered what Tiffany was doing
here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Obviously there had been a few weeks where
they were conducting drug assisted and hypnotically assisted interrogations to
figure out what threat the First Evil's programming still presented, but
honestly, Tiffany was safe for release now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>There was nothing mystical going on besides
the slayer strength, there was no activity going on that couldn't be accounted
for by Tiffany's personality, the two personae had remained united since the
incident where Tiffany had trapped those three people in her mind, and had been
progressing well in her recovery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The problem now seemed to be that Tiffany
just didn't want to return to active duty, like she had fucked it up so many
times that she was now too scared that she would kill or injure someone by
accident again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>There was little she could do about that,
as a shrink, she would never know what combat was like.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Fortunately this wasn't just a recent
problem.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She made it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She had to save up her energy to make this
work, and that was a very slow rate of charge in that dimension, but it
happened at last and she got through.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This way was at least gentler than the
other way (landing in a neat crouch instead of an uncontrolled landing that
fucked up her ankle and fractured her hip and upper arm), and this time she
didn't have to spend all her energy recovering from 3<sup>rd</sup> degree
burns.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>There was going to be a price for all that
shit they had done to her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She looked around for the first time since
getting back, she was certain this was earth and her own dimension, but she had
no idea where on earth she was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She stood up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>There were a lot of people looking at her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She looked around some more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>There were posters all over the walls that
urged the reader to 'vote Zanu PF'.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>A truck full of soldiers drove up to her
and arrested her for something ("is it 'cos I is white?") and drove her to the
police station, she just sat there recovering, she had caused enough of a
disturbance without drawing additional attention from the Watchers Council, she
could keep it cool for now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Of course that might not be possible if
these guys decided to get medieval on her, as they were famous for lately, but
she could minimize the actual magic to simply blowing tiny holes in their blood
vessels, make it look like they died from meningitis or something (it would
probably take ages for the coroner to make any kind of determination), pop a
few vessels in their brain stems, maybe conjure an alternating current across
their hearts (that would be fun to watch, see them die slowly of a cardiac
arrest).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They frowned when they saw her smile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She just shrugged.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Incorrect." said the Daria looking figure
as she continued down the hall to the library.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Robodaria?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The girl turned and dropped her cloak,

Okay, do you know where Daria is? Buffy has been trying to get a hold of her
for ages," said the agent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"She is in the infirmary recovering from
severe burns, did you not hear of the incident with the exploding arrow?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Exploding arrow? ... No, ... I heard of a
nuclear explosion that occurred recently on a bomb range."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"That is the incident, I thought this
agency dealt primarily with covert investigations, how did the details of the
incident escape you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"The details are classified need to know, I
guess I didn't need to know, ... but I do need to get to Daria, thanks," said the
agent as he headed off to the infirmary.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:place w:st="on"><span lang=EN-US>Illyria</span></st1:place><span

and Wesley were going to be briefed on something the Initiative had uncovered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Doesn't look very mystical," said Wesley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"It's a man who's flying without the aid of
an airplane with laser beams for eyes," said Donald.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Wesley looked through the file and found
photographs of sections of pavement where the beams had penetrated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, but this still looks technological,"
said Wesley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"So's that nuclear rocket launcher kit your
Miss Burkle invented," said Donald, he then said "Answers soon, or I'm going to
see if there's someone more suitable." he then left.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"He is right, there is a strong chance of
at least a partially mystical machine here, and we have dealt with robots
before," said <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, I guess we need to get out there
then," said Wesley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Daria, how could you end up in hospital
over a simple experiment?" asked Buffy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"The experiment did a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_bravo">Castle Bravo</a> on my friend,
who failed to mention she was trying out such an insane experiment," said
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>" ... That would be <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address
w:st="on">Jane Lane</st1:address></st1:Street> would it?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yep: She is an artist, and this is how she
will <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>kill</b> herself," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"What?" asked Buffy, not getting the way
Daria emphasized 'Kill'.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Never mind, anything else I can help you
with?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No, that's it, except for what Castle
Bravo is," said Buffy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"A nuclear shot with an expected yield of
eight megatons or less, produced fifteen megatons, Jane expected a yield of
230kg, and instead got around two point three Megatons. And you make me sound
cheerful, where's the depression is from?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I gave Angel and his team such a hard time
over their taking over the LA branch of Wolfram and Hart, and now we're doing
something similar," said Buffy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"That mean you're going to apologize to
them for the attitude?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Hell no."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"How's things over there anyway?" asked
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Well, we just received a number of SAS
instructors to teach us how to operate a gun, we're going to be instructing
them in demonology and magic." said Buffy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"That won't be tense," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"That's the thing about war, once you start
killing, it's difficult to stop, especially where the score's so uneven," said
Buffy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"How is everyone handling this
arrangement?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Well, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
w:st="on">Willow</st1:place></st1:City> seems to be holding her temper, and I
selected where possible people who have as little connection to those who died
and weren't in the groups the SAS did manage to kill members of, but they're
still going to feel anger regarding the deaths," said Buffy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, two kinds of shot you can take,
centre of mass, that's for easy acquisition, a whole range of organs within the
torso are essential for your survival, and instant kill, where you target the
brainstem, tighter target, but your enemy will be dead before he or she hits
the floor, ... of course, if you want to take your enemy alive, you could hit the
soft tissue on the outside of their leg so they can't run away that fast, but
mostly we're going to train for situations where you need the enemy dead. Any
questions so far?" asked Rebecca.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span lang=EN-US>Willow</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
lang=EN-US> felt uneasy about Rebecca's lesson so far.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Clear in her mind was the instant those
three 45cal. Rounds had entered her girlfriends mouth and punched through the
back of her head, severing the brainstem. It had felt to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
w:st="on">Willow</st1:place></st1:City> like the worst ice cream headache ever
imaginable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>And she had then seen Rebecca go for Giles,
the burst starting just above his heart and ending in his nose, the two leaders
of the group.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She had then set about killing the rest of
the group, who had to pile on because there was no way they could get to cover
in the time allotted, she had killed a further 3 in hand to hand combat and had
dislocated the arms of a couple of other slayers, crushing the throat of one,
she had spent a couple of weeks unable to talk and breathing through a hole in
her neck from a tracheotomy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The SAS don't have a stun setting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Understatement of the millennium, and we're
only 4 years in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, getting a gun to spit a bullet is a
piece of piss, but getting your bullet into your enemy before they get about 20
into you is a serious bastard of a problem, which can only be solved with
practice, that will start tomorrow at the SAS's very own firing range. For
right now we'll be discussing the weapons we'll be training with, which will be
<a href="http://world.guns.ru/assault/as18-e.htm">M16A1</a>s, because the <a
href="http://world.guns.ru/assault/as22-e.htm">SA80</a>'s a piece of shit."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Willow listened through her state of shock
as Rebecca described the M16, a 5.56mm gas operated rotating bolt assault rifle
that uses up 750 rounds per minute (10.83 continuous a second, about 2.8
seconds of firing time on a 30 round clip), 945m/s muzzle velocity, she briefly
touched on the effect of gravity and wind on the bullet's trajectory, but
mentioning that the course won't be as geared towards sniping as a more
specialized course would be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, why?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The slayer glanced down at her hands, <st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Oh, ... sorry." She looked at Rebecca, who
didn't seem too annoyed at this development, she was patiently waiting for <st1:place

fireball, which she did.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Amy had managed to scare the cops into
freeing her ("Can you kill me before I telepathically slice your brain stem the
way I just did your testicles?") and giving her 4000000$ (Zimbabwe dollars,
probably equivalent to 12$ American), but she could easily Obi-Wan her way
through the airports without too much of a mystical signature.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"How much radio traffic occurred just
before the attack?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Minimum necessary, we even used code
words, this gang had repelled sting operations before, I guess they just
upgraded a few centuries. And the other weapons they were using were something
else too, Diamond bullets, RDX propelled, weapons looked similar to P-90s,
y'know, like on Stargate? ... Anyway, that's all I got for now."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, thank you, we may need to ask you
more questions later," said Wesley as he and the rest of the team departed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Donald entered the room and said "You're
free to go for now."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yippie," said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Finally," said Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>As they left Donald said "BUUUUUUT, ... if
either of you cause us any more trouble, you will regret it. You may have souls
now, but you both are going to hell when you die, even you <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He waited for an answer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He turned around.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He left the cell in time to see the two

obviously not stopped to hear his speech.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"So, where to?" asked Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You buying?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Get fucked," said Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Later, boyfriend, food first," said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"That's just sick," said Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Not yet," said Jane as she drank the
cocktail that was only half blood, the other half was stuff that either didn't
go together or go on a human or demon palette.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"What, you get sick often?" asked Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Pretty much every morning for some reason,"
said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Uh, funny, except vampires don't get
pregnant," said Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Jane rested a hand on her abdomen, not for
the first time feeling the organ underneath that felt like a balloon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Whatever's happening, I should probably
see a doctor."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany looked up and said "Hi Faith."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Faith entered Tiffany's room and sat down
next to her saying "I heard you're still scared you'll go evil again."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, ... You're not here because the doctor
sent you are you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah I am, but I don't think any amount of
arguing will get you out there before you're ready, and no one will think any
less of you if it takes a decade, ... assuming you can endure the boredom."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany looked at her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Faith then asked "So, what's it like here?
They just talk to you here, or is there, like, bondage too?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"That's definitely a </span><span
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>foetus</span><span lang=EN-US>," said the
doctor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Oooookaaaaayyyyyy, ... I thought vampires
didn't get pregnant," said Jane, as she lay on the table with the sonar device
pressed against her abdomen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"That was our best knowledge on the subject,"
said the doctor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Backed by hundreds to thousands of years
of vampires going bareback without getting preggers," said Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Then, what's different here?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Spike sniffed and said "we have souls."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, so no more unprotected sex," said
Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The doctor turned to her and said "Okay, I
won't attempt to compel a decision to keep or abort it, but this is uncharted
territory, and, ... Well, ... I'd like to chart it."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Hell no, breeding's Summer's gig," said
Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"What?" asked Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Spike, ... it's probably the antichrist or
something, ... " Jane was now trying to come up with something that would stop
Spike looking at her like she was the most evil thing ever created "Quit
looking at me like that."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Spike sighed and said "She's right, we may
have souls, but whatever that is in there, probably isn't good."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Jane eventually said "All right then."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Winifred dropped the clear fluid onto the
object and watched, eventually saying "no mystical signature."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Diamonds may be more common than most
people think, but they aren't that cheap, especially those that big," said
Wesley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"So we're thinking someone made them?" asked
Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"There are two non-mystical ways to make a
diamond I know of: bombard a target with carbon atoms, or melt carbon under
intense pressures."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Any way to determine which?" asked Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yes, as a matter of fact there is," said
Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Well, there's nothing to keep you here on
at present, you might as well get back to work," said the doctor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Sweet," said Daria as she got off the bed
and opened the bag her dad had brought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Pulling out the first items of clothing,
she realized Dad had followed Quinn's advice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She shrugged and pulled the curtain closed
around the bed and started getting dressed again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Watcher central," answered Dawn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"How's it going my whitey?" asked Xander.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Dawn chuckled, and replied "What's up?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Well, apparently someone hypnotized a
pilot into handing over his helicopter, index Z-128CJD, apparently it was a
Caucasian woman with an American accent and more scars than a cutter with a
crack addiction, she's going by the name 'Amelia Airheart', either an alias, or
we finally have an answer to a long running mystery," said Xander.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I think Amelia disappeared before the
helicopter was invented," said Dawn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"There were autogyro's back then weren't
there?" asked Xander.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Different flight principles are involved
with those Xander, do we have any pictures of this woman?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"One of our witches is doing an E-fit now,
we'll have it to you in-" he asked someone in the room, then said "-20 seconds,
check your E-mail."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Dawn turned to her computer and opened her
browser, she opened the attached file and said "got it, ... Xander, does she look
familiar to you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, I just don't know where I've seen
her before."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I'll circulate it," said Dawn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"That's what happens when my sister is put
in charge of bringing me a change of clothes when I'm hospitalized, Jane and
Spike were been detained for most of my stay, and now apparently Jane's found
she's pregnant," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Jane is a vampire," said <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"She assures me it's no joke and that she's
not faking. So, what's going on here?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"We're checking this bullet to see how it
was made," said Winifred, she placed the projectile in the clamps and turned on
the laser saying "the laser goes through points I've ground flat, I'm using
high ultra violet, because I can."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria looked over Winifred's shoulder and
commented "the bullet's transparent."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"It is diamond," said <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"So it'll either be made by bombarding a
target with carbon, or-"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Melted under pressure," said Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, melt under pressure and the crystal
has fewer holes," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Someone has a high pressure chamber with a
window in it and an industrial laser, the chamber will probably be the more
expensive component, we just need to ask around all the distributers." said
Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"It might be an idea to look out for anyone
ordering parts that could be used to make a laser," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Parts that- ... oh shit," said Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No way," said Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Way, I can think of about 20 ways a
suitable laser can be constructed off the top of my head," said Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, that case, you could list them, and
look for combinations, ... Hang on, Donald mentioned laser weapons," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"X-ray canons actually," said Wesley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Apparently it's easier to, err," started
Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Throw electrons at a magnetic barrier than
to work out all the complicated optics needed to focus a coherent light source,"
said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>" ... Yeah, ... What you said," said Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Amazing that they managed to condense the
equipment for that into such a small weapon, I mean, X-ray laser of this kind
uses a particle accelerator."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Those use x-rays in the 100s of MeVs range
though, you only want it in the keV range for this," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You would need to keep the atmosphere out
of your weapon if you want to be accelerating electrons about, I'm wondering
how that's being accomplished," said Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I guess it's time we set up a stakeout
then," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Fixed wing was MUCH better than rotary
wing, flying a helicopter is like balancing on a broomstick.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Amy chuckled at the analogy, being a witch,
she was supposed to fly on broomsticks, but that gets draughty, and they might
not come with autopilots.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Amy had to change aircraft every so often
in order to stay ahead of the various police forces, but that would soon become
insufficient, they were soon going to get wise to her mind control, she needed
something capable of flying transatlantic soon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She had mostly been nicking Mig 29s, loaded
with nothing but fuel and drop tanks, they had a flight radius of about 1700
miles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She was mostly tailing passenger carrying

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It would probably be better to fly nap of
the earth all the way, the terrain would hide her from most control centres and
the phone network in rural <st1:place w:st="on">Africa</st1:place> was

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The problem with that idea was the fuel

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She had managed to find an internet caf&eacute; in
Zambia and managed to find out which flights went where, then asked the
commander at the base she stole the Mig from what frequencies were used by what

being they look for her over there while she punches out over the ivory coast, and
steals an aircraft capable of transatlantic flight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Spike watched as two people entered from
one side, carrying suitcases, and another two entered carrying briefcases from
the other side of the open area between the two large buildings of the
abandoned textiles factory, going nuts from the lack of smoking he could achieve
(no heat sources allowed), he used the camera Winifred had made for him to
record the activity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He remembered the briefing where Winifred
described the camera.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"The camera uses a clockwork spring to pull
a chemical film through the focal area which is designed to work in low light,
you will need to manually focus the lens because the system can't have any
electrical parts, except for the mic which needs a light source to imprint the
sound amplitude onto the film, that uses an electrostatic generator and a neon
bulb to create the light for that, but the circuit has too much impedance to
resonate clearly for any of the sensors that they would probably have, are you
with me so far?" asked Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yes," he said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You didn't," said Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No, I didn't," Spike reluctantly admitted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Sorry about that," she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"S'okay, you said something about a manual

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They had decided not to leave the cops in
harms way, instead tipping off the mafia that someone was attempting to smuggle
in weapons intended for use against them, getting a rival gang involved seemed
better than letting cops die.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Spike watched as they carried out the deal,
a briefcase full of cash for four large bags full of something white and
powdered (coke, heroin, or something else).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Then the fireworks started.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Really thin, brilliant white, blue tinged
lines connected to points off to the left with something in the sky.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>As Spike watched, a human sized flying
object started glowing bright blue and shot past with a loud bang.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>There were more flashes from ahead and
behind him, more of these people were flying around shooting up the place, anyone
who wasn't the four in the middle was getting strafed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The smell of ozone wafted over him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>What had Winifred said would happen to the
air the concentrated X-rays would pass through?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It would get ionized, form ozone, nitrogen
oxides, nitrogen dioxides.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The flying men came up more slowly, giving
Spike his first good look at them, he caught wings folding up into their packs
as they changed from level flight to hover, using really small jets attached to
the hips and shoulders, the four hip jets produced the majority of the thrust,
the four shoulder jets just kept them upright, using varying amounts of power
to do so. Some of them started flying sideways around the buildings, others
hovered over fixed locations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He then noticed something on their chests.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They all seemed to have breasts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They also wore the sort of equipment vests
you see a lot of soldiers wearing on operations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>There was no way they could be controlling
those things if they were human though.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Suddenly they raised their arms and started
shooting the buildings with their X-ray cannons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Had they realized he was there?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Eventually they were done, they flew off
into the night and the gangsters parted ways.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Spike then headed to get the phone, he then
came across the scent of roasted flesh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He headed through the building and found
someone with civilian clothes and one of those P-90 things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The man was still alive, but wouldn't be if
his injuries weren't treated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He turned his weapon to Spike, but Spike
was on him too fast, grabbing his weapon arm and saying "easy mate, I'm here to
save you." He then placed the weapon to one side and said "do you have a phone
on you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No, they target anything that can receive
a signal, who are you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Errm, ... I don't know if I can tell you
that, look, help will be arriving soon, what do you know of what happened
here?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Those angels of death or whatever they
are, they've been protecting our rivals and killing our people en masse, we
don't know where they've been getting their tech from, but they're just, ... they
can see you wherever you hide, like they can see your body heat or something."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They were right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Spike picked up the weapon and was about to
ask him where he got it when he suddenly noticed a smell.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He sniffed it, and tried to place the
scent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He then asked "What about these? The mutant
P-90s?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Errm, ... I don't know if I can tell you
that," he said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Spike said "well, your gang just happens to
be well armed enough to be considered terrorists, which means, no rights to be
treated as a human." and he then pressed the muzzle of the weapon against the
man's shin and discharged one shot through the bones.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"AAAAAOOOOOOWWWWWWWWW!" he cried.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"So, who are your bosses?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Spike waited a few seconds and then pressed
the muzzle against his knee.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"DRUSILLA, IT'S DRUSILLA AND SHAUN, THEY'RE
OUR BOSSES, THEY PROVIDE ALL OUR TECHNOLOGY, OKAY?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay then," said Spike, as he got up to
get some help, he then said "Oh, by the way, anyone asks, you shot yourself by
accident."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Insane vampire from the Victorian era,

subordinate to Amy Madison, a witch and an old friend of Willow's who went dark

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"And never came back," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Spike continued "Anyway, it's actually them

not the ones behind the angels of death we saw earlier, then who is?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Robodaria?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The robot had been replaying the footage
back in her CPU and analyzing everything. She pulled the <a

VCR and stuck it in her arm, and the TV activated seemingly on it's own, she
played the appropriate bits as she said "their weapons are located on their
back packs and in packs strapped to their arms, they didn't seem to operate any
external controls for their equipment which leads me to conclude they are
connected to their equipment by a non-mechanical means, as I would be to a UAV,
or-" everyone's phone rang, interrupting the briefing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They all answered, and through them,
Robodaria said "your cell phones."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They all looked at her darkly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The robot moved onto another bit and said
"where they are hovering there are things that become more apparent, their
hands move their fingers purposelessly when empty, their chests expand and
contract, also, their eyes." She moved onto a part where one is hovering around
firing at rival gang members.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The visors got a little darker for several
frames where the weapon was being discharged, the eyes irises were dilated, the
eyelids blinked. "They have more human mannerisms than would be necessary for
their tasks. Blinking and hand movements use energy, and waste CPU runtime. And
the device protecting the eyeballs would not be needed by a robot because it's
less hassle to build the components into the robot's eyes. also the luminosity
here is not a problem for robots, they wouldn't experience the discomfort that
humans or other organic life forms would. My conclusion is that they are
cyborgs." said Robodaria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"There is another thing that concerns me,"
said Robodaria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"What's that?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"The amount of energy those flying warriors
expended was in excess of what they could achieve with any chemical system,
flammable or electrolytic," said Robodaria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"They're nuclear?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Or mystical," said Robodaria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Where would they be getting nuclear
materials from?" asked Donald.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Just about any source of hydrogen
available. I don't think they were packing a fission plant of any kind, that
would weigh them down so much that they would struggle to remain airborne, radiothermic
generators don't pack the power for the observed energy expended, they are most
likely fusion electric," said Robodaria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"If they're using mystical energy, that can
be transmitted in bulk over extreme distance," said Wesley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"If it's not, there are ways to create
wormholes between the source and every unit, but that would probably be way
more complicated than building fusion reactors, but it would allow them to
connect their units to an unlimited sized power plant over a practically
unlimited distance," said Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, it would help if we could capture
one," said Donald.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Well, if they aren't mystically aware,
there might be a way to achieve this," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"How can it not be working?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I'm sorry, it just isn't," said the
doctor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They had been trying to abort the </span><span
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>foetus</span><span lang=EN-US> for several
hours.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The first techniques tried were the
chemical ones, but they weren't working (normally it takes more than a day to
be certain, but they had access to an MRI, and so were able to track the drugs
through Jane's system, none of them went where they were meant to), so they
moved onto the mechanical ones, but all they managed to do was severely bruise
Jane's cervix.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The fact that Jane was a vampire meant that
by all rights, the foetus shouldn't have any food or oxygen off of Jane, but it
was getting it somehow, and somehow the various chemicals they were using were
being excluded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Absolutely none of this made sense, but
then most of anything mystical didn't make any sense, it just seemed to work,
it was like if you encountered relativistic effects such as length contraction
or time dilation without having been schooled in the relevant physics, you
don't know how it works, it just does.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"There must be a mystical field around it,
that's about the only explanation I got, I'm sorry, but you need to see a witch
about this."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Jane sighed and said "right," Thinking 'I
guess Spike will be happy.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria's phone rang.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Joy's alias," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Oh, I'm sorry, I was- ... Oh, wait, ... Okay,
Daria, listen, we've identified Amy Madison in this dimension, <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place>'s headed over now
to help you," said Xander.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, where was Amy last seen?" asked
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"She was last seen stealing a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIG_29">fulcrum</a>, it was recovered in the
<st1:country-region w:st="on">Ivory Coast</st1:country-region>, the seat some
distance further, she was seen in various locations approaching a UN depot, we
think she's headed to the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">United
  States</st1:country-region></st1:place>."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Sweet," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Uh, ... You are being sarcastic, right?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Not really, no. this might help us out a
lot with this gang Drusilla's running, we should be able to follow her to base,"
said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, ... just watch your back, ... and watch
what you pick up, or wish, ... and don't <a

for songs and dances</a>, trust me, that just, ... -"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"That was YOU???" asked Daria, now
seriously annoyed with him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"errrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr, .... ... yeah, that was
me, I'm the asshole, can we get back to the impending doom of an insane evil
witch that wants you dead?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Sure, but when we meet face to face, I'm
going to want a word with you about that spell."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I could use a laugh," said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Right, just remember what her powers were
like before she got sucked down a portal, you can be certain this will be a
serious level fight," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Give me a chance to work off some of my
preggo moodswings then, won't it?" said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You're just mad that she made you jump out
a 3<sup>rd</sup> story window and then you missed the look on her face when she
was sucked into the portal," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Do faces with 3<sup>rd</sup> degree burns
even have looks?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Point is that this is going to be
extremely difficult, and you're 4 months pregnant-"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Nooooo chance of a miscarry, believe me, I
tried," said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Alright then, as long as you're sure."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Absolutely," said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Amy was observed leaving an aircraft at a
UN depot, she now seems to be headed to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Lawndale</st1:place></st1:City>,"
said Donald.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Which means she's more interested in
revenge than world domination at this point. Okay, let's set a trap," said
Daria, she had her team assembled (Jane, <st1:City w:st="on">Willow</st1:City>,
and <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>) in the NSA's library, which
seemed to be the watchers favorite briefing room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"We don't want her to detect a trap, so she
must not sense us there," said <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Willow</st1:place></st1:City>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"That means another witch will have to jam
her," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"That will be your job," said <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Willow</st1:place></st1:City>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I've been practicing, but I'm barely above
complex telekinesis," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"We'll lend you some power," said <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Willow</st1:place></st1:City>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"'kay," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"We'll meet Amanda in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
w:st="on">Lawndale</st1:place></st1:City>, she'll lend you half, I'll lend you
most, hopefully that will weaken my signal enough for you to jam her. While you
and Amanda are doing that, the rest of us will be getting ready to capture her."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"And how will we be doing this?" asked
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I have some spells that can drain mystical
energy, but if I get it wrong, I'll kill her, and we don't get our intelligence,"
said <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Willow</st1:place></st1:City>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay then, looks like I'm going home,"
said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"They gave you time off?" asked Quinn,
looking vaguely hopeful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No," said Daria, as she entered the house
carrying her <a href="http://world.guns.ru/shotgun/sh16-e.htm">USAS 12</a>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, what's going on?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"That's need to know," said the suit behind
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Amy Madison's returned to this dimension. Shortly
before learning this, we found out that Drusilla, one of her vampire XOs was
still around, and possibly building a nuclear equipped army. Amy's headed here,
we're going to attempt to capture her," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I said-" started the suit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"She needed to know, Amy's coming straight
here, and the last thing I did to her before sending her off to another
dimension was toss an incendiary grenade at her, she might go after Quinn to
get at me," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"So I just became a target for a psychotic
witch whose real problem is with you?" asked Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, sorry about that. You should pack
some stuff and stay over at Sandi's place," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Right," said Quinn as she headed upstairs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The agent behind Daria stepped in front of
her and said "does the concept 'Top Secret' not mean ANYTHING to you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"She knows the situation, so does Sandi,
and I will not put either of them in unnecessary danger."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"And if they use this information to
enhance their image at school?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"They won't, they've taken to studying, and
Brains don't rank on the social hierarchy, neither do freaks, or anyone who
associates with either, 'sides, these tales are wayyyyy too tall for anyone
hearing them from a high school student to believe," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Quinn came downstairs with an overnight bag
and said "I get a lift?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria held out the keys to the agent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He glowered and eventually took the keys
and headed off with Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria closed the door and pulled her cell

room with Amanda and Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The lane house was not too badly damaged in
the blast, it had been forced sideways 11 degrees, but a bit of reinforcement
to the damaged struts had made it safe again, and they had then repaired the
damaged finish sufficiently to weatherproof the house once more, the leaning
casa of Lane had survived in a uniquely Lane way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The sections of roof that had been
destroyed by mortar fire had also been repaired, Amanda was less than pleased
that the contents of the attic had been sucked out through the holes in the
roof by the nuclear powered compression wave, even if she had forgotten what
was up there, it was still possible she had lost items of personal significance,
she was thankful that the house wasn't taken completely apart like some of the
others.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The Deckler house had to be completely
rebuilt, having been lifted into the air by it's massive sail area with it's
foundations weakened by the attempt to squash the Decklers with their own
house. Then it had been sucked back onto it's own foundations by the
rarefaction zone, landing upside down. It's architecture had not been built
with strong winds in mind, it was a wonder it had survived that hurricane the
other year.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>And now the Lane house was the middle of a
conflict zone again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It had been several minutes since <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place> had received the
call from Daria, the next contact will be from the agents supervising the
surveillance on Amy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"So, you take the no such Concorde here?"
asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No, teleported," said <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"That takes a lot of energy," said <st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, need the whole coven to send me this

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"That would have created one hell of a
spike, that's probably why Amy was using non-mystical means to get back here,"
said Amanda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You and Amy were once close friends," said

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, we were, then she ended up misusing
her magics, I went down a similar road, but came back, I guess she's doing the

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Quadrangle buckshot (QB8) was essentially

better for penetration, the "damage" would be laughable), and while it would be

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria woke up wondering what had happened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>'Let's see', she thought, 'I was at a

I was merely there as arm candy.... Oh yes, then I heard Dominic describing what
I submitted to in pornographic detail, at which point, I unloaded a flute of <st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>'Then he grabs me, pulls me into his

in public.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>'Wasn't gonna happen, I unlocked the door
behind my back continuing the argument, he smacks me.... '</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Her eyes snapped open, and she shot to her

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She looked at it and realized it was an

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"AHHHH!" she cried, dropping it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria looked down at herself and quickly

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Body swap device, normally only swaps the
two people whose palms are pressed against it, except she tried it on Illyria,
whose shell has unusual mystical properties," said Stacy/Daria, who then
reached down to the woman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Wait, allow me," said Jane, as she ran
over to them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Stacy/Daria stepped back as Jane grabbed
the woman by her clothing and lifted her to her feet, saying, "Hey asshole,
wake up!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The woman stirred, then awoke with a look
of serious alarm, she looked around and said "Iit didn't work."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"It did something. What was the plan, beat
the crap out of us with <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>'s shell?"
asked Stacy/Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No, the plan was to use Daria to kill you
all, since she's a gun nut, I should have had an easy time with it since your
guard would temporarily be down."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, why did you try this on <st1:place
w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>?" asked Stacy/Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"She looked like...who are you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Hi, I'm Daria, and apparently that's--"
she pointed at Daria's body "--also Daria. Now, what I want to establish, is
where the fucking hell <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place> is?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"WHO IS IT?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:place w:st="on"><span lang=EN-US>Illyria</span></st1:place><span
lang=EN-US> thought about her response, and deciding it more expedient to
borrow the body's identity, said "IT'S DARIA!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"YOU LOST YOUR KEY OR SOMETHING?" yelled
Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:place w:st="on"><span lang=EN-US>Illyria</span></st1:place><span
lang=EN-US> looked through Daria's possessions, finding a bunch of keys.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She tried them sequentially, and then
entered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It took some exploring, but she eventually
found Jane in bed upstairs, her leg in a cast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You are injured."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Jane looked at her in surprise and
eventually said "yes?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:place w:st="on"><span lang=EN-US>Illyria</span></st1:place><span
lang=EN-US> looked at the window and saw Jane's reflection in it and said, "You
also have a reflection; you have also aged the time I left.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>This is not the same time line as I was in."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Jane blinked and finally asked "what's with
the shiner?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I believe the man in the suit in that
office I was in was assaulting me, attempting to intimidate or possibly
hospitalize or kill Daria," said <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You're not Daria?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No, I am <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>I got displaced from my body and implanted in
this one. Your Daria is somewhere else, in my home continuum. You are a
vampire, and you and Daria are National Security Agents that investigate
mystical disturbances, are you aware of magic in this dimension?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Jane couldn't think of an answer to this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I am inclined to believe you at best have
no idea what I am discussing with you, or possibly think I am your Daria
undergoing a mental ailment, I need to find a witch." <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>
then left a very confused Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, Willow, Amanda, what do we do?"
asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Amanda rubbed her chin while <st1:City
w:st="on">Willow</st1:City> ran her hand through her hair sucking air through
her teeth, and <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place>
eventually said, "I'll need to read up on this."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, this'll definitely need some
research," said Amanda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay then, wrap her up, let's get back to
base," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Right," said Jane, she pulled out a big
reel of duct tape and threw Amy to Daria, while the other Daria looked on in
confusion. Amanda went upstairs for some overnight stuff, and <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place> grabbed the USAS 12 and headed
outside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"So... this heaven, hell or purgatory?" asked
the other Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>As soon as they were back at their
headquarters, they placed Amy in a cell and headed to the lab with Wesley and
Winifred to discuss their next move.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Faith's on her way in, but I doubt that
she'll be able to help, it's not like she's seen that many Draconian Katras,"
said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Which means we'll have to talk to Amy,"
said Wesley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Oooooh! Ooooooh! Let me! Let me!" said
Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You know anything about torture?" asked
Wesley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The other Daria froze in her tracks. Daria,
who suddenly realized how her other self might react, stopped with her, and
asked, "you all right?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The other Daria looked afraid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Look, sorry to alarm you, but I think in
this case we're going to have to use whatever we can to get the intel we need,
and getting Amy to tell us what she did is a part of that, and we SO don't have
the time for this," said Daria, as she continued on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The other Daria followed her saying "Hi,
I'm Daria, who are you? Because there's no way you're me!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Daria, things are different here."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"What? DSN's <a
href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Contrib/SciFi/StarTrek/STDS9/seasonTwo.html#443">'Cross
Over'</a> different, or '<a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119081/plotsummary">Event Horizon</a>'
different?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, look, the situation is that we're in
the wrong bodies, you're in the wrong dimension, the person in your body has no
idea what your situation is in your dimension, and the sooner we sort this, the
less likely it is that Illyria will fuck your situation up beyond all repair,
okay?" said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No, not really," she turned to Jane saying
"and you, the Jane I know wouldn't be so keen to torture people."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You'd have to know the history between
us," said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"WHAT HISTORY COULD POSSIBLY EXCUSE
THIS???" asked the other Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"HOW ABOUT TRYING TO KILL US ALL? OR
ATTEMPTED GLOBAL INSURRECTION?" yelled Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"PEOPLE TRY TO KILL COPS ALL THE TIME, DOES
THAT MEAN THEY SHOULD GO 'FUCK THE RULES' AND START GOING AROUND BEATING THE
SHIT OUT OF EVERYONE???"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Start?" asked Daria, she then winced at
that crack, and said "Look, I'm not too happy about using torture either, but
while we're also looking for leads, it might turn up something useful, and as I
said before, the faster we get you back to your dimension, the better for all
concerned."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Right," growled the other Daria, obviously
not able to think up any further arguments against their plans.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I thought as much, I followed them a couple
of nights ago, he was trying to force her into a cab, trying to get her to his
place. I also got a look at her new neighborhood, not the sort of place you
want to leave your emaciated female friend in if you know what I mean," said <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Trent</st1:City></st1:place>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"So she's just flipped her lid?" asked
Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on"><span lang=EN-US>Trent</span></st1:City></st1:place><span

police, but I might have trouble finding her on my own."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Check her place.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You got your cell phone?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yes, I'll call you if I find her," he said
as he headed out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria approached the other Daria as the
others (minus Jane who was preparing to talk to Amy) discussed the factors that
could have affected the Draconian Katra's effects.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She wasn't really surprised her other self
was offended by the fact that the indigenous Daria was so willing to accept the
use of torture on prisoners, in fact, she found it faintly disturbing too, it
made her wonder what kind of a person she was, but the main thing was to try to
keep her other self calm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You all right there?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The other Daria turned around and just
stared at her for about 20 seconds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The taste that was emanating off of her
changed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>These tastes seemed to alter with emotional
states.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>And for some reason, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place>'s emotions had a faint trace of strawberries,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But her other self's emotions tasted like
bile, as if Daria was gargling vomit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Her other self turned away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria stood there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"What do you think we're going to be able
to discuss here?" asked the other Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"My low self esteem."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Bile turned to chicken antimatter vindaloo
as the other Daria turned to her sharply, shouting "HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY THINK
THAT'S FUNNY???"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"LOOK, I TOLD YOU I WOULDN'T BE DOING THIS
IF I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS NECESSARY!" said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"AND WHAT MAKES YOU THINK IT IS
NECESSARY???" asked the other Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"BECAUSE AMY'S GOT NO OTHER INCENTIVE TO

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"OH, SO WE'RE DOING IT BECAUSE IT'S

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"AND WHAT IF YOU GET SUSPECTED OF SOMETHING
WITH NO SUBSTANTIAL PROOF?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE WE COULD

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"SO THIS IS VENGEANCE THEN?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"NO, ALTHOUGH AMY HAS A <st1:place w:st="on">LOT</st1:place>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"WEL THIS CAN'T BE ABOUT GATHERING

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Actually it is," said Wesley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"OH REALLY?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"WE DO THIS CASE BY CASE, WE MOSTLY DON'T,

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She saw Daria and Illyria in a shouting

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Body swap," said both Daria and <st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Faith approached the others and noticed
something lying in a tray. "That isn't what I think it is, is it?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She had received a call while on patrol,
apparently Daria, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place>,
and Winifred needed her to take a look at something.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span><st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place> was
there too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"'fraid so," said <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>,
she and everyone else had now calmed down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"'frai--okay, this I just gotta hear," said
Faith, realizing <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place> "had no use for
contractions such as ''fraid'." as she leaned against one of the work benches.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Amy Madison tried to body switch with me
in order to infiltrate and sabotage us in vengeance for sending her packing to
another dimension without her face, but she accidentally shook hands with
Illyria instead, and that caused the device to malfunction" said <st1:place
w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Aaaaand you are...?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Daria."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"And Amy's in your body?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No, Amy's in her own, I'm also Daria,
only, from another dimension, assuming this isn't some sort of nervous
breakdown. ... or The Afterlife," said the occupant in Daria's body.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, so, what am I doing here?" asked
Faith.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"We need to find out who made it, how it
was put together, this devices particular idiosyncrasies could help us, I want
to know if it looks identical to the one you used on Buffy or if it looks
different," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Hey, I know where I've seen you before-"
started the other Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No, I'm not Eliza fucking Dushku off of
Tru Calling," said Faith, really annoyed at hearing someone mistake her for
that actor for the hundredth trillionth time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Oh... okay," said the other Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Faith returned to the issue and lifted the
device and looked at it saying "bit of a long shot, I mean, that was three,
four years ago, can't you ask Amy?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Jane's doing that now," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Jane entered Amy's cell, where Amy was
strapped to a wheelchair in a straightjacket, and said , "Hi Amy, are you going
to tell me where you got your Draconian Katra device from?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Jane pulled a bottle and a syringe and
started drawing the fluid into the syringe saying "cool."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Is that supposed to scare me?" asked Amy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Nope, it's supposed to hurt you." Jane
then put the bottle back in her pocket and pulled an alcohol wipe, removing it
from it's packet, she wiped a spot on Amy's neck, and pushed the air out of the
syringe before pushing it into Amy's neck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Amy felt the fluid burn her flesh and
waited for Jane to say something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Do you know what capsaicin is?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Amy thought and said "no."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"It is the irritating compound found in
chilies, trace amounts make your mouth feel like it's holding molten iron, and
I'm about to inject several cubic centimeters of the stuff into your carotid
artery, it'll make your blood taste like hot sauce I imagine, might just have a
taste."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Amy couldn't think of anything that could
convince Jane not to do this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Jane nudged the plunger forward enough to
warm up Amy's brain slightly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"That's abouuuuuut...a drop? ... I go any
further, it could be ages before your system gets it off the nerves lining your
cardiovascular system, hours upon hours of pain."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Quinn was standing over the sleeping bag
when she felt something brush against her side.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She heard a loud yelp and suddenly realized
she was now in the corner of the room on the other side of Sandi's bed, looking
at a worried looking Sandi just behind where she had once been standing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She also realized she was breathing hard
and that she was straining to keep her eyelids from view.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Sorry," said Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Quinn slowly stood up, shaking all over,
and said "no biggie," as she mentally cursed her insane reactions loudly and
obscenely.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Her therapist had mentioned the possibility
of weird and unexpected reactions to everyday stimuli, but this was ridiculous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>If this were to happen while she was at the
mall, or somewhere else that was crowded, she would never be able to live it
down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"So if you go into that dimension and look
for Kaxtra Lorrtobi, he'll make one for you," said Amy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Jane waited a little, then pulled the
syringe from Amy's neck, and headed off to relay the information to the others.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"This could add another element to this
puzzle, different dimensions have different mystical properties: In some,
vampires can stand out in the sun without getting dusted as one example," said <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, that leads us to another problem:
these portals don't always go to the same place," said Wesley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"The portals from Pylea seemed to
repeatedly go to the <span style='color:black'>Caritas, and</span> from what I
heard, Angel's car, Lorne's cousin and Cordelia landed within a days walking
distance of each other," said Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, but that portal's going to be a
rough ride, and we need to know how to get back," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"This is going to take way too long," said
Wesley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"And I don't entirely trust Amy to tell us
how to get back, in fact, she may be planning to get us trapped," said <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Where's Lorne?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Dunno, he went off and said 'don't look
for me'."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"We're the NSA, if we want to find him, we
could," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Except we don't hate Lorne," said
Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Hmm... using <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>'s
senses, I could function better than a polygraph, but Amy would probably expect
us to be unable to verify her statement ahead of when we need the information.
In fact, we don't even know that this lead is good," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Which renders the torture earlier
worthless," said the other Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Look, I know where you're coming from, but
we have to try," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Really?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>You know where I'm coming from? So, when did you lose your conscience?
Let's re-trace your steps, when was the last time you remember having it?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Enough!" said Wesley, bringing the
argument to a halt, he then walked up to the other Daria and said, "This is a
debate that, fair enough, should bother all involved due to the obscene nature
of torture. But, we don't have the time right now, because we need to solve the
problem of you two and <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place> being in the
wrong bodies and two of you being in the wrong dimensions!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Now, if the use of torture bothers you, you
have my deepest sympathies, but I am NOT prepared to resist using it to the
point where I can't do my JOB! ...so, if you start to get queasy, kindly take it
somewhere else, and allow us continue our investigation."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The other Daria fumed. "I don't know
weather I hope none of you experience torture, or that you do so you know what
it's like," she said before leaving the lab.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She entered a few second later and said
"there a place around here I can get something to eat?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Spike said "I'll show her to the cafeteria,
let you brains get on," as he left the lab with the other Daria in tow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"There's got to be something we can do,"
said Wesley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Hang on....<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"And there are still instances where I

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, but we will need Illyria's help on
this, she's had the most experience hopping dimensions of all of us, she will
give us the best shot of an accurate transfer, it might also be possible to carry
it out without needing Amy," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay then, we'll get right on it," said <st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The place was totally minging, water stains
on the walls gave the impression that the roof consisted of a mosquito tent,
the floor looked like it had been used as a racetrack for vehicles consisting
of clusters of four chainsaws welded together, the personal items of the
occupant consisted of some books and legal pads stacked near a beanbag chair, a
Kafka poster, a hotplate with cans of soup, an a mattress under a window with a
dying Zinnia and a blind with "If misery loves company, misery has company
enough."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Even if you knew Daria, that was a worrying

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He considered weather he should wait for

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He decided to call Jane while deciding

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on"><span lang=EN-US>Trent</span></st1:City></st1:place><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No joy on Daria, just had a very pissed
off Dominic show up doing an impression of an ill tempered gorilla looking for
her, I think she did something to him when she snapped, and he's out for blood
by the supertanker load."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, I'll get the police on it," said
Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I'll try to get Dominic away from the

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>A police officer approached <st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"<st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>,"
she responded truthfully, but she didn't stop.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Can you prove your identity?" asked the

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No," responded <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Miss, <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>,
you look like someone we're looking for, a Daria Morgendorffer?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:place w:st="on"><span lang=EN-US>Illyria</span></st1:place><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Daria is believed to be suffering from a
nervous breakdown and may be a danger to herself...is there anyone who can
verify your identity?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No, there is not," said <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>,
she resumed walking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The police officer followed her from a
distance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>He obviously wasn't going to
neglect his duty to her and those around her, so she would need to evade him
somehow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"So, you're an author and radio personality
in your timeline huh?" asked Daria, as she and her other self sat in the
cafeteria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:place w:st="on"><span lang=EN-US>Illyria</span></st1:place><span
lang=EN-US>'s eyes were driving her nuts, and if she read one more letter of
ancient text, she would have had a seizure, so she went for a cup of tea and
found the other Daria right where Spike had left her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Except her sense of taste was a bit off,
the tea tasted foul, even with about fifteen sachets of sugar.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In fact, the sugar seemed to make it worse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, well, I was a radio personality, and
almost not an author. I was having an argument with my publisher at the time of
the switch.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>I wonder how bad things will
be with <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place> filling in for me as me?"
asked the other Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"When <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>
infected Stacy's body, and awoke with no idea where she was supposed to be, she
kept her presence pretty low key, and she does have a lot of sense. Not much
patience, but she knows if she makes a lot of noise, her purposes would not be
served or become harder to fulfill.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>Right now those purposes are returning to this body.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>I assume there's a police force in your
reality too?" said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yes," said the other Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Illyria won't want them crawling all over
her, there is a possible danger that Illyria in searching for the equipment she
needs to return to her body, that could generate some assault complaints... that
could get awkward."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Thanks, almost stopped thinking about that
for a microsecond," said the other Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Look, at least when we make contact with <st1:place

control."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Or find out what my brand new rap sheet

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"They'll figure it out, Wesley and <st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Can't we help? I mean, I'm a bookworm in
my reality," said the other Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Trust me, you'd take too long to get up to
speed, and I'm a hair away from an epileptic seizure without having to
concentrate on large bodies of text."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I wonder how <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>
is handling her loss of that extra bandwidth?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"The money she used to buy the camera had
traces of cocaine on it," said the police officer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria had apparently purchased a camera
capable of recording infra red into the 1500nm range and ultra violet into the
50nm range.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>She had paid for the camera
in cash.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>The police had sent a family
liaison officer (Daria was technically a friend, but the same situation the guy
was trained for applied), also a police officer had been assaulted by her,
using a technique that few martial arts experts knew of, let alone anyone else.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>The cop was fine, but that did make Daria's
arrest more urgent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No offence detective, but a lot of bills
have traces of weapons grade plutonium on them, although going on what <st1:place

apartment, and her weight.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>I do find it
improbable that she could have that sort of money legally, I don't know what's
going on with her, she's kept her situation highly secret. Dominic was after
her like she had done something....<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>She

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Could she have stolen the money or gained
the money by selling stolen goods?" asked the cop.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"This isn't going to affect our working
assumption that she's lost it and won't be liable for any of this shit, right?"
asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"This will depend on the facts as we uncover

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I know," said <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>,

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"What's with the camera?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"This body does not have the ability to see

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"A Draconian Katra? That switches most

would have kept trying and the energy discharge would have breeched the dimensions.

pointed out two herbs and a jar of bones.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The proprietor placed the containers on the

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria looked at the other Daria, feeling

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The other Daria looked at her with nearly

punched the wall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I have been tortured for information...."

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Did they break you?" asked the other

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No, but it still hurt like fuck," said
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS PSYCHIATRIC

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Believe it or not, I do fear psychiatric

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

missing a beat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"We're talking about a complex spell that
has way more components than I'm happy with already, Daria, I mean, the more
magics you mix, the more likely it is that they will do something unexpected,
and that usually means something bad and disastrous," said Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Dominic was walking around fuming.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>That Hippy certainly wasn't very peaceful,
and Daria had run off somewhere, but she didn't have a lot of money, so she
wasn't likely to have gone very far.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She wasn't at Jane's, otherwise what was <st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He knew Daria had flipped, that 'Godking of
the primordium' thing he thought was a joke, was probably a delusion, so where
would a godking of the primordium go?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He glanced and saw a familiar looking woman
in a shop window.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Right," he said, hitting the knuckle
dusters together a couple of times as he entered the shop.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Both Daria and the shopkeeper turned to him
as he entered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Now, Daria, I know you've come down with a

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"In what way?" asked Daria, still in 'Seven
Of Nine.' mode, her look of curiosity taunted him by it's indication that he
wasn't the slightest bit intimidated by him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"By knocking some sense into you," he said,
knocking his knucks together again as he approached.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria walked up to him, cocking her head
just before he threw a punch. His fist failed to connect with anything, she had
dropped from view.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He then felt one of her feet against his
abdomen and the other punched him in the throat, forcing him to stumble back.
He then felt her calf against his at his second step back, causing him to fall
on his ass, his next view of her was of the underside of her foot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No it wasn't," said the magic shop owner,

He then put the gun away and <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place> re-joined
him at the counter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Sweet," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"So, I get back, I do this spell, and
everything goes back to normal?" asked the other Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Pretty much I guess," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"But the guy who attacked me, what do I
do?" asked the other Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I don't know, I don't think we have the
time to teach you any moves," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I just checked with Illyria on that, she's
aware of this, and will send you to just after she incapacitated Dominic, she
recommends you head somewhere where you can impede his access and call the
police as he has tried to attack you again with devices that...oh, knuckle
dusters."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria frowned as the other Daria blushed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Why do you think I didn't tell you?" asked
the other Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Because you didn't want to imply that you
were weak, but I don't expect all my other selves to be the same, I'd expect some
to be...well... anything really," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"How did you end up working for the NSA at
your age?" asked the other Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Same way the A-team did in season five,"
said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Oh."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I was working for the Watcher's Council
before that," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"The Watcher's Council?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>What's that, an association of peeping toms?"
asked the other Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>That made Jane and Spike Chuckle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"It's an organization set up to manage
vampire slayers. Long story, but basically, thousands of years ago, some people
decided to stick some demon energy in a girl and set her on the demons that
preyed on humanity, primarily that threat came from vampires, hence, these
girls were referred to as vampire slayers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Originally it was just one girl, they
wanted to manage the threat from the means by which they wanted to manage the
demon threat, that continued until Willow here decided to activate all
potential slayers, before then the demon energy jumped from girl to girl to
girl as each died."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, how did you end up working for the watcher's
council?" asked the other Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I helped them find a missing vampire
slayer, then helped them free anther ally from a torture centre. In doing so, I
committed a number of crimes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>I had
nowhere else to go, so I decided to work for them under a false identity."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Sounds like you've had a very interesting

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, I might just write a book about it...
of course I'd have to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>shoot</i> anyone
who read it. ... What's the story with you and Dominic then?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The other Daria sighed and eventually said
"it's a long, twisted, complicated story that would make an excellent crappy,
made for TV movie."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"And?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"And that's all I'm saying, the whole thing

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They proceeded with the spell.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The first part consisted of ensuring that

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>That part was completed, then <st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No, the unconsciousness is a result of the

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"How was the other dimension?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria was checking the weapon for trace
evidence that could help her locate the factory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The machinery and barrel was composed of
diamond, the chassis was a polyester resin fiberglass composite.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria was shaving slivers off the chassis
because the slivers were more likely to have materials that could pin the
factory to a location. Winifred was chasing up laser components. The problem
with laser components was that the majority of the laser could be built out of
commonly available materials. A jerry rigged compressor could evacuate the
chamber so that you only got the composition and pressure you want and save on
gas you'd otherwise waste purging the chamber of air.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Mirrors were available in all shapes and
sizes everywhere, and thinning a mirror's silver sufficiently for the front of
the laser wasn't that difficult either. Capacitors could be easily made from
bits of foil and paper and oil and wire (and battery top up water if you're
making electrolytics), but proper industrial capacitors are preferred. Although
a three-phase supply wouldn't need dampening (at least not as badly as single
phase).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>As for gasses, CO<sub>2</sub> would be
perfectly suitable and available in any store that does welding gear, or even
more CO<sub>2</sub> would be available from hardware stores from fire
extinguishers, or even soda stream or home brewing kits. Or they could just
steal the fire extinguishers, and the barrel in which the gas would be
illuminated. This could just be made from ceramic soil pipes, home made
concrete tubes, or just bricks. As long as you have enough gas between the
mirrors, and the mirrors are parallel to within 1/8th the wavelength (that's
the part that takes the most time as you fiddle with the screws on the back
mirror), you had yourself a laser.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria would also be checking the
ammunition's propellant for contaminants, but their best bet was going to be
the gangster. Jane and Spike were interrogating him, and he wasn't really loyal
enough to them to face Spike and Jane. It was proving useful to be allowed to
torture suspects. That was what Daria hated about their jobs, it felt like they
were given god-like powers, and she was concerned with addiction. She knew that
it had proven useful, but she also knew it was wrong, but she had used it and
would probably need to use it again. However, Daria knew the ability (legal or
otherwise under circumstances where you're allowed to) to torture is still
risky as people will be tempted to misuse that authority, and it was a
dangerous habit to get into as it would increasingly become your first resort.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>'Like when <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>
had reason to believe I was out to kill her', Daria remembered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In fact, it was starting to look like they
were already there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They were using it in parallel to other
investigative techniques.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>And, of course, there was the amount of
blackmail ammunition they were handing over to Donald and George to be
considered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Daria."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Thinking 'speaking of:', Daria glanced back
at Donald and asked "what?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You wasted a couple of hours trying to
retrieve your demon."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Wasted?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You can't possibly think we need her,"
said Donald.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"She's an expert on the demon era, and on
Wolfram and Hart, she's our best hope for victory against them," said Daria, as
she thought 'which might explain why you're bitching about her return.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"We need control over her assets, you would
have given us that, but you instead handed it back."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria returned to what she was doing. One
sliver was going into an MMR scanner, to figure out if there were any unusual
compounds, and another sliver was going under a microscope to see if any interesting
particles or life forms had gotten trapped in the mould.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Your freedom is revocable at any time, you
know," said Donald.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I dare you to order <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>
to undergo another body swap."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Donald left the room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria looked at the weapon, sorely tempted
to use it on Donald.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Right now they were going after two genuine
threats: Rival gangs with the sort of firepower that could equalize the field
between the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">US</st1:country-region></st1:place>
army and themselves, if they joined forces, or if only one was taken out, they
were fucked. They'd be equally fucked if they took out the command and failed
to recover all the weapons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The cyborgs, however, could potentially
achieve full spectrum dominance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, Gangsta boy gave us an address where
his chapter usually meet, not all his chapter were involved in the action we
picked him up at. There are at least 40 others, so we might be able to get
something from them," said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I looked for both sales and thefts of
parts to make a laser, but there are just too many incidents to, of itself, be
of any use. There are about three towns where these parts haven't been sourced

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I got plankton trapped in the resin, that
suggests a location on the coast where sea spray evaporates mid flight, the
plankton ended up landing on the fiberglass while it was being stored unpacked.
Also found some tree pollen, that's in DNA right now, might narrow things
further, trees not being very mobile and all."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I've been reviewing the intelligence we
managed to gather from the last contact. As you know, we had a satellite over
flying the area, and we followed the cyborgs to a location that was concealed
by cumulus at about four angels, so we know where they landed. That area is
under intensive surveillance now," said Wesley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Hang on, four angels?" asked Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I'm getting better at location spells,
I'll use it to try to locate the tree the pollen came from," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Just a pity we can't seem to use the

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Robodaria operated all 12 of the UAVs
simultaneously. The hydrogen cell powered airplanes, wingspan of 40cm, weaved
between the trees, scanning for anything that could indicate something was
hiding in them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Meanwhile, a geophysics team was running

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She received a phonecall from one of them:

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria drove up the driveway with Jane in
her front passenger seat and four slayers in the back, the weather was going to
remain overcast for the next couple of hours.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They met with Robodaria and a Delta team,
which were equipped with M4s.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Daria, this is Colonel Conrad Mayborne,
he'll be killing the bad guys and making it safe for us to enter," said
Robodaria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Colonel," acknowledged Daria, as she
pulled her USAS 12, Jane was strapping on her flamethrower, the slayers were
grabbing war hammers and tai chi swords.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You don't think you're breeching with us,
do you?" asked the colonel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"'Course not," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Good," he said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"It just seemed sensible to be prepared for
the unexpected," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Not much faith in plan A then?" asked Jane
as she prepared her flamethrower.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Since when has plan A ever worked?" asked
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Good point," said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"We ready to go then?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Going in now," said the colonel, he
signaled for his troop to head off to their assigned start positions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The Delta team had dressed in thermally
insulating bodysuits in order to contain their energy signature and were
camouflaged with standard DPM plus mirrors and locally sourced foliage. Their
weapons had thermo graphic sights, they approached using cover formations, more
Deltas where approaching from the other side.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The Deltas got to the house, and some of
them slung their M4s for SPAS 12s loaded with door breeching ammo. On cue, the
ones with shotguns shot the locks and hinges off the doors and the other Deltas
stormed through.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They were firing shots.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>There was no radio traffic, the only way
Daria knew that the operation had been completed was when the Colonel emerged
and waved them up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria wasn't convinced he hadn't been
killed and his gear stolen, so she unslung her USAS 12 and rested it against
her trigger side's shoulder, ready to drop the muzzle to shoot him the instant
he raised his weapon to her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She got to him and he said "we didn't find
your cyborgs, but we did find something you might consider worth a look." He
then showed her in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They went through the house, stepping over
dead bodies finding the entrance to the underground structure in the basement,
disguised as a brick wall (using actual bricks, it was hinged on massive steel
beams).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>When they entered the basement, they found
another door which led to a space that included another block immediately to
the left, and a main area straight ahead that was filled with torture
equipment. There were a couple of mostly naked men (dressed in leather shorts
and harnesses) being held by a couple of the Deltas and three barely teenaged
girls looking zoned out, dressed in blankets and, Daria guessed, nothing
underneath. There was one man dressed in casual attire holding a camera lying
dead on the floor from having a hole being blown through his head at about
mouth level.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No terrorists, just a bunch of child
molesters."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"This was the only suspicious structure in
the area." said Robodaria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"What's in there?" asked Daria nodding
towards the block.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>There was a door leading to the block, some
noises from it indicated that something made of steel was being broken into,
and several seconds later, more girls in their teens were led out wrapped in
blankets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, I'm gonna call in the feds, this is
their territory," said Daria.</span></p>

Barry Carter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Donald sat down beside him at the bar and
ordered a vodka saying "all right except that bitch Daria can't seem to learn
to just obey orders. In fact, that entire group are starting to piss me off."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Ouch, that sounds bad," said Barry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"She rescued Illyria when <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"<st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>,

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Is there anything you can do? Just if I

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria, Jane, Winifred, Wesley, Robodaria

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Illyria's reported that she's located

Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No joy, there's no way they could have

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Did they land and hitch a ride?" asked
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No traffic left the area while we were

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"We did check for mystical signatures,
right?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yes, nothing," said Wesley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Could they have hidden anywhere?" asked
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"There were plenty of sheds, barns, but we
checked them all after we raided that dungeon, and had a ring of surveillance
watching for them the whole time," said Robodaria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Either they're still there, or they're
long gone, I don't think they can know they are being watched," said Robodaria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, that case, I'll look at the drugs
that were recovered. If we can find out what part of the world they hail from,
we can possibly find out how that gang is getting their hands on them," said
Daria, looking concerned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"What's with the look amiga?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Well ... something strikes me as wrong here,
why land at all if they aren't based out of that area?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Fuel?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"They've been flying long enough, they
should know their fuel limits and have prepared refills at appropriate
locations. But they're using some kind of plasma thruster if they're fusion
electric, that should have left evidence of them taking off again," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I found no such evidence on the aerial
footage of the area," said Robodaria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Had to be air plasma they were using,
those X-ray cannons wouldn't have accounted for the amount of nitrates Spike
got bathed in," said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I could go back and conduct a more
thorough search of the area, the UAVs I used in the forest were equipped with
chemical sensors. The forest was clear of nitrates, but if they landed
anywhere, there will be elevated traces," said Robodaria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I think we need to consider the
possibility that they never landed," said Wesley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"They got picked up by an aircraft?" asked
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Possibly, but what kind?" asked Wesley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Obviously a stealth, it would have to be
quiet and nearly invisible with no thermal energy signature," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"It's almost impossible to have a silent
aircraft -- even blimps need propulsion," said Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"That cloud cover was at 4000 ft, that

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I think I see what you mean," said
Robodaria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You're not saying that cloud was
artificial, are you?" asked Wesley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"The cloud wasn't part of any existing
thermal, it just appeared there," said Robodaria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Take a lot of energy to vaporize that much
water," said Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"What if they just burn off a load of
liquid hydrogen?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Wouldn't that cause an energy signature?"
asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"It can be reduced, if the burner is exhausted
through a liquid hydrogen filled radiator," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"How did that cloud form?" asked Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"It just appeared as a normal cumulus at
4000 ft," said Robodaria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No spiral, or criss-cross action,
nothing?" asked Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No ... it's like a load of water vapor just
appeared there," said Robodaria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Did it appear too fast for it to have been
from any kind of burner system?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"The system would have been unwieldy," said
Robodaria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, that leaves magic, or, they dropped
the liquid hydrogen the same way fire fighting planes drop water," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"That much liquid hydrogen per sale would
eat into the profits quite badly," said Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"They got fusion reactors, they could make
tons of hydrogen for free," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"And the aircraft could be electric, that
would affect noise, wouldn't it?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Provided any moving parts stay subsonic,"
said Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"If they're using a ducted fan, they could
build a system that absorbs most the noise," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"We'll need more information, how do we get
it?" asked Wesley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Y'know, Dru's gang seemed to know where
they were last time, as did the DEA," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"That's not guaranteed, but I don't think
there will be a problem," said Wesley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Y'know, there may be a way to speed things
up," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>After several hours of surfing Aviation and
UFO forums, Daria typed up her entirely fruitless report and got up to leave.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Any progress yet?" asked Donald as he
emerged from his hiding place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"None," Daria said as she headed out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Then why are you leaving?" asked Donald,
acting like Daria was taking a liberty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Because, I try to continue like this, I
could miss vital clues," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"How very responsible," said Donald.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"So, lurking, how's that working out for
you?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You think I do nothing but lurk?" asked
Donald.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No, sometimes you make veiled threats or
attempt to look all important, g'night," said Daria as she left.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She passed Wesley at the door and asked
"How's it going?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Not really that good, I've been looking at
my list of forums for hours, but found nothing."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Wesley's speech seemed wrong somehow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"What?" asked Wesley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You sound different," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Oh, thaaaat, just ... ... "</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Fred?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Wesley's head nodded, and said "Couldn't
resist."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Right," Daria said, she eventually pointed
at the body and asked "How is it?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"It's good," said Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria looked like she wanted to say
something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You know you want to," said Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Have fun fucking yourself?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Lots," said Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, good night," said Daria as she
headed off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Quinn came up at the door to the room
Tiffany had been given. She took a breath, and then stepped forward, glancing
in. Tiffany was reading a really heavy book on cults.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Quinn knocked on the door and Tiffany
looked at her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Um. ... hi," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Mind if I come in?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No" said Tiffany, she resumed her reading.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Quinn sat next to Tiffany and said "I. ...
Wasn't particularly understanding when you. ... "</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Raped you?" asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yes," said Quinn, she then continued
saying "Anyway, I'm sorry for avoiding you, it's not like it was your fault or
anything."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yes it was," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No, the First Evil-" said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Egged me on. The me that was in that room,
that was just a front the First Evil hypnotized into me while I waited for the
perfect opportunity. It's exactly the same thing I did to Daria when I was
chasing Jane, I wanted someone to find out what it's like to be hurt in such a
manner, I wanted to hurt you, I enjoyed hurting you. I enjoyed biting through
your neck, I enjoyed sucking the blood out through your wounds, I enjoyed the
look on your face when I stripped you, I enjoyed stabbing you in your vagina,
that look on your face and the noise you made when you felt your vaginal and
anal sphincter muscles tear got me high. That was me, Quinn."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Quinn didn't need to be reminded of what
Tiffany had done to her, she remembered the pain and fear she had felt, the
anger at her rapists, and at the fact she hadn't been able to do a damn thing
to them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>And the anger at the betrayal she had felt
of Tiffany, when it had occurred to her that it was Tiffany's mind that was
doing that to her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>That was something she had been working on
since the incident, Quinn had been encouraged to find stuff to do that she
liked (NOT involving vengeance) to give her somewhere safe to go most of the
time, while she only dealt with what had happened in Tiffany's mind during
therapy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But it seemed like Tiffany had done the
reverse, Quinn looked at the book Tiffany was reading, and then looked around
seeing more books on hypnosis, and on specific cults and psi-ops.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Enjoying that?" asked Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Not really."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Is there anything you do enjoy?" asked
Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, hittin' stuff, they let me use the
gym for that."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, I sometimes need to do that too."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You think about taking up an unarmed
combat course of some kind?" asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Well. ... yeah, actually, especially since
that incident where Sandi and I went vampire hunting."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany looked up at Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"We didn't do too well, we couldn't get the
arrows to penetrate the vampires hearts."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"What kind of bow did you use?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Err... a pink one."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Draw strength?" asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Quinn waved a hand and made to say
something, then aborted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You generally need a draw strength of
around 250N, us slayers use around 700N for good measure. Keep in mind that the
target is protected by a ribcage, you may even need to go through the sternum,"
said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Oh... didn't think of that."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No, probably went for the bows that
matched your outfits," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Well, duh! What did you think we'd do?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Have the sense not to go looking for
vampires to kill you,"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Quinn was infuriated by this attitude.
"Tiffany, come on, I wanted to get to know your world a little better."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany gave Quinn such a condescending
look, one that included contempt by the ton, and said "You're not a vampire
slayer Quinn, stay off the battlefield."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Quinn eventually said "fine, don't forget
to cut yourself extra deep," before getting up and leaving.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Quinn regretted saying that about 20s out,
she stopped and considered returning, but she didn't trust herself to quietly
sit through any more verbal abuse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In fact, her patience had been extra short
ever since the mind rape, it wasn't just the panic attacks that were wearing
her down, for some reason everything took way more effort than she remembered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>God this was infuriating.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>After several hours working with M16s, they
had moved onto the MP5. She removed the clip and pulled the cocking handle
back, locking the bolt back, she took a few seconds to look at the bullets in
the clip.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>So far it had been this type of ammunition

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She decided to resume her trance later,
taking the magazine pouch and heading off to the range with the other slayers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It hadn't been that much fun, every time a
target popped up, she was supposed to shoot it immediately -- the idea was to
compress target acquisition into as short a time as possible, shoot them first
before they can shoot you. That is, when the targets are similarly armed
enemies instead of mild steel cut-outs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>There was a lesson scheduled where they
would use the 'killing house', a house with a load of targets dotted around it,
that was going to be live fire (in such a confined space, that didn't strike
Willow as being particularly safe). Rebecca had also mentioned times when
they'd conduct the exercise with real people standing amongst the targets, that
seemed even more insane. But the SAS needed to be comfortable with firing in
such circumstances.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Oh. ... Sounds like Tiffany was doing that

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"She said she enjoyed what she did to me."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>That left Sandi unable to respond.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"She actually said she enjoyed what she did

said it."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Sandi just stared at a spot on the wall

supposed to be a good guy?"</span></p>

made her weapon safe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You will see me after class, <st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I think I can guess what this is about,
but humor me: what's going on?" asked Henno when Rebecca closed the door behind
them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Are you aware I was projecting into
Kennedy when your subordinate shot her?" asked <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No, All I knew was that the two of you
were romantically involved" said Henno.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"When you project into someone, you enter
what could be accurately described as a mind meld. I saw and felt everything
she saw and felt, heard her thoughts, she heard mine... her last thought was the
word 'Eep' in case you were curious," said <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"So you saw and felt her getting the back

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"By that exact model," added Rebecca, with
a wince.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Right, well, your primary role is to
oversee the training, you don't need to participate, but I would prefer it if
you could get over it," said Henno.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on"><span lang=EN-US>Willow</span></st1:City></st1:place><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I don't do warm and fuzzy, I don't do
apologies, my expertise is the battlefield. We do have shrinks if you need
someone to help you with this, my opinion is that nothing cures phobias better
than acclimatization, you can spend more time on the range if you choose to,"
said Henno.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"That's appreciated," said <st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on"><span lang=EN-US>Willow</span></st1:City></st1:place><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Rebecca, do you think she's a threat?"
asked Henno.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Possibly, Sarge, she's definitely having

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Keep an eye on her, if you feel she's

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Sarge," acknowledged Rebecca, as she

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It was odd that she didn't have as much of
a problem with the M16, it's not like they were that different, but for some
reason it was the MP5 that put her on edge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"This is stupid, it's just another gun, why
do I have this phobia that's so fixated on it?" she asked aloud.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She changed the clip.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She was wired most of the class and her
continued session, this being the reason she couldn't hit her own target with
more than 2 out of 30 shots, now she was extremely tired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She cocked the weapon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She looked at it, turning it around in her
hands.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She turned it so she was looking backwards
through the sights, holding it by the bottoms of the magazine and the pistol
grip.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She adjusted the location and attitude of
the weapon to that which she had seen through Kennedy's eyes just before. ...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It happened again, she was reminded of the
intense ice cream headache she had felt when Kennedy was killed, the way her
consciousness faded a fraction of a second later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on"><span lang=EN-US>Willow</span></st1:City></st1:place><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Her girlfriends death.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This had been way too much of a shock for
her to even contemplate anger, let alone vengeance. All she could do was stare
at this Kennedy shaped hole in her life for several minutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She had just erected a shield and curled up
on the floor to wait out the cold feeling, nausea, and loss of equilibrium.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>There had been a number of collective
funerals for all the military and Watchers Council personal that had died in
this conflict, but there was no news coverage of this, and their names wouldn't
be written onto any cenotaph or other collective memorial plaque.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Even the CIA had a memorial plaque in it's
main building.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The shock had delayed any ideas of
vengeance, but what she did after <st1:place w:st="on">Tara</st1:place>'s death
had kept her from going on any vengeance trips:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Killing <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
w:st="on">Warren</st1:City></st1:place> hadn't sated her. She had then moved
onto Andrew and Jonathon: Neither of those two could be described as hardened
criminals. Except Andrew, but he regretted killing Jonathon the same way she
regretted killing <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Warren</st1:City></st1:place>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on"><span lang=EN-US>Willow</span></st1:City></st1:place><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on"><span lang=EN-US>Willow</span></st1:City></st1:place><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria headed home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She had an apartment close to the NSA
branch she worked at. She could make <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Lawndale</st1:City></st1:place>
if she wanted to, but it was a bit far for her, so she instead used this
apartment most of the time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She remembered her mother's funeral.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It had been a mass funeral, the amount of
Lawndale that got flattened it was hardly surprising so many people had died,
either from having a building fall on them, from having their faces burned off
while they were driving home, from being blinded and then their homes set on
fire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She only occasionally returned to Lawndale,
not only due to the amount of her time spent at the NSA, but also because she
hated seeing the place like that, and being reminded of her mother's death.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>That was kind of pathetic, people die
everywhere all the time; she shouldn't be that put off by <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
w:st="on">Lawndale</st1:City></st1:place> just because her mother died there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>There was more though.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>A lot of the houses on her home street were
wooden, and hadn't fared that well (Morgendorffer house was brick, it survived
mostly intact), the carpets and furniture that had been exposed to the light
had been bleached. Add to that the replacement TV, DVD/VHS player, various
sound systems, because the stuff they had before had all been jacked due to
there being no windows after the blast hit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This was one of the few places that had
stood up enough for people to be able to access the goods (as opposed to having
to fish them out of a pile of rubble), and the smell of half digested food that
they could never seem to adequately clean that Jake had sprayed about the place
when he got absolutely shitfaced a week or so after the incident.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Jake wasn't holding things together too
well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Jake had been well protected in his office
which was made mostly of steel reinforced concrete and the window of the room
he was in were facing away from the hypocenter. He had described what had
happened from his point of view. His computer had conked out and at the same
time the outside had gotten extremely bright, he had gone to the window and
realized that there was an extremely powerful light source somewhere behind
him, the light slowly faded and the source was ascending, he had realized that
he was seeing the effects of a nuclear explosion, and had just made it under
the desk before the blast wave hit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The windows on the other side of the
building had blown in, but the doors between there and his office were all
closed, then the rarefaction that sucked everything back had cracked the
windows on his side. He had then tried to call Helen, but there was no dialing
tone and he realized that the EMP had taken out the phone lines.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It had taken a while for the phones to come
back on line. The payphones in the street, by accident of the fact they needed
to be vandal proofed, it got armored with enough steel to deflect most of the
energy -- steel wasn't best for this, but it made the difference beyond a
certain radius.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Jake based his decision to hang about or
leave on which way the cloud drifted, which was the other way, so he decided to
try to locate Helen and Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>After hours of driving, he started calling
the police.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He found Helen himself. Her car had been
blown off the road and got squished by a huge truck that hadn't been affected.
Its driver had been blinded and for some reason, hadn't stopped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He had called it in, and then resumed his
search.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He had later heard that both his daughters
had been seen stealing a police APC that had probably been in the fireball
radius of the explosion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Basically, not hearing anything from Daria
and Quinn over the amount of time it took for them to get around to talking to
him hadn't been good for him, wondering if they were dead this whole time,
drove him nuts. ... nuts-er. ... when Daria and Quinn had returned, he was too
relieved to do anything other than hug the pair of them for about an hour.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Quinn couldn't tell Jake what had happened
to her, the fact that the government was trying to classify all this top
secret. That helped Quinn and Jake to a certain extent, because explaining the
mystical would have caused Jake the distress of wondering weather Quinn was
lying or delusional, and Quinn the distress of having Jake analyzing her
instead of supporting her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Quinn had talked with Daria about this at
the same time she was seeing her shrink about the PTSD. ... That reminded her,
Quinn had mentioned that the Shrink wanted her to see Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria didn't know what to advise Quinn to
do, but had said "only if you think you can handle it."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria had no way to advise Quinn on this,
because she wasn't a qualified psychologist, she wondered if she had given
Quinn good advice, or scared her off. Or made her seek an encounter she was
unprepared for, or what.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She had been avoiding any serious contact
with her family for a while now, focusing almost exclusively on Tiffany, trying
to get her ready to return to active duty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany was, understandably, mortally
embarrassed. After the first shrink had jump started her brain, the First Evil
had essentially distilled her emotions into two separate personae. One was not
aware of her life as a slayer, she thought she was a normal teen girl who
hallucinated a lead role in a monster hunter movie. The other persona somewhat
resembled Dana, that vampire slayer that escaped that <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
w:st="on">Los Angeles</st1:City></st1:place> nut house, that had been
retrieved by a team of slayers led by Andrew. Twisted with rage into someone
who was unable to express her rage in any way other than to put someone else
through it, so she would have someone who understands.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Of course evil Tiffany couldn't think of a
way to make it happen, and wouldn't interact until she could. Amanda gave her
the means, except evil Tiffany didn't want Daria, she had blown it with her,
she wanted Quinn. When they had come to the inevitable conclusion that Quinn
would be needed for this, evil Tiffany took over Amanda and used her magic to
keep everyone stuck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She hadn't bothered trapping <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place> too; Amanda was
taking up all her attention not focused on torturing Quinn and her other
personality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>What had interrupted Tiffany's plans was
the carbon dioxide that had built up within the spatial shield. She had
difficulty isolating her personae. And ultimately her hold on Amanda. When her
personae had reunited, her sense of shame at what she had done to Quinn and the
memory of the pleasure she had felt at doing this to Quinn. ... Daria knew if it
were her, she'd feel like she was at the bottom of a well that was deep enough
to stop daylight reaching her even if it were pointed straight at the sun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Thinking about it, it was amazing that
Tiffany had been able to function at all. She had gone through weeks of that
torture, and she had no way to access help with the mental trauma, she had no
way to contact the Watcher's council, so no way to request help or orders, all
she could do was cope as best she could.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She also couldn't tell her friends about
this, they'd drop her like a plaid </span><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>burqa</span><span
lang=EN-US>, so she pretended it was something fairly mundane. When she felt
that she was having trouble holding it all in. She obtained some pretty fancy
medication, managing to purchase it in secret, while playing miss normality
with her friends, and training for her night job in case she got activated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>That had gone pretty well until Jane was
turned, and Tiffany got a spike every time she walked past her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It took a while for Tiffany to work out
which of them was the vampire. She eventually made her move, but Jane, in spite
of having no formal combat training, had managed to defend herself and evade
Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Then when Daria had helped Jane escape
again, that had been too much. Tiffany wanted Daria to understand what Jane had
become (not knowing at the time that Jane had a soul) and that she was not
worth protecting. She had then gotten carried away when she started
interrogating Daria (Plus, being an active Slayer and having Daria pull that
move on her was annoying), it became more about hurting those who didn't
understand (this was stuff Tiffany had told Daria about during her visits).
Tiffany might not have done this had she not been doped to the eyeballs, the
whole point of that medication had been defeated, so she immediately stopped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Then she had staked a couple of zombies,
and thought she had accidentally staked a couple of innocent bystanders, that
hadn't done much for her self confidence, but she came back from that (Well,
Willow brought her back, Tiffany had run off when Sandi and Quinn had said
something about turning her in), the girl was getting seriously eroded by these
rare, but seemingly unending fuck-ups.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It wouldn't surprise Daria if Tiffany no
longer had it in her to continue as a vampire slayer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Well, there was no reason Tiffany couldn't
retire, it wasn't like there was just one, or two active slayers on the entire
planet, except they were now working for the NSA in order to keep out of jail,
so Tiffany would need to do something for them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>That was something she would have to
explore with personal, the important thing was to find something for Tiffany to
do that would get her out of that fucking hospital she was hiding in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Hey Quinn," said Daria, as she entered
reception.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Hi," said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"What brings you here?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"A sense of guilt."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"How's that?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Well. ... I visited Tiffany yesterday, I
meant to see if I could help her, and then she said something mean to me, and I
said something mean back, and I didn't mean to say something that mean, and I
was going to go back and apologize, but I was afraid I'd do it again, and make
things worse, and. ... I hope she didn't do anything to herself. ... "</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria looked at Quinn, and eventually said
"The first meeting after something like what you two went through is always
going to be a tap dance across a minefield. The only way to get over what you
two are feeling towards each other is to interact, let the insults get lame.
I'm concerned I may have interfered with that by telling you to wait until
you're ready," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Right," said Quinn, a couple of seconds
later, she said "So you're not mad at me?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>" ... No," said Daria, she then waved at the
door into the hospital, and they headed in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You're back are you?" asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Sorry I blew up at you yesterday," said
Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Don't be, because I wasn't kidding about
any of what I said," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Tiffany, I can't believe you actually
meant what you said," said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Well, believe it, it's true," said
Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Hold up, stop a minute, what's true?"
asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany looked awkward for a few seconds
and eventually said "I enjoyed raping your sister, and you know what? I want to
do it again."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I see," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Quinn eventually asked "What did I ever do
to you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany looked at her and said "I wanted
you to understand what it's like to go through that, I mean, you're my friend,
and I couldn't share any of this with you, it would not have meant anything to
you."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Quinn stood up and shouted "HOW CAN YOU SAY
THAT??? ALL YOU DID WAS TURN ME AGAINST YOU!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE LOST ON YOU, OKAY? I
NEEDED SOMEONE CLOSE TO ME WHO UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT FEELS LIKE!" replied Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria raised her hand and said "I got
tortured by both you and <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>, that fucked
me up plenty for a while."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I forgot," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You forgot hurting my sister?" asked
Quinn, still annoyed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I forgot everything, I woke up strapped to
a bed with no memory of anything, including my entire childhood," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Do you recall doing anything that could
have caused you to become incarcerated in that hospital where you lost your
memory?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany thought about it and eventually
said "odd hours, evidence of combat, disappearing for a few weeks, odd
reactions to every day combat, unusual sensitivity to certain topics of
conversation, talking like a stoner; what didn't I do?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Could any of that have been avoided?"
asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany thought and said "Possibly, but
it's difficult enough to wage this secret war without having to assess every
operation for my ability to prevent the generation of evidence. ... Is there
anything I can do to avoid hurting people?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Well, hiding out in here will avoid
accidents, but what does it cost you?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Well. ... I don't even know if I want to be
a slayer any more. I'm sorry, but this last fuck up really got to me," said
Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, I understand that, but I would
prefer you finding something to do that isn't sitting around lamenting on past
mistakes, it isn't healthy," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Daria, were you even paying attention back
there? I got off on hurting Quinn," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"After you got brainwashed by the First
Evil, Tiffany, you got rebooted and re-programmed. I'm a brain and I don't
think I could have done any better, I wasn't too picky about who I attacked
after I was tortured." She glanced at Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Quinn realized where this was going and
said "I remember. ... I also remember how I reacted to what you did Tiffany, the
rage just takes control. You have to fight that if you don't want to hurt
someone."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"We all know what we're talking about here,
you don't have to become a slayer again, but for fucks sake, find something to
do," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Right," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I'm actually less mad at Tiffany now,"
said Quinn, as they drove off to the Morgendorffer home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Good, I just hope she can stop being mad
at herself now," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria's phone rang, she activated the phone
in it's charger and said "Y'ello?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You're close to New York right now, get
over to Queens hospital, Detectives <a

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Right," said Daria, she turned the phone
off and said "I'll have to really move on this. Sandi's is closer, you mind if
I drop you there and you make your way home from there?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Sure," said Quinn, looking down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I'm sorry I wasn't able to clear the time

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, I get it, I'll get over it, I'll be

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I'll see about making some time for us, I

follows through.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria approached the cubicle and was met by
a bald man who asked "Who are you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Special Agent Daria Morgendorffer,

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I'm Captain <a

Cragen</a> of New York Police Department's Special Victims Unit," he responded,
he then asked "What makes this case of interest to you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I was told two officers sustained injuries
that match those known to be caused by directed radiation weapons, specifically
a hole where flesh got vaporized, possibly surrounded by severe radiation
burns?" said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, it felt like half mil <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primacord">primacord</a> exploding along the
line," said one of the patients, a black man with a goatee whose hair was tied
back in a ponytail, he waved Daria over saying "I'm detective Odafin Tutuola,
my partner over there--" he indicated a man with glasses and graying black
hair, who half waved at her "--is Detective John Munch."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Pleased to meet you," said Daria, she then
asked "what do you remember of the attack?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"It happened as we were leaving a slave
auction. We were gathering video evidence using cameras disguised as clip-on
ties. Once the sale was ended, I activated the beacon which was disguised as a
pen, but nothing happened, but we got out okay, right up to the point where we
started taking fire from something."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Did you see what that something was?"
asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Munch continued the story, saying "The
origin of the beams appeared to be on top of a building, I got us around a
corner and floored it out of there, but the shots started coming through the
buildings at us, I kept going we were in a tunnel, I checked the beacon, it was
hit."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria figured it was the beacon they were
homing in on, she asked "What happened to your support?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Their vans were found burnt out with
bodies inside tallying the missing officers, I'm not betting against the bodies
being the officers" said Captain Cragen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Can I see the footage from the tie
cameras?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Wesley (in Winifred's body) answered the
phone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Daria here, were you told about the

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yes I have, what's the situation?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Seems the cyborgs or someone using similar
weapons intercepted a number of uniformed officers that were going to raid a
slave auction, and shot up two that were gathering video evidence in
anticipation of the raid," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I see, was this video evidence recovered?"
asked Wesley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, I'm looking through it now, that
should give us a list of suspects to work with," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Good, maybe we'll get lucky this time, you
know, if we can recover the slaves themselves, we might be able to find out
more about the gang," said Wesley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, I was thinking that, none of these

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Who?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Charles Ruttheimer the third, <st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, good luck," said Wesley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria wasn't really that surprised that
Upchuck would need slaves, although she had heard from Quinn he had managed to
pull Andrea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The question was, why was he buying so

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She then saw a bright dot in the distance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Shit!" she activated the phone and called <a

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Standby. ... ... Yeah, we have your bogey,

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, it has X-ray cannons, seems to have

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Acknowledged" replied the Admiral.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I need to call the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Understood," said the admiral.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria then disconnected and called the

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Superintendent McFright"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Special Agent Daria Morgendorffer here, I
called earlier for you to pull in a Charles Ruttheimer the 3<sup>rd</sup>, I
just saw one of those cyborgs flying away from <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, we served a warrant at the
Ruttheimer residence. Ruttheimer the 3<sup>rd</sup> was out, we're still
searching his place for the slaves, but we're coming up with nothing," said the
superintendent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Right. ... Excuse me a minute,"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria called Winifred (Who was still in
Wesley's body, Daria wondered if they would ever return to their own bodies).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Fred here."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Hi, Daria here, Are there any anagrams of
Charles Ruttheimer being used to purchase or rent anything in the <st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Hang on."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria waited, wondering what Upchuck would
do to get storage for his purchases.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Cirra Sue Mettre has a storage locker in
the warehouse district," said Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Right, could you call superintendent
McFright and let him know?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Sure," said Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria hung up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>About 5 minutes later, she got another
call.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"This is the bike," said the officer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"At least he left it looking cool," said
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Where would he go though? Bike doesn't
look like it's been jacked, and he was last seen using it," said the cop
watching the scene.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria stepped back and surveyed the scene.
The bike was parked in a really strange location, between a couple of trash
cans, one of which was turned over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She looked at the one that was turned over,
and looked again at the bike. There was a faint line of dried crap on the seat
that curved at the same radius as the bin. The wall the bike was parked against
was the back of a restaurant, which had a flat roof.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She picked up the bin and it's lid and used
it on the bike to get up on the roof, which, aside from a large air
conditioning plant, a hatch and a sky light, was completely barren.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Err, Agent Morgendorffer. ... are you
allowed to do that?" asked one of the cops.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yes. ... yes I am," she said, as she looked
around the roof.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Maybe he had kept something here, or met
someone here, but if that was so, why leave the bike there?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Had he met someone that didn't agree with
his health?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It was too bright for a luminal test to be
practical.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She walked around the roof perimeter. There
was no obvious sign of him having jumped off the roof on anything. Was there
anything?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She wandered around the roof feeling lost.
She noticed some marks between the AC plant and the skylight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Four gouges. The gouges started centimeters
wide at their closest points, radiating outwards, where they simply became
puddles of melted tar blown outwards. Like four jets of hot exhaust had--</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"SHIT!!!" Daria whipped out her phone and
called superintendent McFright.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Su-" started the superintendent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"CANCEL THAT RAID NOW, IT'S CHARLES, HE'S
RUNNING THE CYBORGS!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She heard him talking into the radio, but
he sounded like he was too late, it had already kicked off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She heard the sound of gunfire and
screeching noises like that of large model rockets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"FUCK!!!" she screamed, as she turned in
the direction of the noises, she saw three of the cyborgs pop up, hovering in
the air.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She ran off the side of the building and
after a hard but tolerable landing, ran straight for her car. She pulled her
USAS 12 out, it's magazine back to FSHE only, she got on the roof of her car
and activated the CCIP sight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The weapon did not have the range.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She jumped back down and got in her car.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Agent Morgendorffer?" asked one of the
cops.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No time!" she said, starting the engine
and flooring it off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The cops followed her, escorting her as she
headed off to a point under what she projected their escape route to be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She eventually stopped and climbed onto the
roof with her shotgun again, the cyborgs were now moving off en masse. She
raised her weapon, knowing she had almost no time to act, the weapon on full
auto, she picked one and opened fire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It broke off and started evading, and fired
back at her. Daria felt the beam penetrate her like 3mm bearings at near light
speed, other shots hit her originating from other points in the formation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The shocks from the exploding lines of
vaporizing flesh rendered her limbs temporarily dead. Other beams penetrated
her chest. She felt a couple penetrate her heart, her ribs were shattered, as
were bits of her vertebrae.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She feared that the damage to the vertebrae
would prove fatal as she fell off the car.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The cops arrived seconds after she landed
on her back. The back of her head felt cold from the impact. She was concerned
that might be fatal if nothing else that had happened to her did her in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Daria, the next time you call me insane,
remember what you did today, or I'll remind you in front of whoever's present,"
said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Cute, Upchuck became Borg king and all I
got are these lousy blaster wounds. Tell me we got something," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Well, we now know who's running the cyborg
gang, which is mostly female. ... "</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"He's not buying whores, he's buying
soldiers, he's implanting computers into them so that they can be manipulated
into fighting for him," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Man, that's just. ... ... Hang on, what is
it?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"It's slavery, just a different task," said
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Right, right. So, what now?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Did the satellites see where they went?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"They disappeared under a cloud again."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No glimpses of a craft emerging from
underneath?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Actually there were some disturbances, the
satellites picked up some turbulence occurring within the clouds. That
indicated aircraft flying through at several points, but they were optically
invisible," said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Optically invisible."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"We got some shapes though, the patterns
were just a little off this time."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Let me guess, some kind of camera/LED
system?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, covered most the infra red part of
the spectrum too, we'd have missed it if the satellite was directly overhead,
which it was the last time we tried to follow them, and it was each time they
made a deal, they know where our satellites are," said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"What shape were the outlines?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Hexagonal, Winifred thinks they're shaped
for stealth geometry, the aircraft entered and left on different vectors, so we
don't know where they were headed. The satellite couldn't monitor everywhere at
once."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Upchuck knows we know he's involved, he'll
most likely go to ground and stay there, he might occasionally surface to buy
more girls though," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Back to square one then," said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Not really, no. We might learn plenty if
Upchuck's been using anagrams of his name for credit cards, good thing he was
that stupid, but I'm still just a little annoyed that I didn't work it out in
time," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Sounds like you were lucky to work it out
at all: If you hadn't figured out he went up on that roof, you would never have
found those scorch marks, and there was even the possibility those scorch marks
would have not meant a whole lot to you," said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The doctor then entered the cubicle and
said "you have any idea how lucky you are one of those shots didn't intersect a
major artery?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Do tell," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"One went through your heart, good thing
the muscle was too tough to allow the hole to grow, had to insert a probe
through your femoral vein in order to get the plugs in place," continued the
doctor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Soooo, expect a hike in my medical
insurance rates," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The doctor looked stunned for a little
while, and eventually said "yes, a hike in insurance premiums. ... " he then
walked off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"So, what now?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"How's <st1:place w:st="on">Illyria</st1:place>
doing?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"She reports that she's tagged at least a
hundred and fifty seven gangsters, and we've managed to locate 12 of their
armories, the police are preparing to raid them now." said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Good, what about Dru and her lieutenants?"
asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Still under surveillance, they will be
picked up when we're certain we got as many of their armories as possible."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"And their factories?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Tracked them down, those are also under
surveillance," said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay ... Back to Upchuck, have we recovered
any DNA samples from his place?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I'll check, why?" asked Jane.</span></p>

w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place> was about wake up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, bye," said <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She lifted herself onto her elbow while
trying not to disturb the vengeance demon spooned against her, as she turned
off the alarm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You have to go to work so soon?" asked
Gwen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, I still need to finish up on that
curriculum for that magic course," said <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I'm glad you finally found a use for <st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You mean another use," said <st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The demon chuckled and said "I suppose now
you've gotten past the feelings of anger, I really shouldn't be here trying to
tempt you."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I was tempted, but I just can't really go
for it, I can't come up with a decent wish. And besides, it takes the fun out of
it if I outsource. And besides, Rebecca's one of the good guys."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I am starting to like you." Said Gwen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"And I like you too. ... I mean, right now,
I'm uncertain weather I'm just seeking comfort or if I'll get. ... " <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place> sighed and rolled
over to face the demon, and said "Do you remember what happened with Anyanka?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yes, I do" said Gwen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"We could end up on opposite sides, and. ...
" <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place> found
herself blinking and sniffing back tears.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You might have to fight me?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I could end up having to kill you, or one
of my colleagues will, and if I get too attached, and that happens. ... I'm like
some sort of bad luck charm as far as all my girlfriends go."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Gwen watched as <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place>'s eyes dripped tears onto the pillow,
and said "it's a risk. ... maybe I'll be lucky."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria entered the Morgendorffer house and
recoiled a little at the smell of fresh vomit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She looked over to the couch and found Jake
unconscious on the couch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She walked over to him and watched for a
while.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>When she detected movement in his chest,
she left him and headed to the utility room for the water assisted hoover that
she had bought on a hunch that they would be making extensive use of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Jake awoke to the noise of a vacuum
cleaner, this was assaulting his brain like a pair of 1/2 kg claw hammers doing
a drum roll on is head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He opened his eyes to see Daria cleaning up
the carpet in front of the couch with the wet hoover, upon seeing him awake,
she reached for a glass of water on the coffee table and handed it to him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She resumed cleaning as he took it and
sipped at it, tasting the aspirin that had been dissolved in it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He then heard Quinn say "Hi Daria."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Quinn, I'm off sick for the next few days,
so, I figured I'd use them here."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Oh good, thanks Daria." Said Quinn,
sounding vaguely insincere.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"So ... what are you down with?" asked Jake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Bunch of directed radiation wounds,
including one through my heart. Have to wait for the plugs to fuse with the
tissue before I do anything extraneous ... I'm sorry I've been leaving you guys
alone for all this time," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"It's okay, we've been coping just fine,
right Quinn?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Jake's enthusiasm was about as infectious
as a taste for faeces.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"What he said, only with actual sarcasm,"
said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Dad ... if you were coping, you wouldn't be
getting absolutely shit faced every night. Tell me you're not driving home in
that state," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No, and it's not every night, it's every ...
well, I vary the schedule a lot," said Jake, trying to remember what nights he
came home in what state.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Quinn, how's it been like for you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Well, you know, lack of sleep, depression,
panic attacks, exhaustion. Haven't been able to go out on a date since the
incident."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Right, because of the thing with the
vampires," said Jake, who then mouthed to Daria "she's crazy." Tapping his
farthest temple from Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria looked at Quinn, who said "Well, you
weren't around for me to talk to, I had to try to get him in."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Sorry about that," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You keep saying that," said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I have a lot to apologize for," said
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I don't think there's a lot you can do to
make up for what's happened," said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"It's a pretty deep energy well alright,"
said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Energy well?" asked Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You know how you need to heat stuff up
before it will react or burn?" said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Oh," said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Look, it's not like I would have much
spare time anyway. If I quit, I get jailed, or can never set foot on <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">US</st1:country-region></st1:place>
soil ever again. Or take a casual stroll out of wherever I hide out, but I
haven't been making the greatest effort to maintain contact, I'll move back
here at the end of this month permanently. Be a longer drive to work, but it'll
mean I'll be here for you," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You don't have to do that kiddo," said
Jake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, we're cool," said Quinn</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Dad, you're doing your liver in, and Quinn
... you make me look cheerful. ... I gotta try something."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They just sat there picking at their
breakfasts for a few minutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"So, School's gonna start in a few days,"
commented Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, our senior year is going to be very
weird without Stacy, or Tiffany," said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Tiffany called me to say she checked out
of the hospital, she's going to take the next few days to work out what she
wants to do. She might show up at school if she gets bored enough," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Going to school to escape boredom ... that's
just wrong," said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany entered her new room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The house was different to the house that
had stood before. For starters, it was made mostly of steel reinforced
concrete, the Blum-Decklers would have had to pay about 70% of the costs
themselves because their insurance only covered the wooden house that had come
before, but they suddenly got very generous (probably thanks to her new job,
but their new bosses probably hid more bugs in the walls than what you'd find
in a termite mound).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Of course, that meant if she ever quit, the
insurance company would be like "'scuse me, been a mistake, we're gonna need
that money back," on top of the threat of prison, but she didn't need to be on
the front line unless she wanted to be there. She could help sift data with
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yeah, she could do that ... well, she was
thought qualified because a telephone signal analyzer of the kind used for
tracing calls was found in her possession. She had obtained it from an Ex CIA agent
when she was being stalked once. What she didn't tell them was that she
couldn't get it to work for her as anything other than a paperweight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>And that was before she started medicating
herself for PTSD.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaking of, the shrinks had discussed anti
depressants with her, but she had decided against because she felt that had
been what led her to torture Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They didn't push the issue, but asked her
to reconsider if she did start having difficulty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Right now, she wasn't feeling depressed,
she was feeling numb.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This numb feeling was disturbing, she
wanted to feel something, and the longer this numbness persisted, the more
antsy she got. The way most people dealt with this feeling was to start cutting
their skin. That was why Tiffany had procured those drugs last time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany instead decided to head down to the
houses basement, where a training room (covered by the NSA) Equipped with some
exercise gear including a number of punching mats and an open area where she
could set up targets and start beating the crap out of them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Tiffany dear?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany stopped what she was doing and
turned to her mother.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Dinner's just about ready."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay" said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She then followed her mom up the stairs and
through to the dining room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She didn't eat very fast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"How are you feeling right now?" asked her
mom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Bit numb," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Doc said that can get bad," said her mom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I know," said Tiffany, continuing her
progress through the delicious, but currently unappetizing food.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But Tiffany knew that her low appetite was
not a symptom of being full, it was the same thing that made her feel numb.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You know we're here for you, if you need
our help with anything, right?" asked her dad.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yes," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany's parents watched her eat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Eventually Tiffany sighed and said "Look,
it's not like I haven't dealt with mental problems before, I'm sure I'll be
fine. I'm not going to do anything rash, I didn't last time, I'm not going to
this time."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Why didn't you tell us what happened the
first time?" asked her dad.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Because it would have been too much to
deal with. Even if I glossed over the fact my rapists were vampires, I would
have had to think about how much you could check up on, and the fact you would
have involved the police. They would have investigated the case and found my
statements don't add up, it was just easier on me if you didn't know what had
happened to me, one less thing to deal with," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Her parents absorbed this information and
her dad said "You didn't think you could trust us?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I didn't think you'd believe me if I told
you about vampires, and I didn't want you stressed out over what had happened
to me, yeah? I love you, and seeing you stress over me would have hurt, it just
seemed that it would be easier on you if you believed I had ran off, cleared my
head, and returned unharmed than if you knew I had spent several weeks getting
brutally tortured. I'm sorry for the deception, I ... ... I just didn't want you to
... ... I was trying to protect you," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>There was more silence as her parents
absorbed Tiffany's statement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You're still our child, we should be
protecting you," said Tiffany's mom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I'm a vampire slayer, if I need
protection, you're fucked," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>That caused looks of shock to appear on her
parents faces.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Sorry," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Contact, 11 o'clock" said Carl.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Brad glanced at the house they were driving
past, there were three girls walking out to a yellow convertible. Two were
Sandi and Quinn, the girls they had escorted home that night all those months
ago, and the third was ... "fucking traitors!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Carl and Brad Farranger had been searching
the town for that Chinese girl ever since their chapter got massacred by what
the police had finally concluded was a horizontal hailstorm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"What do we do? Do we kill them here, or
find somewhere else?" asked Carl.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Let's follow them for now, maybe we can
find a suitable spot to make an example of them in," said Brad.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"So ... " said Jake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"So ... wanna go out for lunch?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Sure, Kiddo," said Jake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria nodded and they headed out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"So ... I guess if anything interesting
happened at the NSA, you couldn't talk about it" said Jake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Not legally," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Right," said Jake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Apparently Upchuck's got this cyborg
army," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Upchuck?" asked Jake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Charles Ruttheimer the 3<sup>rd</sup>,
call sign Upchuck because he keeps hitting on anything with tits with the most
irritating lines in the most irritating voice imaginable," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Right," said Jake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"How's the consultancy business?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Well ... I've lost a couple of clients, they
saw me hung over," said Jake, somewhat depressed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You get pissed, I bury myself in work,
Quinn's probably the least self destructive of us," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Except she believes in vampires," said
Jake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Remind me to prove they're real some
time," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"GAH!!! You too?" screamed Jake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria reset her eardrum as she said "'fraid
they're real, as is magic apparently," said Daria, she then concentrated on the
cellphone in it's charger and car audio hookups. She telekinetically lifted it
into the air and spun it a few times, before putting it back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Jake was stunned into silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Quinn and Sandi weren't as into 'Waif' now
as they would have been last year.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"So what theme should we go with?" asked
Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Something dark?" asked Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I don't feel like doing something gothic,"
said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, not going gothic ... what about
something matrix?" asked Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I don't think we should go with something
that's likely to freak out Principal Li." Said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, then how about something earthy?"
asked Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Sandi groaned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"This is going to take a looooooong time,"
said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria and Jake started searching the
restaurant area for something they felt was appetizing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"What are you into kiddo?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Usually Pizza, but for some reason I feel
like trying something different."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They looked around.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"KFC?" asked Jake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria looked around.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"How about Tai?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Isn't that the same as Chinese?" asked
Jake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"That's just what the Chinese want you to
think," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"This is going nowhere fast," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Food?" asked Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Food," said Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They bought the few items of clothing they
could agree on and headed out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Daria, I've never been that much of a
contributor to our finances, I mean, I guess that's where most of my stress
comes from, I want to put Quinn through college."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria shrugged and said "Well, my job's
paying pretty well, I should be able to help out."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, but you're high risk, you got shot
full of holes yesterday." Said Jake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Hmm ... Okay, I got nothing," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They then saw Quinn, Sandi and Tiffany
approach them with shopping.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"That any good?" asked Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"So, do we go in?" asked Carl.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Only if the gook goes to the bathroom,"
said Brad.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Guns?" asked Carl.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Too quick," said Brad.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Only if you shoot her in the head, shoot
her in the hip, she'll be immobilized and it will hurt her while we also shoot
a vital organ that will kill her slowly," said Carl.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The topic of conversation bored the crap
out of Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She was in the looking around the room for
something of interest mode as she continued to eat, she had been hoping to get
some one on one time with Jake to help him get over Helen's death, but Quinn
Tiffany and Sandi had seen them and had joined them for lunch and had hi-jacked
the conversation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The two people outside the restaurant - she
had seen them before. She couldn't quite place them, but they looked familiar,
and not in any good way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Daria! Distracted much?" asked Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria glanced at Quinn and said "Sorry, you
wanted something?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"What are you looking at?" asked Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Eventually their patience paid off, Tiffany
went to the bathroom, they followed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The staff at the restaurant looked puzzled
that they didn't wait at the front of the restaurant to be seated, but the time
it was taking them to decide whether to intercept or just leave them to it
would be sufficient.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They entered the girls room and saw only
one stall locked, the other 7 were open.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They kicked open the door and saw a
different girl sitting there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Woah," said Brad.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Sorry, wrong stall," said Carl.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They heard someone whistle a cuckoo noise
behind them, and saw the girl they were chasing pointing two micro-Uzis at
them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The girl in the stall they had just broken
into stood up and said "never underestimate the predictability of stupidity,"
she held out her hands to receive their guns.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Fucking race traitor," said Carl.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Ought to slot you right here," said Brad.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They just handed their weapons to Daria
though.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Right, I'm arresting you for threatening
behavior, criminal damage, stalking, and conspiracy to commit murder. You do
not have to say anything, anything you say may be recorded and presented as
evidence, you have the right to have a lawyer present during questioning, you
have the right to have someone informed of your arrest. You understand your
rights so far?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yesssssss," they chorused.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I thought you had time off," said Quinn as
Daria stepped into the reception area of the police station, where she, Jake,
and Sandi were waiting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I can't help where the forces of evil
choose to attack me or my friends," Said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I guess we should have expected this,"
said Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, we need to be real careful here,
we're going to see who they inform of their arrest. Hopefully we can get their
back-up before they can try anything," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Carl and Brad watched the clock.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It was eventually time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Carl stood up and went to the cell door and
said "I'd like to make my phone call now."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The two of them watched as Daria conversed
with the caller and finally she thanked them and hung up, she then said "Our
coneheads called someone, the number they called was a stolen cell phone. It
was recovered from a bin on a bus, which wasn't fitted with a camera, so we got
fuck all right now."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"What does this mean?" asked Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

strength.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Kirsty?" another Klansman, an office
gopher, entered the training area (none of the sections have been walled off as
such, the only real perimeter was one of Klansmen camouflaged in a line with
assault rifles, they talked through a speaker line that anyone of them could
hook an amplified microphone to).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yes?" she asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Brad and Carl were arrested, apparently those
two girls they escorted home weren't allies after all, they were seen
associating with that chink," said the Klan Gopher.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Right, I think it's time for us to meet
miss ice dragon in her home," said Kirsty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"We just happen to have her address," he handed
her a page torn from a hand sized notebook.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Right," she then signaled for everyone to
assemble in front of her, they were going to plan the operation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"What exactly are we looking at with the
Klan anyway?" asked Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Depends which cell we're talking about.
Klan started off as a sore losers club for ex-confederates, then it died out,
and got resurrected due to the popular appeal of a movie called 'Birth Of A
Nation' combined with the generous helping of ignorance I've come to expect
from the general public.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Throughout their existence they've been a
menace, but now they're severely fragmented. On the plus side, we don't have to
worry about them overthrowing the government, but that does give us a problem
when it comes to figuring out what they are going to do. Some of them are a
joke, basically sit around the TV downing beers saying 'fucking niggers ruin
everything' all the time. Some of them are busy trying to demonstrate that the
Ku Klux Klan can be multicultural, that they're not supposed to be a lynching
mob, but some of them are highly militant and well organized.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"The <st1:City w:st="on">Lawndale</st1:City>
chapter that <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place>
took out was one of the highly militant groups, they might have been in contact
with other like minded groups. They certainly have procedures for avoiding NSA
surveillance, odds are they'll be right on top of us before we see them," said
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Quinn and Jake looked scared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"My workmates are watching us, The
Blum-Decklers and the Griffins closely," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Oh, okay," said Jake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"That's a relief," said Quinn
simultaneously.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany headed down to the kitchen, having
woken from another of those fucking dreams.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She then noticed a goon in a forest DPM
suit pointing an AK47 at her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She ducked back just in tome to avoid
getting a load of holes in her, rolling to the nearest door on her left, which
was the bathroom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She heard the goon step up onto the landing
and he unloaded his weapon through the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She managed to get up against one of the
walls next to the door without getting hit, the goon then kicked his way
through the door and Tiffany grabbed him, smashing his face against her knee.
She grabbed his weapon and noticed movement behind the goon, it was another
goon. She threw the first goon back into the second goon, and saw a third
behind him as she emerged into the corridor. She threw the assault rifle she
had at him, it not having been reloaded yet, that was the only way it was going
to do any harm. The first goon was now unconscious, so she concentrated
exclusively on the second and third goons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The third goon was pulling his sidearm, the
second was still trying to get his shit together, so she dragged the second
with her as she grabbed the third goon's weapon hand. They all went down the
stairs, Tiffany rolling head over heels and landing on her feet as the goons
bounced off the stairs halfway down and landing in a heap at her feet. She was
about to examine the bodies at her feet when she noticed movement at her 3
o'clock.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>A dark blonde girl with light freckling and
the same sort of DPM suit as the other goons was pointing a silver revolver
with a 64mm barrel at her and had a medieval European looking broadsword over
her other shoulder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany ceased all movement with the
exception of visual examination of the girl.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The suit had a familiar looking badge (red
circle, white cross with flared tips, diamond border and some sort of blood
drop) above a set of three chevrons (Sergeant?) on it's shoulder indicating she
was a member of the Ku Klux Klan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>A few seconds later, Tiffany was wondering
why she was still alive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"So you're the one," said the girl.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Who are you?" asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Kirsty Kramer, Staff sergeant of the 43<sup>rd</sup>
black legion."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Staff sergeant? ... no grand dragon or great
and wonderful wizard?" asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The girl chuckled a little and said "what
about you? You got some powers too, don't you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, I'm a vampire slayer," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"A vampire slayer? Sounds like a sillier
title than the stuff we had. Wanna show me some of these powers?" asked Kirsty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany slowly turned to Kirsty placing her
feet under one of the unconscious goons assault rifles, she said "sure, why
not?" and then kicked the weapon at the girl who had to take her weapon off of
Tiffany for a spit second.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The time Tiffany needed to jump at her,
deflecting the pistol before Kirsty could bring it back to bear on Tiffany.
They landed on the floor, Tiffany somersaulting, pulling the pistol out of
Kirsty's hand as she left.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany brought the gun to bear on Kirsty,
but Kirsty had managed to get back to her feet in the time Tiffany's eyes were
off her, and the tip of the sword struck the gun's magazine, knocking it out of
Tiffany's hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany closed range before Kirsty could
bring the sword back, Kirsty released the sword and threw a punch, which
Tiffany deflected. She then used the pummel on the sword to punch Kirsty in the
throat, Kirsty backflipped, catching Tiffany in the face, but only as Tiffany
was moving it out the way. Tiffany had to step back as she recovered, she ended
up next to a dresser unit with several cut crystal vases on it. She grabbed one
and threw it at Kirsty, following the vase hoping to get some critical punches
in before Kirsty could get her shit together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Kirsty managed to sidestep and swing
Tiffany into the wall behind her causing Tiffany to drop the sword, Tiffany
kicked Kirsty away. Kirsty collided with the table behind her flipping over it,
and Tiffany followed, hoping again to get some decent kicks and/or punches in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Her foot missed Kirsty's face Kirsty tried
to sweep Tiffany's feet, but Tiffany jumped in time. Tiffany tried to get a
punch to Kirsty's face, she caught the girls face, but it was moving away from
her. The girl managed to bring her feet around and got Tiffany in a scissor
hug, she managed to bring Tiffany onto the floor and pulled a knife. She got it
within about 12cm of Tiffany's face before Tiffany intercepted it, and started
kneeing Kirsty's kidneys.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She wasn't getting much energy in, she
instead brought her other hand to Kirsty's knife hand and tried to stab one of
Kirsty's thighs, but Kirsty also brought her other hand around and equalized
the strength.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This girl was surprisingly strong.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You say you were recently blessed with
enhanced strength, how recently?" asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Why?" asked Kirsty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Because I want to know what your deal is,
you're not a vampire, I would have sensed it. You're not the First Evil's
running mate ... ... " Tiffany suddenly realized something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"What?" asked Kirsty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You're a vampire slayer, aren't you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"What???" asked Kirsty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You suddenly got stronger a year and a
couple of months ago, right?" asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah," said Kirsty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Unfortunately these powers don't seem to
come with a sense of right or wrong," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Kirsty broke her scissor lock and rolled,
taking Tiffany with her, but Tiffany then kicked Kirsty in the face sending her
back against the wall dividing the dining room from the kitchen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany got to her feet in time to deflect
an attempt to stab her, swinging Kirsty around again, but Kirsty was able to
arrest her momentum and managed to get a punch in on Tiffany's face. Tiffany
brought her hands which were both on her knife hand to punch Kirsty's face,
then her hands separated and she got two more punches in and then kneed Kirsty
in the stomach. She then kicked Kirsty's left knee out, Kirsty brought her
right foot to Tiffany's face, Tiffany spun around and got a reverse kick into
Kirsty's ribs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Kirsty wrapped an arm around Tiffany's foot
and kicked Tiffany's other leg out, she then stood up, using Tiffany's leg to
pin her while she stepped on Tiffany's throat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany tried to use her other foot to try
to push Kirsty back as she tried to push Kirsty's foot back, but there was
enough forward force left over to choke Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Gotcha now, don't I you filthy chink?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>There was suddenly a crash.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Kirsty looked behind her, but this didn't
give Tiffany any advantages. If she moved her hands to any of the useful
pressure points, her trachea would be squashed flat, but the oxygen deprivation
was reducing her muscle force and she was headed for a crushed trachea anyway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She heard Jane say "Owwww."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany tried to invite Jane in,
remembering that she had never done that before, but it wasn't happening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She then saw a piece of Kirsty's neck
explode, and Kirsty leapt away from Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany sat up in time to see Kirsty's foot
disappear around a corner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The window Jane had broken trying to get in
was still obscured by the roller blind, which now had a bullet hole in it with
pettalling from the force of the muzzle blast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Come in Jane," she said a couple of times,
but she could only wheeze the words right now, she sat there breathing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>There were a couple more gunshots, Tiffany
finally got to her feet and walked through the house to the back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Jane was there at the back door, looking
kind of lost, she said "She got away."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany nodded and just about said "Come
in."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Jane waved her hand over the threshold and
then stepped in, asking "you alright there?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, ... I'm-" she then entered a coughing
fit she had been holding off as best she could.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They heard sirens.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Got some prisoners," said Tiffany, when
she managed to stop coughing long enough.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Sweet," said Jane, she stepped through the
house, cracking her knuckles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Sandi's missing, along with her dad and
brothers, and all the agents on surveillance are dead," said Daria. She, Jake
and Quinn had made their way over to Tiffany's house, they had called the
police on the way and had found out the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Griffin</st1:City></st1:place>'s
were missing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Plus I didn't get to repay that Klan bitch
for shooting me," said Jane, who was now sporting an entry wound in the
sternum.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I can't believe I forgot to invite you in
earlier," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Eh?" asked Tiffany's dad.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Vampires need to be invited to enter a
dwelling," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Eh?" asked Tiffany's dad.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Mystical physics, gets really weird, makes
general relativity look simple," explained Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Right ... whatever," said Tiffany's dad.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"They're probably alive, the only reason I
can think for them to relocate them would be if they thought there was a chance
of mission failure and they needed hostages to maneuver Tiffany into a killing
zone," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"They'd probably become expendable once I'm
dead," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Tiffany?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"If I hadn't ran away-" started Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Alright stop! Tiffany, shit happens, okay?
Right now, I just want to focus on getting the Griffins back alive, okay?" Said
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yes," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Good," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>A car pulled up outside the Blum-Deckler
house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany went to the front door to invite
Spike in, and Spike, Winifred and Robodaria entered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Are you okay Jane?" asked Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, just got shot through the heart,
that's all," said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Not many people who can shrug off that
kind of injury," said Winifred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I'm hooked into the phone lines. If they
use them, we'll get them," said Robodaria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Sweet. Jane, call your mother - I think
we're going to need her," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I couldn't have predicted encountering the
Klan that night, but I have been letting myself get rusty of late, I'll be
downstairs if you need me," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Tiffany, are you sure you're all right?"
asked her mom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Fine, y'know, if Jane weren't there to
pick up the slack, I'd be dead, and you and dad would have been next. I mean,
this isn't the first time a slayer's gone bad, and the distribution of
potential slayers is so incredibly random ... excuse me," Tiffany headed down the
stairs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"And five, four ... " the camera man said,
signing the last three numbers, before hitting record.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Good evening, I'm Staff Sergeant Kirsty
Kramer of the Ku Klux Klan, and I have a message for the world to hear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"There are two ways this will go down, one
way is that I kill all those I am holding. They're race traitors, so I want to
do that anyway, but that won't look too good if the Zionist occupied government
looks like it doesn't care. But the other way, and I want this so much that I
am willing to forgo the execution of my prisoners in order to get it, is to
kill that slimy chink Tiffany Blum-Deckler for what she did to those Klansmen
in the forests surrounding <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Lawndale</st1:City></st1:place>
all those months ago."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Kirsty then paused for a second thinking
"Blum-Deckler ... That's a kike name innit? Fucking Jew too, ain't ya? Well,
anyway, I imagine Tiffany would like to have a go at me, so we're going to do
this thunder dome style, y'know, two go in, one comes out. The other sort of
lies there dead until the smell starts attracting scavengers."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Rebecca was walking down the corridor when

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She turned, just about concealing her
apprehension.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"We need to talk," Said Willow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Rebecca nodded and followed <st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:City w:st="on"><span lang=EN-US>Willow</span></st1:City><span

behind her, waiting for <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place>
to talk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Eventually <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place> said "How- ... Have you ever been in a
situation where you have lost comrades to an enemy, and then had to make peace
with that enemy? Or even co-operate with the same soldiers you know killed your
friends recently?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No," replied Rebecca.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on"><span lang=EN-US>Willow</span></st1:City></st1:place><span

considered the possibility of such an event?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah ... mostly it's when I start musing
randomly, but there are events that bring up the subject ... like every second I
spend around you or the other slayers or watchers or other affiliated
personal," said Rebecca, keeping her voice calm, her sentences short and to the
point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on"><span lang=EN-US>Willow</span></st1:City></st1:place><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Have you ever gotten any of your friends
killed?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Rebecca thought briefly through all her
battles, including the ones she fought before joining the SAS.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I don't think I have, I nearly moved a
booby trapped body with other personal nearby, but that's as close as I've
been," replied Rebecca.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>More silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Rebecca finally asked a question of her
own: "have you been made aware that I'm the one who killed Kennedy?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I saw you do it," replied <st1:place

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>More silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I had been telepathically linked with
Kennedy numerous times, I could sense her emotional state a lot of the time. It
was a bit trippy, but it was also comforting when she was happy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I knew when she was happy, when she was
cranky, when she was amused, when she was horny, when she was mad ... ... I felt
her fear from quarter the way around the world, she was trapped along with a
group of slayers and watchers. She was about to drop her shields, so I reached
out to her and took control.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"She let me take control, trusting me to
see her through, I sent my energy over too, and teleported all the slayers and
watchers out of there."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"And since I was a slayer, I got beamed
over too," stated Rebecca.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yes ... I managed to restrain you and remove
your weapon ... when I realized you were a slayer, I told you what you were and
tried to convince you that we weren't the enemy," said <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"And I went along until I had an
opportunity to kill the witch who seemed to have all the magical abilities,"
said Rebecca.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Kennedy trusted me completely, and I got
her killed," said <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You fucked up, it happens ... You know, I'll
never take the piss out of the Americans for their friendly fire incidents ever
again."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"That's not funny," said <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Wasn't meant to be. At the time, I was
reaping vengeance for that girl I thought your lot had killed, that's how we
work. It has occurred to me that I might one day get it wrong, but I never
thought about something mystical happening," said Rebecca.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Took me a while to accept the mystical
too," said <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Willow</st1:City></st1:place>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You know, when I was going through the
final exam, the simulated interrogation, Henno interrupted it. Talking about a
recent operation he went on, about how he had lost a lot of his unit in the
middle of nowhere in a country that didn't really want them there. He asked me
if that was the kind of life I wanted. ... I answered yes, thinking I had thought
about it, which I had, but no amount of thinking can ever provide any real
insight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I fully expected to die when the slayers
managed to stop me."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I'm not sure what stopped them either. As
far as I know, they pinned you down, and stopped, unsure what to do with you."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"That's a lot more patience than I would
have shown."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The four prisoners dressed in their bed
clothes with felt sacks over their heads were forced to step into view of the
camera by goons who were holding them by choke chains, their hands tied behind
their backs with wire ties.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Kirsty pulled the sack off of Sandi's head,
Sandi squinted in the sudden light, the girl had a split lip and some bruises
on her face consistent with being punched around a bit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Sandi Griffin, say something." Said
Kirsty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You're so dead." Retorted Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria was the only one who didn't seem to
so much as wince, as everyone else gasped and said "No!", but she was thinking
the same thing everyone else was: 'Sandi, you fucking idiot! Stay alive.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Kirsty punched Sandi in the abdomen, the
goon behind her holding her head up against Sandi's bending over in pain. She
eventually stood up, coughing, Tom asked "What you doing to her you rat
bastards?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Kirsty asked "Wanna watch?" as she stepped
over and removed Tom's hood, his face had similar trauma to Sandi's.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Kirsty then pulled a knife and started
running the tip along Sandi's body, causing Sandi to react involuntarily.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"If I didn't think she'd enjoy it, I'd have
my unit sodomise her in front of you," said Kirsty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tom couldn't come up with a response,
everyone realizing the position he was in was that if he was to deny Sandi was
a slut, they would possibly rape her, and if he let it slide, it felt like he
was helping them insult her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You seem awfully fixated on me-"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>'Don't say it' thought Daria, as she
gritted her teeth, anticipating the inevitable conclusion to the sentence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"-for a supposedly straight woman."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Kirsty seemed to snap, and started kneeing
and kicking the crap out of Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This continued with Tom protesting loudly
and everyone watching this feeling sick, but eventually Kirsty stopped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Sandi could barely stand, her face was
starting to turn a deep maroon when Kirsty ordered the goon to let her fall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You might not be aware of this, but here
in the Ku Klux Klan, the Geneva Convention is something we only turn to in
times of running out of our normal toilet paper. In fact, I'm starting to think
you're not going to take this seriously until we kill one of our prisoners."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Kirsty walked off screen, and eventually
returned with a bottle of caustic soda, she read the back of it saying
"Extremely corrosive, wear rubber gloves when using, do not ingest, do not use
metal buckets or wooden stirrers, hang on a minute." She placed the bottle on the
floor and left the screen again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"She's bluffing, right?" asked Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria's silence was not reassuring.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Daria, please, tell me she's bluffing."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The camera kept panning between Sandi and
Tom, both looked increasingly worried.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You two, you should also put on gloves,
then take the prisoners off those two," said Kirsty off to the side.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria recalled the State Sam Griffin had
returned in, he was in a state that indicated that he had witnessed one of his
family members being killed horribly and slowly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He had basically walked into the police
station carrying the video tape titled 'for Tiffany's viewing pleasure', he
hadn't said a word to anyone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This tape was getting seriously sadistic,
both Tom and Sandi were watching the Klansmen preparing to execute someone by
force feeding them Caustic soda. She didn't know weather this would be dry or
dissolved, but this was going to be bad if they weren't-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Quinn Grabbed Daria, turning her around to
face her and screamed "ANSWER ME DAMN IT!!!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I don't know," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They resumed watching the tape.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Okay, I think we're ready now," said
Kirsty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Two Goons now wearing rubber gloves and
rubber aprons took Sandi and Tom off the other two goons and Kirsty, similarly
dressed, said "get them on their knees."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Now, one of you must die, but which one?"
asked Kirsty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Both prisoners were silent now, they had
been since Kirsty first picked up the bottle, and that bottle was now open.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She walked over to Tom and said "You should
have raised her better, she should have known not to associate with
non-whites."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She then walked over to Sandi and said "if
you hadn't aided and abetted an enemy of our race, you wouldn't be here right
now."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She then walked back to Tom and said "when
was the last time you went to church?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She then walked to Sandi and said "Have you
ever seen the inside of a church?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She walked around the pair of them, and
finally stopped next to Sandi, saying "You're the one with the dirty mouth,
let's clean it out."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The goon holding Sandi grabbed her head and
pulled at her jaw, but wasn't having much success, and Sandi was now struggling
to get away from them. Tom was screaming at Kirsty not to do it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Kirsty put one hand on Sandi's chin and
pushed at Sandi's gums, her enhanced strength was sufficient to open Sandi's
mouth. Her rubber coated fingers then crawled into Sandi's mouth, the camera
hovered over Sandi's terrified face as Kirsty moved the bottle up to Sandi's
cheek.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Kirsty then slowly poured the granules into
Sandi's upturned mouth, pouring down her throat where Kirsty's fingers were
pushing it down her </span><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>oesophagus</span><span
lang=EN-US>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Some point after Kirsty had started this,
Sandi vomited. Kirsty's hand deflected the vomit from her, it dribbled down
Sandi's chin, a few more spurts and Kirsty resumed pouring the white granules
down Sandi's throat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It looked like half the bottle had been
unloaded when Sandi started vomiting blood.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>A lot of blood.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The camera man panned down, showing that
Sandi had started pissing herself, there was even some fecal matter dripping out
through the leg hole of her shorts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He moved back as Kirsty and the goon
holding Sandi's head did, and Sandi was left to try to get the stuff out of
her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But everyone knew she was fubar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Eventually Sandi lay face down on the
ground, she started convulsing a little, she was alarmingly pale, and the blood
was just gushing out of her mouth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The camera man focused on Sandi's face
again, pushing her shoulder back as she rolled down, keeping her face in view.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Her Jaw was moving a little, and her mouth
was filling with blood, there was no obvious way she could be breathing, and
she wasn't reacting to the obstruction to her airway, her face was covered in
blood from the vomiting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>There was no obvious threshold between life
and death, Sandi's eyes didn't close, they just stared blankly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Eventually Kirsty said "whew, I bet that
hurt."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The camera looked up at Kirsty who said
"I'll be sending a pilot in a helicopter to pick you up Tiffany. If you want
Tom and Chris Griffin back alive, you will board that helicopter with a sword
and will meet me in combat, or you will see two more videos of this kind, got
it? Good."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The image turned to static.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria pulled her phone and made a call.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Kirsty buried the last mine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She was going to enjoy this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She wished she could kill that bitch that
had shot her too, because it was her that had interrupted the killing of that
kike chink bitch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>How can someone survive being shot through
the heart?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It didn't matter, this time, Tiffany was
going down, she had her, all she had to do was finish the job she started.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She checked her watch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany entered the kitchen and opened the
cupboard under the sink.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"If I had the time to do so, I could whip
up a blister agent for insertion into Klan girl's trachea," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They heard a rotor craft approach.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"But we don't," stated Tiffany as she
grabbed a bottle of sodium hydroxide and examined it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany was now dressed in a black
tracksuit and combat boots, she was carrying a pair of <a
href="http://www.swordsofhonor.com/kungfusword.html">Dao swords</a> that Jane
had made for her. The blade outline was about the only thing that was
traditional about the sword, Jane had been using her newfound access to
machines to make a diamond knurled grip, and the surface texture of the blade
had been machined with 2</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol'>m</span><span
lang=EN-US>m pyramids that were inclined to absorb all light. The 30</span><span

lang=EN-US> valleys made all but 3mm of the cutting edges pitch black. Jane was
especially proud of that feature, and Tiffany had been getting comfortable with
these weapons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany didn't know for a fact that Kirsty
wouldn't just shoot her once she was in their custody, or if the Klansmen
coming to transport her to the fight venue wouldn't just shoot her. But there
was a good chance based on the fact that the girl was a total sadist, she would
at least want Tiffany in front of her when she killed her, but she would want
to do it slowly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It was a supervillian clich&eacute; that they
wanted their foes to die slowly, but the fact she had forced a fistful of
caustic soda down Sandi's throat seemed more than just a means to get them mad.
Tiffany was certain the girl had enjoyed what she had done, and Tiffany knew
how close the girl had come to killing her, so there was a chance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I wish I could suggest an alternative,"
said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, well, I don't care," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She pocketed the bottle and a pair of PVC
gloves, and walked out of the kitchen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Kirsty's mine, make sure everyone
understands that," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Right," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The helo, a <a
href="http://www.airliners.net/open.file?id=189171">Hughes 500</a>, was
orbiting the empty street.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It came to a hover over it, and descended
to about a foot off the ground.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>A Klansman jumped out and swept an RF
detector over Tiffany and the swords in her possession.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He then frisked her, he encountered the
lump on her pocket, and pulled out the bottle and the gloves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Heh, let me guess, you want to do unto
Kirsty what she did to Sandi," he said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I want to do worse, but I can't think of
anything else at this time," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He put the items back in her pocket and
continued his search for firearms, lingering a little longer than necessary on
her breasts and crotch, then he waved her on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She boarded the helicopter, moving over for
the guy that had felt her up, and as soon as he was aboard, they were off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany watched the ground for landmarks or
the compass on the opposite dashboard as appropriate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This was the primary reason she was there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Quinn and Jake were sat in the cafeteria of
the police station as Daria worked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Neither of them could think of anything to
say.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Quinn could only see one thing: Sandi
dying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>One of the officers acted as a sentry
telling all who approached to leave them alone. That was appreciated, but it
didn't stop Quinn thinking about how she had seen Sandi having those corrosive
granules forced down her throat, and found herself again wondering at what
point Sandi had in fact died?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>And how long had it been? It couldn't have
been longer than 5 minutes, the caustic soda would have started dissolving cell
walls within seconds, and that would have started mixing with her blood, that
would have started mangling even more of her oesophagus, hence the bloody
vomit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The stomach acid would have neutralized
some of it, but the sheer quantity of caustic soda vs. the thin film of stomach
acid meant that it was already a lost battle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Also, how far would her oesophagus have
carried the stuff?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Quinn imagined the burning sensation
followed by the cold sensation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Hydrogen-oxygen-sodium.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Surely that shouldn't be any different from
hydrogen-oxygen-hydrogen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The importance of chemistry to beauty was
not lost on Quinn, but she just couldn't work out what was so different about
it. Hydrogen and Sodium were both group 1 elements, that should give them
similar properties, right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>That was something Daria could help her
with if she were to ever get a break to come check on them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The helicopter approached a clearing in the
forest. It was surrounded in burning crosses, there were two red ribbon fences,
Kirsty and another medieval sword was standing off to the side of the circle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>As they got closer, the ring of soil showed
evidence of being disturbed recently, and triangles were hanging from the
ribbons. Tiffany had an idea what was written on those triangles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The helicopter hovered a foot off the deck
again, kicking up dust, Tiffany got out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The helo then left.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"What the fuck?" asked Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Jake looked up to where Quinn was looking,
apparently the TV that was normally on CNN was now showing Tiffany and Kirsty
standing in a ring.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I hope you don't mind, but I'm
broadcasting this on CNN, my people should hold the facilities long enough for
everyone to see the entire fight," said Kirsty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany shrugged and said "Okay," as she
pulled her swords and waited for Kirsty to make a move.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I told you to bring A sword," said Kirsty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I miscounted, if only I wasn't racially
inferior," mused Tiffany, almost Daria like in her delivery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The two continued to circle each other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You making a move or what?" asked Kirsty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"After you," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Oh no, you first," said Kirsty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Alright," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany started spinning towards Kirsty,
she had to try to get a feel for her style.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Of course, if she could kill her out
without a fight, that would be even cooler, but it didn't look very likely, and
besides, she had to keep the fight going.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Kirsty managed to deflect each blow Tiffany
rained on her. Kirsty finally attempted to skewer Tiffany, but Tiffany
deflected the blade and span down the length striking Kirsty in the face with
the pummel of one of her swords. Kirsty then pushed Tiffany away, trying again
to stab her, but Tiffany was out of range too quick.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Vinny heard something wiz past him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>'Fucking flies' he thought, the noise had
caused a release of adrenaline.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He just about saw some movement in the
forest just before something ripped through his face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The two Klan sentries were now too dead to
get a report out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany continued to fence with Kirsty, who
was having trouble with Tiffany's speed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They eventually broke and started circling
each other again. "This'll hurt less if you quit resisting," said Kirsty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Getting tired?" asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You are?" asked Kirsty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Wow, go you with the five year old
witticisms," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Wow, go you with the ... err ... " Kirsty
said, quickly getting stuck, this got her mad, and she went for Tiffany again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They ended up getting close to the inner
perimeter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany ducked into a crouch and spun away
under Kirsty's swings, and cart wheeled away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tom and Chris watched as the two girls
fought it out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tom wished Kirsty's death could involve
something a little more painful than beheading, there was no need for her to
kill Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Sandi could be a bully at times, but she
was a good person, all she wanted to do was make the world beautiful, and she
was doing better in school.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He was also angry at himself for failing to
do something about this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He didn't know what he could have done,
these guys had taken out the NSA surveillance that was supposed to protect
them, so probably no way he was going to do any better, but ... .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Something wizzed over his head and he felt
the choke chain fall against his back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He and Chris looked behind themselves and
saw that the two goons were dead, a neat hole through their heads.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Two guards on the far side of the arena
collapsed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>What was going on?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I'm going to need your help again," said
Daria, she had just seen the video the Klan had sent where they had executed
Sandi. Everyone else was speechless or silently waiting for orders.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Sounds bad," said Amanda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"It is, hostage situation, one hostage
dead, they want Tiffany to go to them for some sort of duel. I need you to
astrally project to Tiffany and watch where they go through her eyes, do you
have a map?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"No."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Jane will bring one to you, I'll also need
something else of you when we have the location."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Right."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Jane and Spike were ready for insertion
when Amanda started following Tiffany's progress out of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
w:st="on">Lawndale</st1:City></st1:place>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They had been ordered not to track the
Helo, and they weren't.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Not using the normal equipment anyway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Jane and Spike were ready for war, they
would be inserted down wind of the arena, they would make their way over there
while Tiffany bought them as much time as possible. They dressed in forest
camouflage (rag leaves, veil, face paint and all) and they had wrapped two of
Jane's high powered bows in rag vines.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>These bows had the power to embed an arrow
10cm into concrete, and the heads had even been known to weld on impact to
metal armor from the kinetic energy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>So going through several heads all at once
was not going to be a problem.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Amanda networked them telepathically so
that they could co-ordinate their actions for maximum kills on their first
shots.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Vampires: enhanced smell, enhanced hearing,
enhanced vision, enhanced strength, no thermal signature. Meaning they could
see, smell, and hear the enemy long before they became visible to them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Daria asked me to ask you if you'll be
able to extract us later."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, why?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Remember the gambit spell I mentioned?
Daria ordered that if there was no one left to save ... "</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I see," she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The location they were headed to looked
sufficiently far enough for Jane to enchant her entire Quiver. That would then
be split between her and Spike and they would basically scatter the arrows as
widely as possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tom watched as a soldier in one of those
leaf suits emerged from the forest, bow slung, he or she was now toting one of
those silenced MP5s. The soldier ran up to him and pulled a pair of cutters and
released him and his son.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Then there was the sound of rotorcraft.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>A little while later, there was the sound
of a small helicopter coming in fast and dust was kicked up as it appeared over
the treetops, pitching up dramatically as it descended to about a foot off the
ground.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"WHAT??? YOU CHEATED!!!" shouted Kirsty
realizing that all the other Klansmen were dead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I'M SORRY, I HONESTLY THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T
MIND ME BRINGING THE SECOND SWORD!" replied Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"WHAT???" asked Kirsty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I SAID-" started Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"YOU MOCK ME???" screamed Kirsty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"HEYYYY, YOU KNOW ME ... OF COURSE I MOCK
YOU." Replied Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Kirsty ran at Tiffany again, and kept
slashing and stabbing, and not getting Tiffany at all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany's persistence and patience was
eventually rewarded as she got one laceration on Kirsty's knee. A few more
seconds passed before she managed to inflict a deep cut through one of Kirsty's
forearms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Eventually she got another laceration on
Kirsty's side, and Kirsty had to place a hand over the wound when she felt her
intestines start to slide out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She was fucked now and she knew it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Eventually Tiffany disarmed Kirsty and
started slashing at tendons at Kirsty's knees and elbows.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Eventually she dropped the swords and stood
over Kirsty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"What?" asked Kirsty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You killed Sandi for being my friend."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yes."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"She never did anything to you, the girl
probably couldn't throw a punch."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You killed a whole bunch of Klansmen,"
said Kirsty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"They chased me down and tried to kill me,
just for accidentally walking into view of one of their sad ceremonies. They
didn't have to give chase, they drew first blood, they had it coming. What did
Sandi ever do to you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"SHE'S A TRAITOR TO HER RACE!" shouted
Kirsty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Really? ... You know what? Any hostile
aliens looking at our world, drooling over it's resources, would love to see us
remain conflicted. They'd love to see us killing each other by the millions due
to ridiculous ideologies such as racial supremacy, homophobia, religious
fanaticism, I'd say you are the race traitor."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany then pulled her gloves and put them
on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Sandi Griffin was a close friend, she
helped me more than she knew. If it wasn't for her and the time we spent in our
group, I would have probably killed myself a couple of years ago, or would be
living out the rest of my life in a nut house. She helped me maintain enough of
an illusion of normalcy to restore my sanity after a very traumatic experience,
you had no reason to kill her."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany then pulled the bottle of caustic
soda and opened it, she sat on Kirsty's chest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I don't spend nearly as much time as you
obviously do coming up with torture techniques, so I hope you don't mind if I
borrow yours."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany then grabbed Kirsty's face, Kirsty
moved her head around, clenching her jaw tightly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"TIFFANY, DON'T!" shouted Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany looked at him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Spike was with Jane, poking the ground with
a bayonet to clear a way through the minefield.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany took some time to think about what
she wanted to do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She had about a minute to do this if at
all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Tiffany knew that she was still on live TV
and that if she were to shove this stuff down her throat, she would be jailed.
There would be no way for the government to give her a free pass without losing
it's last shred of influence, she would be killed like a rabid dog.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>And she didn't care.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She didn't care now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Would she later?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She thought back to the times she wanted to
just die.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She didn't care if she died as long as the
pain and humiliation stopped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>And she had since vindicated her decision
to live.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She had saved many lives, taken many
vampires out of circulation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The world needed her as a vampire slayer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She picked up the lid and put it back on
the bottle and said "you'll get yours," before standing up and walking over to
the claymore sword. She then walked to the edge of the arena, and started
minesweeping from her side to meet Jane and Spike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"What do you think we should do?" asked
Buffy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Honestly ... I don't think there is anything
we can do, this girl may be a slayer, but she's dedicated to her mission. She
wants to kill every non-aryan, non-straight, non-protestant on the planet. She
isn't another Dana or Faith, the girl isn't killing from poorly dealing with
any personal issues. She believes her actions were correct, we can't bring her
back," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Have you talked to her?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria recalled the conversation she had had
with Kirsty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"-you're just another race traitor you
godless heathen witch, I bet you're gay too, I hope you burn in hell-"
continued Kirsty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria stood there patiently waiting for her
to stop.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>She checked her watch again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Eventually she got bored and walked off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>-~-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Oh yeah, girl just lay there verbally
abusing me, I got bored and walked off. There's no back for her to go to, and
Tiffany was about a hair away from reaping vengeance," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I saw," said Buffy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I'm taking time off work for the next
fortnight, my sister saw the actual murder. I also want to see if there's
anything I can do for Tom, Sam and Chris Griffin. And honestly, if I were to go
on operations in this frame of mind, I'm likely to start making liberal use of
Jane's gambit spell."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Like you ordered Jane to if there was
no-one left to rescue?" asked Buffy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Daria thought about it and eventually said
"that was part vengeance, mostly I wanted to eliminate that group of psychos
all together."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"But if it were that important, why did you

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The default leader accepted the disc and

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He opened the file on it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It was a powerpoint presentation that

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I don't get it, 'You Are The Weakest
Link', what's that supposed to be code for?" asked one of the Klansmen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I dunno, it would make sense if Kirsty was
trying to kill us all, but that doesn't make sense either-" started the other,
only to be interrupted by the sudden immersion of himself and the other
Klansmen that were assembled around him in a nuclear fireball.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I actually had her charm a 53</span><span

string and put that under the label, but you get the idea," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"What yield is that?" asked Buffy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Six tons, 'bout the same energy as a daisy
cutter."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I'm watching the news now, the device was
deep in the woods when it went off."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"I figured they would want a base they
could control, if they try to hide out in an urban space, they'd quickly
encounter people who are not sympathetic to their cause, that would report
them, I set the yield based on that."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"What about that whole thunder dome thing,
did that make sense to you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"<a

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Yeah, it did, she must have seen that in
one of her Slayer visions."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Notice a theme developing here?" asked
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"You mean the bumper whirlwind harvest we
seem to have reaped? Oh yeah ... How's Tiffany?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Angry ... She wants to return to active
duty, I think I should let her, see how it goes," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"Think it's a good idea given her anger? I
know from experience that anger can impede good judgement."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"So does Tiffany."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>There was some silence for a while.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>"How goes the cross training program?"

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It would seem that <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
