a <I>Daria</I> Fanfic by wyvern337
<P>
Daria held onto her mother's hand as they left the library and
crossed the street to where the car was parked. She'd been walking
on her own for awhile now, but holding onto Helen helped her stabilize
herself, at least in a psychological sense: it could be <I>scary
</I>out away from home, and she liked to make sure she kept close
to her mom. As they stepped up onto the curb Helen stopped, looked
down at her daughter and, pointing upwards, said &quot;see that
airplane, Daria?&quot;
<P>
As a matter of fact, Daria <I>couldn't</I> see it -- could barely
even see far enough to tell that her mother was pointing, much
less what she was pointing <I>at.</I> As her visual range had
always been that short, she'd just assumed it was normal. More
recently, as the adults had taken to pointing out things to her
she couldn't see, she'd formed the idea that her eyesight would
improve as she got older, and that being able to see distant objects
was part of that mysterious and far-away thing called being grown-up.
For some reason, though, this time it annoyed her. She was sure
that the plane was up there -- <I>somewhere</I> -- and that her
mother could see it, but <I>why couldn't she? </I>Daria frowned,
squinted, tried to picture in her mind what the distant aircraft
must look like...why wasn't it getting any easier? was something
<I>wrong</I> with her?
<P>
Looking down at her daughter when she didn't receive a reply,
Helen noticed Daria straining as she looked upwards. The aircraft
was pretty high up -- so much so in fact that you could hardly
make out its shape and the engine noise, if it was reaching the
ground at all, was drowned out by the sounds of the street. She'd
only noticed it because of the flash of the sun glinting off its
aluminum skin. But still, shouldn't Daria be able to see it? Was
there something...<I>wrong</I> with her?
<P>
As the seconds passed, Daria began to sense her mother's expectation
of some kind of answer, and perhaps...something more? Uncomfortable,
she said &quot;oh, I see it now&quot;, and pointed in what she
guessed was the correct direction.
<P>
&quot;That's good, sweetie,&quot; said Helen, unable to keep the
note of concern out of her voice. Not only had Daria been pointing
to the wrong part of the sky, the plane had passed behind a cloud.
<P>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
That evening, Helen found herself paying more attention to Daria
than to the library book she was helping her read. Daria was pausing
over the more difficult words, of course, while she tried to figure
them out, but now that she was paying more attention to <I>how</I>
her daughter was reading, there were some other things Helen noticed.
For one thing, Daria wasn't just frowning in frustration at the
words, she was squinting in a way that seemed to Helen as if she
were finding them hard to see. Not only that, but now that she
was looking more closely, she also seemed to notice Daria holding
the book unusually close to her face.
<P>
&quot;Jake?&quot; called Helen across the room to where her husband
was engrossed in the evening newspaper.
<P>
&quot;Uhm, yeah?&quot; came the reply.
<P>
&quot;Have you noticed Daria trying to read?&quot; she asked.
<P>
Hearing her name and realizing her parents were talking about
her, Daria stopped trying to read her book and turned her attention
to the conversation.
<P>
&quot;Sure have!&quot; said Jake. &quot;Isn't she amazing? Beats
me how the two of <I>us</I> had such a...&quot;
<P>
Daria smiled a little, recognizing the praising note in her father's
voice.
<P>
<I>&quot;Jake!&quot;</I> Helen interrupted, her daughter jumping
slightly in her lap at the sharpness of her tone, &quot;<I> </I>I'm
<I>talking</I> about the way she squints at the pages, and holds
the book so close to her face. Do you think there might be something
wrong with her eyesight?&quot;
<P>
Daria's eyes widened in alarm. <I>Something </I>wrong <I>with
me?</I> 
<P>
&quot;I don't know, I hadn't really noticed. D'you really think
it's anything serious?&quot; Jake replied.
<P>
<I>Does she?</I> 
<P>
Helen was disgusted at what she perceived as her husband's cluelessness,
but she didn't say anything about it at the time. Instead she
answered, &quot;I don't know. I think I'd better get her in and
get her checked. Maybe our regular pediatrician knows a good eye
specialist.&quot;
<P>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
Early one afternoon about a week later, <I>almost </I>running
late as a result of having to find someone to watch Quinn in the
middle of a weekday, Daria and Helen stood at the front door of
Village Eye Medical Group. The door had a logo on it of a stylized
eye inside a big triangle, big enough that Daria could see it
more-or-less clearly. Something about it seemed vaguely sinister
to her. In the entry foyer was a sliding window with a counter
in front of it, set above the level of Daria's head. She could
see that there were some folded pieces of paper with writing on
them projecting over the edge of the counter.
<P>
&quot;Good afternoon,&quot; came a woman's voice from behind the
window, &quot;and welcome to Village Eye. How may I help you this
afternoon?&quot;
<P>
Daria peered at the source of the voice, but even at that close
distance the receptionist was little more than a blurred, variously-colored
smear.
<P>
&quot;We have a one-thirty appointment with Dr. Williams,&quot;
said Helen.
<P>
While her mother fussed with the largely invisible person behind
the window, Daria turned her attention to the pieces of paper
she'd noticed before. She was getting a sense that this was going
to take awhile, and thought maybe she could avoid getting bored
if there was something to read. As Daria stood on tiptoe attempting
to reach the brochures, the receptionist cast a slightly-disdainful
glance at her. <I>Just what I need, one of the ill-behaved brats
making a mess I have to clean up.</I> Noticing what her daughter
was up to, Helen pulled one of the brochures off its stack and
handed it to Daria without looking down. The girl held it up close
to her face and, frown-squinting at it, started aloud: &quot;A
Pu...pub..lis..<I>lic...</I>&quot;
<P>
&quot;'Publication', sweetie,&quot; said Helen, still not breaking
from her haggling session, though the receptionist looked down
in surprise at Daria.
<P>
Soon Daria and Helen were sitting in two chairs near the opposite
end of the waiting room from the receptionist's window, Daria
trying to make what sense she could of an informational brochure
on macular degeneration while her mother helped her in her attempts
to sound out the more difficult words. This hadn't been going
on for very long (a tribute to Helen's negotiating skills) when
they were called back into the offices for the examination.
<P>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
Standing behind the tape line on the floor, Daria peered at the
chart on the wall at the end of the hallway. It was so <I>far</I>
-- how did they expect her to see all of it? Still, she obediently
described what she could make out. The big &quot;E&quot; at the
top was easy enough, but it wasn't long after that she started
to have trouble. First he had her try to read it with both her
eyes open, then with just her right eye, then just her left. She
found she could make out a <I>little</I> more of the chart that
last way than with just her right one.
<P>
After that test, Daria and Helen (who would have none of simply
staying in the waiting room) followed the doctor into a darkened
room with a big, strange-looking chair in the middle of it. After
the doctor helped Daria up into the chair she found herself flinching
as he lowered a...<I>thing</I> towards her face. Gray metal, attached
to a movable arm, bigger than her head and in two connected pieces,
each with a glassed-over hole in its center. Daria didn't know
what it was and wasn't sure she wanted any part of it.
<P>
&quot;It's okay,&quot; Dr. Williams reassured her. &quot;Just
look through the two holes in it and tell me what you can see.&quot;
<P>
Daria held still as the device was lowered onto the bridge of
her nose and adjusted until she could see through both lenses.
The doctor then switched on a projector, kind of like the one
Jake sometimes did slide shows of the family vacations with, and
a chart full of letters a lot like the one in the hallway appeared
on the screen. Daria caught her breath as she realized she could
make out several lines of letters more than she'd been able to
out in the hall. Was <I>this</I> when her eyes were going to start
to get better, so she could see all the things the grownups could?
<P>
&quot;Okay, Daria,&quot; said Dr. Williams, &quot;I'm going to
change the lenses in these glasses --&quot;
<P>
<I>Glasses?</I> Thought Daria, a little confused at the unfamiliar
use of the word.
<P>
&quot; -- And you tell me whether you can see the chart any better.&quot;
<P>
She couldn't, really, and she said as much.
<P>
&quot;How about now?&quot;
<P>
And so it went, Dr. Williams changing lenses, sometimes using
a wheel or dial of some kind built into the...<I>glasses?</I>...sometimes
by actually inserting new lenses into them, sometimes with one
eye or the other covered, occasionally switching the projector
to a chart with different letters on it, always asking Daria whether
the changes were &quot;better or worse?&quot; Sometimes they were
much better -- in a few she could even make out <I>all</I> the
letters -- while one was actually worse than nothing. Most of
the changes really weren't noticeably better <I>or</I> worse,
though, and Daria wasn't sure how to answer with those, little
though she liked making the doctor guess.
<P>
Finally, there were no more lenses, no more &quot;better, or worse?&quot;,
and the device was taken away from Daria's face. The doctor told
Helen that her daughter had severe myopia as well as moderate
astigmatism, then he said it was time to dilate her eyes. He showed
Daria a small dropper bottle and told her he was going to put
some drops in her eyes that would &quot;make it so I can see inside
them and tell if there's anything wrong there.&quot; He wasn't
sure how much his young patient understood of what he was telling
her, but he liked for them to know as much as possible about what
was going on. &quot;It might sting and burn a little at first,
and it'll make things look brighter than normal. We'll give you
some special glasses --
<P>
<I>That word again...</I> 
<P>
-- That'll help make things look less bright. These effects won't
last long --&quot; Dr. Williams continued.
<P>
&quot;You mean they'll be tem-por-ar-y,&quot; interrupted Daria
in her little toddler's singsong.
<P>
For a moment the doctor wasn't sure what to say, taken aback by
Daria's precociousness. Then he said, &quot;Yes. Yes Daria, that's
exactly what I mean. Your eyes should be back to normal by tonight
or tomorrow. Now I need you to tilt your head back...look at the
ceiling....&quot;
<P>
When the first drop hit her eye, it did more than just sting a
little. Daria just barely heard her mother's sharp, horrified
gasp from across the room, nearly drowned out by her own shriek
of pain. Dr. Williams handed her a tissue which she used to blot
at her eye, and after a few moments asked her if she felt like
she was ready to do the other eye. She <I>didn't </I>feel ready,
but Daria realized that this was something that was <I>going</I>
to be done, one way or another, and that if she insisted on stopping
now she'd just have to go through it again later. She swallowed,
set her jaw, nodded silently, then tilted her head back to receive
the other drop.
<P>
Afterwards, Daria and Helen sat in a waiting area while they waited
for the eyedrops to take effect and Daria's pupils to dilate.
There was a selection of childrens' books and large-print books
for adults in the waiting area, and Daria tried to read some of
them, taking frequent breaks to wipe at her eyes with some more
tissues Dr. Williams had supplied her with. Her eyes still burned,
and they just wouldn't seem to stop tearing. She also noticed
the room seeming to get slowly brighter, but the effect she found
the most irritating was one she hadn't been forewarned about:
as the room got brighter, the letters in the book she was trying
to read became hopelessly-blurred, much worse than normal. Soon
she couldn't focus at all and slapped the book shut in frustration.
<P>
Noticing her daughter's irritation, Helen laid her hand over Daria's
and said &quot;it'll be okay, sweetie. It has to be done, and
it'll get better soon --&quot; Daria flashed her an annoyed look.
&quot;Of course, you already knew that, didn't you,&quot; she
finished a little lamely.
<P>
Daria acknowledged this, though at her age she was still a little
worried, and the tense hoarseness she heard in Helen's voice didn't
help things much, but she decided to put on a brave face and tough
it out. After a little while (about fifteen minutes, not that
she could've seen a clock or watch face to read it), the drops
had done their work and it was time go back into the examination
room and finish things.
<P>
The rest of the exam was something of a blur for Daria of head-harnesses
and inescapable painfully-bright lights being shone in her eyes.
Finally it was over, and she heard the doctor telling her mother
that there was no evidence of any serious underlying pathology
and Helen saying &quot;thank God.&quot;
<P>
Next Daria was fitted with a pair of dark glasses made of thin
clear-brown plastic with cardboard earpieces that constantly felt
as if they were cutting into the skin behind her ears. She overheard
but didn't really pay much attention to Dr. Williams telling Helen
when Daria's glasses would be ready. One thing she <I>did</I>
notice was Helen anxiously asking whether she should keep Daria
from reading anything until her glasses were ready, so her eyes
didn't get any worse. This earned a sharp look from Daria, though
it failed to be noticed through her shades. &quot;No need for
that,&quot; said Dr. Williams, &quot;it wouldn't make things any
worse, especially over such a short time.&quot;
<P>
At first Daria wondered why she'd been given the dark glasses,
but this question was answered for her as soon as she and Helen
stepped out of the Village Eye offices into the parking lot. Even
with the shades, everything was <I>horribly </I>bright, especially
around the edges of the glasses where light leaked in. Daria squinted
a lot on her way to the car, and she looked down pretty much the
whole way, squeezing her eyes shut whenever she could afford to
(not wanting to run into anything or fall down, of course).
<P>
After they'd made it to the car Helen, perhaps feeling a little
guilty over what her daughter had just been through, asked Daria
if she wanted to go for ice cream. Daria didn't really feel like
going anywhere except home. Not only was the brightness of the
direct sunlight beginning to give her a headache, but another
unmentioned side effect of the eyedrops was beginning to make
itself felt: Daria was getting drowsy, and cranky. &quot;There's
too much light,&quot; she said crossly, and she and Helen drove
home in silence.
<P>
Daria went to bed early that night, slept unusually-soundly, and
by the next morning her eyes (except for itching a little) were
back to normal.
<P>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
About a week later, it was time to go back to the optometrist's
to get the glasses. Daria felt a little apprehensive about the
trip, even though Helen had reassured her it was just to pick
up her glasses. Though she couldn't quite put the feeling into
words yet, she'd learned to associate the place they were going
with pain or at least discomfort.
<P>
Once they were there, Daria got to see her first pair of glasses
for the first time. there was a round lens for each eye (larger,
she noticed, than the ones in the...<I>device</I> she'd worn during
the examination), with black plastic frames. While her mother
haggled and fussed over the glasses' cost, Daria slipped them
on for the first time.
<P>
Immediately, she was struck by how much sharper-focused everything
was and how much better she could see. She wasn't sure yet just
how they'd done it, but whoever'd made the glasses had captured
the effect of the very best combination of lenses she'd tried
out during her exam!
<P>
The second thing Daria noticed was that there was a weird...<I>flatness</I>
to everything. It was harder to tell how far away things were,
and there was a strange sensation while looking at objects that
made her a little dizzy and even queasy.
<P>
Finding no way out of paying the apparently exorbitant cost of
the glasses, Helen looked down at Daria and sharply admonished
her to take good care of them, that they were very expensive and
would be hard to replace. Daria didn't really need to be reminded
to take care of them -- anything that helped her see this much
better was certainly worth going out of her way to care for! --
but looking up suddenly at the words being addressed to her did
make her momentarily dizzy and caused her to reel in order to
keep her balance.
<P>
Apparently the doctor realized what side effects Daria was dealing
with, as he told her then that she'd get used to the new glasses
and the...strangeness....in her vision would go away over the
next few days.
<P>
After Helen paid for the glasses, she and Daria left the doctor's
office and went out to Helen's car. They'd just started to drive
out of the lot when Daria suddenly leaned against the window and
exclaimed <I><B>&quot;the leaves!&quot;</B></I> 
<P>
&quot;What, sweetie?&quot; asked Helen.
<P>
&quot;The leaves on those trees!&quot; replied Daria.
<P>
Helen looked where her daughter was pointing, over at a row of
scrubby-looking saplings that had been planted between the parking
lot and the sidewalk. Some institutional-looking landscaping species,
they'd obviously been planted recently, when the new medical center
had been built. Not the most impressive or exciting of sights.
<P>
&quot;What about them, Daria?&quot; asked Helen, slowing the car
down.
<P>
&quot; I can see them from way over here!&quot; said Daria excitedly.
<P>
She was excited because she could <I>see</I> them, Helen realized.
Before they must've just been...what? A blur? A smear? Until today,
Daria -- <I>her baby!</I> -- wouldn't have been able...couldn't
have&#133; even....
<P>
Helen suddenly swerved off course and parked the car, a little
awkwardly, in a space near the exit of the lot. This confused
Daria, who had thought they were going home. Then she looked at
her mother, and became even more confused. She knew, from recent
experience, how they could blur the vision, and now that she could
see better it was really brought home to her how good a thing
it was to be able to see where you were going, but still she didn't
understand what had happened. Helen hadn't had any drops put in
<I>her</I> eyes while they'd been in there -- Daria was certain
of this, they'd been together the whole time. The only other cause
for tears she knew of was to have been hurt in some way. Was that
what had happened?
<P>
la-la-LA-la-la
<P>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
<I><B>And now, The Disclaimers</B></I>: I don't own Daria, MTV/Viacom
does. I'm not making or going to make any money off of this, and
I don't own anything worth suing me for anyway, so please don't.
I wrote this story for fun, of a sort. May you have fun, of a
sort, reading it.
