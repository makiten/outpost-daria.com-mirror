Hey,
How are you? I'm extremely bored. The English teacher,
Mr. O'Neil, is trying to explain something on
"PowerPoint" for some
works we'll have to do... but nobody seems interested.
Kevin and Brittany are not in the class. They are
surely making out in the
making out room or in the toilet... Jodie and Mack are
talking, Andrea is putting makeup on her face and
Upchuck is talking to me.
Argh! Big pervert! (I was talking of Upchuck.) If he
continue talking to me... I think I will hit him... I
wonder why you aren't here
anyway... But you don't miss anything... except Mr. O'Neil
is calling himself stupid.

Hey... I hope your brother didn't kill you! But... How is
he anyway?

Oops... sorry I have to go... (Math class.)

Bye... 
Your Partner in crime...
Daria...

(Cut to see Daria reading the response from Jane...)

Yo Daria,
I'm fine, just get a cold... don't worry... I'm still
alive... I knew you couldn't stop talking about Trent...
He is just fine... Oh...
I'm so sorry... he found your letter... huh... in my things...
Sorry...

I have to stop here to take my syrup.
Bye...
Partner in crime
Jane...

(Cut to see Daria find another sheet with Jane's
letter. Something is written with an unknown
handwriting... she starts reading.)

Hey Daria,
What's up? I'm sorry I red your letter but Janey must
have drop it in front of my door... and like there was
no name on it... then I
red it... I'm sorry! Thanks to care a little about me
anyway! 
I have to go... (Getting some sleep.)

Love

Trent
Xxx...

The end...
