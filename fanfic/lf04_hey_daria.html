HEY DARIA!<br>
<br>
written by Warpedkjh13<br>
-------------------------<br>
This fan fiction is a sequel to my first, second and third Daria fan fictions, Daria's Run, Beavis, Butt-Head and... Upchuck, and The Search For Jesse. It is focused on the school fair in which Daria's Run, B,B&U and D3:TSFJ were told. It also features Beavis and Butt-Head and the characters from Hey Arnold. By the time I've finished all of these, it'll be Christmas! Agh!<br>
-------------------------<br>
SCENE ONE: BAND STAGE<br>
<br>
MS. LI: And now, the musical talent of P.S. 118, from somewhere near New York.<br>
<br>
(There is a very feeble clap from the audience. The characters from Hey Arnold start singing a poor rendition of the Daria theme.)<br>
<br>
HELGA: Criminy! This song sucks big time.<br>
<br>
GERALD: Where are we anyway?<br>
<br>
ARNOLD: I don't know and I don't want to know.<br>
<br>
DARIA: Strange little kids.<br>
<br>
JANE: They sort of look like the people in my painting "People With Misshaped Heads".<br>
<br>
ARNOLD: Hey, look at all the girls out there. (looks at Brittany) Look at the blonde!<br>
<br>
GERALD (focusing on Jodie): I've found my share of the action.<br>
<br>
(Helga turns red.)<br>
<br>
ARNOLD (spots Kevin): Aww.<br>
<br>
GERALD (spots Mack): Aww.<br>
<br>
DARIA: This is going to be a long day.<br>
<br>
HELGA: That's it, I'm moving out.<br>
<br>
GERALD: Same here. I'm a ladies man and I want to meet some ladies.<br>
<br>
JANE: Well, jeez, kid. I think Wingus, Dingus and Slingus have them all covered.<br>
<br>
BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO (O.C.): Are you threatening me? Corrrrrnnhooooolio!<br>
<br>
(Hey Arnold credits play, shortly followed by the Daria credits.)<br>
<br>
MS. LI: Ah, kids. These are Daria, Jane and... Trent?<br>
<br>
TOM: It's Tom.<br>
<br>
MS. LI: Ah yes. Anyway, the assigned guide for these children is... um... busy-<br>
<br>
UPCHUCK (O.C.): Heh heh. Cornhole.<br>
<br>
MS. LI: So I'm handing custody to you.<br>
<br>
DARIA: Oh great.<br>
<br>
HELGA: Stop your whinging! Daria and Jane look cool and pretty damn popular if you ask me!<br>
<br>
(Daria and Jane look at each other doubtfully.)<br>
<br>
ARNOLD: Yeah, I guess you aren't that bad.<br>
<br>
JANE: So kiddies, what are your names.<br>
<br>
GERALD: I'm Gerald Johannsen, this is Helga Pataki, and this is Arnold-<br>
<br>
TOM: I'm hungry.<br>
<br>
DARIA: Yeah, me too. Hey kids, how about we go get something to eat and watch some idiots play football?<br>
<br>
ARNOLD: Sounds great.<br>
<br>
HELGA (thought): Oh, Arnold... Arnold... my love... shut up! Damn raging hormones!<br>
<br>
GERALD: Yeah, why not?<br>
<br>
HELGA: It's okay by me.<br>
<br>
JANE: I like idiocy.<br>
<br>
DARIA: These kids are cool.<br>
<br>
TOM: Hi kids, I'm Tom Sloane. This is Daria Morgendorffer and Jane Lane.<br>
<br>
GERALD: Are you two going out?<br>
<br>
DARIA: Don't ask stupid questions and I won't give stupid answers.<br>
<br>
GERALD: Sorry.<br>
<br>
DARIA: Look. There's a TV over there. Watch it. You can watch your cartoons that are filled with mindless violence.<br>
<br>
JANE: Daria!<br>
<br>
DARIA: Okay, come with me.<br>
<br>
TOM: What do you want to eat?<br>
<br>
HELGA: Cotton candy! Yum!<br>
<br>
(They bump into Tad and Tricia.)<br>
<br>
TAD: Daria!<br>
<br>
TRICIA: How are you?<br>
<br>
DARIA: Are you lost again? I don't remember seeing any windmills around here. [1]<br>
<br>
TAD: No, we're cool.<br>
<br>
TRICIA: We want candy!<br>
<br>
DARIA: You told me candy was poison.<br>
<br>
TAD: There are liars in the world.<br>
<br>
JANE: I'm glad to see you've made a permanent mark on these impressionable kids.<br>
<br>
COMMERCIAL BREAK 1: DARIA RUNNING INTO TAD AND TRICIA<br>

SCENE TWO: COTTON CANDY STALL<br>
<br>
BGM: ELECTRIC LIGHT ORCHESTA - ABOVE THE CLOUDS<br>
<br>
(Monique walks up to them.)<br>
<br>
MONIQUE: Hey Daria.<br>
<br>
DARIA: Hey Monique. How's Trent?<br>
<br>
MONIQUE: He's resting after his big concert.<br>
<br>
(Focus on Trent, sleeping while standing backstage.)<br>
<br>
JANE: Good concert by the way.<br>
<br>
MONIQUE: I know. Word says there is a record producer looking for Trent. Better go wake him.<br>
<br>
JANE: You know the drill.<br>
<br>
MONIQUE: I sure do. See you.<br>
<br>
DARIA: See you.<br>
<br>
(Monique walks off.)<br>
<br>
MONIQUE (O.C.): Trent! Jesse smashed your guitar!<br>
<br>
JANE: She's so inventive.<br>
<br>
ARNOLD: Is Trent that guy who was playing before us?<br>
<br>
DARIA: Yeah.<br>
<br>
GERALD: He's cool.<br>
<br>
JANE: You have no idea.<br>
<br>
SCENE THREE: BACKSTAGE<br>
<br>
RECORD PRODUCER: I like your sound.<br>
<br>
TRENT: It wasn't our song.<br>
<br>
RECORD PRODUCER: It doesn't matter. You can be the first band on our label, Mixtown Records [2].<br>
<br>
JESSE: Okay.<br>
<br>
TRENT: We accept.<br>
<br>
(The band rejoice.)<br>
<br>
RECORD PRODUCER: Cool. I'll be seeing you tomorrow afternoon then?<br>
<br>
TRENT: Well, yeah!<br>
<br>
DARIA: Hey Trent.<br>
<br>
TRENT: Daria, we're making an album.<br>
<br>
(Trent runs up and hugs her, and Daria gives an unmistakable blush.)<br>
<br>
JANE: Ha!<br>
<br>
DARIA: Oh, shut up.<br>

END CREDITS MUSIC: Set Me Free - The Sweet<br>
<br>
Alter Egos<br>

Aunt Amy<br>
Marge Simpson<br>
<br>
Tom:<br>
Jack Torrance (from The Shining)<br>
Hannibal Lecter<br>
<br>
Jane:<br>
Van Gogh (I know, I used it before, I just like it)<br>
A very shoddy imitation of Brittany<br>
<br>
Monique - Liza Minelli<br>

FOOTNOTES (I hate footnotes, I'm sorry I had to do them)<br>
<br>
[1] - Tad got lost when he saw some windmills in a window in "I Loathe A Parade"<br>
<br>
[2] - I don't know whether Mixtown Records really exists or not, so please don't e-mail me saying CHANGE THAT LABEL NAME because it was an honest mistake.<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
NOTES:<br>
<br>
I would really appreciate some appreciative criticism, don't just tell me I suck bigtime. I really don't want to hear it. Arnold and the gang will be in the final episode, then I shall go on to single stories. The things Mystik Spiral go through to make the album will be a story, as will another aunt story. I think that Aunt Amy needs more recognition. By the way, another great Daria fanfic is Heroes by Lew Richardson and it made me realize that Monique was better as a good character, unlike her portrayal in Diane Long's Undone. LONG NOTES! WHEW!<br>
