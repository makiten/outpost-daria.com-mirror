<P>"You're Standing On My Neck" begins to play, but the title sequence will be 
as follows: </P>It is night. Camera sweeps over a rooftop. Stop on Mara, who 
nods her head and says: "All right. If we're gonna do it." She turns her head to 
the right and continues: "Let's do the bloody thing right." Music begins now.
<P></P>Mack and Damien are in Shakespearian costumes. Mack has his head shaved. 
He looks absolutely <B>PISSED.</B> He grabs Damien and pushes him into a 
rectangular pool of water at the front of the stage.
<P></P>Daria and Darren are standing in what looks like a fast food kitchen. 
They are wearing rather embarrassing uniforms that have the American Flag design 
on them. There is an older man standing between them. He grabs his head and 
falls over backward. Daria and Darren look at him, look at each other, and 
shrug.
<P></P>We see O'Neill standing, in the auditorium, next to a middle aged woman. 
Suddenly, Damien runs into the shot and tackles her.
<P></P>Darkness. Then some stage lights turn on. Mystik Spiral is standing on a 
very large stage, instruments ready. Trent has his back turned to the camera. 
The rest of the band looks scared $#!7less. Trent turns around and gets the same 
expression on his face. The camera pans to behind him. Showing Mystik spiral 
standing in front of a VERY large crowd.
<P></P>Mara is sitting in a conference room. She looks bored as all hell. She 
then pulls out a book called: <U>Vaseline, gasoline, and five hundred other ways 
to make plastic explosives.</U>
<P></P>Miranda is standing on stage at a school dance of some kind. She is 
playing a guitar. In the background, Darren is playing bass, Damien is playing 
drums, and a slightly older version of the brothers Kinsington is on the other 
guitar. Darren is wearing a dress shirt, unbuttoned, a white t-shirt underneath, 
black slacks, and black Doc Martins. Damien is shirtless. Miranda is wearing a 
white pixie dress and her hair is done in a set of tight braids, each braid 
colour alternating red and purple. She is playing what looks like a very 
complicated solo. Trent is staring at her in awe.
<P></P>Daria and Jane are in the theatre. Daria is wearing a black t-shirt and 
jeans. Jane is dressed as she usually is. Upchuck is accosting the girls. 
Miranda grabs him and pulls him off camera. Daria and Jane look in their 
direction, then exchange looks of nausea.
<P></P>Our heroes are standing in front of a bulletin board reading a notice. 
Camera moves down the line. Daria looks impassive, Jane looks shocked, Damien 
has a scowl, Darren looks angry, Miranda looks absolutely <B>pissed.</B> She is 
breathing heavily, gnashing her teeth, and her left eye is twitching. She closes 
her eyes and screams something.
<P></P>Jodie is standing in front of Mr DeMartino's class, giving a 
presentation. She puts her left hand to her forehead and continues. She puts her 
hand to her forehead again. A couple beats later, she collapses.
<P></P>Stacy is running down the halls of Lawndale High. Sandi is running after 
her weilding a blood stained Chainsaw.
<P></P>Close up on Daria, who smirks as the Daria Logo comes up over a yellow 
background.

<P></P><B>Scene I</B> 
<P></P><B>EXT:</B> Rowe House
<P></P><B>Music:</B> Sleep, by Garbage
<P></P><B>CUT TO:</B> Stacy's bedroom
<P></P>Stacy is asleep in her bed. She is tossing and turning, like she's having 
a bad dream.
<P></P><B>CUT TO:</B> The dream
<P></P>Stacy is running down the halls of Lawndale high. She runs over the 
camera, which is placed on the ground. A few beats after she runs past, Sandi 
runs past, holding a blood stained chainsaw in front of her.
<P></P><B>CUT TO:</B> a side view of Stacy, who's still running. Camera pans 
right to show Sandi swinging said chainsaw.
<P></P>Stacy is then seen crawling along the floor until she reaches a door, at 
which point she opens it and sneaks in.
<P></P>We then see a frontal shot of Stacy sitting with her back against the 
door. She is panting heavily. She then gets a very scared look to her as she 
covers her mouth to stifle any noise. Her eyes look up as camera pans up to show 
Sandi's sillhoette in the frosted window in the door. Sandi looks around, then 
moves off to the left.
<P></P>Stacy removes her hand from her mouth and breathes out a sigh of relief. 
<P></P>Camera cuts to a left profile shot of her breathing heavily. She then 
flinches and screams as the blade of the chainsaw suddenly cuts through the door 
at about the level of her neck.
<P></P>Camera cuts to Stacy's POV. The chainsaw inches closer as she...
<P></P>Wakes up screaming.
<P></P>Stacy wakes up in a cold sweat. She starts shivering and breathing 
heavily again. She puts her hand to her forehead as she talks to herself
<P></P><B>Stacy:</B> It was just a dream. It won't really happen, Sandi isn't 
like that.
<P></P>She takes her hand, which is now covered in sweat, off her forehead. She 
looks at her hand and cringes
<P></P><B>Stacy:</B> Eew, Sweat. That looks, like, so bad.
<P></P>She is then startled by a knock on the door
<P></P><B>Stacy's Mother:</B> Stacy? Are you ok?
<P></P><B>Stacy:</B> Um...Yeah, I'm fine.
<P></P><B>Stacy's Mother:</B> Oh. Well, try to get some sleep. You've got a big 
day tomorrow.
<P></P><B>Stacy:</B> Um...ok.
<P></P>Stacy gets back under the covers and turns her back to the camera. A few 
seconds later, we hear the sounds of soft crying
<P></P><B>EXT:</B> Lawndale High
<P></P><B>Music:</B> "Crash (Into Me)" by The Gufs (You've probably never heard 
of them)
<P></P><B>Scene II</B>
<P></P>Hallway
<P></P>Darren and Jane are sitting beside a group of lockers. Jane is giving 
Darren her sketchbook
<P></P><B>Jane:</B> So, I finally have some ideas for the set that I like. I'm 
just hoping that O'Neill will approve.
<P></P>Darren looks at the sketchbook, then he gets a "Please tell me that 
you're kidding" look
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Um...You're not serious, I hope.
<P></P><B>Jane:</B> What? I'm an artist. I question normalcy.
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Yeah, I know that, but...Othello in a supermarket.
<P></P><B>Jane:</B> Tell me, who else would dare to have the actors duel with 
baguettes?
<P></P>Darren smirks, then he gives Jane her sketchbook
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Whatever.
<P></P>Enter Mack
<P></P><B>Jane:</B> Hey Mack. What do you think of these?
<P></P>Mack looks at the designs, then smirks
<P></P><B>Mack</B> It's daring, but I think O'Neill will want something more 
traditional.
<P></P><B>Jane:</B> My art is lost on you people.
<P></P>Mack smirks. Enter Daria and Damien
<P></P><B>Jane:</B> Hey, How did the lock picking instruction go?
<P></P><B>Damien:</B> Not bad, considering the locks Ms. Li puts on these doors.
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> All the more challenging.
<P></P><B>Daria</B> Now maybe I can get into some of Quinn's stuff.
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (confused) Why?
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> Blackmail scheme. It's what normal siblings do.
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> As opposed to functional siblings like us?
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> Basically.
<P></P>As our heroes talk, The camera pans to show the fashion club. Sandi, 
Tiffany, and Quinn look at our heroes, disdainfully. Stacy, on the other hand, 
has a look of pity for our heroes and fear of Sandi
<P></P><B>Sandi:</B> God Quinn! Why is Darren Kinsington hanging out with that 
loser cousin of yours?
<P></P><B>Quinn:</B> I know! And who's that loser guy that's with them?
<P></P><B>Tiffany:</B> (in typical form) Well...I heard...Darren say that that 
guy is...his...brother.
<P></P><B>Quinn</B> Oh c'mon Tiffany. If I had a loser brother or sister, 
[immediately corrects] and I'm not saying I do, the last thing I'd do is 
<I>admit</I> it!
<P></P><B>Tiffany:</B> Really.
<P></P>Camera cuts back to our heroes
<P></P><B>Jane:</B> Ya know. You'd think they'd catch on one of these years.
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> (deadpan) Especially when you've told them...several times.
<P></P><B>Jane:</B> Speaking of Quinn...How's she doing in the play?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Oh, bleedin' marvelous...when she actually shows up.
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> She's barely shown up in the past two weeks of rehearsal. 
How she made it through the "Canterbury Tales" is beyond me.
<P></P><B>Jane:</B> I don't think I <I>want</I> to know.
<P></P>Daria gets a look of mild disgust
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> And I thank you for putting that image into my head.
<P></P><B>Jane:</B> Anytime, partner.
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> I don't understand it. From what I heard, she was pretty 
good last time.
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> Because she didn't have as many dates last time.
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Well, we're supposed to get an assistant director today, 
maybe he can set her straight.
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> I doubt it. She's trying to distance herself from this.
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Trying to move the blame, I take it.
<P></P><B>Damien:</B> Probably. That way she can say "Well, it's not my fault, I 
wasn't even <I>there.</I> (smirks) Besides, She won't get cut. I think that the 
school thinks that the play needs the popular kids to bring honour and glory 
to...
<P></P>He is interupted by Ms. Li
<P></P><B>Li:</B> (accusatory) Why aren't you in class?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> We still have a couple more minutes.
<P></P><B>Li:</B> Well, you'd better get moving, you know the punishment for 
tardiness?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (under his breath) Yeah, yeah, automatic week's detention. 
(He turns to the rest of the group.) Ea, mu prakao levi po kintaa na le 
nerfucdei.("I suggest that we continue this conversation tomorrow.")
<P></P>The rest of the group just shrug and leave. Darren and Jane go one way, 
Damien, Daria, and Mack go the other. Li watches both groups leave, then she 
speaks into a dictaphone
<P></P><B>Li:</B> Update on investigation. The Lawndale Deviants have started 
using foreign languages. Obviously in an attempt to hide their subversive 
activities. Continue surveillance.
<P></P>She moves offcamera. We see Darren, who was standing behind her, watching 
the whole thing. He gets a "You <I>really</I> don't get it, do you?" face. He 
then gets out a notebook, writes something in it, and continues down the hall.
<P></P><B>Scene III</B> O'Neill's Room
<P></P>O'Neill is sitting on his desk, looking into a hand mirror.
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> Now, I'm sure you can get motivated to...
<P></P>Enter Quinn:
<P></P><B>Quinn:</B> You wanted to talk to me?
<P></P>O'Neill yelps, then regains his composure
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> (Worried) Um, Quinn, we need to talk about your 
attendence at the rehearsals.
<P></P><B>Quinn:</B> What's to discuss? I've been there a few times.
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> Now, while I understand that you have many things going 
on in your life.
<P></P><B>Quinn:</B> <I>Tell</I> me about it
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> Why, I remember when I was your age, and...
<P></P>Quinn looks impatient
<P></P><B>Quinn:</B> Um...Can this wait? I have...um...something to do tonight.
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> Oh, certainly. But, keep what I said in mind, ok?
<P></P><B>Quinn:</B> (as she exits) Whatever.
<P></P><B>CUT TO:</B> The Theatre
<P></P>Darren and Damien enter through the doors. They suddenly stop, get a look 
of complete Joy, and look towards the heavens
<P></P><B>Darren and Damien:</B> Thank you!
<P></P>Daria just looks at them
<P></P><B>Scene IV
<P></P>Still in the Theatre:</B>
<P></P><B>Music:</B> "There You Go" by Pink
<P></P>The Cast is sitting on the stage in a semi-circle, except for three kids, 
who are sitting by themselves. O'Neill is standing centre stage. Standing with 
him is a very thin, middle aged woman with short, curly blond hair and round 
glasses. She is wearing light blue jeans and a grey t-shirt that has a portrait 
of Shakespeare. O'Neill is taking roll
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> Montano?...Othello?...Desdemona?...Desdemona?...Where's 
Quinn Morgendorffer?
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> Not here.
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> (concerned) Oh no, I hope she's ok. She's been missing a 
lot of practices lately.
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Really? No $#!7.
<P></P>O'Neill's mood suddenly brightens
<P></P>Well, I'd like to present a new face to the play. She has done a lot of 
work with Shakespearean troupes. Please give a warm Lawndale welcome to Diane 
Kolinksi.
<P></P>Camera stays on her as we hear scattered applause. Suddenly, Damien runs 
into the shot, tackles her, and gives her a great big bear hug.
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> Well, It's...nice to see such...enthusiasm, Damien.
<P></P><B>Kolinski:</B> (groans) Nice to see you too, Damien. Now get off of me.
<P></P>Damien waits a couple seconds, then gets up and goes back to his seat. 
Kolinksi gets up and composes herself. Camera cuts to Daria
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> (To the brothers) You know her?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (grins) Our beloved drama teacher back in Kenesha.
<P></P>Back to O'Neill
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> (to Kolinski) Well, Diane, take over.[Exit O'Neill]
<P></P>Kolinski looks at her clipboard, then looks around
<P></P><B>Kolinski:</B> Who's Daria?
<P></P>Daria raises her hand
<P></P><B>Kolinski:</B> Oh, good. You're Quinn's sister, I assume?
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> Though it would kill her to admit it, yes.
<P></P><B>Kolinski:</B> (to herself) I'm not going to ask (back to Daria) How do 
you pronounce your last name?
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> Mor-gen-dor-ffer
<P></P>Kolinski gets a mildly offended look
<P></P><B>Kolinski:</B> (To everyone) O.k. I'm 47 years old, I'm not five.
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Although she <I>does</I> sometimes act like it.
<P></P>Daria looks at him. Kolinski just nods and smirks
<P></P><B>Kolinski:</B> (points to Darren) True. The point is that I'm not 
senile yet. (Looks at the three kids who are sitting by themselves) Um...could 
you three sit with the rest of the group, so I don't have to look back and forth 
and crap?
<P></P>Darren and Damien smirk. Daria just looks impassive
<P></P><B>Commercial</B>
<P></P><B>Scene V</B>
<P></P>Yes, still in the theatre.
<P></P><B>Music</B> "Home" by Staind
<P></P>The cast is standing in a circle, holding hands. Their eyes are all 
closed, except for Damien's, for obvious reasons.
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> Now, when you're out there, wowing the crowd, you must 
remember that you should act as one mind. It may take time to perfect. But, 
someone said that if you put a thousand monkeys (sp?) in a room, and give them 
typewriters, eventually, you'd have...
<P></P><B>CUT TO:</B> Daria
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> ...A room full of dead monkeys.
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Not to mention a <I>really</I> bad smell.
<P></P>Kolinski glares at them
<P></P><B>Kolinski:</B> (dead serious) Guys, listen to him! When you're on 
stage, you can't act like 40 different people. You must know exactly what the 
other person will do. If you don't, you won't know where the hell you are, the 
play will fail, and, as much as I hate to quote Adam Sandler, <I>they're all 
gonna laugh at you!</I>
<P></P>O'neill looks at her with a mixture of shock (that she would take that 
tone with her students) and relief (that someone actually understands what he's 
trying to say.)
<P></P><B>CUT TO:</B> The students.
<P></P>The camera moves down the line, Daria looks impassive, Darren and Damien 
are grinning, and Kevin looks <I>very</I> uncomfortable.
<P></P><B>EXT</B> Lawndale High. We hear Kevin
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> C'mon Mack Daddy.
<P></P><B>Scene VI</B>
<P></P>Near Mack's locker.
<P></P>Mack is getting his books. Kevin, is standing next to him. Darren and 
Miranda are sitting down, indian style.
<P></P><B>Music:</B> "When Dolphins Cry" by Live
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> (annoyed) Kevin, You can't quit. You're one of the major 
characters...And don't call me that!
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> I can't take it. You heard the lady! Just the thought of 
the whole team laughing at me.
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Kevin, they're jocks, what makes you think they'd step 
foot <I>near</I> the theatre in the first place?
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> It's one of the rules, I think.
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> (perks up) Really? (turns to Darren) Hey, too bad the 
<I>soccer</I> team doesn't have the same rule.
<P></P>Darren looks <I>very</I> annoyed
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Oh, for #$%*'s sake, don't start this again.
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> C'mon, bro. Our football is better, so why don't you just 
call soccer, like we do?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (through gritted teeth) Because we came up with the name 
first?
<P></P>Miranda rolls her eyes. She then turns to Mack
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> Might I suggest we go somewhere else?
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> Why? This is getting good.
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> You don't know how big a footie fan exists in my brother. 
[looks at Kevin and Darren] This is the kind of argument that could turn 
violent.
<P></P>Mack and Miranda leave Darren and Kevin arguing in the hallway. Darren 
and Kevin are now facing each other.
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> It's *football*, bro! <I>Our</I> sport is football! Your's 
is <I>soccer</I>, not football!
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (sarcastically) Can't argue with that logic.
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> (Confused) Um...what are we arguing?
<P></P><B>Darren</B> (Frowning:) Look, the goalkeeper is the only one who can 
use his hands. The rest of us have to use our <I>feet.</I> Therefore, 
it-is-FOOTBALL! You guys generally use your <I>hands</I> to run with your ball, 
or to throw it! You use your feet to only kick the ball when you're kicking off, 
punting, or going for the extra point! If anything, your sport should be called 
<I>handball!</I>
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> (Rolls his eyes:) Aww, man--that's stupid! There's 
<I>already</I> a sport called handball! You see, two people hit the ball against 
a wall...
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (Smirks:) Then why don't they call their sport "wallball?"
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> (Exasperated:) 'Cause there's no such thing as "wallball," 
dude!
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (grins) How do <I>you</I> know?
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> (Now thoroughly confused, looks up, scratches head:) Uhhh, 
Gee, I don't know, bro!
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (While walking away:) Well, when you find out, do me a 
favour and tell me, will you? See you around.
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> (Calling after him:) Yeah, I'll do just that, dude! (Looks 
confused:) Ummm--what were we talking about? (Shrugs. Sees Brittany:) Hey, babe!
<P></P>Darren walks off, mumbling to himself
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Idiot!
<P></P>He walks up to Miranda
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> (smirking) Nice. Remind me to try that on my ex-boyfriend 
the next time I see him.
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (chuckles) You've never had an ex-boyfriend. Come to think 
of it, you've never had a <I>boyfriend</I>.
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> Touché dear brother
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> I might have been too hard on him. I guess we're not meant 
to understand American Football.
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> Then again, They probably wouldn't understand cricket if 
we tried to explain it to them.
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (Just looks at her) Neither would we.
<P></P>Miranda concedes the point
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> True.
<P></P>Darren smirks
<P></P><B>Scene VII:</B> The theatre
<P></P>Daria and Damien enter. A little bit later, Keven staggers in looking 
shaken. He looks fine, except for the fact that he now has a big, red circle and 
the "Adidas" logo imprinted on his forehead. Daria looks somewhat curiously at 
Kevin, then she turns to Darren
<P></P><B>Music:</B> Deep Deep Down by (?)
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> What happened?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Well, it went something like this.
<P></P><B>Begin Flashback</B>
<P></P>Kevin and Mack were sitting in gym class. Kevin was rather disgusted with 
the unit that the teacher had planned
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> Aw Man! We're playing <I>soccer</I>?!
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> Well, Coach says that we should be getting into other 
sports.
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> (exasperated) C'Mon Mack Daddy. We should be playing 
football. After all, it <I>is</I> the most popular sport out there.
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> (Under his breath) Even though the rest of the world plays a 
different football.
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> (Seeming to completely forget his arguement with Darren) 
Um...what do <I>they</I> call it?
<P></P>Mack rolled his eyes
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> Nevermind. Look, just give it a try.
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> O.K., but I <I>have</I> to be the QB.
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> (annoyed) Kevin, there is no QB in soccer.
<P></P>Kevin tried to let that fact sink in
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> (dejected) Aww Man! How can anyone play a sport without a 
QB?
<P></P>Mack pointed to the Brothers Kinsington, who were playing a rather heated 
game of "Hackey Sack" with a soccer ball
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> Well, they don't seem to have a problem with it.
<P></P>Darren used his knee to pass the ball to Damien. Damien then bounced the 
ball on both knees, on his right elbow, then he bounced it off of his forehead 
before catching it in his hands. Kevin looked impressed
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> Whoa! (Calls out) Hey dude. Let me try that.
<P></P>Damien looked at Kevin, who was flaging him down. Mack walks over to the 
brothers
<P></P><B>Damien:</B> (To Darren) Is he talking to me?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> I don't know. I think so.
<P></P>They both looked at Kevin
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> He wants to try to bounce the ball off his head.
<P></P>Kevin squats and puts his hands on his knees. Like he's ready to wrestle
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> Yeah! C'mon! I'm ready!
<P></P><B>Damien:</B> (To Darren) You really think I should?
<P></P>Darren winced, uncertain
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (signing and speaking) If you want to, go light. As 
annoying as he is, I don't think you want to kill him.
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> Is that really a problem?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Kinda. Damien is pretty powerful. 
<P></P>Everything was ready. Darren placed the ball on the ground. Kevin 
narrowed his eyes, as did Damien. The other students in the class gathered 
around the two. Damien came up to the ball and kicked it. The ball sailed 
through the air. Its target (Kevin) made contact...and promptly fell over 
backwards. The rest of the football team rushed over to help their teammate. 
Mack, Damien, and Darren just looked at the scene
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> (V.O. from present) So, our star quarterback found out that 
it's not as easy as it looks.
<P></P>CUT TO: Present. Darren shakes his head
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Oh, no. If you don't know what you're doing, it's like 
trying to head a bowling ball.
<P></P>O'Neill walks up
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> Um...Guys. We're about ready to start.
<P></P><B>Later That Day</B>
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> Well. A little change of pace today. I decide that we 
should get a feel for how the play should be done. So we're gonna watch a tape 
of one of the versions of <I>Othello.</I>
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> Because everyone knows that you can't simply do your own 
version, you have to take some ideas from other places.
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Hey, That's the way the world works.
<P></P><B>Later on...</B>
<P></P>The entire cast is watching the video. Camera moves down the line. Daria 
and Darren look bored. Damien looks vaguely interested. O'Neill is rather 
excitedly writing down scene ideas directly from the movie, and Kolinski looks 
at him, somewhat condecendingly. (sp?)
<P></P><B>Commercial Break</B>
<P></P><B>Scene VIII</B> A couple Days Later
<P></P>Daria and Jane are walking to school. Daria is relating the events of 
rehearsal so far
<P></P><B>Music:</B> "(sic)" by Slipknot
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> So then Kevin started to spit his pepsi at Darren.
<P></P><B>Jane:</B> So, he's finally learning the correct way to treat the 
understudies? How did Darren take it.
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> Rather well, actually. He waited until after he finished 
rehearsing before saying anything.
<P></P><B>Jane:</B> Wow, you think he's softening a bit?
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> Maybe. (beat) So anyway, After the blocking, O'Neill had us 
do some "Trust Building" exercises. It's self-esteem class all over again.
<P></P><B>Jane:</B> And thank god I'm not directly involved in this.
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> Don't start.
<P></P><B>Jane:</B> So, what's planned for today?
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> More of the same, probably.
<P></P><B>Jane:</B> Well, if all else fails. Remember. You know where they keep 
the power tools.
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> Don't tempt me.
<P></P><B>Scene IX:</B> The Theatre
<P></P>The Cast (minus Quinn, again) is standing around. O'Neill and Kolinski 
are standing centre stage
<P></P><B>Music:</B> "The Animal Song" by Savage Garden
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> Now. Since the essence of cast unity is trust, I thought 
we'd go into more exercises to better develop that trust. So, I want everyone to 
get into pairs for this.
<P></P>Everyone gets into pairs. Darren and Kevin, Damien and Mack, Daria and 
Miranda. Miranda has a "Why do <I>I</I> have to do this" look on her face
<P></P><B>O'Neill:</B> Then, I want you to close your eyes, say "I trust you 
completely", cross your arms, then fall back into the other person. And the 
other person will catch you and show you ultimate trust.
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Strange, I thought "ultimate trust" would be much deeper.
<P></P>Mack smirks, then gets into position
<P></P><B>Mack:</B> I know you can't hear me, But I want you to know that I 
trust you completely.
<P></P>He leans back and is caught by Damien. So far so good
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> (Completely deadpan) I trust you.
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> (faux offended) Oh, c'mon. At least say it like you mean 
it?
<P></P>Daria falls back.
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> (half-heartedly) I trust you.
<P></P>Kevin gets ready and Darren leans back. As Darren is falling, we hear 
Jamie offscreen
<P></P><B>Jamie:</B> Hey Kevin, Check this out
<P></P>Kevin looks offscreen
<P></P><B>Kevin:</B> Whoa! Cool
<P></P>Kevin goes offcamera, forgetting that Darren is still falling. Darren 
hits the ground with a loud smack.
<P></P><B>CUT TO:</B> Miranda
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> Um...Kevin? Run!
<P></P>Kolinski frowns at Kevin. Enter Quinn (finally)
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> (deadpan) So, she finally decides to come into work today.
<P></P><B>Quinn:</B> God, Daria. Don't you know <I>anything</I>?! I wouldn't be 
caught <I>dead</I> in some job!
<P></P><B>Kolinski:</B> (Sternly, To Quinn) Where the hell have you been the 
last week?
<P></P><B>Quinn:</B> Well, first Sandi made this presentation about baby-tee's 
going out of style, since <I>everyone</I> seems to be wearing them now, then she 
started looking at <I>me</I>, then...
<P></P><B>Kolinski:</B> (Irritated) I mean, Why haven't you been to rehearsal 
lately?
<P></P><B>Quinn:</B> That's what I've been trying to <I>tell</I> you, duh!
<P></P><B>Kolinski:</B> Quinn, I'm not bullshiting around about this. Do you 
want to get cut? 'Cause I <I>will</I> do it if I have to.
<P></P><B>Quinn:</B> You can't cut me, I'm the <I>star!</I>
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> Even though the play is called "Othello"
<P></P><B>Kolinski:</B> Quinn, When is your first line?
<P></P>Quinn tries to think. Kolinski winces
<P></P><B>Kolinski:</B> Quinn, <I>What</I> is your first line?
<P></P><B>Quinn:</B> Well, you can't expect me to remember <I>everything.</I>
<P></P><B>Kolinski:</B> (Under her breath) Yes, I can. (out loud) Quinn, I have 
a show to run, and I can't do it if some of the actors just don't feel like 
showing up. By signing up for this, you should have an obligation to at least 
<I>try</I> to make it.
<P></P><B>Quinn:</B> Well, <I>You</I> would probably expect me to be here, but 
you're not as popular as I am. We're very busy.
<P></P><B>Kolinski:</B> (In an "I'm not buying it" face) How?
<P></P><B>Quinn:</B> Well, first I had to try to figure out how to accessorize 
my new pumps that I got for my date Thursday when the only thing I have that 
will go with them is the purse I used on my date Wednesday of course I could 
just forget the purse and where my new blazer top with the cute frill but it 
doesn't really go with the shoes I could wear and they don't really match Carls' 
eyes anyway... (Authors note: Thanks Renfield)
<P></P><B>Kolinski:</B> (Wincing) Quinn. I only cut people as a last resort. I 
haven't given up on you yet.
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> Give her time, Diane.
<P></P><B>Kolinski:</B> All I'm asking is that you come at least a <I>little</I> 
prepared. Now, Can you promise me that you'll at <I>least</I> try to make it 
tomorrow night?
<P></P><B>Quinn:</B> I can't. I'm going out with Matt.
<P></P>Kolinski glares at her
<P></P><B>Quinn:</B> What? Have you <I>seen</I> the size of his house?!
<P></P>Kolinski buries her face in her hands and groans
<P></P><B>Kolinski:</B> Quinn, Don't make me give up on you. At least <I>try</I> 
to be a bit more enthusiastic about this.
<P></P><B>Quinn:</B> (flippant) Whatever.
<P></P>She leaves. Kolinski glares at her.
<P></P><B>Kolinski:</B> Alright, That's it. I've had enough of this. (To the 
rest of the cast) Who's her understudy?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Lynne Giles, but she quit last week.
<P></P><B>Kolinski:</B> Really? (muttering) shit. (To the rest of the cast) Is 
there <I>anyone</I> who can play Desdemona?!
<P></P>The cast sits there, blank faced. Finally, Damien raises his hand
<P></P><B>Damien:</B> Well, What about that one girl who was auditioning with 
Quinn. I mean, I didn't get to <I>hear</I> her, but her facial expressions alone 
would be enough, I think.
<P></P><B>Miranda:</B> Oh, yeah. I remember that. She <I>really</I> had the 
acting down too. I think she'd be perfect.
<P></P><B>Kolinski:</B> Do you know where she is?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> I think she's making up a test for DeMartino.
<P></P><B>Kolinski:</B> Find her. I don't care what it takes, find her.
<P></P>Darren, Damien, and Miranda nod and exit. Daria turns to Jane, who's 
sitting beside her.
<P></P><B>Daria:</B> What were they talking about?
<P></P><B>CUT TO:</B> Stacy, who is sitting, alone, at her locker. Darren's and 
Damien's bodies enter the shot, between Stacy
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> Hey, Stacy?
<P></P><B>Stacy:</B> (Scared) Um...yeah?
<P></P><B>Darren:</B> We need you to do us a <I>huge</I> favour.
<P></P><B>CUT TO:</B> EXT: Lawndale High. Stacy screams
<P></P><B>Fade out</B> to a black screen. White writing reads...

<P></P><BR><BR>FINALLY! IT'S DONE! This one seemed to take forever (Well, four 
and a half months anyway
<P></P>Anyway. Here are the...
<P></P><B>ENDNOTES:</B>
<P></P><I><U>The Opening Sequence:</U></I> You may notice that these are 
slightly modified from the teasers for "Why Don't You Get A Job." I came up with 
a few more ideas for future stories (Most of them non-othello related)
<P></P><I><U>Stacy's Dream:</U></I> I got the idea for this from the old Fashion 
Club site at MTV's old Daria site. Appearantly, Stacy has this reoccuring 
nightmare of Sandi chasing her with a bloody chainsaw. This is my interpretation 
of how the dream might have happened
<P></P><U><I>Music: "Crash (Into Me)" by The Gufs (You've probably never heard 
of them)</I></U> The Gufs are a band from Milwaukee. They're sort of like 
Matchbox Twenty, but the Gufs have been around longer. <A 
href="http://www.uwm.edu/~bpoulsen/">Click Here</A> for more information
<P></P><I><U>Quinn Oh c'mon Tiffany. If I had a loser brother or sister, 
(immediately corrects) and I'm not saying I do,The last thing I'd do is admit 
it!:</I></U> Just for those who don't know. Quinn would rather die than admit 
that She and Daria are related. Quinn usually passes Daria off as her "cousin, 
or whatever"
<P></P><I><U>Mack: I don't understand it, From what I heard, she was pretty good 
last time:</U></I> By "last time" I'm refering to the Canterbury Tales from the 
episode "Fair Enough" where Quinn was the ingenue (female lead) One of the 
initial problems with writing this fic was that she <I>was</I> pretty good in 
terms of practicing and memorizing and such, but her being bad was sort of 
crucial to my series. Oh well
<P></P><U><I>Darren: Ea, mu prakao levi po kintaa na le nerfucdei.("I suggest 
that we continue this conversation tomorrow"):</I></U> Now, I <I>know</I> you're 
asking "What language is that?" It's a language called <A 
href="http://www.loglan.org/">Loglan</A> which was a language constructed in the 
fifties in order to test something called the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which 
states that the boundries of a language determine the intellectual capibilities 
of the native speakers. In this case, it was just obsure enough to be diffucult 
to translate. Basically, Darren is just trying to push Ms. Li's buttons
<P></P><I><U>We see Darren, who was standing behind her, watching the whole 
thing. He gets a "You really don't get it, do you?" face.:</I></U> One of my 
initial beta readers was wondering about that. Basically, Darren's just saying 
"How does someone <I>that</I> paranoid get to be put in charge of a high 
school?"
<P></P><I><U>O'Neill is sitting on his desk, looking into a hand 
mirror.:</U></I> O'Neill usually does this, in order to "practice" a 
conversation before trying to engage the actual person. It's kind of funny to 
watch, actually
<P></P><I><U>Diane Kolinksi:</I></U> based on a melange of the various drama 
teachers I've had in my life. In particular, she's based on a guy named Ron 
Parker, who directed this version of Othello that I was in. Kolinski will be the 
last new character that I'll introduce for a major role. I promise (The only 
other characters I'll introduce are Damien's old partner in crime, and most of 
the rest of the Kinsington family)
<P></P><I><U>Kolinski: (dead serious) Guys, listen to him!</U></I> In my 
opinion, O'Neill is actually not that incompetant a director. He only might seem 
that way because he seems to have very little ability to inspire (or, for that 
matter, control) his students. I'll reveal O'Neill's competence later on in the 
series
<P></P><U><I>The Football vs Soccer arguement</I></U> The idea for this exchange 
was written mostly by Steven Galloway (To which I would like to extend a big 
THANK YOU!) I changed the wording a bit, though
<P></P><U><I>Music: Deep Deep Down by (?)</U></I> I heard this song on an 
internet broadcast from England. I don't know who sings it, though Anyone know?
<P></P><U><I>Darren: Oh, no. If you don't know what you're doing, it's like 
trying to head a bowling ball.</I></U> That's actually very true.
<P></P><I><U>Music: "The Animal Song" by Savage Garden:</U></I> Just to clarify 
for the last time, (since my beta readers pointed seemed to express their dismay 
at my inclusion of this song) <I>I CHOSE THAT SONG BECAUSE, IN MY MIND, IT FIT 
THE SCENE! I AM <B>NOT</B> A BIG FAN OF SAVAGE GARDEN!!!!</I>
<P></P>Thank you for your time
<P></P><I><U>The "Trust Building" excersizes</I></U> Did anyone else have to do 
this kind of thing in theatre class? I remember having to do the one where the 
rest of the group tries to lift you over the head. (They almost dropped me too)
<P></P><I><U>Daria: (deadpan) So, she finally decides to come into work 
today</I></U> This is the opening line to the musical "Little Shop Of Horrors" 
So I guess you could call this a reference
<P></P><U><I>Quinn: Well, First Sandi Made this presentation about baby-tee's 
going out of style, since everyone seems to be wearing them now, then She 
started looking at me, then...</U></I> Quinn used to wear a baby tee in the 
first through third season of Daria. And I figured Sandi would use ANY excuse to 
crucify Quinn for whatever reason
<P></P><I><U>Kolinski: Quinn, When is your first line?</I></U> In case you were 
wondering, Desdemona first appears in Act I Scene III
<P></P><I><U>Quinn: What? Have you seen the size of his house?!</I></U> Hey, she 
postponed a babysitting job to go out with Skylar Feldman because his parents 
had a boat (and she didn't want to spend the summer on some public beach
<P></P><I><U>Stacy as Desdemona:</I></U> Alright, I <I>know</I> that this is 
cliché, but the reason for picking Stacy had nothing to do with pity for her. 
The main reason is that (in my mind, anyway) She is just perfect for the role. I 
promise, I'll try to stay away from the "standard" Stacy leaves the fashion club 
plot. (You know, the one where Daria and Jane just sit her down, talk to her for 
a couple hours, and suddenly, she's deprogrammed)
