OPENING CREDITS<br>
<br>
(Stay Hungry by Twisted Sister)<br>
<br>
Are you feeling the fire, are you ready to explode?<br>
Are your dreams and desires riding down an open road?<br>
I'm like a runaway, a heart without a home<br>
Others can laugh and play<br>
I'll fight for every inch I take, I'm desperate to the bone<br>
<br>
Stay hungry, feel the fire<br>
Stay hungry, don't explode<br>
Stay hungry, with desire<br>
Stay hungry, you're alone<br>
-----------------------------<br>
SCENE ONE: LINK'S BEDROOM<br>
<br>
(Link is typing on his computer journal.)<br>
<br>
LINK (V.O.): It's Friday night, and for some reason, I feel like something strange is going to happen. Well, it's 10:41 PM, and I'm feeling tired, so I'll bid you adieu.<br>
<br>
(He turns it off and switches his lamp off then crawls into bed. Suddenly an apparition of Daria floats above his head. This Daria has chains around her.)<br>
<br>
DARIA GHOST: Liiiiinnnnk... Liiiiinnnnk...<br>
<br>
LINK: Daria?<br>
<br>
DARIA GHOST: Good, I've got your attention, now let's cut the ghost crap.<br>
<br>
LINK: What are you doing here?<br>
<br>
DARIA GHOST: I have to tell you that three spirits, strange ones, I might add, are going to visit you tonight.<br>
<br>
LINK: Why? What did I do?<br>
<br>
DARIA GHOST: Apart from pelting a boy with a pillow filled with rocks and locking two people in a wine cellar, not a hell of a much. Well, I gotta go rattle my chains somewhere else. Pleasant dreams.<br>
<br>
LINK: Yep. See ya.<br>
<br>
(Daria bumps into the wall.)<br>
<br>
DARIA GHOST: Could you turn the lamp on? I can't see where I'm going.<br>
<br>
(He does and she floats through the door. Link turns the light back off and goes to sleep.)<br>
<br>
GUY FAWKES DAY: Right, lad, wake up!<br>
<br>
(Link wakes with a start.)<br>
<br>
LINK: Who the hell are you?<br>
<br>
GUY FAWKES DAY: I'm Guy Fawkes Day, one of those spirits that brainy girl told you would come during the night. In other words, I'm also known as The Ghost Of Christmas Past.<br>
<br>
LINK: I already know what happened two years ago.<br>
<br>
GUY FAWKES DAY: Hey, us spirits have to be watchin' you lot, so it's not my fault we caught you getting drunk on eggnog. I want to take you back ten years ago.<br>
<br>
LINK: When I was a baby?<br>
<br>
GUY FAWKES DAY: Yeah. Get ready, 'cause it's a weird ride.<br>
<br>
(A flash fills the room. Link finds himself lying on the floor in the same room.)<br>
<br>
LINK: This is my room.<br>
<br>
(Across the room, a baby's crib is against the wall.)<br>
<br>
LINK: My crib!<br>
<br>
(Link's real father walks in with a baby Link. His father looks like an adult Link.)<br>
<br>
MICHAEL: Goodnight, baby Link. Pleasant dreams and when you wake up, you'll have heaps of new toys to play with!<br>
<br>
BABY LINK: Daddy.<br>
<br>
(Michael smiles gently, then walks out.)<br>
<br>
LINK: That's not my father. My father was a mean, manipulative man.<br>
<br>
GUY FAWKES DAY: That's all a load of bollocks. Your father was a decent, loving man who misses you very much. You only thought he was a jerk 'cause you're totally screwed up, just like that Daria chick.<br>
<br>
LINK: Speak for yourself. What is Guy Fawkes Day, anyway?<br>
<br>
GUY FAWKES DAY: You oughta know. You're a brain. I stand for free pies. Free pies for everyone.<br>
<br>
LINK: No thanks. You know, you look a lot like that Sid Vicious guy.<br>
<br>
GUY FAWKES DAY: You think? 'Cause that's the look I've been going for. Anyway, back to bed with you.<br>
<br>
(He claps twice and Link wakes up back in his own bed.)<br>
<br>
LINK: Crazy dream. But there was a message in it...<br>
<br>
GUY FAWKES DAY: Yeah, you're screwed up.<br>
<br>
CHRISTMAS: Are you still here?<br>
<br>
GUY FAWKES DAY: What do you think?<br>
<br>
CHRISTMAS: Get back to holiday island.<br>
<br>
(Guy Fawkes Day disappears.)<br>
<br>
CHRISTMAS: Anyway, down to business. I am Christmas, but I like to be called X, short for-<br>
<br>
LINK: X-mas.<br>
<br>
CHRISTMAS: My, aren't we the perceptive one. Anyway, I'm going to take you to see your friend Daria and her family.<br>
<br>
LINK: Alright-ee.<br>
<br>
(Christmas clicks his fingers.)<br>
<br>
SCENE TWO: THE MORGENDORFFER LIVING ROOM<br>
<br>
(Link and Christmas appear.)<br>
<br>
JAKE: Ah, beautiful egg-nog.<br>
<br>
CHRISTMAS: Sound familiar?<br>
<br>
LINK: Oh, shut up.<br>
<br>
HELEN: Quinn, where's Daria?<br>
<br>
QUINN: How should I know? I'm not... someone who knows... everything.<br>
<br>
SCENE THREE: DARIA'S ROOM<br>
<br>
(Daria is lying on her bed, holding a mistletoe over her head.)<br>
<br>
LINK: What's the matter with her? I thought she had a boyfriend.<br>
<br>
CHRISTMAS: She does, but he's out of town and she's lonely.<br>
<br>
LINK: Wait, it's not Christmas for another three months. This can't be happening now.<br>
<br>
CHRISTMAS: This happens in three months.<br>
<br>
LINK: Really? Wow. If this is a dream, I'm developing some weird powers. I could wreak havoc on everyone... everyone...<br>
<br>
CHRISTMAS: No, this isn't a dream, and no, you don't have any powers. As if God would bestow powers on a eleven year old boy.<br>
<br>
LINK: Damn. Hey, do I get to meet God?<br>
<br>
CHRISTMAS: Yeah.<br>
<br>
LINK: Cool.<br>
<br>
CHRISTMAS: In about another eighty years.<br>
<br>
LINK: Oh... you have taken all of the excitement from my life. Now I know that I'll die at ninety one.<br>
<br>
CHRISTMAS: Eighty years, give or take.<br>
<br>
LINK: Thank you. So what is the point of this dream?<br>
<br>
CHRISTMAS: For the last time, it's not a dream, and you've been a very naughty boy as of recent times.<br>
<br>
LINK: You don't have to remind me.<br>
<br>
CHRISTMAS: It's what Daria critics call a filler episode.<br>
<br>
LINK: Okay, and I suppose that since this is a spinoff, we have to have filler episodes as well?<br>
<br>
CHRISTMAS: Yes, but they come a lot sooner.<br>
<br>
LINK: What's in the future for me?<br>
<br>
CHRISTMAS: I can't tell you that, it'd take all of the surprise out of the remaining seasons.<br>
<br>
LINK: Right.<br>
<br>
CHRISTMAS: See you later.<br>
<br>
LINK: Wait, how is Daria important in this episode?<br>
<br>
CHRISTMAS: This is a spinoff, so she has to have an appearance every now and then.<br>
<br>
LINK: But she's already had an appearance.<br>
<br>
CHRISTMAS: Well, it's basically time filler. Now, enough of the boring conversations and off to bed.<br>
<br>
(He claps his hands and Link wakes up in his bed.)<br>
<br>
SCENE FOUR: LINK'S ROOM<br>
<br>
(Link drops into his bed.)<br>
<br>
LINK: This proves it wasn't a dream.<br>
<br>
HALLOWEEN: Oh yeah. It isn't a dream.<br>
<br>
LINK: Let me guess. The Ghost of Christmas Future.<br>
<br>
HALLOWEEN: Uh... yes and no. Halloween. Pleased to make your aquaintance. Come with me.<br>
<br>
SCENE FIVE: A HIGHWAY<br>
<br>
(She clicks her fingers and they appear in front of a sign. We are looking at them from behind the sign, so we can't see what the sign says.)<br>
<br>
LINK: No way! Cool. I'm moving? When?<br>
<br>
HALLOWEEN: Soon. Just wait - some things are worth waiting for.<br>
<br>
LINK: Can I see my house?<br>
<br>
HALLOWEEN: No.<br>
<br>
(She clicks her fingers and they disappear. The camera moves around to look at the sign, which says... WELCOME TO LAWNDALE.)<br>
<br>
SCENE SIX: LINK'S ROOM<br>
<br>
(They appear in his room.)<br>
<br>
LINK: That one was awfully quick!<br>
<br>
HALLOWEEN: Well, what do you expect? We're working on a tight budget here.<br>
<br>
(She disappears.)<br>
<br>
LINK: Yeah, bye then.<br>
<br>
(Link turns to the camera.)<br>
<br>
LINK: Tonight was strange. I've learned that Christmas is about sharing and spending time with your family no matter how stupid they may be.<br>
<br>
SCENE SEVEN: LINK'S ROOM<br>
<br>
(Link sits up in bed and rubs his head. He opens the blinds and it is sunny outside, nowhere near like Christmas.)<br>
<br>
LINK: It's not Christmas? It's not Christmas!<br>
<br>
(He runs out to the front yard where Wind is watering the lawn.)<br>
<br>
LINK: You there, Wind! What day is it today?<br>
<br>
WIND: Why, it's Saturday, Link.<br>
<br>
LINK: Saturday!<br>
<br>
(Link spins around happily in the sun and Wind just stares. Roll end credits.)<br>
