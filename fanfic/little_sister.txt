 The End.

Authors notes:

O.K as we can see this is a ripoff of the Simpsons when Lisa was 
born. Some of the things that we're taken from the Simpsons we're 
the skating off baby, the wall coloring, the corners, the about 
to runaway, and the name of the brothers. Also if you notice In 
the Simpsons version Lisa calls her dad Homer like Bart. In  this one Jane calls her mom Amanda.
Well that's all I have now till next time.
Oh and I also know that a lot of these words were mispelled, but 
I figure that's how little kids talk.
