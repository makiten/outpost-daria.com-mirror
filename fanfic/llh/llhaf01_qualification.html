<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Tiffany felt
herself sway a little as she struggled to maintain her balance. The now foul
bag over her head meant she couldn't see anything that could help her maintain
her position, she was entirely dependant on her sense of equilibrium, and that
was almost non-existent thanks to unknown hours of sleep deprivation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"WHAT WERE YOU
DOING?" screamed the asshole next to her. She was just about beyond flinching
when his voice nailed her ears like that. She had even gotten used to them
discharging guns next to her ears, and these weren't blanks they were firing.
Everythign going on around her reminded her how vulnerable she was at this
point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>The Mk. 40 compliance
band on her wrist meant that if she didn't want her captors to REALLY kick the
shit out of her, she had to stand and not move when they hit, caned, whipped,
drenched, or electrocuted her anyway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>The stick struck
the back of her thighs again, but again, she was beyond flinching. They had her
standing with her knees slightly bent, and her legs were burning from the
constant tension her muscles had to maintain. Her shoulders and outstretched
arms were also burning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>She was interrupted

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"GET UP!" He was
now kicking her arms and legs, "GET UP! WHO TOLD YOU TO CHANGE POSITION! GET UP
NOW!" Tiffany scrambled to get back into position again. The movement reawakened
her limbs, but now everything was hurting more fiercely than just five seconds
ago, and she again felt the urge to tell them what they were telling her to
admit: That she and her companions were a team sent in to destroy an arms
shipment, that the US had unofficially sanctioned this. "YOU WILL STAY RIGHT
THERE UNTILL I TELL YOU TO MOVE!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Tiffany didn't

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>There was a way
for her to avoid the other stuff too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Tell them what she
was doing sneaking around within ten klicks of that explosion that happened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>This boat load of
shoulder SAMs and RPG 7s had been blown up along with the truck of mines, more
RPG 7s, 7.62mm rounds, and the enemy fuel dump. They had to do this by manually
placing charges.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Boat was easy,
just swim under it and stick the charge to it. This was a number of sheets of
explosives, adhesive backed with an adhesive that would function while wet, The
person setting these charges had then uncoiled the det-chord they were using to
fuse the charges and tied that together with wire ties to a detonator which had
been rigged to a delay element, bit more C-4 around that part to ensure the
chord would properly initiate, the delay element had a pin-pull ignitor which a
team mate of hers then pulled before he swam away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>The truck and the
fuel dump were on land and where being guarded by twelve X-rays.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>They had
anticipated the possibility that they couldn't get right up under the truck and
fuel dump and had rigged charges that could be effective from a distance. If
they could get the charge under the vehicle, super-duper-excellent, but if they
couldn't, then they had to be able to position it at a distance and point it at
the target and it would have to be effective against the target.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>They had
considered having Tiffany simply phase through the soil, but the truck's
underside was too high off the ground for the charge to go unnoticed, and
merging explosives with soil would have had unknown effects on the explosives
and the copper plate, they wanted to detonate the munitions on the truck so
that they absolutely could not be used. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>They amended it so
that Tiffany would do all the land charges, she would leave the charges on the
surface and dig out soil for any devices that needed to be in the ground, but
Tiffany could simply float through the ground with just enough of her head for
her to see where she was going protruding, she then places the charges on the
surface, and moves back, uncoiling the det-chord as she moved back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>This was achieved
with an 8mm copper plate backed with cast H6 and a hole drilled through both
the plate and the charge, that served as a sight to help aim the charge and it
received the detonator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>You get as close
as possible, position the charge, using the local top soil to support one side,
then you insert the detonator and move back, uncoiling det-chord as you go. In
this case the delay element and detonator has been pre-assembled, it was long
enough to reach the river, pull the ignitor at the appropriate time, and get
out of there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>The plate would
form an appropriately sized and speedy projectile that would detonate any
explosive material in it's path, so all they had to do was aim roughly at the
centre of the truck's cargo space. The fuel dump might be gasoline, diesel,
jet-A, so they couldn't guarantee ignition if they didn't accompany the
projectiles with an ignition source.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Five claymore
mines, off the shelf, rigged together along with the ignitor system, claymores
turn the fuel containers into colanders, ignitor was a Pringles tube full of
thermite with a lump of C4 at the bottom with a detonator, but det-chord would
destroy the thermite ignitor, so they instead rigged a small shaped charge and
simply used the copper jet to ignite the thermite by means of friction.
Thermite took up most of the tube, C4 took up the last 15mm, thing was buried
in the ground so it would keep it's shape as the thermite burned, detonator
initiates the C4 and throws the molten iron over the fuel puddle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>They aimed to get
the charges to initiate within five seconds of each other. That simply meant
having someone next to the boat waiting to pull the pin on that charge. If
Tiffany had been compromised, the other two operatives across the river would
provide covering fire as the other two ignited the delay elements on the
charges they had planted and left. Bit of luck, they could hold the enemy's
attention long enough for the delay elements to burn up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>They then all
ignited the delay elements and left.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Exfil had been
going all right, they found a vehicle, hotwired it, and were well on their way
out, until all these enemy soldiers popped up out of nowhere.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>One fired a
flash-bang into the car from a grenade launcher attachment on their assault
rifle, and the rest moved in while they were blind and deaf, and then the last
thing Tiffany remembered was this powerful white hot pain in her neck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>When she awoke,
she was face down in the back of a truck, hands and feet tied, bag over her
head, headphones piping white noise at ear piercing volume, and this Mk. 40 compliance
band on her wrist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>All this
information told her that their worst case scenario had occurred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Once the truck had
arrived at ... wherever ... They had been pulled to their feet by the bag over
their head being used as a choke ligature and pulled off the back of the truck,
they were barely standing as their feet were still tied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>She assumed they
were all going through this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>They had been
captured ... ...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>It had been ... ...</span></p>

been?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Tiffany needed to
get some sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>'Damn it!' Tiffany
lowered her hands and extended her feet straight back, her arms slightly bent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>They usually kicked
her in the crotch and her sides when she was in this position.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Sometimes they
removed her hood and placed a plate of ravioli with a couple of slices of
garlic bread and an ice cold glass of ultra-cola about a foot ahead of her. The
food varied, but it was usually something delicious with a refreshing, thirst
quenching drink, and she could have it if she just admitted what they were
doing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Other times they
molested her, telling her that as long as they kept their secrets, they would
not be considered prisoners of war, this would not be considered a war crime,
they would simply be considered criminals with no right to any more protection
than a citizen of the country they had invaded. That was obviously bullshit,
they were just as bad on POWs as they were on their own citizens.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>And there was no

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>She scrambled to

seconds after she had stood up, the hood came off, and Master Chief Keller
stood before her, the guy who was probably interrogating her stood off to the

followed the interrogator, a third class petty officer, out. The ambient light
almost blinded her, and she was not familiar with this location, but she was
eventually led to a dormitory with a communal shower in the back. The rest of
her team were already in there getting cleaned up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>USAES had been
exciting and had really helped her. The Legion had also been good, and she was
still a Legionnaire, but she also felt that a military career would give her a
sense of routine. But she started to tire of routine, and decided she wanted to
try something a bit less routine. In fact, she wanted something that more
closely resembled superhero work, she had superpowers for Christ sake, and she
was sweeping decks and collecting spent brass from the chaingun stations and
firing range. She wanted something that would test her. It still wasn't public
knowledge that the US Navy allowed women to apply to become SEALs, and that was
because they wanted to be able to disguise their teams as ordinary civilians.
They wanted to be unexpected. There had been a number of decades where they
weren't, but eventually someone used to the idea of women being equally capable
as men got in a position to change that and the change was made.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>She recalled her
half decade long path from being a USAES cadet to her new posting in the SEALs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>She had taken
interest in explosives after she had made contact with Quinn while on leave
from USAES. Quinn had taken this explosives course that this retired(?) SBS
operative was running back at Legion Tower.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>A man named
'Betty'. SBS, Special Boat Service, were basically Navy SEALS, only British.
Special warfare usually consisted of sneaking around behind enemy lines,
killing, capturing or rescuing people as ordered or blowing things up as
ordered, so this guy would really know his explosives.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>The course had
been comprehensive. Within six months of her enlistment, Tiffany took a Navy
demolitions course and had found it equally fascinating. She had to take it
twice, along with the extended firearms courses, but eventually she felt ready
to go for the SEAL course.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>She opened the
other box in her possession. The one containing her Legion badge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Her commanders had
always expressed concern over her dual loyalty, she was loyal to both the
Legion and the United States of America DOD.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>She had always
maintained that the Legion was good for humanity and that included the United States, there was no split.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>The USAES and the
Legion were in close co-operation anyway, and had remained so all this time.
Tiffany had another reason for joining the Navy: She felt it would improve
relations between USAES and the Legion, closer co-operation improved Legion
procedures, tactics, and procurement strategy. Besides, USAES had helped her so
much, it seemed only fair. Both Daria and Armalin had warned her against doing
this out of gratitude, although for different reasons: Armalin, being a Marine,
valued absolute loyalty: If you're not 200% committed to serving your country,
don't pledge to that effect. Semper Fidelis. And Daria was concerned Tiffany
could find herself being ordered to do something wrong and Tiffany would have
to do it and get jailed for war crimes or not do it and get jailed for
disobedience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Then the two of
them promptly got into an argument about the integrity of military courts and
the JAG corps.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>She couldn't wear
the Legion badge on her uniform, but she was damn proud she now had the right
to wear the SEAL badge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>She also
remembered her conversations with Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Daria did not
trust the US DOD. Tiffany had felt a bit apprehensive as a result of this. That
encounter with General Bakerson hadn't have helped. It certainly didn't impress
Tiffany. But her time at USAES told her idiots such as Bakerson didn't take up
the entire military. Aside from that, she was going to encounter people who
didn't like her or thought she was stupid everywhere she went.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>She was building a
substantial amount of evidence that she was not as stupid as she sounded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Daria had
acknowledged she wasn't as stupid as she sounded just before she first left for
the USAES. Pity Daria didn't need to know she was a SEAL.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>She closed both
boxes and placed them with the rest of her kit and went to sleep.</span></p>
