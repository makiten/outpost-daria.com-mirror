<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Same thing we

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"No sir. We
acquired the same intel they did, when Daria observed us in field and made
psychic contact, we co-ordinated and achieved our objectives," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"How did Daria
detect you?" asked the Admiral.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"I was
infiltrating the Hezbollah facility with the explosives when I saw the door
open and close behind me, when I pointed a gun at the person's location, she
de-cloaked and revealed herself to be Brittany, Brittany was in psychic contact
with Daria and Daria made contact with me, we quickly agreed that the Legion
would help the rest of my team divert Hezbollah attention from us while
Brittany and myself place our charges, I placed my charges where Brittany had
no access, later BDA indicated all our charges were effective. It also explains
why the rest of those superpower jammers went down after we only got three of
them."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"While it's
inescapable that I am working as a special forces operative, they have no means
to work out which organisation I am working for, and I have added no new
information they can use to narrow the range. Sir, I could be a mercenary for
all they know."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Eventually the
admiral said "Okay, fair enough. I have another assignment for you. You are
uniquely placed to be able to execute this one. We need you to ascertain and verify
the location of the soul crystal that contains Lou Cypher."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Sir? Any reason

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"No sir. One thing
to bear in mind is that Jane and Sandi have kept it's location secret in order
to reduce the number of people able to betray it's location as far as possible.
They're unlikely to tell me where they put it."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

reach a decision as to weather or not to move it, but we are certain that we
don't want our enemies to find it, so any information pertaining to our
decision and any action we decide to take will be highly compartmentalised, is
that understood?" asked the admiral.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Tiffany waited as
the Gridrunner landed at the airstrip, the lower halves of the ramjet cones
forward to reduce if not avoid the intake of FOD from poorly maintained
airstrips. She was back in her Legion clothes, her navy whites were back at
base, her bag had three sets of civilian attire and 12 changes of underwear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>The Gridrunner
slowed to taxiing speed and the starboard forward door opened while the
aircraft was still in motion, the aircraft turned right to bring it to the side
of the runway in preparation for it's about turn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Not waiting for
the aircraft to stop, Tiffany boarded, ascending the stairs as the aircraft
turned left. Jane hit the button to close the door and then hit the intercom
and said "Passenger aboard."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Okay," replied
Charles, "strap in, taking off as soon as I'm lined up."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Jane and Tiffany
strapped into the few seats that remained in place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Glancing back
before she sat down, Tiffany asked "new L1s?" There were two L1s along with
their folded wings and fins on special palettes. The reason they transported
fighters in this manner was to delay observation of the aircraft's modifications
at least until they were required on an operation and because the fighters
weren't as fast as the Gridrunner, so this was faster and less stressful on the
pilots. The palettes were designed that they could be towed in the Gridrunner's
slipstream on telescoping arms (any flex in the members securing the palettes
to the Gridrunner would oscillate) and thus launched and recovered in flight.
Gridrunner had to drop to mach 2 or less to do this, but that meant one
aircraft suddenly became three.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>This displaced
other payloads, including people, they often ended up fitting wherever they
could as the L1s were extended out the back on their palettes or retracted back
into the cargospace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Same ones, new
skin, they now have holographic LED clusters," said Jane as the engines spooled
to mil thrust, and they then felt the kick as the afterburners rasped into
life. They could have just done a vertical landing and take off, but dynamic
was preferred where available because it saves fuel as all the thrust goes into
building forward inertia.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Right," said
Tiffany. "Told Daria I'm inbound?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Nope, you can
tell her, preferably with a prank," said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Gotcha," said
Tiffany, "so who's prez and veep?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Brittany's

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"No," laughed
Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Always the
critic, never the example?" asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Performance
anxiety, by the ton," said Jane, "She lets me into her mind occasionally, if
she were in charge, she'd have to be on top of everything. She seems to like
the role of snagger too much to give that up. She has also evolved some of our
best plans on operations, she and Brittany have ended up working together to
generate a plan or have ended up ending opposing teams in war games."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"She still an
asshole?" asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Mmmmm .... She's

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"She helped us

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"It's Tiffany,

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Tiffany walked to

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>She still felt
nauseous, every time the aircraft changed direction her brain tried desperately

occasional buzz as they flew through a load of hailstones.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>They hadn't
emerged from the clouds since they had entered, although the size of the clouds
they had entered prevented that from being a surprise, this was a proper storm

their field of view.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Daria's groan

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Several minutes

awkward, she had learned tons from Daria but she couldn't share anything after

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>She knew from

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Tiffany could
imagine some means by which it could be disposed of and how the routes could
evade surveillance or investigation, and there were plenty of subduction zones
to drop it into, the crystal could basically be rendered inaccessible for the
next few thousand to billion years, depending on weather or not it would end up
being carried back to the surface by a volcanic eruption.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Daria eventually

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>The comms devices

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>She kept as
straight as possible, trying to get over Tiffany, hoping she would remain out
of everyone's field of view. Daria was on point, Jane and Tiffany formed in

towards a trail, but there were no roads in view.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Fran decided she

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>She lost sight of

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>She moved to fold
up her parachute and stuff it back into it's bag. She might need it later, but
she would have to lay it out, fold it and pack it properly before she could use
it again, or it would most likely tangle and defeat the purpose of her carrying
it in the first place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Brown Recluse is
the leader of some mercenaries my boss hired to help with capturing you, and
it's you, Tiffany, you know where the soul crystal is."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Jane looked

getting without looking back at them, said "okay, who's your boss?"</span></p>

It was at this point that Daria noticed a puff of grey smoke, barely visible,
on the opposite tree line, and she barely perceived the object coming at them
before it blew open in front of them, coating the entire area around the four
women in a heavy aerosol. &quot;Oh, damnit,&quot; Tiffany growled; to the
surprise of the other women, she stood up and held her arms so they hung limp,
yet away from her body. &quot;You've got about twenty seconds to get up and
stand exactly the way I am,&quot; she continued. &quot;Keep your mouths open -
trust me, it's worse if you don't!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We know,&quot; Daria said, her face falling. Seconds later, the four
women were unable to move as the confinement mist released into the air
coalesced and they felt their bodies being covered in a clear, adhesive fluid
with the consistency of syrup. <br>
<br>
Feeling an enforced calm due to the sedatives within the mist's formula, the
women barely perceived the arrival of four men and two women dressed in forest
digicam under leaf net capes, tooled to the gills as they went about capturing
the Legionnaires and freeing Fran.</span></p>

aghast when Armalin directed Charles to land on the impromptu airstrip, but
really, there was no mystery after the ejection, the now lobotomised airplane
had found somewhere to set down pending recovery. Gridrunners had three
settings for their residual autopilots, first was to land at the first safe
place it encounters, second was to land at a specific location, such as an
airbase or the LZ, they run out of defensive or decoy ammo, the flight crew
eject, and hopefully the enemy will assume they've done enough long enough for
the fuselage to get away, and the third setting was programmed by the weapons
management computer, you select kamikaze, point the reticule at whatever you
want the airplane to fly into, and eject, turning the aircraft into a kinetic
energy and incendiary (depending on how much fuel remains) weapon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Actually, it's a
Mk. 50. I have to use four because you can only wear one of these for nine
hours before it's irreparably screwed."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Okay, well, that
makes it sort of less funny," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Yeah, originally
it's just rogue and Nightcrawler, but when I co-opted Rogue, he had to find Dorian.
Now rogue stays well clear of me and goes after my minions instead while
Nightcrawler keeps Dorian right next to me, hence my current entourage. Of
course that means we're going to have to do things the old fashioned way, and
instead of getting my answer in seconds without causing physical injury, I'll
have to take hours taking you apart until you or someone here tells me where
the soul crystal is, so I can send someone to go and get it."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>After a few
seconds of no one responding, he dragged Daria over to a chain that was
dangling from the ceiling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>He then threaded
the chain through a ring apparently in the back of the collar and pulled it
through until the collar pulled up against Daria's trachea, forcing Daria to
stand on her toes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>She then heard a
click behind her head and Wyatt stepped in front of her, the tension in the
chain remaining.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>After watching her
for a few seconds, Wyatt turned to Fran with the shrinking powers and said
"Fran, you did well, I almost have the soul crystal," as he pulled a syringe
and a box out of his pocket. He handed her an antiseptic wipe and then pulled
an ampoule out of the box. The Ampoule held a light violet coloured liquid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>As Fran wiped a
spot on her neck with the wipe, he uncapped the needle on the syringe and broke
open the ampoule, he then loaded the syringe out of it and tapped the syringe
to de-gas the contends before he expelled the air.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>He then injected
the liquid into Fran's neck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>It took seconds
for the effect to become noticeable on Fran's disfigured face. She looked
beautiful now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>He pit the cap
back on the needle and removed it from the syringe, placing it and the empty
ampoule in her hands saying "would you mind disposing of this?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Not at all,
thanks," said Fran as she left.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>He then put
another needle, it's cap in place, on the syringe and put it back in his
pocket.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Sweet girl. Pity
about the car crash. She used to work for this William Appleton guy, and he
wanted to form an alliance with me, and when I said no, he made the mistake of
assuming he was negotiating from a position of strength. ... Silly man ...
Inherited her off of him, learned to synthesise the stuff he was giving her.
Some point I might be able to make the effects permanent," said Wyatt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"But not before
she outlives her utility value, right?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Really Daria,
that's not the way to motivate employees. I will make the effects permanent as
soon as I have the ability, and I am also paying her for her work. Now, how do
I motivate you and your friends to give me the soul crystal?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"You'd need to
prove that we can trust you not to misuse it. ... good luck," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Wyatt chuckled as
he stepped around Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>He whispered
something in a mercenary's ear, the mercenary nodded and left the room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Daria felt her
calves burn from the sustained force she was having to project, but she had to
stay on her toes to allow blood to flow through her head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"I know it was too
much to hope, but I would like to make this easy on you, so please, tell me
where that crystal is. I only want what is mine."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Yeah? You also
consider the world yours?" asked Daria as her calves shuddered, really burning
now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"The world is
everyone's, why shouldn't I be included in that?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>The Mercenary
returned, carrying a roll of black PVC tape and an electrically fused
detonator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Ah, thank you,"
said Wyatt as he took the roll of tape off the mercenary and picked at the end
of the tape with his fingernails. Eventually he managed to pick up the end of
the tape and he unrolled about 100mm, borrowing the mercenary's knife to cut
the tape. he gave back the roll of tape and took the detonator and stepped out
of Daria's view.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Daria then felt
him grab her left pinkie finger, pressing the back of the detonator against the
back of the tip of her finger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>He secured the
detonator with the strip of tape, and then turned back to the mercenary, and
said "I need another 100mm of tape."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>After the
mercenary unrolled and cut the desired length of tape.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Daria then felt
him secure the other end of the detonator against the knuckle of the finger.
The detonator held her finger straight, and she didn't want to bend the
detonator because she was kind of attached to her finger and didn't want to
lose it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Now, why don't I
give you half an hour to think about what you want me to do when I get back, do
you want me to remove the detonator or set it off? Excuse me," he said as he
left. The Mercenaries left with him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Daria shifted her
weight to try to keep her calves from cramping up.</span></p>

watt per fridge, it'd be a stretch to say they'd be far enough from the nearest
town that they'd need to freeze anything," said Charles, "I suppose it depends
on how much they're willing to spend on fuel getting the food to their base,
let's see, at least fifteen people, combined food per day would be about
nineteen point six kilojoules, 3.6kg carbohydrates, 0.815kg Protein, 0.836kg
fat, you know what, most the stuff needed can be canned, in fact, if they use
vitamin pills, they can skip raw fruit and veg all together, Damn it!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Well, they still
need wat- ... ... They'd have to drink two point five litres per person, and that's
just sitting around doing nothing, but you have to pasteurise it, you do that
by boiling it, so fifteen people makes thirty seven point five litres, you want
to boil that to be extra sure, forty two hundred Joule per kilogram kelvin
times thirty seven point five times about ninety five Celsius, fifteen
megajoules a day, that's one hundred and seventy three watts over the whole

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Good point. Aside
from that, it's more efficient to heat it quickly, so it'll be as fast as they
can, they could use kettles or hot water urns ... ... You know what? This is
getting us nowhere, what are we missing here? Why set up here at all? We got
forests, mountains, some volcanoes ... ... You know what, you want to hide a large
structure in the middle of nowhere indefinitely, make sure no one can stumble
across it, Aww, they have a permanent installation, I can think of a LOT of
ways you can build something without the CIA having so much as a clue, you'd
need to stabilise the ground, that can be done with grout injection or by
injecting cryogenic fluids to freeze it, precast segments will draw attention, but
you can build a shotcrete pump yourself, you can make rebar grids yourself if
you're okay with doubling up to overcome the use of steel cable not designed

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Daria felt tension

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>After he wired it

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Daria started to

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>She then felt a

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>He let go of her
trousers and said "I'm sure the pain will be along in a minute." He then walked
around her and inspected the damage. "Hmm. ... Might lose a bit too much blood if
we don't do something." He then unlocked the padlock holding the chain to her
collar and lifted her hands.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Daria realised
there must be a ring attached to the base of the cuffs as the chain wasn't
threaded between her wrists, and the momentary relief to her legs ended as her
hands were pulled up as high as they would go. The sudden movement awakening
her leg muscles hurt like hell, as did the pressure on her wrists as her
bodyweight pulled her elbows apart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Wyatt looked at
her current posture and said "Maybe we should have started with caning her ass.
... Ah well, maybe we'll do that with Jane or Tiffany if it comes to that. We'll
be back later, we have hundreds of detonators, so we can do your fingers, your
toes, we can slowly carve you up to nothing."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>He then walked to
Tiffany's cage. There was a load of saliva pooling under her face. He kicked
the cage. No response. "She should be awake by now shouldn't she?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"The dose a person

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>A few minutes
later, the sensation started to return to the knuckle that no longer had a
finger attached. She could also feel the muscles in her arm cramping because
the tendons no longer had anything keeping the muscles from simply bunching up.

peeled back some of the skin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>One of them got a
mischievous look on his face and said "I know what'll wake her up."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>He then slid his
hand down her trousers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>His friend
chuckled and said "If you don't tell us otherwise, we'll assume you want our
babies."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"DON'T YOU DARE!"
shouted Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Or what, you'll
shout at us to death?" said the guy who was feeling Tiffany. He chuckled as
Jane tried to force herself up against the roof of her cage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>He then looked
down at Tiffany and said "She should be awake now, or at least twitching."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>The other guy
opened her mouth and put his ear over it. "There's saliva pooling in her
trachea, I don't think she can fake that, get her in the recovery position,
I'll get help."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>He wasn't stupid,
he still had a sneaking suspicion that Tiffany was faking it, so when he rolled
her onto her side rather than release her hands to support her head, he held
her head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>That was still
insufficient. Tiffany bent forwards, rolled onto her back and kicked him in the
side of the head. With him punch drunk from the first kick, Tiffany got on her
feet and kicked him in the throat, flipping him onto his back. Her next move
was to stamp foot onto the bridge of his nose with sufficient force to cave his
cranium in. She then took his knife and moved to his neck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"TIFFANY!" shouted
Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Tiffany looked up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"He's down, you
don't need to kill him."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"What? ... Are you
willing to bet your life on that Jane?" asked Tiffany. The guy was probably
dead anyway, this was just to make sure. Aside from that, unknown hours wearing
a Mk. 40 screwing with her nervous system, she really wanted to kill someone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Tiffany, just
don't, okay? Grab his keys," said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Tiffany eventually
dropped his knife and checked his pockets and located a bunch of keys.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>She then opened
Jane's cage and Jane rapidly shuffled out. Tiffany tried each key until one fit
and freed Jane's hands.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Jane then moved to
free Tiffany and then Daria. With everyone's hands free, Tiffany took the
mercenary's gun, which turned out to be a PFT-M2, and retrieved his knife from
the floor. She also located a small first aid kit and handed it to Daria. "We
don't have time at the moment, but as soon as we have a minute, I want to get
that wound sterilised and dressed. We don't have time to debate any of this,
we're not cops busting a couple of vandals for tagging, we're in extreme
danger, we're well out numbered, we pick up any grenades along the way, and we
need to clear a large formation out of the way-"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"NO!" interrupted
Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"YES!" replied
Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"BOTH OF YOU KNOCK
IT OFF! YOU'RE DOING MY HEAD IN! Tiffany do what you have to, Jane and I will
do what we have to," said Daria. Daria had checked the damage to her hand: As
expected, her pinkie finger was gone, and the skin on her ring finger was slightly
torn, but the wound had clotted, and while she didn't want to move her ring
finger, she figured she could still fight if she had to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>About ten seconds
after they were all free, they heard boots approaching.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Tiffany stood
ready at the door, but a loud bang suddenly sounded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"What was that?"
asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Tiffany took the
handle of the door and opened it, looking ahead. Seeing no threats, but a lot
of smoke, she then opened to the rest of the way and saw three mercenaries on
the floor, one of them had his leg badly chewed up. There was a patch of soot
on the floor and a shallow crater indicating an explosive device the size of a
grenade about a metre from the door, and there were pits in the wall in a
pattern consistent with a fragmentation grenade.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Tiffany signalled
the other legionnaires to follow her. As soon as they were out, Daria and Jane
grabbed their guns, also PFT-M2s.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>They then heard
people running and four mercenaries appeared from the direction Daria and Jane
were facing, guns drawn. Daria and Jane knocked them out as they emerged, these
guys were clearly not expecting guests this deep in their stronghold.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Check for keys
too, we can get out of these collars, we'll be better able to fight."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Daria and Jane
quickly checked the bodies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"No joy," said
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Ditto, did we miss
anywhere?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"We could cavity
search them and find an MRI or something, but us being in the middle of an
enemy stronghold, I vote we move on," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Agreed, my
direction let's MOVE!" said Tiffany, causing Daria and Jane to wince.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>They followed
Tiffany, covering their rear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Tiffany approached

a fourth with a claymore mine taped to it. To the outside with the shrapnel
facing the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Yesssssssss,"

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Okay then. MOVE!"

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"How the hell did
you accidentally hit play instead of record?" asked Wyatt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>The embarrassed
mercenary said "I don't know, or it wouldn't have been an accident."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>This pissed Harman
Roberts, call sign Brown Recluse Zero One, off. Most the day he'd been in
conflict with Wyatt over their interrogation strategy, they had been keeping
the prisoners together, his justification was if they see what'll happen to
themselves later and that their empathy towards each other will add to their
duress. Guy had probably never read a horror novel in his entire life, fact is,
snippets of other prisoners distress would do far more than seeing it happen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Giving the
prisoners time to dwel on the consequences of resistance is all well and good
to the uninitiated, but that time only ends up building resolve, you give them
time to adapt or collect their thoughts, he was leaving them too long between
blows. Simulated chaos in the administration of the duress such as apparent
rage combined with something that could accidentally kill or permanently injure
or disable motivates the person to try to regain control before they are killed
or rendered unable to escape when freed. The only means available being to give
the interrogator something they want, Reinforce that and eventually the
prisoner runs out of things other than the information they're after, and
another reason to separate the prisoners is so they feel less shame when they
do co-operate. They remain in sight and sound of each other, their sense of
shame will reinforce their determination to withhold the information.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>The stress
positions, strapedo and hanging on tiptoes were a good move, and the compliance
bands would further harass their senses, but he failed to mix in other things,
he just wasn't keeping up the fear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>It also didn't
help that the rooms were so unfinished. They should have plastered and painted
the walls, tiled the floors, quadrupled the light levels, the collars would be
making the prisoners photosensitive, pipe in a high pitched tone to harass
their ears (not much point in using white noise, just use something constant
and irritating again to break their concentration), remove distractions, smell
of cleaning fluids and disinfectants, make them look somewhat obsessive, right
now it looked like a half finished building site.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Harman had been in
the Rangers, as had three of his team, another four were former Green Berets. The
rest were former gang members they had managed to tempt away with the money a
mercenary can make, and the Green Berets took a special pride in being 'Force
Multipliers'. Their ability to train up indigenous groups being one of the main
points of their existence, and the former gangsters were now as capable as any
other member of their group. Harman thought the Rangers would take him places
and let him fight. Apparently not, he could count the number of actual operations
he had been on throughout the decade of his career on one hand, and he found
himself going crazy to the point of developing a bad discipline record, so he
quit before he did something to get fired and set up his own rent-a-squaddie
business.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>To be fair, Wyatt
knew how to build and wire this place, and was fairly good at tactics and
strategy, basically keeping their overall profile to near invisibility, he
never picked a fight they couldn't win, and that stealth Helo was just mint,
but he was a bit slow when it came to the psychology of war, and didn't want to
admit it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Still, Fran had
bugged the Legionnaires facilities so thoroughly that they had a shot at
following the crystal if it was ever moved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>That's another
point, they could have used Fran as a friend, according to the debrief, Fran
would have been fairly plausible, and she could have been used as a 'Good cop',
let the prisoners try to recruit her and gather information off of her, she
could be used to manipulate the prisoners. Fran, underneath her usually calm
exterior, felt empathy. Empathy with your co-workers improves unit cohesion,
but empathy with enemy operatives was a problem, it was obvious Fran was not a
villain at heart, it was just the only job she could get. Push her too hard and
she might grow a spine and react. Like Jonathon Levinson off of Buffy The
Vampire Slayer after Warren Meers killed his ex-girlfriend and was trying to
kill Buffy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Wyatt didn't want
to hear about the possibility of Fran defecting, apparently, she's "Too scared
of me to defy me."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>She's actually too
scared of being abandoned with no support, and that card has a limit. It just
felt like they were playing out an episode of Orange County Chopper, only with Paul
Teutul Sr. not knowing his ass from his elbow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Like, for
instance, just as a vague example, that stunt with the detonators was likely to
turn Fran against them, seeing prisoners being disfigured would probably be a
bit close to home for her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Wyatt hit stop and
they saw blue with a message saying "No Signal."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>He hit more stop

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>The mercenary
grabbed his comm and said "All call signs, we're under attack, surveillance is
down, we may have an invisible or intangible intruder, and can someone check on
the prisoners please? Over."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>He waited for a

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>He then picked up
another comm unit and turned it on, he placed them next to each other and heard
no feedback.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>He then used the
fresh unit, asking "Any call sign, comm check, over?" After receiving no reply,
he pulled his gun and grabbed another, handing it to Wyatt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>He then opened the
door looking ahead of him, seeing no one, he popped out the door looking the
other way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Wyatt jumped out
behind him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>The mercenary then
advanced along the corridor to the room they were keeping their prisoners in,
the second corner he rounded he saw four unconscious people at a junction. He
ran up to them and saw three more dead people near the door to the room they
were storing their prisoners in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>He picked up a comm

die, or your friends, or you AND your friends along with you. You don't always

trying to reign everything in, and it's hard for me to get Quinn on side most

the prez and vice prez are, they generally go with the advice of the majority

Daria's side of this, and a dose of venom from Jane, it came up because I tried

Jane asked me if I killed anyone, I couldn't answer of course because all my
kills occurred after I became a SEAL, if the operations ever become
declassified, I'm probably out of the Legion. I guess I'm pissed off at that,
but it was more than just some rule Jane thought might be a good idea at the
time, she's really pissed off at me. ... Daria, she feels Jane's losing the plot,
pushing for policies that will make the Legion less effective. ... I'm afraid the

said "I think there's a public relations side that's of equal importance to us,

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>The cockpit of the
submarine consisted of a tube of diamond with an adamantium hatch on the back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Any electronic
systems interfaced to the outside through optical electronic connections, there
were lithium battery banks that used four propellers for main thrust, pitch and
yaw, and the four propellers could be turned 90 degrees for roll.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>The submarine had
two arms, one carried a giant shaped charge, it's buoyancy neutralised with
tanks of ammonia, the other carried the soul crystal and a thermite charge,
also neutralised by ammonia tanks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>The first thing
Jane had to do was blast as much of the sand and loose soil away from under the
shaped charge as possible. This was achieved by blasting water from the middle
of a panel under the shaped charge, this blasted the mud out from under it and
it just fell into place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Creating a vacuum
at that depth was not realistic, so they connected a bottle of liquid hydrogen
and piped water around the tank to boil it off as they dived, filling the void
with pressurised hydrogen. There was also a lump of thermite to heat the
hydrogen up, a refractory liner on the plate lining the hollow stopped the
charge from cooking off, but this won't be used until Jane was at an
appropriate standoff.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>The charge placed,
Jane disconnected the charge from the submarine and disconnected the ammonia
tank from the charge, letting it rise to the surface. Jane backed the submarine
off about 300 metres.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>The shaped charge
was big, it had to punch a hole wide enough to accept the crystal as deep as
possible. Daria had designed the submarine to withstand the overpressure at
that distance, but the way they had been getting along lately, Jane found
herself wondering if she could really trust Daria not to take advantage of
this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>She eventually
armed the hellbox and fired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>She felt the
submarine oscillate away from and towards the hypocentre.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>There was too much
solid material suspended in the water for her to see anything ahead of her, the
submarine was using a sonar mapping system to locate itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Jane returned to
the hypocentre.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>The Soul Crystal
was in a steel casket filled with cobalt 60, the casket had some tabs welded to
it, and those tabs had shaped charges on the end that would nail the tabs to
the inside of the hole, and there was a quantity of sand over the crystal so
that the casket and tabs would remain intact. There was a hose to blast mud and
sand out of the way in case a load of that had gotten in the way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>The ammonia tank
on the soul crystal floated away, the thermite charge weighed down on the water
blast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>It seemed to drop
right into the hole, but did not continue to sink at a slower rate as it would
if there was a load of sand in the way, and Jane was close enough that she'd
see if there was sand being blasted out the way. Looks like they added
something they didn't need.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>'Well, when you

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>She backed the

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>She fired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>She didn't see
anything until the sintered thermite was about 90% consumed. The hole was never
going to completely absorb that amount of thermite, that was deliberate so that
the thermite would completely fill the hole and cover it, sand currently
suspended in the water would eventually settle on it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>Jane parked the

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"How come I never

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"We did what we

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Okay, seems

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Probably through Armalin,"
said Jane, "he became involved when Brittany stole the crystal from us, this
was before we became aware of her abilities, it co-opted her, made her try to
kill and then brainwash Stacy, we recovered the crystal and had to explain the
whole thing to him, and then, couple months later, Black Majesty shows up,
kicks everyone's ass, and Armalin was the one who had to show up with this big
alien gun with irreplaceable ammo and shot him to near nothingness."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"And he came back

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Yeah, he came to
Xavier's attention when he freed Juggernaut to try to divert us, sent
Nightcrawler and Rogue after them both, and he kept up the pressure on Black
Majesty to the point where Black Majesty started wearing a compliance band to
get off of Cerebro, then he lost Xavier's people through old fashioned slight
of hand and evasion."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"Then he appears

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>The crystal had
been successfully relocated. There were some Legionnaires that had not been
told of it's existence, let alone it's location, and getting them to restrain
their curiosity and convincing them to "Just trust that we know what we're
doing" was such a pain in the ass, containing knowledge was vital. Jane, Daria
and Lance were the ones that had finally decided what to do with the crystal,
and all anyone knew was it would be dropped somewhere on the Pacific basin. Of
course Quinn, and probably everyone else knew that the logical place to stick
it was a subduction zone, and Lance's involvement ... Lance, callsign Avalanche,
causes earthquakes, so any earthquakes occurring on a deep sea trench would be
a dead give away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"An unusual amount
of earthquakes occurred all along the so called 'Ring Of Fire' today, the
epicentres were so numerous that geologists are baffled," said the newsreader.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>How long is that
subduction zone? Nine thousand kilometres? No way was anyone going to be able
to determine it's location from that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt'>"The activity
started at locations far enough from population centres that preparations could
be made before any structural collapse could occur, but the actual strength of
the quakes never seemed to do more than throw some small tsunamis, the damage
totals less than fifteen million dollars in flooded out homes and beached
watercraft, any watercraft that had their owners nearby made got far enough off
the continental shelf to avoid getting caught."</span></p>
