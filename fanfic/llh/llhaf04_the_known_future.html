<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Harman Roberts entered the room and asked
what the problem was. His rangers training which he now turned to the mercenary
game prepared him for everything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"It's too warm."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He opened the cabinet and it was, indeed,
too warm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He pulled it out and smelt something
burning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The burning smell would otherwise be taken
out by the vent behind the unit's radiator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He pulled the plug and pulled the unit
completely free of it's alcove, he pulled a screwdriver from his pocket and
removed the cover from the motor's starter. "Starter circuit's burnt."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He removed the destroyed module from the
motor and stood up and said "I'll move you to a new room, and refund the drink
from the mini-bar, sorry for the inconvenience."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Why the hell did these fridge manufacturers
use crystals to generate their phase differential? Not like they're that short
of room that they can't just use a capacitor for this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He returned downstairs to the reception
area and told the receptionist "Need to transfer the Dawson couple to a new
room, refund the drink from their mini-bar, I'm going to figure out what
capacitors to order, no way am I ordering a whole new fridge for how many
hundred bucks when a five dollar capacitor will get it up and running again."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Boss," acknowledged the receptionist, he
then started entering the changes on his computer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They hadn't had a customer in months.
Conflicts around the world were dieing down, and that was annoying as hell,
because that meant he'd soon be faced with a choice between turning his
attention not the hotel full time or seeking employment with some drug cartel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Aside from the moral implications of working
for a cartel, it would also bring him in direct conflict with US or US backed
forces.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Of course, that line had been crossed when
they abducted those Legionnaires.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Maybe it was time to cross that line.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He had to get his instructors back though.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Two of his former green berets had been
killed by Fran, the other two had been arrested along with half his force.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He was working on a plan to rescue them.
They hadn't been able to revive everyone before they had to bug out, and one
thing you quickly realise about the private soldier business, you had to make
choices about who you break out of prison, and he had to minimise the risk by
breaking out only those who were in the same prison as his most valuable
assets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He had contacts in the prison service, so
he knew which prison his people were being held in, and as it happened, they
were all in the same prison, so this time he had been lucky, but he needed to
figure out if he could eliminate the possibility of this ever happening again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>One thing is for sure, if he rescues his
people from prison, their loyalty to him would be reinforced and he would have
an easier time controlling them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He found an electronics website and looked
at the capacitors on offer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We need an operation," said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Hell no, first you want us all to do
makeup and now you want to-" said Daria as she fired off another PFT discharge
at the cue ball. Daria and Quinn had set up a cordon around a snooker table so
that they'd have to really aim as opposed to simply firing from point blank.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No, not a surgical operation, a save the
world operation," said Quinn as she walked around the snooker table, figuring
out what her shot should go.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I get it," said Daria, "but the fact
there's no evil afoot at the moment is a goooood thinnnng, yeah?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, except you're going stir crazy
again," said Quinn as she took her shot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Aww come on, if I were going stir crazy,
I'd be painting the building with Nitrogen Tri-iodide paste," countered Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>With a snap and a blast of purple smoke,
the PA system came to life, Brittany said "Daria, you painted my keyboard with
exploding paste AGAIN!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria awkwardly shrugged and said "Okay,
you're right, we need some villains to kick around the world," as she started
working on her next shot. "Do we have to restrict ourselves to metahuman
threats? If none of our priority threat boards have any activity on them, maybe
we could work on some normal criminals."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria's next shot potted a red ball, the
cue ball also struck a blue ball, potting that, and then a second red ball
before stopping behind the yellow ball from a nearby pocket. "Perfection,
ha-hah."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tom then entered the firing range, holding
a knife and a fork, the utensils and his hand covered in a purple dust. Tom
said "Daria, seriously, not sanitary, okay? Explosives DO NOT GO ON CUTLERY OR
OTHER ITEMS MEANT FOR HANDLING FOODSTUFFS!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, okay," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Then Mack entered and said "Run."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Run, now, any direction- ... Crap."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The now extremely audible string of impacts
approached and Stacy entered, completely feral and completely naked, carrying a
purple stained pair of panties in a purple stained hand. She pounced on Daria,
snarling, holding the purple stained panties in one hand to Daria's face, her
other hand squeezing Daria's throat, her fingers right up against Daria's jaw line
to control where Daria could look.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Never mind," said Mack.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Stacy, she won't learn nothing if she's
dead, let her go," said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Stacy remained in position, snarling, Daria
took no action.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Nice view," said Tom. Mack looked at him
wondering how he suddenly became stupider than George Bush Part Deux.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Stacy snapped around and locked onto Tom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Turn around again," said Tom, seemingly
oblivious to the apparent danger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Stacy then ran after him, Tom left.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>About ten seconds later, Daria said "Let's
find some street punks."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>[Scene
Separator]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Harman Roberts hung up the phone and sat
back, staring at the ceiling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Phoning around previous employers looking
for work was always frustrating, everyone was just TOO DAMN FRIENDLY these
days.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He was considering carrying out attacks of
his own to start something so that there would be business for him, but there
was a chance one of his team would be captured and as a result, not only would
no one want to hire his team, but his team would instead be hunted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Aside from not making any money, he
couldn't just come back here once he'd broken his people out of prison, he
needed somewhere else to go, and that meant finding a customer that would be
willing to assist him in the prison break.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Someone knocked on the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Harman brought up a webpage on his hotel
business's bank and said "Come in."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>One of his customers, a man named Waldo
Noland, entered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What can I do for you Mr ... Noland, right?"
asked Harman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I work for someone who would like to have
some of your ... other ... services."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Potential customer or disguised agent?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Harman said "I see," before he picked up an
RF sensor box and switched it on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The structure was a faraday cage, he could
turn off the only cell phone relay at the flick of a switch, but he also had to
look for recording devices, anything active or metallic should show up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The guy raised his hands and allowed Harman
to scan all over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Harman then sat back down and reached over
to the consumer unit located right over his desk. He turned off the Cell phone
relay. If anyone is making or receiving a call at this time, this would be an
annoyance, but as long as he restored it within five minutes, there shouldn't
be any complaints, especially since oly he and his staff knew the hotel had
it's own relay and was RF resistant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I take it by your tone you're seeking to
employ me and my team as mercenaries, would that be an accurate perception?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"It is. My boss runs the west Columbian
coke farms and has a few meth labs, do you have a problem working for narcotics
distributors?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No I do not. I will need some time,
however, to break some of my team out of jail, and if I could co-ordinate with
your people to assist in our transport out, that should break any trail the
Marshals might follow."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We could provide assistance if you like,
more than a few of us would love the opportunity to annihilate a few screws."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Good idea, then our leaders would feel
even freer to throw yet more resources into the war on drugs. I'd much rather
keep this as low key as possible, soldiers dying abroad is a demoraliser, LEOs
dying at home is a challenge."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Seems strange that you would want to limit
the scale of the war," said Waldo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I want a reputation for winning wars, a
reputation for screwing up is bad for business," said Harman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, so how do you plan to get your men
out?" asked Waldo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Harman thought about his response.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"By guile."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Care to elaborate?" asked Waldo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Not yet." Harman said, picking up a US road atlas, he opened a page and said "Just have a Dash 7 or similar aircraft ready at
this location, we'll be there in three days."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay," said Waldo, as he left.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany poked her head out of the wall of
the underground facility.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Well built for a meth lab.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Construction method often left a lot to be
desired, usually it consisted of posts driven into the ground, planks of wood
for a ceiling, and usually nothing done to keep the wood dry, but these guys
had apparently gone all out to build a concrete arch, there were signs of
plastic sheets between the segments, melted back, power plant in a completely
separate hole.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Good levels of light, fume boxes for the
more hazardous phases, eye wash stations, everything you could want when cooking
up methamphetamines.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Too bad it had to be deleted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany located the flammable chemical
store and pulled her face back into the wall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The next time she emerged from the wall,
she was behind the flammable chemical store.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She ignited the satchel charge before she
moved it out of the wall. The fuse had ten seconds, Tiffany had spent three
already, so she pulled back into the wall and swam for it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She emerged from the ground 20 metres away and
was fully above ground before she heard the explosion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The structural damage was likely to be
minimal because the charge had detonated within the room, it had been close
enough to the wall and was in direct contact with the floor so there would be a
crater in both, but the main effect was that all the flammable material had
been blown all over the room, and the inside was now a furnace, and the air
coming in from above while the heavily carbonising exhaust rose caused this
unstable pulse effect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Another source of air was the ventilation
system, if nothing else worked, that would keep the fire going.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As long as that kept going, the internal
temperature would probably rise until the fire could sustain itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany found the rest of her team and
Seaman Jack Benson said "Do we get some play on the next one?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, okay," said Tiffany, admitting to
herself she had been somewhat selfish lately.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Next drug factory would be blown up by the
rest of her team.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Dominic Greyson emerged from the bushes
where he would drag his victim once he had stunned her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>His target continued on her journey,
walking alone, though the park, there was no one around that could happen
across before he had completed his operation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As soon as he was close enough, he drew and
fired his taser.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The woman did not fall over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He ran to close range and use the syringe,
getting within half a metre before he noticed a prickling sensation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He continued another ten centimetres before
a blindingly bright arc ignited between his syringe needle and her shoulder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The stimulation caused him to snap the
syringe in two and trip over his own feet and collide with her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He failed to take any action before the
woman was sat on top of him, she pinned his hands over his head and he felt a
throbbing sensation between where her hands pinned his and where her pelvis
pinned his.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"So, you're the night park rapist," said
the woman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You're Quinn?" asked Domonic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yes I am."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Quinn looked around and said "We're all
alone here, if you scream, it's unlikely anyone will hear you."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He started to struggle against her. After
half a minute he said "Please don't hurt me," his voice quivering with fear.
His face flushed with embarrassment at sounding like one of his victims.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Why not?" asked Quinn, increasing the
voltage enough that the throbbing turned into a dull ache.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There had been news articles showing Quinn
belting out enough current to blow neat holes clean through granite.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"It's interesting how invasive
electrocution is, the electric current penetrates your cells between the entry
point and the exit point, it stimulates muscles, it's incredibly painful, I
could make you soil yourself against your will, I could mess with your heart, I
could screw your brain up, and I'd be able to do it without you being able to
stop me. Any other woman would have to settle for shoving a broom handle up
your ass." Quinn leaned in close to his face, and he felt a prickling sensation
on his lips and on the side of his nose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>After half a minute, Quinn whispered "or
you could turn yourself in to the nearest precinct and save yourself a screw
load of pain. What do you reckon? Prison or me? Hmm?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Prison, please, let me go to prison," he
whimpered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Quinn sat up and sighed, looking
disappointed, saying "Okay," she stood up and gestured towards the nearest
police station saying "let's go."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"And here's where we prepare our crack,"
said the drug dealer as he lead the cops into the kitchen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It was a little bizarre that the drug
dealers had called the cops and suddenly started talking them through their operation
instead of waiting for someone to report them to the police and then putting up
all this armed resistance they normally put up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We normally store the raw cocaine up
here," he opened the wall mounted cupboard and pointed out the three 1kg packages
of raw cocaine and the five 500g boxes of baking soda, the scales and the jugs,
he then opened the oven where four baking trays with a white sludge in them
were drying out, the oven set to 80 degrees Celsius, "this is where we dry the
stuff out, we prefer electric ovens for this because gas ovens tend to be
saturated with water vapour, that requires us to boil it which obviously means
a load of our product ends up on the insides of the oven and the material ends up
foaming or even decomposing on the underside of the tray, electric we can use
lower temperatures and we end up with a denser product."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He then stood up and said "I think that's
everything. ... Another thing is that I'm not usually this polite and personable,
only reason I am at the moment is because a telepath is controlling me, as soon
as she stops, and that'll be when she feels I'm firmly in your custody, I'm
going to be physically and verbally abusive and difficult to control, so if
you've seen enough to proceed with the arrest ... "</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We have," said the uniform sergeant,
somewhat bemused with the situation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay then," said the drug dealer as he
turned towards a wall, placing one hand on the wall and the other behind his
back in anticipation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The sergeant calmly cuffed him, talking him
through his status and his rights to legal representation and to have someone
informed of his arrest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Quinn followed the serial rapist as he
entered the police reception area.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He walked up to the desk sergeant and said
"I'm the night park rapist, my DNA and fingerprints should confirm it, please
arrest me now."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria entered the reception area.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She then looked to Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"There was no part of that which was not
fun," said Quinn, a smug pose and highly satisfied grin on her face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, my drug dealers should be entering
the custody area in a minute."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>A group of kids ran in, and announced
"we're the ones that were tagging the schools, arrest us, quick."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They appeared to be soaked around the tops
of their shirts and the smell of urine appeared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Stacy entered, beaming with pride.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria looked to Stacy and said "Stacy ...
tell me you didn't ... "</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"They were leaving their mark on public
property, seemed only right that I leave my mark on them."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Ho-kayyy, you need to dial it down a bit,
seriously," said Daria. As several cops entered to make the arrests.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You can talk, Peter Logan," said Stacy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, but, the cops, do we hate them?"
asked Daria as she looked over to the cops as they struggled to breathe around
their prisoners.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Ah ... Right," said Stacy, "it just seemed
the thing to do at the time."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Want to find more criminals, or do we
knock off now?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They thought about it and Stacy said "We'll
pick this up again tomorrow."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They then left.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, here are your prisoners," said the
warden as the prison guards emerged with the orange jumpsuit clad men.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Four of the pseudo-marshals started moving
the prisoners into the back of the refurbished truck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Harman had to make this look as real as
possible. He was prepared to start killing prison guards if that was what had
to happen to assure his escape.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He had the truck rigged with smoke grenades
to hide himself and the truck as they depart and had a sniper set off way in
the distance with a .50 rifle so prison snipers could be deleted, but what he
had told Waldo was the truth: You want to limit the motivation of the US
government to pour more resources into this if you can, and the cake and ass
party of the war on terror was fresh enough that US involvement in south America
could be seen as wasteful by enough people to show up on the surveys
politicians run to decide what they want to say to get people to vote for them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Soldiers dying abroad = reason to quit.
LEOs being slaughtered at home = reason to get violent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Everything went smoothly and he got in the
truck along with the rest of his pseudo-marshals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The sniper would wait until they were clear
and he would get on his motorbike and shot off after them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The second sniper that would keep anyone
walking up to the first sniper would then get on his bike and join them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Harman didn't know if he could trust this
Waldo guy, so he had his people build a couple of aircraft to assist their
travel from the US.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>One new trick he had learned was how to
swindle loan sharks. The people that ran his hotel when he was away knew he and
his team were mercenaries, but didn't care about that, so they were happy to
assist him in he odd deception if it didn't seem to dangerous and it paid well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>What they would do is they would pretend to
move into an estate and pretend to apply to a bank for a loan. Loan sharks look
for rejects to sell loans to. Usually those sharks would ask for absurd levels
of interest that would basically keep the client paying them back until they
basically died from a cardiovascular disorder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The pride and satisfaction of putting those
types in the poor house was usually as sweet as the money they make from it,
Harman's people, even just the hotel workers, were just too good at staying
hidden from them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>But it still didn't pay anything like what
warlords were usually willing to fork out for some decent rent-a-soldiers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Harman had learnt a thing or two from Wyatt
when they had built their stealth helo, and he had applied that knowledge to
the construction of two stealth aircraft.&nbsp; It had been surprisingly easy to
construct a pair of turbofan engines, he managed to save a bunch of precision
work by using a centrifuge compressor, he really didn't need to have the power plant
itself all in one module, he could have the fan on the end of a long shaft, so
he used a big carbon fibre fan in a big carbon fibre duct on the back of the
aircraft like one of those boats you get for traversing the everglades.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>That had left him a little freer in the
shape of the engine, instead of having to condense the thing into a nicely
streamlined pod, he could place it all over the fuselage behind the cockpit, so
he had three centrifuge compressors that were rigged in series, he had heat
exchanges between them where the fuel soaked the heat from the compressed air
so that the compressors wouldn't melt, gave him a fantastic compression ratio,
but then he still needed something capable of being rigid at 2000 Celsius.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Secondary adamantium was out of his price
range, so he instead had to construct a laser capable of chucking out a couple
of gigawatts, procure any scrap of tungsten carbide he could find, melt all
that and cast it into something resembling a blade wheel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It had to be a complete wheel because the
CNC machines needed to make a perfectly fitting root would have cost as much as
the aircraft he was trying to make.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>What he was unable to build was a radar
system, that required a computer, so weapons consisted of two M2s, a blacked
out flashlight with cross hairs scratched off of it aimed at a plane of glass
in place of a HUD, and four bodged stinger launchers that would hopefully lock
onto the enemy instead of the sun or someone's chimney or even worse, the
aircraft they were supposed to be protecting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He had four qualified fixed wing pilots,
and while they were happy to fly the aircraft, they dreaded having to use them
in an actual fight, they had basically used traffic radar detectors to
construct their RWR system, there was no way to know if their RWR would
actually work since there was no need for any of them, even when they were in
their regiments, to know the frequencies the air force use in their radar
systems.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Hopefully their anti-AWACS missiles would
work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The anti-AWACS missile was this big ramjet
powered weapon clad in stainless steel (except for it's Pyrex radome) that
would locate the source of a radar pulse and follow it back to it's source. It
would be passive for most of it's journey, using active occasionally until it
got a strong enough signal to tell it was a couple of seconds away, and then
full active so it would hit the main fuselage. It didn't have the capacity for
much explosive, so they had basically placed an array of linear cutting charges
around it in the hopes that one of them would slice through something vital.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It had no use for measurements of distance,
it just needed a vector.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It was still a bodge job, and it was
untested. Harman hoped he wouldn't need to down an AWACS, same reason as
before, plus for all he knew the missile would end up going for a terrestrial
TV station.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Still, if all this got him some violence,
the whole reason for him quitting the army was that he wasn't getting enough
actual combat for his tastes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They came up on their first change of
vehicle point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Time to find out if Waldo was being
straight up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Charles piloted the aircraft while Daria
and Jodie were on the phones to the cops as they approached the location of the
prison.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The escapees had a lead of an hour.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Don't the local cops have traffic
cameras?" asked Sandi as she leaned in through the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, they do, so if Harman's extraction
team broke the speed limit or did something else to attract attention, we'll
know where they went," said Daria, "Best bet's going to be store front cameras,
we'd need cameras that are constantly on, and even then we may not get the
vehicle index, we're looking for a rigid UPS truck."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, my conversations with the police
have revealed five or six UPS trucks in town at about the time of the prison
break," said Jodie, "all of them rigid."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria dialled UPS and said "Hi, I'm Daria
Morgendorffer, I'm with the Legion, I need to determine which of the rigid UPS trucks
seen wasn't yours."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah?" responded Jodie to another call. ...
"Right," She then turned to Daria saying "Cops just found sheets with a UPS
truck skin printed on them just outside of town."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Still listening to the phone call and
writing notes, Daria said "it could still look like a UPS truck, the skins
could be a plant to decoy us."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We could end up spread real thin on the
ground if we're asking the cops to look for every rigid truck that happened
through that town," said Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, but I'll be able to sniff them out,"
said Stacy from her seat in the passenger seating area of the aircraft.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"As soon as we're subsonic, I'm going to
step out and fly around, see if I can spot the truck myself," said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Normally this would be the exclusive
jurisdiction of the full time US Marshals, but the Legion was interested
because of their previous encounter with these guys.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany led the team along the path.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There was no reason for Tiffany to cause a
disturbance in the foliage, so she simply walked through everything as she
carefully scanned every square minute of view for any sign of an enemy presence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She heard something and signalled for those
behind her to stop.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There was an airy high voice singing
something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It was coming from her 1o'clock vector.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany waved everyone to her left.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She then sunk herself into the ground and
advanced, hoping to identify the source of the sound.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They were about 190 metres from their next

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Of course kids were impulsive, so-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Here was a crunching noise behind Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She turned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She could no longer see the second SEAL in

the second-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Jack!" she whispered as she found her
second SEAL.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She then noticed his head was off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Where was his head?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She moved back and saw Jack's head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She looked up and around, trying to work
out what was going on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It quickly occurred to her that while she
was trying to guess what was happening, the remaining two SEALs were on their
way to getting dead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"PEEL TO LZ! GO!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The other two immediately started the peel
cycle, third running while fourth shot at anywhere the enemy might be. They
would switch every 30 metres.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany stayed close to them, but she was
really after whoever had dismembered Jack.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She climbed up through a tree, trying to
get a better view. Above the foliage and below the canopy, she had a fairly
good view from 10 metres up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She eventually identified one person
following her team. The X-ray was apparently female, apparently dressed in a
bright tee shirt and denim shorts. Not really interested in camouflage, is she?
She also had pointy ears or horns, Tiffany couldn't tell which. She didn't
really care that much either. The woman was running after her team. Anyone
hearing gunfire would normally go the other way or start making hot, passionate
love with the ground. Tiffany shot at the individual.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The PFT knocked the X-ray over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany dropped down through the tree and
approached.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The X-ray was hopefully unconscious, this
woman was obviously super powered, telekinetic, the protrusions were horns, and
Tiffany felt something pass through her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She turned around and saw another woman,
similar dress, same cranial features, Tiffany shot at her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The woman was out of the way before Tiffany
could close the contacts within the pickle button, and suddenly several trees
were coming down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany gave chase.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She eventually stopped and looked around.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She heard nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She returned to the location of the
unconscious woman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She was gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Great. She gets away with murder, and all
I get is this lousy loss."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany returned to Jack's body and phased
it and his head 1.8 metres into the ground.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She noted the GPS co-ordinates and started
towards the LZ to hook up with her surviving team members.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>No way she could retrieve a body AND
protect herself at the same time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Body would have to be relocated when it was
safe for someone to come and do that at a later date.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She quickly came across her other two
SEALs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They were hanging around.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>From the trees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>In pieces.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>By their small intestines.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Har-de-har, har, har!" growled Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"This <i>Dash 7</i> aircraft was spotted at
these two locations at these dates, it was searched on it's way in, no drugs or
other contraband, Visa said it was carrying some fashion models, a photo crew
and a director for a company that no longer seems to exist and the current
occupants can't ever remember seeing in their thirty years of tenancy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Prison break wasn't detected until the
aircraft was two hundred klicks away, and then no one thought to rewind the
tape and find out what aircraft were launching from the area, another thing to
note was that two other aircraft were seen at about the same time, but <i>AWACS</i>
didn't see them, so if it was Harman's people on that <i>Dash 7</i> as it left,
he probably had a fighter escort, <i>Dash 7</i> is now out of the country, last
seen headed towards Columbia," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They were talking to each other over video
phone lines, Daria and Sandi from the <i>Gridrunner</i>, Julia from her office,
Brittany from her office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"The US Marshals that were supposed to have
issued the move order have no memory of issuing the orders, and the fakes that
showed up seemed to know internal procedure down to the gesture, so I'm looking
for anything in the phone records of any marshals and prison staff connected
with the case," said Jodie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Can we pursue these guys?" asked Brittany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Officially and popularly, the Columbians
are supposed to be in close co-operation with us. Problem is that the cartels
own the courts, getting them extradited takes forever and a day, by which time,
a cock-up in an attempt to transfer the prisoners between prisons or to or from
court will have freed them," said Julia.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Whole region's a mess, if Harman's people
went there, they've probably got an employer," said Daria, "We go after them,
we'll end up deeply involved in the war on drugs."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Here we go," said Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Exactly," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Excuse me?" asked Julia.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I agree that substance addiction drives up
crime, but I think the current doctrine of tougher sentences for simple
possession is ass backwards, we need to focus exclusively on the dealers,
otherwise all we do is push the addicts deeper into their addiction," said
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Dealers are harder to find, it's easier to
find the addicts," said Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"It's also easier to use steroids instead
of doing physical training," said Daria, "Dealers are the bottleneck, let the
addicts remain free, you can follow them to the dealers."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What if the dealers take greater care in vetting
their customers?" ask Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That'll drive down crime, and make drug
dealing less profitable," said Daria. "Currently dealers don't give a screw,
they have no incentive beyond maximising their profit."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"And how do we deter addicts from continuing
their addiction?" asked Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We make the substances unavailable, and we
pick our battles, why the screw is cannabis illegal?" Asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"THIS is fascinating, but ... " Julia said,
trying to get everyone back on track, "we have two options if we still want to
pursue these guys, we can do it above board, get the Columbians to let us work
on their patch, which means the cartels know where we are at all times, or we
do it under the table, enter Columbia illegally and hunt them down and
hopefully not cause a diplomatic incident in the process. There's a third
option: Wait for them to return to the US, which could be any time, and we have
no way of finding out when that will be."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We go after them while they're lying low,
we're going to have serious trouble finding them, we need to go after them when
they're attending a gig, gives us the possibility of attracting them into our
field of view," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"How do we do that?" asked Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Cartel's own Columbia's judiciary?" asked
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yes?" asked Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"There you go," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okayyyyyyy, sounds like we're discussing
something HIGHLY illegal here, so let's all meet up at Legion Tower where I can
explain face to face why this is a bad idea and what kind of prison you're
likely to wind up in if you breech the Bowman acts," said Julia.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, so, how do you propose we do this?"
asked Julia.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"First Brittany bugs all the people that
are useful to the Columbian Cartels that have jobs they shouldn't, then we use
a <i>Mk 5 Gridrunner</i> to knock out any radar assisted air defences with the
MASERs. <i>L1</i> with Confinement Mist bombs to capture any enemy forces we
find, anyone not operating the aircraft or planting surveillance gear on the
ground to de-glue and capture as many land forces as possible, Jodie does SEAD,
I do CAS, everyone else on the deck, I'll be using my powers to tell Cartel
gangster from Columbian Soldier or other allied operative," said Daria, "Like
it?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Love it," said Brittany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Don't we already have Radar stealth on our
aircraft?" asked Julia.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We do, but that's only good up to a point,
I'll be close enough to the deck to read peoples minds, but I need to be
sufficiently high off the ground in order for the confinement mist bombs to
function, puts me well into the range of triple A and most SAM systems, anyone
using a shoulder launched fox 2, I'll just have to read and strafe with my
PFTs," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Where do we stick our captives?" asked
Julia.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Somewhere where the Columbian Army can
find them, that way we start people talking to people we're interested in,"
said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Nice," said Jodie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, here's a question: What if we get
caught?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What if someone manages to kill us, what
if we get complacent one day on an operation, or even when we're crossing the
road?" asked Daria. "This is our best chance to get these guys, we leave them,
they're only going to be an even bigger problem later, once we have them, we're
out of there."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, this is what I don't get about you
Daria, you'll basically avoid finding a boyfriend or looking good like the
plague, that all scares you for some reason, yet you're all over insane risks
when it comes to operations," said Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"And I don't get you being the other way
around," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Excuse me? I'm as much of an action diva
as you are, I just also go out and meet people too," said Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Which makes you half as productive as me,"
said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Sandi triplicated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Even with three of you," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah," "Right," "Whatever," said the
Sandis.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We have a go already?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Ummm, ... sure," said Brittany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>[Scene

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, we're here, who do we talk to about
operations?" asked Harman as he stepped off the back of the aircraft.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That would be me, but I get my orders from
someone else," said Waldo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, got anything for us now?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Relax, take a load off, mr ... "</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Harman felt himself tighten up with
irritation when he hear the voice of Buck Conroy, editor of Brutal Mercenary
Magazine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Harman glared at Waldo, pointing his thumb
at Buck for a second before turning and saying "Okay, Buck."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That's General Conroy, Major."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>'Yeah, right, General' Harman thought as he
forced himself to snap to attention and salute the prick as opposed to Prince
Albert-ing him with a bullet. "My apologies, general, but don't you think it
would be a good idea to start thinking about the battle space and the enemy's
likely activity while we're waiting for orders to arrive?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There was a reason Harman hadn't promoted
himself to a higher rank after he had started his own private army, and that
was because he was qualified to be a major and to promote anyone below him up
to his rank. Unless he had some way of being certified as having the skills and
knowledge to be of a higher rank, he would be kidding himself if he was to take
on a rank he couldn't be certain he was qualified for.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Buck Conroy, on the other hand, had not
gotten beyond private first class, had not passed selection when he had tried
for Green Berets (you need people skills for Green Berets, Buck had displayed
no such skills and zero maturity, and that was something his own green berets
had mentioned right when he had first started), and Harman could see familiar
faces that had appeared next to Conroy in magazine articles and in Conroy's
magazine, and was further tempted to shoot Conroy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"There'll be time for that later, mean
time, beer and snacks in that hanger over there," Buck pointed over to one of
the hangers on the small airfield.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Harman looked where Buck was pointing, and
then asked "What about sleeping areas? Same building?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Nah, the one to the left," said Buck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Understood, anything else?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Nah, that's all, you can get on over
there," said Buck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Sir," acknowledged Harman as he saluted
and turned away, he waved his men to follow him as he headed over to the
sleeping hanger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He also waved for Waldo to follow him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I take it you're not impressed with Buck
Conroy," said Waldo as he followed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"To say the least, he couldn't make E2,
he's certainly not O10 material, you want your operations to succeed, you're
going to have to use your authority as our employer to supersede his and follow
my advice," said Harman, "I dread to think what his officer corps is like,"
Harman added with a shudder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, but how do I know you're not
falsifying your credentials?" asked Waldo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You have contacts inside the US DOJ?"
asked Harman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yes," said Waldo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You should have my war record, now I'm a
fugitive, it should be on every BOLO in every precinct in the US or Interpol member states," said Harman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, fair enough, to be honest, my orders
to hire you came from higher up," said Waldo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, well, if your higher ups don't want
to reveal themselves, that's fine, I've worked under such conditions before,
and I understand the paranoia that goes with unlawful operations. But I do
insist on full operational intel and would like to start getting my head in the
game as soon as possible, and I'd like to get my green berets in charge of
training up anyone Buck hasn't unrealistically promoted over us as soon as
possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Like I said before, I like having a
reputation for victory, and that'll be a lot easier to achieve if I'm not
having to carry Buck's dead weight with me, and using people for cannon fodder
is bad for morale and subsequently performance, so, please get me maps and
start rotating his men through my command as early as possible."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay," said Waldo as he left.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Waldo entered his office in the
administration building attached to the control tower.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I see Harman's people have arrived," said Valerie,
one of the proxies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Waldo startled and looked up to the ceiling
where she had attached herself. "Yeah, and I really wish you wouldn't do that.
I also had the mine set up where you specified, what do I tell Roberts
regarding your boss? He's likely to walk if he senses we're messing him around
or throwing him and his forces into a suicide mission."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Well, you might as well fill him in then,"
said Valerie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay. Where's Sal? Just you two usually
show up together," said Waldo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Intangible SEAL turned out to be a problem,
she'll be fine," said Valerie as she lowered herself from her ceiling. She left
the building and headed off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria tightened the sway braces on the last
bomb and walked around the aircraft, checking that none of the bombs could move
around. The load out included four triple racks that carried 12 bombs each, the
confinement mist bombs didn't really need to be that big, they were half the
length of a Mk81, same diameter, way less the weight, the remaining two hard
points were taken up by the biggest drop tanks Daria could take off with.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Bombs were essentially fibreglass shells
that the fuse would fit into, fuses were basic proximity fuses, no need for the
bomb itself to have any explosive components, the way the bomb was constructed,
the shock wave from the fuse would be sufficient to shred the shell and
disperse the confinement mist. Bombs looked similar to any normal bomb except
they were grey with a violet band around the nose. Most the Legion ordnance was
that way, incapacitating, they also had HARMs and some air-air weapons, that
was about as close as they came to conventional ammunition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>That complete, she checked off the box on

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Brittany</span><span lang=EN-GB> had

possibly corrupt officials in Columbia.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Basically the two of them would run to all
the offices, Brittany would hide Fran as Fran shrinks the pair of them under
doors and into phones and other systems, and it would suddenly become a lot
easier to locate anyone that receives a call from any of these individuals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Aircraft's just about ready," said Daria,
"I'm thinking I super cruise at 70 angels direct most of the way and then drop
to floor hugging level just before I hit Venezuela, I should be able to fly
there and back and I should have a total of a minute of burner time before
bingo, a further half minute if I want to get to a US airfield, Jodie leaves
about an hour after I do, she should catch up just as I enter Columbia, sound
good?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany finally gave up on salvaging the
sat phone from the wreckage. Tiffany had a device that would allow her to call
for a ride, but anything more than calling for a ride would have to be done
over a secure satellite phone, and that could not be allowed to fall into enemy
hands. She had found bits of a case, but she doubted she could find enough
parts of it to piece it back together again (her intangibility powers allowed
her to weld things just be phasing them through each other), so that was
definitely not an option.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Helo pilots are trained to hover 2ft off

landed on a mine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany was going to board the helo when it
arrived and report in, the rest of her team was gone, the enemy had
telekinetics working for them, she needed a replacement team.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>So, she's waiting at the edge of the field,
Helo's inbound, it's just emerged over the trees lining the opening in the
forest, and suddenly there's this blast from the ground and the helo's a
flaming holy wreck with no rotor blades attached.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>How many of these mines were there?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany checked the rest of the clearing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>No other bombs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>That bomb would have posed a hazard
wherever it was placed, the rocks were the size of melons, that's a much higher
terminal velocity than what you get with even gravel or railway ballast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>But this bomb had been exactly under the
flight path.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This bothered Tiffany deeply.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It occurred to her that she should try to

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Gizmo Sandman, you're five by five, time

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Sandman Gizmo, have that, I'm listening

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jodie could operate both the <i>Gridrunner</i>
and the sensors simultaneously while also targeting the Masers at any threat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Only problem was she needed to be at considerable
altitude to give any kind of cover, and she would also need to dive a lot of
the time because the Masers could only skew their effects by so far. Above all,
that means getting subsonic, and the Gridrunner really didn't like being
subsonic at 80 angels. Jodie would have perfectly good attitude control because
the Gridrunner, being a vertical flight capable aircraft, had reaction control
thrusters, she'd just have the glide slope of a mass concrete pad stone.</span></p>

military establishment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It didn't occur to her to look at the
weather radar because weather is generally irrelevant to the <i>Gridrunner</i>,
especially at this altitude.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Which meant she missed the huge lump of goo

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right," said Quinn. She pushed a button on
the underside of her seat and two metal posts extended up from the armrests.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Quinn grabbed the posts and supplied power

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jodie tried to spin the fans using Quinn's

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It wasn't working.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria ditched her parachute in favour of

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Realising she was vulnerable to snipers and

she removed her helmet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>'Gizmo Sandman, receiving, over?' thought cast

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>'Really? Hadn't thought of that,' thought
Daria without thought casting, she simply replied 'Gizmo Sandman, have that,
landing now, over.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Harman and his men advanced on the ridge
that Daria had been hiding behind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Three of Conroy's fire teams were on his
left flank, and they were moving too fast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"HEY!" shouted Harman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>When they looked back, he signalled for
them to form a line left of him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They looked off to his left, thinking he
was pointing something out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You're moving too fast, are you even
looking for trip wires?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Dude, we're dealing with abberents who
lost their powers, they're lost."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Harman was tempted to just let them blunder
into whatever trap lay ahead. 'Abberant', kinda like 'Freak', disrespectful and
(probably inaccurately) implies mental incapacity, you disrespect your enemy at
your own peril, the enemy may not underestimate you the way you underestimate
them and like you, your enemy is playing to win.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He eventually decided "You know what? Go
ahead, do what you want, I'll try to rescue you once I've subdued the Legionnaires,
just don't make them use lethal force."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This was one of the reasons Harman wanted
to train up Conroy's men, the problem was that they didn't have the time, their
advisor had told them this attack was imminent and they had to be fielded right
now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The Cartel had the advantage right now, but
that could change in an instant if they screwed up, Harman had cautioned
everyone to look out and that the Legion had been trained by a Marine Special
Forces Officer, and Conroy went ahead and called Harman a Gloom and Doom
monger, and gave everyone an idiotic pep talk. The two metas, Val and Sal,
weren't impressed either. They did have a very good plan to start off with
though, Harman couldn't think of any way to improve upon it beyond postponing
it to train everyone else up (which hadn't been an option), which made Harman
wonder about their boss, was he or she former or current military?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>All Harman could do was exactly what he
said he didn't want to do: Use the idiots as cannon fodder. It was going to
happen either way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He signalled for his men to form a line
along his 1:30 vector, that should get them into position to hit the legion
when they respond to Buck's idiots.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>After setting up the trip wire, Betty,
Sandi, and Jane brought their ends to Daria and they threaded them through the
ring and tied them to individual rocks, she then tied them to the loop in the
string holding the rock that would trigger the trap.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They then moved on, careful not to tread on
the trip wire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"How much brown string do we have left?"
asked Betty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Enough for two more, then we'll have to
rig the devices for command detonation, that's going to fix our own movements,"
said Daria as she picked up one of the remaining bombs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I hate that," said Betty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Three Cartel members were guarding one of
the metajammers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They were set up to repel any approaching
Legionnaires.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They had spent hours setting up dangle
traps.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They had also had to bury the device and
the generator in order to hide it from the <i>Gridrunner's</i> radar system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They had also set up their gun positions
with mirrors rather than sand bags, that turned out to be a really effective
means of camouflage, until they opened up with their MG42s, they would be
perfectly concealed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They shouldn't have been so easily spotted,
but they got knocked out anyway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>When they woke up, they were tied up and
gagged with their own socks. Actually, it was each other's socks. They no
longer heard the generator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>A woman dressed for jungle warfare stood
over them, holding a PFT M4.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Took your time waking up," said the woman,
"one of you will be coming with me, we're going to shut down every one of these
metajammers or I spend all day torturing the crap out of you, the sooner you
comply, the less pain you'll feel."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She approached one and removed his gag.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Deal?" she asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What do you know about torture? You're
nothing like my boss, as you'll find out when we have you in our custody."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay," said the woman as she stuffed the
gag back into his mouth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She then dragged him out and tied his feet
to a 'technical', a truck with a 12.5mm machine gun on it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She then started it and slowly drove on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Feeling the ground moving under him, he
realised that if she moved at a mere 10mph, he'd break ribs, his arms, his
hands would be a bony pulpy mess, his pelvis, his skull.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She stopped and got out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She removed the gag again and asked "Scared
yet?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He wasn't quite ready to admit he was, and
said "You're not used to the kind of brutality of this country, you grew up in America, where-"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The women pushed the gag back into his
mouth and throttled him, calmly saying "your assumptions are based on a false
premise about my character and my life experiences, two of my more recent
experiences being seeing the rest of my fire team slaughtered and seeing a
Legion jet being splashed by the same forces that killed my team, and I have friends
in the Legion, friends I care deeply about. friends you are currently endangering.
I am not happy."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The woman got back in the truck and started
driving again, accelerating hard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He had to force himself to hold his head up
as she drove a little faster this time, he felt a couple of rocks in the path
break three of his fingers and another rock dislodged his elbow cap, he pissed
himself as the bends in the road pulled him off to the side where the trees
lived, forcing him to push his arms out to the side to keep from rolling face
down. He pissed himself as the pain from his arms colliding with the trees
flooded his senses with pain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The woman stopped again and got out again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Panic was setting in now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She removed the gag, saying "if you die,
I'll return you to your buddies after a long drive around and hook one of them
up. There'll be no way to tell how many of your injuries are pre mortem or post
mortem, therefore no way to tell how long it took for you to die."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She waited about twenty seconds before
moving to push the gag back in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"OKAY! I'LL HELP YOU!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Good choice," she said as she produced a

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He then saw the air ahead fill with a mist

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yep." He then pressed the talk button on

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Once all the bombs had been used, they
would need to counterattack for their own safety, that was the reason they
didn't want to be pinned down, but until Jodie could locate and knock out the metajammers,
they couldn't do anything else.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Each Legionnaire had a string to pull to
set off the bomb, the bombs had been set up in the trees and the strings were
tied to the remains of the arming wires, as soon as the wires leave the

the fuse is set to detonate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They heard movement to their east.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>That was Sandi's field of fire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Sandi was in semiautomatic mode, she tapped
off a few shots.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Eventually she heard someone fall over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She then heard something in Spanish.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She then started seeing muzzle flashes and
pulled back behind the tree she was using. There were at least ten people in
her field of fire, she considered that enough to justify the bomb.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She pulled the string and heard the
explosion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She then heard a load more Spanish dialogue
and some movement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She leaned around her tree to try to locate
anyone not within the reach of the confinement mist cloud.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She shot four people and advanced further.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Two more advanced into Daria's field of

fire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Luckily their shots were way too high while

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Everyone else's Field Of Fire filled up

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This was going to work, provided no screw
ups, and Harman had the utmost confidence in the marksmanship of his people and
their discipline.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Stand by."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He saw movement at his two o'clock, Zero
Three should have them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Stand by."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He remained perfectly still. Whatever his
camouflage was like any movement on his part would destroy any advantage he
had.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Stand by."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Two more legionnaires appeared ahead of
him, Mack and Stacy. Zero Two could have those.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Stand By."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Next two to appear were Daria and Sandi,
these two were his, he lined his reticule up on Daria, Sandi was facing away,
he could guarantee Daria would die, Sandi might acquire him the instant he
opened fire, his weapon was suppressed in order to delay discovery, suppressors
were essential in jungle warfare, your field of view is extremely limited, so
you don't know where the enemy that'll hear you is.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria and Sandi stopped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria and Sandi both turned and knocked him
out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>'Tiffany, Daria, do you need extraction?'
Thought cast Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>'Yes please,' thought Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>A couple of seconds later, Betty appeared
next to her, grabbed her, and then they were both on the <i>Gridrunner Mk 5</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Just about all the seats were now occupied
by unconscious mercenaries.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Betty disappeared again and reappeared with
another bound up mercenary.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Sandi emerged from the rear compartment and
said "Hey Tiffany, we're just about done grabbing those mercenaries, anywhere
we can drop you off?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"There's a carrier at
seventy-fourteen-twelve west, fourteen-forty five-two north, I've been trying
to return there for the last day now."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Anyone else with you?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany eventually said "yes."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Sandi asked "any injuries?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany eventually said "they're dead."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Crap, sorry to hear that."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Well, you're not dead," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Eventually Betty and Daria appeared in the
aircraft. Betty disappeared again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Two outstanding, they're the ones in the
fighters, they're within the coverage of the remaining superpower jammers, so
we're going to take the ones we've got here to prison," said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Betty reappeared with Mack and Jane and
disappeared again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Pretty good considering how we started,"
said Daria, "that was pretty tight though, a hundred milliseconds later, half
of us would have been dead, the other half probably would have been dead
alongside."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Betty reappeared with Stacy and Julia and
disappeared again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany glared at Harman, stepping close to
him and leaning against the seat in front of him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Betty reappeared with Charles and said
"That's everyone."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jodie said "Okay, returning to base."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Harman woke up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Hello, Harman," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Crap," said Harman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah, crap, and you're cranium deep in it.
... There are two girls with cat ear like horns poking out their heads, they have
telekinetic powers, have you encountered them?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Do I get time off if I tell you?" asked
Harman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I have a better prise," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany then reached into his chest. Harman
looked alarmed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Who are they?" asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Harman didn't respond.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jane asked "Tiffany, what are you doing?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany didn't answer and Harman felt a
pressure build in his heart, as if it was having to work harder to beat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The lower half of his body started to feel
cold.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What did they do to you?" asked Harman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"They killed my team, Harman, are they
worth possible tissue necrosis?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"TIFFANY!" shouted Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Tiffany, I have to agree with Jane, ease
up, this is something for him to plea bargain for, okay?" said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Daria, Jane, button it!" said Tiffany,
"those two telekinetics are a threat to SOCOM operations, and so is that precog."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I can't help you," said Harman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"YOU'RE NOT WORKING FOR A STATE, YOU'RE
WORKING FOR A DRUG CARTEL, THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU, WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE
PROTECTING?" asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"My reputation," said Harman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany pulled on the blood vessel she was
pinching shut and said "YOU FEEL THAT? ALL I HAVE TO DO IS TUG JUST A LITTLE
HARDER AND YOU ARE DEAD!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We all go through the escape and evasion
exercise in one form or another," said Harman, "your menaces are irrelevant."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany scowled and pulled down hard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Betty appeared and disappeared with Harman
almost instantly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"NO!" yelled Tiffany as she ran through
Daria to the back of the aircraft.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She didn't find him there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She turned to Daria and said "HE NEARLY
KILLED YOU! WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria and Jane shared the same look of
annoyance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"THAT'S THE THANKS I GET? HOW DO YOU THINK
I LOCATED THOSE JAMMING BEACONS? YOU SAID SO YOURSELF YOU WERE A TENTH OF A
SECOND FROM BEING KILLED BY THAT RAT BASTARD!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Ten seconds later, Betty reappeared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"He has a slight arrhythmia, but the
Corpsman said he'll live."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany went for the nearest prisoner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Betty disappeared, reappeared behind
Tiffany and then they both disappeared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>[Scene

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"WHERE IS HE?" asked Tiffany as she started
running through the bulkheads of the destroyer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>A US Marine private who had been standing
there drew his gun and asked "WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Relax, I'm NATO affiliated. Can't tell you
much beyond that as it's compartmentalised, sorry," said Betty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany reappeared saying "HE'S NOT HERE!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"YOU THINK I'D TAKE YOU TO HIM?" asked
Betty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I'LL KILL YOU!" said Tiffany as she went
for him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Betty teleported to a position four metres
behind Tiffany along the corridor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany reached into the marine standing there,
alarming the private.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Betty nodded saying "you'd kill your own to
pressure me to talk?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Eventually Tiffany looked at the marine
private and slowly withdrew her hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Other marines appeared from the ends of the
corridor, all drawing their guns and pointing them at the intruders, shouting
at them to show their hands.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>When they stopped, Betty said "If you're
calm now, I'll teleport you to the tower. We're not going anywhere near the
aircraft, I can't trust you not to try to kill any of the other prisoners. I'm
sorry you lost your mates in action, but that comes with the territory, YOU CAN
NOT LOSE CONTROL LIKE THAT! ... NOT ... EVER!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Eventually Tiffany walked over to Betty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She turned away from him, and he stepped
forward and touched her back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They appeared in a Legion Tower conference room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They stood in silence for a couple of
minutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Eventually Tiffany said "I guess I'd better
not be here when they get back."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I could talk to them, try to calm them
down, but I think you're out of the reserves too," said Betty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Why the hell couldn't they have let me
kill him?" asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"LEO doctrine: Protect your prisoner," said
Betty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany chuckled for a few seconds and said
"I wonder if I could have screwed things up any worse? I don't think I could,
but did I miss anything?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Betty said "I don't think I can help you
any more. ... I'm going to try to smooth things over. ... You going to be okay?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany said "No ... ... go on."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Betty eventually teleported out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany said to herself "Well, at least I
settled things between Daria and Jane."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>About a minute later, Tiffany walked to the
nearest elevator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>[Scene
Separator]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"YOU SENSED IT, SHE WAS GOING TO KILL HIM!"
said Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"YEAH, BUT THAT WAS IN AN INTERROGATION,
I'M TALKING ABOUT COMBAT SURVIVAL," replied Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"WHAT HAS COMBAT SURVIVAL GOT TO DO WITH
PRISONER ABUSE?" asked Jane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"WHAT HAS PRISONER ABUSE GOT TO DO WITH
COMBAT SURVIVAL?" asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As Jane and Daria relaxed into an argument,
Betty turned to Stacy and said "I know Tiffany's out of the reserves too, and
you got procedure to follow, any reason you can't remain on friendly terms with
her?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Friendly terms? Betty, she attempted
murder, and I'm guessing here, but that ALSO goes against the SEAL manual,
doesn't it?" replied Stacy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>" ... ... A little," admitted Betty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"WELL THEN WHY SHOULD I BE HER FRIEND AT
ALL?" asked Stacy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Because if several Legionnaires got killed
in front of you and the guy who did it ended up in your custody, you'd be
tempted too, would you not?" asked Betty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"NO EXCUSE!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I KNOW!"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"SO WHAT SHOULD I DO?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Betty thought about it. Eventually he said
"Help her." He then looked at the prisoners sat all around them and said "Come
on," as he walked to the cockpit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>[Scene
Separator]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany stepped off the elevator on the
basement floor of the Legion Annex, her bags in tow, and met Stacy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I'd have been out of here sooner, but I
had to rent a trailer," said Tiffany as she continued on to her car.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Betty talked to me about you," said Stacy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Improve your mood any?" asked Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Daria's testimony plus the corpsman on the
aircraft carrier would be sufficient to put you away. Even received a phone
call from your CO talking about starting a JAGNAV investigation into your
attempt to murder Retired Major Harman Roberts."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Crap," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Indeed," said Stacy. "I managed to get it
halted. You're valuable enough that as long as you receive counselling from an
approved shrink and complete the course of treatment, the investigation remains
frozen. If it ever thaws, there's enough to secure a conviction, and you're too
much of a security risk for Leavenworth, so ... "</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right," said Tiffany. The other places she
might end up include 'The John' (as in 'Smells like a') in Puerto Rico, tropics
and skimping on the sewage system in favour of the security measures made it
smell like an open sewer, 'The Kiln' in Arizona, the luxury that got cut there
was decent air conditioning, and 'The Well' in Alaska, this facility was deep
underground and drew energy off a geothermal system, so heat wasn't a problem,
heating things was usually easier than cooling it. That was the most secure
metahuman prison, that's where she'd be serving out her sentence if she ever
received one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Stacy eventually said "Daria seemed to
sympathise with you for some reason, hid by her piss poor attempt to resemble a
logical Vulcan, but she seemed to be arguing against Jane on policy to distract
Jane from your misdeed."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"I suppose it would be inappropriate to
offer my gratitude for her sentiments," said Tiffany.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That's Daria for you," said Stacy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany eventually asked "Is it likely I'll
ever be welcome if I show up for Christmas or birthdays or whatever?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We'll see," said Stacy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right. ... Bye."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Tiffany continued on to her car and packed
the remaining cases in her trailer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She then sat in her car and turned the
power on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She programmed the satellite navigation
system with the post code for a storage company so she could stick her kit
somewhere safe while she decided where she would ...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She sat back and tried to work out why she
was even crying, it's not like she had been back that often since she had
enlisted, let alone after she passed selection for SEAL.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Stupid emotions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Stupid anger management issues.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>How the fornicate did that even start anyway?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Eventually the tears stopped flowing and
Tiffany did up her seatbelt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She started the engine and looked around,
pressing the clutch down and selecting 1<sup>st</sup>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She released the handbrake and set off,
turning towards the car park exit. The device controlling the
electromagnetically actuated block of concrete recognised her vehicle and the
block dropped into the road, letting her out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She emerged from the tunnel and was on her
way to her new home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>But first she had to pull over at the
nearest lay by so that her damn tear ducts could finish discharging AGAIN!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Not that she was in any danger from
anything she might collide with, her ability had developed to the point where
she could make the car and trailer intangible, but other drivers she phased
through would likely kill themselves after they enter what they think is a
collision. Stacy was right about one thing: Tiffany needed a shrink.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Sal and Val entered the airport's
administration building and found themselves surrounded by a number of very
irate gangsters, Waldo among them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"What happened?" asked Val, her tone
showing annoyance rather than fear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"We lost," said Waldo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"How?" asked Sal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Someone took out our metajammers," said
Waldo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"How'd that happen?" asked Val.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Maybe someone told that SEAL where they
were," said Waldo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Like that sentry who ran off with your <i>technical</i>
after his buddies saw him being dragged off by aforementioned SEAL?" asked Sal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No way would one of our people betray us
like that," said Waldo, "they're too aware of how we deal with traitors."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This was a moment when both Diclonii felt
like they needed an aspirin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You, along with the rest of the screwing
planet, do not have a monopoly on torture," Val finally said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Yeah? Maybe you'll have a different view
on the matter shortly before we kill you," said Waldo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That's a statement of intent to detain and
attack us, is it?" asked Sal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Both Diclonii then realised that they
couldn't use their vectors. The look of annoyance on their faces was apparently
apparent to Waldo because he said "We didn't tell you about that jammer, did
we."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No, you didn't," said Val.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The gangsters closed in on them, prompting
Val and Sal to roll their eyes in disdain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"You know how the Legion had a Force Recon
Marine train them?" asked Val.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Nes?" asked Waldo, barely breathing
through his mouth as blood from his nose poured down his throat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"So did we, we didn't tell you about that,
did we?" asked Sal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Oh, oou iii-and," replied Waldo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Sal and Val then shot him with the guns
they had captured.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They looked around the room full of dead
cartel members.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Val then pulled her satellite phone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She dialled her boss.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Hi Val, just saw Harman's mercenaries in Leavenworth, what happened?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"That screwing SEAL turned off all the
jammers, and Waldo blamed us," said Val, "foresee any business yet?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"No, just Harman and his people. Legion
like capturing those guys, maybe we can use that to get the Legion out our way,
got enough money to return to the States?"</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Think so," said Val.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay, get to Platte in Missouri, I'll see
if I can focus my visions on the clink and see if I can have a plan for you,"
said their employer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Right boss," said Val before she hung up
and said "Platte, Missouri."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>"Okay," said Sal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They wouldn't go direct, that was never a
