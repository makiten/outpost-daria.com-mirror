good in the eyes of their superiors. The fact was that Tiffany&rsquo;s
CO would never hear the intimate second by second details or even of
the important details that Tiffany would reveal, all he would hear is
that Tiffany was fit for duty or not fit for duty, but there was a
strong possibility that Tiffany would not open up, not give him the
information he needs to guide her through her issues, and she would
spend a couple of decades doing nothing for herself or for her

reviewed what Lucy had revealed about her past so far: A Japanese mad
science firm had captured her and done a bunch of experiments on her,
and other similar mutants. She broke out and sustained a GSW to the
head from some kind of AP 12.5mm round, that split her personality
for a while. Some kid took her and another Diclonius in. She then got
engaged by the mad scientists private army, she kept dismembering
them.</P>

got engaged by Mariko, total sociopath diclonius, Mariko beat the
faeces out of Lucy, knocking a horn off, Apparently Mariko was then
attacking Nana, when one of the mad scientists grew a conscience and
somehow managed to relocate Mariko to an empty area, and explosives
placed inside Mariko (to menace co-operation out of her) were set
off. Someone less conscientious was then going to shoot Nana, but
Lucy intervened, then Lucy got engaged again by more of these mercs,
her other horn was shot off, following this Lucy elected to piss off,
taking measures to draw the mad scientists away from the kid that had
taken her in, and ultimately emigrated from Japan.</P>

not the rules of war, we could generally exclude anyone who is

met Wanda as planned, Tiffany sitting down with a burger meal that
cost about 1.5 times that of a McDonalds plastic burger meal, only it
tasted and filled like real food. Apparently this place was a meta
hangout. She chuckled as she remembered what her fashion club diet
was like, salad, celery sticks, no meat, not enough to fill you up.
Then they started training under Force Recon instructors and learned
about real nutrition. You want protein, you want complex
carbohydrates, and you want vitamins and minerals, and for
bodybuilding you want lots of them. Of course Sandi and Quinn
insisted on the fad diet, so she and Stacy followed suit until about
the third PE session that had to be attended by Corpsmen utilising
intravenous lines to feed them Glucose brine.</P>

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Coast

</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Fair

Callisto was an able leader and the Morlocks had been fairly good
opponents, but Tiffany also wondered how she&rsquo;d deal with any
directions Tiffany might give.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Callisto

</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nana was
in worship of Director Kurama. He had to explain what Kurama had told

homosapian, and following that explanation she had resolved herself
(after a brief crying jag) to kill him.</P>

</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Then he
found out about her prosthetic limbs. She revealed this fact by

Nana probably didn&rsquo;t need her vectors to deflect that round,
which skipped off her head.</P>

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She

was Mariko bouncing Nana off the road, Kurama (after meeting him and
getting his prosthesis changed out and getting him to accompany him
to rescue Nana) went to rescue Nana, she&rsquo;d fallen off the
bridge after disabling Mariko&rsquo;s vectors, he then saw Lucy with
that kid Kouta, He chased Lucy off, she got the upper hand again,
then Lucy was like &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t see me again,&rdquo; and
left him there.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

that none of our rounds could get through, we only had one 12.5mm
rifle.&rdquo; A woman stumbled into view, carrying a tray with a cup

not people, just like the Tutsis of Rwanda, the Jews of Germany, the

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One useful
fact Haruka had learned was that the building was still under
construction, it was being done upside down. The piles that were sunk
went all the way to the bedrock, which wasn&rsquo;t that far down
anyway, and they were now cutting through rock. The nice thing about
the rock was that it was way harder than the concrete they were using
could ever be, so they could just carve the main structure out of
that, only using the concrete to isolate the stone from any
mechanical shock that could fracture it.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The useful
thing about it was that every floor had an identical layout, and the
metajammers were isolated in separate wells on separate power
sources. This was to make it impossible for rampaging prisoners to
access the metajammers, but Daria and Charles had an L1 with PFTs,
what they should be able to do is climb to about 80000 ft, and attack
all the metajammers vertically. The PFT shafts had access structures
located around the perimeter of the building, so aiming should be
well easy.</P>

seal the hatch, Vaseline to prevent adherence to the hatch surface,
the door jamb surface had a lip that the hot glue would freeze
around, water pressure would press the hatch against the seal, and
the seal would be locked solid around the jamb, provided they don&rsquo;t

Things have changed since world war two,&rdquo; said Tiffany, &ldquo;A
submarine could attack from hundreds of metres deep, sonar look up
and look down is unlimited, and torpedoes are wire guided by the
ship&rsquo;s computer, command detonated, and big. They&rsquo;ll be
detonated at a distance of ten to fifteen metres from the hull, it&rsquo;ll
break the ship in half instead of just poking a hole in the side.
PFTs can penetrate some way into the sea at their full setting, but
it&rsquo;s like shooting buck shot into the water, you won&rsquo;t
get much more than ten or twenty metres before the pressure drops too
far below the threshold we&rsquo;d need.&rdquo;</P>

to chasing terrorists, Japan could throw that in the SecState&rsquo;s
face, tie up the politicians for months. Fact is, I don&rsquo;t think
Japan has any reason to fear retaliation as long as this is all they

Diclonius was probably on that Orion since before I even first

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Okay,
problem with that is that boyfriends mean self esteem issues,

attractive as a regurgitated meal.&rdquo;</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her lack
of people skills would just screw everything up, People might find
her attractive, or so the news magazines Stacy shoves in her face
would have it, but there was just no way any relationship she would
attempt would last more than a few copulations and then word would
get out that she had all the warmth of Bose Einstein condensate, and
the next news magazine Stacy shoves in her face would influentially
say &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go there,&rsquo; so no way was she putting
herself through that.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Realistically,
she&rsquo;d need to go for a relationship with another meta, the
problem was the numbers she could casually interact with, it was not
like she could just go on a pub crawl for single metahuman men out on
the pull, the only realistic sources of candidates were the Legion,
who she&rsquo;d have to live with after she screwed things up, the
Xavier Institute &hellip; &hellip; Yeah, right, SHIELD, who would
think it&rsquo;s a rouse to complete an operation because she would
be too stressed to approach them calmly, and the USAES, who she had
no idea how to approach for dates without people raising questions
about her sanity.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not that
her sanity was above question as it was, but she knew what she was
doing on operations, knew what she was after and how to get it,
however crazy her tactics appeared, but it was apparently blatantly
obvious to Charles that Jane and Tom were over (but didn&rsquo;t want
to admit it for whatever reason) whereas Daria had no clue how to
read whatever Charles was reading.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No fun, no
comfort, no relaxation, there was absolutely nothing about seeking a
romantic partner that in the least attracted Daria. If that was
supposed to improve her mood, it seemed like the worst way
conceivable to go about doing it. Receiving affection may be
pleasurable, but chasing it? No way.</P>

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany
took a few minutes to get used to the way the wing worked, but once
she did, she started her approach to the ship.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The plan
was insane, Tiffany was going to have to go right up in front of the
propellers, the slightest lapse in judgement and she would be
pre-sliced shark food.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She
decided to go for the furthest one first. The nearest one would be
better, if the bow of the ship could end up in the blast of the
container ship&rsquo;s propellers, that could cause the ship to
capsize, probably get them well out of the range of their CIWS, but
that was impossible without putting the parawing through the port or
centre propeller.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She would

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She pushed
the lance into the propeller shaft cowling, squeezing the handle that
would release the full flow of the ozone.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She cut a
circle in the shroud big enough to admit the lance.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That done,
she plunged it in, and eventually there was a loud bang and the
propeller came out, it ended up resting against the rudder.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany
let go of the lance and worked on retracting herself up the rope so
she could approach the centre propeller.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She cut

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arakawa

</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The idea
was that if the Japanese fire first, they lose all rights to complain
when she shoots back.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One
nagging concern she had was that the torpedo would end up chasing the
enemy torpedo instead of the submarine. She had isolated a submarine
specific frequency, but it could be that the torpedo will also
generate the same frequency.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She
eventually heard a hiss and then a sudden screaming noise. Torpedoes
weren&rsquo;t built for acoustic stealth, so they were loud. Arakawa
hit the switch.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She heard
a second noise erupt. Their own torpedo would probably arrive at the
enemy submarine before the enemy torpedo hit them because their own
torpedo had a tail current whereas the enemy torpedo had a head
current.</P>
