<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Julia entered the office and Agent Fleming said "I take
it you have a message for me?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Some questions, actually. What led you to believe the
Legion are terrorists? And why the hell didn't any of you talk to me about your
concerns?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"You're a Legionnaire too, that tells us where your loyalties
lie."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"I also have moral standards, Agent Fleming, my fellow
Legionnaires act in an unacceptable manner, I won't support or enable it," said
Julia.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Moral standards. ... Osama has moral standards," replied
Agent Fleming.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"No he doesn't. He just wants to take over the world.
What makes you think the Legion are terrorists?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"You helped Al Qaeda attack Japan, and you stole reactor
fuel for what can only be terroristic purposes."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"We're mortally opposed to Al Qaeda and anyone like them,
we didn't attack anything or anyone in Japan, and we were busy preventing death
and destruction in Chicago when Harman's people stole that nuclear fuel, and
you keep skipping past anything even resembling evidentiary links, do you even
have any evidentiary links?" asked Julia.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"We have a tip off predicting your attack before the
attack, right when it was predicted for, we have an Osama video claiming credit
for the attack, then we had a tip-off that you guys would be attacking
Chicago-"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"These tip-offs were probably from that precog we've been
chasing. You're being manipulated," said Julia.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"The tips have been accurate so far," said Fleming.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Precog," reminded Julia.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Regardless, we've sent Daria off for interrogation,
we'll have our answers soon."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"The correct answers or the answers you want to hear?"
asked Julia. "You know why none of the other branches of government use
extraordinary renditions?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"You don't take your jobs seriously?" asked Fleming.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Julia laughed and said "how the hell do you keep a
straight face? It's because these interrogations contaminate the evidence, they
make prosecution impossible, it makes a mess."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"It also gets us the information we need to act fast,"
said Fleming.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Okay, and how's that been working out?" asked Julia. "We
both know the Legion has no interest in assisting terrorists. What's this
really about?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"It's about keeping America safe," said Fleming.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"No it's not," said Julia.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"That's because you're too close to see the forest. 'If
you don't choose the future you want, you don't get the future you want.' How
the hell doesn't that set off alarm bells?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"You're on the Legion's case for getting people to take
an interest in their future?" asked Julia.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"They're too loosely defined in their purpose," said
Fleming, "I believe you yourself expressed concern about this."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Out of concern for their survival," said Julia, "I'm now
getting that having such an open ended purpose helps them do more good. That
saying about a 'Jack of all trades is a master of none', that's not very accurate,
in fact, the Legion has become one of the most adaptable organisations created."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"The problem with them being so open ended, is that they
could decide to try their hand at being a government. What if one day they
decide it's ... for the best?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"You mean, like, a violent overthrow of the US and other
nation governments? Undo everything they've worked to achieve?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"They have such an open ended role, why not?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Because it's wrong," said Julia.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Oh, right, well in that case, we can just stop worrying
about them, can't we?" Said Fleming.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"You don't really think the Legion are perpetrating the
current crisis, you're just using the current crisis as an excuse to nip an
imagined problem in the bud," said Julia.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Where's your proof?" asked Fleming.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Everywhere. So many agents have jumped ship because of
how retarded they perceive the management to be. Then there's your history
prior to entering the CIA, remember when you were in the BATF? Your colleagues
and supervisors felt you were lazy in your thinking, ham fisted in your
deductions, and speaking of fists, did you get a boner every time you ordered a
cavity search, or was that just an extension of your lazy thinking?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Have you heard of professional courtesy?" asked Agent
Fleming.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Says the man who just took interagency rivalry to a
whole new level," said Julia, "I'd say we're done for now. Take my advice and
release Daria. If we have to extract her, you're going to get crap canned, big
time." With that she left.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing align=center style='text-align:center'>]:::[</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"It's them all right," said Stacy, as she sniffed around
the nuclear material flask.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Wasn't it just a little dangerous to be using explosives
around enriched uranium?" asked Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Not really, that is, provided there's a flask around
it," said Jodie, "aside from that, they have two diclonii with them."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"How'd that protect them from a nuclear explosion?" asked
Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Making fissionable material explode like that isn't that
simple," said Jodie, "you need to make a supercritical mass quickly enough and
keep it together long enough for enough uranium to undergo fission for the
blast you want before the fuel disperses too thinly to continue fission. It's
not very efficient, tactical nukes barely use up any of their fuel, most of it
remains as the uranium or plutonium it started off as."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Really?" asked Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Really," said Jodie, "another advantage we have for the
moment is that they can't use it as is, if Harman has any sense, he'd have
picked up an engineer or two for designing custom vehicles and weapon systems,
most engineers could transfer their skills to building a nuclear weapon very
easily, most engineering disciplines require the same mathematical skills, at
least some chemistry theory."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"That doesn't sound very advantageous to us," said Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"The part that is advantageous to us is that they'd have
to build a fuel processing plant," said Jodie, "reactor fuel ain't bomb fuel,
especially this stuff, it's alloyed with aluminium, makes it easier to handle
once it's been expended, makes it less likely to melt down, the process needed
involves reacting the metals with a halogen such as fluorine, that turns the
alloy into salts of the component metals, then you can distil, dissolve,
precipitate the uranium or aluminium out of the mixture, then you reduce the
uranium using electricity. Biggest question will be how quickly he wants to get
this all done?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Assume fast, next couple of days or so," said Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Small to medium industrial plot, the need for
hydrofluoric acid in the process makes things really difficult because you also
need to reduce the uranium when you're done, and that isn't exactly easy, he's
going to have to rotate his men to limit exposure and provide healing time
because gamma rays are corrosive to organic materials," said Jodie, "He'll also
want to set up all the moulds so that he can get the uranium straight in there
without having the change anything in their equipment between stages, any time
you stop, dismantle and re-rig, you risk contamination, and no amount of
money's any good to you if you're dead."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Money," said Jane, "Riddle me this: What the hell does
our precog expect to make from all this? How many movies have there been where
some idiot tries to extort money through nuclear terrorism, and instead gets
their ass handed to them?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Smart people have stupid moments too. More likely though
is that she'll try to sell her wares or sell strikes. Same industry as before,
except with bigger weapons," said Jodie.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"To who?" asked Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Given the ethical salesmanship she's demonstrated so
far, her list of approved customers probably include everyone from Al Qaeda to
the Zapatistas. She'd have an easier time hitting targets in the United States
since that's where here is, crossing borders with nuclear fuel is a pain in the
ass, so she'll probably approach Al Qaeda and Aryan Nations first and
foremost."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Al Qaeda who hate women, Nazis who hate metas," said
Stacy.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Mercenaries who don't care, money is money is money,
money, money," said Jodie, "She'll also have to notify her prospective
customers of a nuclear strike at a given time, probably not a location so it
doesn't get back to the authorities in time for them to do anything about it,
and demonstrate a weapon at that time."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"So no matter what, at least one city will get smoked,"
said Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;</span>"Unless we find
them first," said Jodie, "Also, to keep from alienating prospective customers,
she'll probably want to ensure that the demonstration doesn't kill any of her
potential client's operatives, so middle of nowhere might seem better for her."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"I have a trail," said Stacy, "vehicle moved this way,"
she followed the scent. The rest of them followed her.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Here we are," said Wanda, "Stay frosty."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Wanda knocked on the door of the street level apartment
in the street in the town in the woods of Bolivia. Their next best hope after
that Japanese institute was the theatre where the precog and his or her
diclonii were recently so long active.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A man in a Hawaiian shirt and beige trousers packing an
MP5k opened it and asked "What?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"You know your rivals that were fighting the Legion a
while back?" asked Wanda.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Yes?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"We're interested in any intel anyone could provide on
them," said Wanda.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"How interested?" asked the man.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"We're their enemy," said Wanda.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"And you being their enemy makes you our friend?" asked
the man.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Something like that," said Wanda. "Our interest is
rather specific, they recently had an advantage over you, right?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Yeah, they had those aberrants and a precog that only
seemed to communicate over the phone," said the man.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Wanda and Tiffany refrained from commenting on his use of
the word 'Aberrant', although Tiffany was thinking of exiting through the wall
next to the door when it came time to leave.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Any conversations that anyone recorded would help. Bonus
if it's audio," said Wanda.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Alright, come in, have a seat, I'll have the information
for you soon."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Callisto looked around as she and Lucy wandered around
the Honolulu beach front.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"How do they manage to fit in so well?" asked Callisto.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Who?" asked Lucy.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"The diclonii we freed," said Callisto. "The whole trip,
they were pretty much dressed the same, like some kind of army or something, in
the institute, they were like concentration camp inmates, now they've made
contact with their relatives and friends, they're ... "</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There were diclonii involved in various activities, some
were sunbathing, others surfing on rented boards, some shopping, all were
dressed in as wide a variety of clothing as the humans milling around them.
Some even had religious items such as crucifix or Star of David necklaces, or
Islamic head scarves (imagine being in a religion where most the imagery
depicts people with horns as being evil). Pictures of naked prisoners don't
have much effect unless you actually realise that the naked people ARE IN FACT
PEOPLE. People with personal styles, tastes, personality quirks, friends,
families, histories, interests, thoughts, seeing them now reinforced the scale
of the crime that had been committed against them.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"It probably helps that having experienced life in a concentration
camp, suddenly funny looks caused by their horns are nothing," said Lucy.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Yeah, as helpful as that gets anyway," said Callisto.
"I'm really sick of living in a sewer. Why can't we find homes that don't smell
like the inside of someone's deceased ass to live in?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Because I'm a recovering serial killer and the rest of
us are faeces ugly," said Lucy.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A diclonius woman stopped next to them and said "I'm
holding a meeting at seventeen o'clock in auditorium no. 5 at our hotel, could
you come?" she held out a leaflet which held a time and place, no decorative
trim or anything.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"What's it about?" asked Lucy.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"I have a proposal to make, I want to make it to everyone
together," said the woman.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Ohhhhh-kay," agreed Lucy as she accepted the leaflet.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Thanks," said the woman as she continued on, approaching
every diclonius in sight.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"A proposal?" asked Callisto.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Yeah. She's nervous about it," said Lucy.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The scientist finished explaining to the next guy how to
introduce the hydrofluoric acid to the reactor fuel and walked over to the rest
area.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They were casting the parts for one bomb at a time.
Everything else was set up including the fractioning tower.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They had also set up a mass spectrometer. If they could
get away with broader temperature differences in temperature, they<span

people might increase the number of informants available to us," said Wanda, "speaking
of informants, one of the rival cartels to the one that our favourite precog
was working for, we have her voice on a flash drive, should be good for voice
match, might even give us clues about her background."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Okay, upload it and e-mail it."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Might need to talk to NCIS about this," said Tiffany, "our
precog seemed to use naval terminology when she gets stressed or tired,
referred to doors as 'hatches', described Harman's people as 'good for army
people,' and one conversation following my first encounter with the diclonii,
she referred to me as a 'damn squid', I mean, she could be throwing the phrases
in there in case the conversation get's listened in on, but I am getting a
strong Marine Corps feel off of her."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Marine corps? Someone who was discharged or who quit out
of dissatisfaction maybe?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Other locations got mentioned, they mentioned Chechnya,"
said Tiffany, "we're going to try Russia for after action reports from their
operation, see if anyone ever happened across two diclonius women or across any
sliced up dead people."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Okay, let me know when you get there, I'll talk to some
people I know in the People's protectorate and the RRB," said Fury.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Rocket Red Brigade?" asked Tiffany.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Yeah, why?" asked Fury.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"No reason," said Tiffany, with barely any opacity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When they hung up, Wanda asked "Anything that should
affect my risk assessment?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"As a meta-cop, you encounter artificially induced mutations
all the time, don't you?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Yeesh, enough said, so RRB's mainly or all ... "</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Yep," said Tiffany.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"And the People's Protectorate?" Asked Wanda.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Russian version of you guys," said Tiffany, "slightly
Stasi-ish, used to go by the name Supreme Soviets, some people defected in the
cold war, haven't really encountered them in the field, never had them come up
in any briefings, more stuff I sought out myself. I guess we'll find out what
they're like when we get there."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Julia landed in the field and walked up behind Jane and
Stacy as they watched the plaster as it took the shape of the tyre imprint in
the mud.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"See what you mean about Fleming," said Julia as she
approached them, "David Koresh could scam him. How we doing here?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Mack and Tom are looking in through windows at business
parks and industrial estates from nearest out, hopefully they'll find something
resembling a nuclear processing plant. So far they've led police to three meth
labs and four moonshine stills," said Jane, "Brittany and Jodie are talking to
as many cops as possible, at superintendent level or highest each jurisdiction
failing that has to offer failing that, at least they're co-operating with us,
anyone at the federal level's being a dick about assisting us as per policy re.
Terrorist watch list nominees. What led this idiot to list us as terrorists
anyway?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Apparently Fleming has an agenda, and this was just a
convenient opportunity to forward it. Daria's ... ... Got any leads for me to
pursue?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jane didn't really need to hear Julia say that Daria had
been flown out to some place where amendments against cruel and unusual
punishment and self incrimination don't exist and the Geneva convention is out
and out ignored, and what Julia did in switching to asking about the case went
back to what Jane had been saying earlier about the greater urgency the missing
enriched uranium presented.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This was not a matter of procedure, or law or anything
like that, the fact was that if they didn't get that fissile material back,
massive numbers of people would die, and not just in the blast, but beyond as
the fallout contaminates people through contact, through ingestion, people
would just keep dying after the event.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Question is what would Daria make of that when they
finally turn their attention to rescuing her? Would she understand the reason
for the decision or would she be unable to see beyond her pain?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jane hoped they would find that uranium fast.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

of Harman's folks, I can handle the tyre tread cast from here."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Any idea what this is about?" asked Lucy.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"No," said Nana.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was just about enough room to seat all the diclonii
that had shown up.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eventually the diclonius that had handed out the leaflets
walked over to the podium and turned on the microphone. "Okay, your attention
please?" The room quietened. "Thank you. I'm Sarah Fontaine, I'm here to
propose an action, and it'll sound absurd, but I hope you all will stay for the
entire length of this meeting and seriously consider what I'm proposing. ... Okay,
now, having come out of that torture camp, you all probably don't feel that
lucky, but we were lucky to get out of that camp at all, and we were lucky that
SHIELD agent and that ... Coast guardsman," she had trouble keeping a straight
face when reciting the story Tiffany had told them about being in the coast
guard, but the concept of a deniable operation was not lost on them, " ... we
were lucky they helped us stay free when that submarine and that battleship
showed up. ... Our next stroke of luck was that the United States INS has
granted us permission to stay instead of returning us to sender. Our situation
has been precarious since our births, and we somehow made it. ... It is time to
capitalise on this luck and give something back. ... Okay, this is what I'm
proposing, and you're probably going to be asking yourselves 'well, how's this
our problem?' ... Well, we weren't our rescuer's problem, they helped us, and I
for one don't want to feel like an asshole sponger."</p>

showroom.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Stacy homed in on a red 2.5T truck. She pulled a Geiger
counter.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"I doubt they'll have contaminated it," said Julia, "they
want to live, remember?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Right," said Stacy.</p>

said Julia.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A man in a suit approached them asking "Interested in
this truck or just browsing? Either's good, but any questions, I'm here. Laos,
if you're willing to endorse my business, I'd be willing to offer a discount."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Yeah, who sold you this truck?" asked Julia.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"I can find out, but whatever it's service history, you
can rest assured we made good any flaws," he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"These are new mud flaps," said Stacy, "Paint smells new,

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Julia said "we're running an investigation, when did you
receive this truck?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Well, at least a week-" said the man.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"BEFORE you attempt to lie to me, you need to know that
my friend here has enhanced smell, and she's smelling a number of individuals
who stole a shipment of fissionable material yesterday, so by lying to us,
you're aiding terrorists, and we still have lots and lots of lovely Federal
prisons that you could visit on the government's dime! The food's great - and
you'll love the nightlife. Now, who did this truck come from?" asked Julia.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They pulled over and the men driving the truck with the
uranium on it swapped with two from the minibus in front.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Boss, all the fuel's been reacted," said the man who had
been fluoridising the material.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Val, Sal, do we have a safe destination yet? We've been
changing our minds every four hours," asked Harman.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Our boss just said she'd call when she had a plan," said
Sal.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Right, don't suppose she'd be willing to tell us what it
is that keeps happening?" asked Harman.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Same thing?" asked Val.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Why'd you ask about that?" asked Sal.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"So it is the same thing? That case, what is it?" asked
Harman.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>" ... We don't know either," said Val.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"We keep asking but she keeps saying she needs to figure
this out," said Sal, "this is a little creepy, first three times, she did say
'Cops will be there', but then she stopped talking to us."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Information control could seem essential to her for
diagnosis of the problem," said Val.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"She might also suspect one of your me-"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"No," said Harman.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Sooo, this, Nintendo detector?" asked Brittany as Jodie
and Charles loaded it onto the Gridrunner.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Neutrino detector," said Jodie, "Charles and I have been
working on it for a while, it seems to work, it should detect Harman's uranium
as it undergoes beta decay."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Neutrinos lose so little energy that they are a good way
of working out what's going on in a stellar core without having to wait for the
heat to make it's way through the star's mantle," said Charles, "it won't
matter how much lead they put on that uranium, the neutrinos will get through."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Problem is we'd need to be in the path of those
neutrinos, U235 has a really long half life, and with us being on the terrorist
watch list, overflying population centres at two or three hundred AGL is going
to get us some attention," said Jodie.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"No way around it," said Brittany.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Nope. Charles will accompany me with a load of
confinement mist bombs, that way, as soon as we find these assholes, we can
contain them," said Jodie, she then added "provided they haven't set up any
radiation containment fields."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Well, what happens if they do have those containment
fields?" asked Brittany.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"We fail to notice them," said Jodie.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Oh, okay. I guess I should stay here and watch the
phones," said Brittany "I mean, I know how to fight a mean war, but I'm not so
good at investigation."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Well, we're investigating former special forces
mercenaries," said Jodie, "in fact, thinking about it, I think there's a good
chance our precog is also ex military. Something about her style and the
breadth of her knowledge. Harman's not been planning that much of this, the
precog had to set things up and hand out instructions to get Harman's men to do
what was needed, I wonder if-"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"What?" asked Brittany.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"That DNA sample Rochelle PD entered into CODIS should
have been back by now. If the precog's ex military, her DNA would be on record,
but that could be blocked, metro cops wouldn't get an answer off of CODIS, but
the applicable military cops would be notified. Except they're all looking
either for us or the Uranium, case notes saying dead people in a house might
not grab their attention," said Jodie.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"You mean no one will follow it up?" asked Brittany.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"If they don't, I will," said Jodie.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"My tastebuds are discussing a mutiny," said one of
Harman's men "I may need to execute some of them to quell it."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"You know the radiological diet," said Harman "minimum
biotic, and the least biotic foods are-"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Energy foods, I know boss," said the soldier as he
peeled back the cover and added the boiling water to the pot noodle.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They had been doing this for a day before the train
robbery, and now they had to continue until they were done handling the uranium
close in. As soon as they got their bombs built, they could basically keep
their distance most of the time, only handling the device to deliver it to
their targets.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>But they would still need to stay on the minimum biotic
diet until they were no longer dealing with the bombs and even then they'd have
to wait at least a week to allow their bowels to fully heal. This seemed really
pointless with their radiation containment fields preventing both gamma rays
and neutrinos from escaping, but in the event that the field generator packed
in, they would need o be able to continue without until the field generator
could be repaired.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The plan was to bury the devices in concrete. These
particular weapons would be about the size of a typical trash can, the plan was
to find a nowhere spot that was in the middle of a population centre they would
offer to hit in exchange for a load of money.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>But only if they could get the material reduced.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They were able to park up in lay bys and get on with
distillation there, but if they had to use their vehicle batteries or a
portable generator to reduce the hex, this regime would continue for months.
Worse, they'd be using even more energy keeping the condenser at the correct
temperature over that longer period of time, and stopping and restarting the
process as you constantly relocate is a serious inconvenience.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They were now completely off the road and had been so for
way too long, what were they-</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Boss, possible contact, tree copse at our eleven
o'clock," said the driver.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Everyone in the vehicle readied themselves with their
weapons, one soldier near the back window signalled the alert to the driver in
the processing van.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The processing van stopped and the lead van continued
until they were at the minimum response time in the event of a rocket or
missile launch.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They stopped and disembarked, forming a line. They slowly
advanced on the copse until they arrived and saw the five soft walled trucks
parked within.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They quickly worked to check there were no x-rays
loitering.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"So, what was in that one?" asked Harman.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Generator, five hundred kVA, and there's about twelve
cube metres of diesel fuel," said the first soldier.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"How do you figure?" asked Wanda.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"You have three people, they make statements, two are in
sync, one isn't, the liar is ... ?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Probably the one out of sync, but not necessarily," said
Wanda, "They're not all RRB you know. Most these after actions came from
regular army."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"That's where Rocket Reds get their attitude," said
Tiffany, "a product of the prevailing attitude towards the internationally
accepted rules of war, they're used to tough people scaring populations into
obedience, and can't seem to grasp why it doesn't seem to work in Chechnya.
These reports claim they got to the location after the Chechen rebels gleefully
murdered the locals. Guess why they usually get away with their claims?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Russians and Chechyans use the same small arms?" guessed
Wanda.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"The two in sync are Amnesty International and the Central
Intelligence Agency. AIs observers in the Chechyan population, CIA spooks in
the Russian Army. Of course, the presence of the spooks is classified, so their
testimony will never appear in any war crimes tribunal. "</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Okay, so we want some candour and the Russians don't
want to be candid," said Wanda, "any suggestions?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Tiffany sighed, starting to re-box the folders and said
"I have a few ideas, I just don't like them, and if you want to double our
progress, neither will you."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Wanda looked apprehensive. She eventually asked "what do
you have in mind?"</p>

Gridiron game.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"This had better get us the information we need," growled
Wanda as she ad Tiffany stood there in their short skirts and tube tops and
medium heeled boots.</p>

Wanda.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One interesting thing about running an undercover
operation is that you generally keep your personal details as similar as
possible, that way you don't have to think as hard as you lie your ass off to
your subjects.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Hello pretty ladies," slurred one soldier.</p>

the other's a SHIELD cop. Can you guess which of us is which?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>And sometimes you don't have to lie at all, just omit
that you're there on business.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Which navy? You sound foreign," said a soldier.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"What do you mean 'which navy'? The only navy on the
planet is the United States Navy, everyone else just has a collection of boats
and morons," said Tiffany, prompting some "Oooooh,"s.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>And sometimes you just have to take a chance and start
dissing the armed forces to which a drunken crowd with NVQs in killing people

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Tiffany dear, that's not nice," purred Wanda.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Tiffany chuckled and replied "Yeah, your right, we
shouldn't hold these guys to our standards," she then said to the crowd "Yeah,
you guys have a Navy ... I hear."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"FUCK THE NAVY, WE'RE ARMY!" shouted one of the men that
had greeted the two of them, this prompted cheers among the other patrons.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Of course, the US is unlikely to ever have a monopoly on
inter services rivalry.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Heyyy, you're the navy girl, and she's the SHIELD girl,
right?" asked another.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Damn, my tentacles are showing, aren't they?" said
Tiffany as she self consciously patted herself down looking for imaginary
tenticles.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Tentacles?" asked the man.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Don't tell me you don't know any US armed forces slang,"
groaned Tiffany, "honestly, I know the cold war is over, but we still get
training on your slang and terminology, okay, what does the term 'Jar Head'
refer to?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Errr, green berets?" suggested one drunk.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Noo, it's Naval Infantary, their ... maritimes?" slurred
one drunk.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Marine Corps, it's their Marines," slurred another.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This was more like it. Getting your subjects to relax
around you so they'll talk openly. Normally Wanda would have thought she'd be
better at this than Tiffany, but you do need to know the mentality to get your
foot in the door. To the detriment of her pride, Tiffany was taking the lead.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"YOU," said Tiffany, to the man who had answered
correctly, "Are thinking too clearly. TEA TOTALLER! TEA TOTALLER! SCARED OF A
LITTLE DRINK YOU ARE!"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

put Tiffany potentially in a corner of having to accept a drinking challenge.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Yeah, I heard about these two girls with horns and
telekinetic powers were seen around here or Chechnya or someplace like that,"
said Tiffany.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Quiet you," said Tiffany, she then addressed the guy who
had responded first saying "You, name and speciality?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Antin Maksim, Sniper."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"So what did you see?" asked Tiffany.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Okay, you know there's this tail extending north west of
Groznyy, right?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Yeah?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"I was eight miles up that tail, I was on this old oil tank,
looking west, watching for rebels in these suburbs, and I saw this rebel and he
was conversing with this woman with pink hair and horns growing out of her
head, at first I thought they were some kind of personal communications
equipment or something, but I got a look at where the objects connected with
her scalp."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Sounds like one of them," said Tiffany, "Anything
happen?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"I reported this to the captain, he ordered a fire team
in to capture the rebel and the girl, I was to provide sniper cover from my
position, we had a platoon attack from the south west as a diversion, make
noise, fire team approaches from the north with suppressed weapons."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"How long did the prep take for that?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"About half an hour, we position Spetsnaz fire teams all
over to hole up in case we need them, I was in such a team, the platoon was in
an APC, my job was to provide additional support if needed, but I only had one
view of the area. I ended up killing several of the rebels that responded to
the overt action, the girl and the rebel retreated from the overt platoon
towards the fire team, I directed the fire team to intercept. "</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"What happened when they got there?" asked Tiffany.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Antin sighed and said "The Spetsnaz team were ripped
apart, literally. It was the strangest thing. ... I reported the situation, and
my CO ordered me to kill them. I followed orders as best I could, but none of
my shots impacted the targets. The girl looked towards me. She couldn't see me,
I was about four hundred metres away, I shot something else to try to work out
what was wrong with my sights, but there was no malfunction. The shots were
simply being deflected. Being unable to locate me, the girl smiled and flipped
me off."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Julia got off the elevator with Brittany and walked over
to Daria's apartment. They used the skeleton key to enter it, and they looked
around.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After looking around the room, Julia asked "are you sure
you got enough books there Daria?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"So, what's going to be a personal item?" asked Brittany.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"I'll just have to touch things until I feel something,"
said Julia. She then walked around, running her fingers over the rows of books.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eventually Julia had completed the books.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Well?" asked Brittany.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Insufficient psychic energy," said Julia, "She's into
reading, but her devotion to all these books is spread too thin by their
number."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"So now what?" asked Brittany.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Now ... ... If Daria finds out about this, she's going
to melt my brain. Brittany, how many telepaths does it take to screw in a light
bulb?" said Julia. She then started looking around the room. She lifted the
skirt of the bed and looked under it, and found it strange that there was a
centre post linked to the four other legs, but some beds were like that.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She then looked through the wardrobe.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She failed to locate it there.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Where else?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She tried the utility room, with Brittany watching
looking confused.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Julia eventually returned to the bedroom and looked
around confused and frustrated.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She then looked at the bed again and realised that the
centre post could serve another purpose, especially with the structural
elements on the floor, why would anyone do that? It makes moving the bed a pain
in the ass.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Julia got on her hands and knees and crawled around the
head of the bed, and found what she was looking for. Brittany looked under the
bed from the front. Julia was not visible. Brittany lifted her head and saw
Julia pulling something, but looking under the bed again showed no sign of
Julia. Julia pulled a box out from under the bed. Brittany walked around and
looked under the bed, seeing the triangular compartment that couldn't possible
occupy the same space as the empty space she kept seeing. Brittany looked under
the side and reached through the frame, only to be stopped by glass which, by
the symmetrical reverse image of her hand on the other side of the glass, had
to be the substrate of a mirror.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Julia opened the box revealing cuffs, chains, dildos,
devices with time setting dials (Delayed release devices?), electrical
stimulation gear.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Daria's brain had been sped up so she should be
perceiving double the frame rate of normal people, the problem was they had
only had six days, or twelve from her point of view. Actually, he had managed
to get her to experience twenty three days, sleep time normally slows your
perception down, so might as well have that occur at the speed she perceives.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The assistant appeared next to Trask and said "One of her
associates, their explosives instructor, has been seen around the area, and we
heard a sonic boom consistent with the shape of the Gridrunner, I think we're
about to get attacked."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

"Okay, watch from outside, and prepare to sedate her, in a minute I'll have

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He looked through the window to where Daria was still
being prepped for relocation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The sound of PFT shots and things breaking from PFT shots
told him "this sucks."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This was about two seconds before the door left it's

entered.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He was knocked out.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Hi Trask," said Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"I suppose I should beg for mercy or some other crap,
right?" Asked Trask.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Actually you should be abiding by your parole
conditions, one of those conditions stay within the state you were released to,
only you were outside the country, and then there's the no more crimes, don't
even litter or park obstructively, only you assaulted a Legionnaire, equivalent
to a deputy marshal," said Jane, "you must love prison. Either one of those
counts on their own will return you to it."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Oh yeah, that's right, you're supposed to be the good
guys, aren't you?" said Trask.</p>

generally referred to," said Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Yeah, well, I guess your perspective on what constitutes
saving the world is just different is all," said Trask.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Right," said Jane. "FYI: If Daria wakes up before we've

captain.</p>

me."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Blown up while on operations in Afghanistan, huge
charge, DNA recovered from shrapnel, but nothing of her body was recovered.
Blast was big enough to pulverise bones, so KIA was a reasonable assumption at
the time," said Tiffany, "she's a precog, she could have tipped off the Taliban
or Al Qaeda months in advance. Rest of her unit was recovered mostly intact,
white butterfly effect. DNA could have come from a bag of blood placed on one
side of the bomb."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"So now what?" asked Yuliya.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"We can use her appearance to narrow her location down to

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jane looked over to Daria. They were in the back of the
Gridrunner. "Daria. Sorry we took so long getting around to you, but Harm's
goons made off with a load of reactor fuel."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Daria sat up and felt most her body lock up.
"D-AAAHHHHHHHH. One of those huh?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"You've been in VR for seven days," said Jane "get
yourself into the TIDES pool when we return."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Uh-huh. Harm's goons made off with a load of reactor
fuel, I take it it's not weapon's useable uranium."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"It may have been refined since it was taken."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"How many critical masses?" asked Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Forty," said Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"In practical terms, thirty eight 3KT yield devices, ten
400KT yield devices, or maybe five of the low end hydrogen devices," said
Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Yeah," said Jane, "that's why I convinced Brittany we
needed to go after the fissile material first."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Okay," said Daria, "it sounds like you still haven't
recovered the material though."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"No. Thing is we think we must have passed them a bunch
of times. Look, I'm sorry I convinced Brittany to leave you there, as soon as
we've recovered the uranium, I'll let you beat the crap out of me, I won't
resist, but anything you can bring to the investigation, we need it."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Daria sighed and said "My head's a little out of the
game, but I'll see what I can come up with. ... That damn precog's the key, get
me a computer terminal."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Right," said Daria as she got up and walked. Jane used
her magnetic powers to assist Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They entered the passenger seating area and Daria passed
Trask. She turned to look at him. "Huh." She then continued on.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Daria entered the flight deck where Brittany said "You
okay Daria?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Nothing about a year in a TIDES pool won't cure. Need to
use a terminal," said Daria as she sat at one of the rear stations.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She opened the electronic sketch program and set to work.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Sorry we left you in there so long Daria," said Jodie.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Missing fissionable material Jodie, I concur," said
Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Okay. You may need me to hack the various databases to
use it though, we're on the terrorist watchlist."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"I was renditioned to another country for interrogation?"
asked Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Yeah. Agent Flem-"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"English speaker, English speaking, all she'd need to
work on is the accent and a few slang words," said Tiffany, "of course you're
trading cultural difference for obstructed exits, UK's densely populated,
riddled with cameras ... ... Having said that, she'd have plenty of people to
hide among, unless she does something to really draw someone's attention, she's
just not going to be seen."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Yuliya. This probably isn't your favourite topic, but
did you get the impression that this was Kerry's first time committing rape?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Honestly? No, I know ... ... a thing or two about the
mentality of a torturer, and from that I think a lot of what she did was
habitual and too playful for it to be her first time, what exactly are you
thinking?" Asked Yuliya.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Okay, the good news is I think I know how we can find her.
The bad news is, it can't be us that captures her," said Tiffany.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"WHAT?" asked Yuliya.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"She's a precog, but she isn't omniscient, if she doesn't
know how she got found, she can't evade. I think we can locate her by her
habits. We narrow it down to a town, we can come up with an alternate means of
getting her arrested. We'll be looking for footage or accounts of her appearing
at nightclubs or red light districts," said Tiffany, she was thinking again,
"trying to think what her criteria is likely to be."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Rapists get into their criminal behaviour early, like
with serial killers, they start in their teens," said Wanda, she went to work
on her palmtop saying "NCIS might have something on her, maybe complaints that
were filed and later dropped, maybe complaining witnesses experienced fatal
accidents after or even before they lodged the complaint, anyone who
mysteriously died could give us her targeting criteria, otherwise we'll end up
looking all over the place. Did she say anything while she was assaulting you?
That could also assist us."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"She mentioned she appreciated my technique wi ... ... "
Yuliya looked agitated as she thought through what she was going to say.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"If this is going into war crimes you yourself have
committed, we'd need to obtain a warrant to prosecute for such acts, and that
would require a person's name or a location which could lead us to witnesses,
so keep those points vague and we won't have the ability to pursue you, and
that's pretending any Russian judge would approve extradition in the first
place. You can check with your base's JAG attorney, but we need to get into
Kerry's mind," said Wanda.</p>

Afghanistan."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"So we eliminate her?" asked Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"No, we focus on her, the others have 'Status: Active' on

mercenaries," said Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jane saluted saying "Morning General, oh hang on a

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"I'll see if they got internet access to any records relating
to Kerry and anyone she worked with," said Jodie, "we think she sexually

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"We should stick with Kerry for now, she actually makes
the most sense, and the style of the hand to hand combat that left the bruises
on the bodies at that cartel's base strongly resembled individuals schooled in
Semper Fu," said Daria, "she'd have to know the military internally to be as
effective as she has been, Jodie, see what AA and personal reports you can

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"You'll need to put it in a drum full of concrete, but

might have better luck if we can figure out who she's been assaulting since she
faked her death."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Garden City might give us a better picture," said Jodie.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Okay," said Daria, "we still need to keep up the
pressure on Harman and the mercenaries, glad as I am to be out of there,<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>the precog probably predicted the break in
your search efforts and took this opportunity to get Harman and company
somewhere the hell else."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"We expanded our search radius across an entire state
before we came after you," said Jodie.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Assume they've built the nukes, where do they stick
them?" asked Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Middle of the population centre," said Jodie, "they
don't want to be seen doing it, and they don't want it to be removed
intentionally or accidentally, so no dumpsters, sewers might get inspected, any
construction work that was recently carried out might have a nuke buried in any
concrete slabs that were left to cure overnight, bearing in mind there are two
diclonii working with them, they could put the nukes in a lot of places, they
don't want a Geiger counter detecting it, and they don't want our neutrino
detectors, so they're using radiation shields, those need power. Could be
buried in someone's back yard."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Burial leaves disturbances that radar and infra-red can
pick up," said Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"I'll rig a program to compare visual imagery to radar
imagery, that way we can exclude buildings," said Jodie.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"What about cemeteries?" asked Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"We can get the age of a burial, if they pick a plot
that's been undisturbed for long enough, that'll give us their nuke," said
Jodie.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"What if they use a rocket?" asked Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"How would they guide it?" asked Mack.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Wouldn't need to," said Daria and Jodie simultaneously.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Same engineers they had design the nuke, they'd also be
able to project a rocket's trajectory if given the overall mass and the
propellant's specific impulse, it would also require some fluid dynamics
expertise to work out how tight to construct the exhaust, but given all that,
they'd have the means to put the nuke where they need<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>it to be for maximum effect," said Jodie,
"that would probably be a massive ground disturbance though, you'd bury it in a
pipe at the launch angle, have some explosive device remove the soil prior to
launch."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Wanda looked over to Tiffany again and eventually asked
"You're dourer than usual." Tiffany had been scowling at the back of the seat
right in front of her the whole flight.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"I'm glad we couldn't get her a visa," said Tiffany, "I
know I shouldn't say stuff like this, but that's the one woman on this planet I
know of that I feel had it coming."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Yeah, I'm sure you've never broken the rules of war,"
said Wanda.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Not indiscriminately," said Tiffany, "it's not like I
come away with a guilty conscience, but I also don't get off on other people
suffering, and I have at least enough self control to ensure that the people I
go after are actually involved in enemy activity, the crap she pulled in
Chechnya, made me want to kill her."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"As a cop, I find myself wanting to kill a lot of the
suspects I end interviewing," said Wanda, "welcome to my world."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"You don't choose the future you want, you don't get the
future you want," said Tiffany.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Legion motto. Sorry you left?" asked Wanda.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"I was expelled," said Tiffany.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"You were only there when you absolutely had to be," said
Wanda "Might as well have left."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"I know. ... This is just one of those times when I think
back to Bakerson's attempt to recruit the Legion. I wasn't that much into deep
philosophy or anything, the difference between heroes and soldiers just went
completely over my head, but this is why they maintained their independence.
DOJ gives them so much more independence of action, but me going off around the
world saving lives would need orders to do so, or I get all kinds of done for
insubordination or whatever else."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"There's that. Maybe administrative separation would be
an improvement," said Wanda.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Okay, if Julia and myself work Garden City, you and
everyone else try to find the nuclear weapons, sound like a plan?" asked Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Yeah, Brittany?" asked Jodie.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They landed at the airport, having let Julia and Daria
off over the city.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Brittany and Jodie emerged from the aircraft and headed
for the manager's office. "Maybe they'll understand once we explain to them
that we're not the terrorists," said Brittany.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"I doubt it, " said Jodie, "I'll hold their attention,
there's something I need you to do."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Okay, what do we want to do?" asked the inspector, now
they had assembled the entire shift into the briefing room.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"We're looking for anyone who had any contact with this
individual, real name's Kerry Thompson, thought to have been killed in action
two years ago, we now believe she faked her death to become a mercenary," said
Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"We're now hoping to chase her down, but we need
information on her personal habits in order to do so," said Julia. "We think
Kerry is a rapist, she assaulted someone she then killed at a house in Rochelle
before she killed her, and we think she was raping women in her unit prior to
her desertion, now, because she deserted at a time of war, the witnesses you
uncover won't have to appear in court for us to put her away, but we do need to
find her, and that means figuring out her personal tastes, the people she
targeted while in the Marine Corps would have been skewed by what was available
to her and what she thought she could get away with."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"We're going to need you to go door to door, ask if
anyone has seen her, they'll probably know her as her alias Miss Teak Meg,"
said Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Keep in mind that anyone who was raped by her would
probably not be forthcoming about it, but seeing her face might prompt a
reaction, recoil in terror, that kind of thing, if we get a list of names off
of you, we can follow up with further interviews," said Julia.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"But we're telling the truth, and how many cock-ups have
been directly caused by 'only following orders'?" said Jodie.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Well, I'm sorry, but Homeland Security scare the crap
out of me," said the manager.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Brittany entered and asked "Any luck?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"No," said Jodie.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Well, we'll just have to make do with what we got then,"
said Brittany.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"I suppose," said Jodie.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They then left.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As soon as they were out the office, Brittany and Jodie
broke into a run.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The airport manager couldn't help but think something was
wrong, like he had been tricked somehow.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As soon as the Gridrunner was starting to take off, one
of the fuel crew entered carrying a suitcase with a note taped to it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Boss, apparently the Legion paid for their fuel in cash,
what's with that?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The manager turned ashen. "Oh, nothing, just the CIA said
not to sell them fuel, and they went and took it anyway, and left the money so
they wouldn't be stealing."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Phil Lien here, I got a call from a diclonius in Casper,
Wyoming, they think they sensed your terrorists heading south west, probably on

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"I'll call back with more information as I get it," said
Phil. He then hung up.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One of the soldiers hooked a speaker up to his Ipod and
asked "Time on target?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Five minutes, why?" asked Sal.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Let me know when we're at three and a half minutes."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sal shrugged and said "Okay."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eventually they came off the 220 and Sal said "time on
target three mike thirty."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The soldier hit play.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Dambusters theme started to play through the speaker.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This got a laugh out of everyone.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They eventually caught sight of the step-up transformers,
and the powerplant at the base of the dam. The dam itself appeared seconds
later.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Right, get the nuke into position," said Sal.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Two more soldiers did that and Sal grabbed the door
handle with one of her vectors, and the arming wire with one hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The arming wire was poking out a plastic sleeve that led
to the time delay fuse in the nuke buried in the concrete. This was the only
thing stopping the nuclear weapon's fuse from counting down the 10 minutes it
would take to detonate. 10 minutes. They would want to be above the current
water level of the Alcova reservoir before that runs out.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They ascended the road towards the top of the dam and Sal
said "Stand by ... Standby ... " She then flung the door open and pulled the
arming wire, saying "Go."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The two soldiers shoved the barrel out the van and it
rolled down the slope into the lake.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Well, there's some farms, and Alcova ... And a gravity
dam with 208718068 cube metres of water behind it!" Jodie switched her
attention to the neutrino detector and turned hard, full burners.</p>

"Sorry."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Kerry awoke again. "DAMN IT, WHAT THE FUCKING HELL IS
WRONG HERE?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every dream she had showed Harman and her two Diclonii
getting arrested.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She heard the occupier of the home she had invaded cry
out in anticipation of further physical or sexual abuse.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Actually that might not be a bad idea, she could work off
some of this stress.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Kerry stood up and headed upstairs with a glass and a
pitcher of cola filled with ice cubes and lemon slices to the bedroom where she
had left the woman tied to the bed, on an electric blanket, three quilts on top
of her. She looked fearfully at Kerry, pleading through the gag as Kerry leered
at her. The woman was probably slightly delirious from the heat she was being
subjected to. "Hey there hot stuff. Ready for more?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The perspiration was probably soaking through the first
fifty millimetres of quilt and it almost certainly wasn't doing it's job.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Kerry poured herself a glass of ice cold cola and set the
pitcher down on the bedside table, she slid in beside the girl, glass in hand.
"nothing like a hit wet girl under you when you're enjoying an ice cold cola
drink." She took a sip, as she rolled over, the glass of cool refreshing cola
just centimetres from the girl's head.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Hey, it just occurred to me, you might be thirsty."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The girl nodded, shuddering at the thought of the price
of that drink. Poor girl was instructor qualified in Krav Maga. This was about
the most satisfying kind of trophy, women who were trained in violence, getting
brought down by Kerry's own hands. It was like catching and toying with a wild
animal.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>And the home invasions involved in the commission of these
crimes weren't a bad thing either, stopped the walls and ceiling getting
boring, always something interesting.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She couldn't stay too long of course, more than 24 hours
would be pushing it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She heard a bang with a crunch downstairs. The front door
being kicked in.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This was followed a split second later by someone saying
"Move, move, move," and footsteps, rapid footsteps.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Kerry got out of<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;

door.</p>

the man through the brainstem. She then emerged with her MP5 and shot each and

out.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"I'll take your word for it," said Superintendant Brian
Potter.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They watched the footage from the police helicopter as
Kerry dragged the superintendant into the neighbours car, a blue Mercedes M3
what she had apparently stolen the keys for.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"From our experience in dealing with precogs, they either
need to be asleep or in a trance to predict the future," said Wanda, "we have
her with her pants down now."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Right. Well, you know the current treaties between our
countries mean you basically have her anyway, I'm not throwing any more of my
people at her."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"On it. Thanks for your assistance. We'll add the latest
murders to the list," said Wanda as she and Tiffany left the room, going to the
roof of the police station.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Once they had access to the sky, Wanda levitated herself
and Tiffany and Wanda switched her radio, which she had rigged with an earwig,
to VOX.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Sierra Oscar from Maximoff, heading for last known
location, request directions to target."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Maximof, Sierra Oscar, suspect heading north west on
Tumbledown Hill, speed seven zero miles an hour, over."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Wanda adjusted course and replied "Have that, North west,
Tumbledown hill."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As they flew, they heard "From Sierra Oscar, suspects are
slowing on approach to Oxford Road, Suspect is turning left left- FUCK!"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Sierra Oscar From Wanda, confirm left turn onto-" Wanda
then caught sight of a large fireball rising into the sky from the junction
"-actually disregard, over."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As Wanda overflew Eynsham Road, she saw a blue Mercedes
M3 weaving past oncoming and slower cars at idiot velocity. "Sierra Oscar,
Wanda, I have the suspect, I'm going to take her off the road, over."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Wanda used her powers to lift the car off the road. She
had to make this look like a departure from controlled motion, but there was
one yankee to protect, this was also the reason for the charade in the first
place, to stop Kerry from threatening harm to the hostage. Wanda didn't want
Kerry to be aware of the presence of herself and Tiffany until at least she had
decided to ditch the hostage. The car spun off the road, rolling across the
ditch, through the hedge and landing right side up in the field, with both left
wheels broken off.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They heard a gunshot immediately before Kerry emerged.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The hostage was dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Wanda took possession of Kerry's weapons and collected them,
holding them about four metres over her head.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;</span>Kerry stopped and
looked up.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Kerry finally noticed Wanda and Tiffany.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Captain Kerry Thompson, this really isn't your day, is
it? I am arresting you for deserting at a time of war, so many counts of treason
I can't be assed to count them all, so many counts of murder that I can't be
assed to count them all, so many counts of rape that I- You know what? Screw
it. You are busted. End of," said Wanda.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"I can't see the fact the United States has the death
penalty preventing extradition after tonight," said Tiffany, "in fact, I think
the judge will make it a condition that the method of execution is the electric
chair."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Oh no, you all hate me now? How did I fail to realise
that would happen?" Said Kerry, pouring on the sarcasm.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"I suppose my offer to give you a chance at having your
sentence commuted to life won't draw any interest," said Wanda.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"And that chance would require from me, what exactly?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Tell us where your minions are," said Tiffany.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Kerry considered this for about a minute and eventually
pulled her phone saying "I'll ask them."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Wanda used her powers to squash the phone into nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"You are the one controlling them, you're predicting what
happens when they move, so you tell us where they are now," said <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;</span>Wanda.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Kerry put her hands in her pockets and said "Well, one
thing I will tell you, if I don't make contact in a credible manner, they'll be
deciding for themselves whether to continue with the sale or to just set the
nukes off in the first city they come across."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Then you fry," said Tiffany.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Kerry grinned maniacally at Wanda and Tiffany saying "You
think I'd have become a Marine if a little death scared me? You know, with our
obesity rate, all those couch potatoes, once alight, they'll make a lovely
light."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Okay, death don't scare you, I'll just have to find
something that will," said Wanda. Kerry suddenly fell asleep, dropping to the
ground like a sack of potatoes.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Tiffany watched, and after ten seconds was about to ask
Wanda what was happening when Kerry woke up looking all around her, seemingly
very agitated.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eventually she calmed down and asked "what exactly was
that?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"That was me warping your reality for ten seconds."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Ten se- ... Wanda ... Wanda, Wanda, Wanda ... By the
time I break, I'll be so insensible, I'll be telling you they're on Pluto, or
sailing on a yacht under Jupiter's red eye, or checking their stock interests
at the tower of commerce on Ferenginar, yeah? Any fucking where but where they
actually are. ... Tiffany, you're a SEAL, tell her."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Tiffany sighed and eventually said "It's probably true."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Hmm," commented Wanda. She then put Kerry to sleep
again. "Let's find out."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing align=center style='text-align:center'>]:::[</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jodie answered the phone. "Y'ello?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"We think we have your terrorists moving south through
Laramie on Route 30, I've started redeploying Diclonii volunteers around them."
Said Phil.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Sorry, volunteers?" asked Jodie.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Yeah, the Diclonii that arrived in Hawaii and the ones
that arrived at the USAES was it called? Anyway,-"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing align=center style='text-align:center'>]:::[</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was just about enough room to seat all the diclonii
that had shown up.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eventually the diclonius that had handed out the leaflets
walked over to the podium and turned on the microphone. "Okay, your attention
please?" The room quietened. "Thank you. I'm Sarah Fontaine, I'm here to
propose an action, and it'll sound absurd, but I hope you all will stay for the
entire length of this meeting and seriously consider what I'm proposing. ...
Okay, now, having come out of that torture camp, you all probably don't feel
that lucky, but we were lucky to get out of that camp at all, and we were lucky
that SHIELD agent and that ... Coast guardsman," she had trouble keeping a
straight face when reciting the story Tiffany had told them about being in the
coast guard, but the concept of a deniable operation was not lost on them, "
... we were lucky they helped us stay free when that submarine and that
battleship showed up. ... Our next stroke of luck was that the United States
INS has granted us permission to stay instead of returning us to sender. Our
situation has been precarious since our births, and we somehow made it. ... It
is time to capitalise on this luck and give something back. ... Okay, this is
what I'm proposing, and you're probably going to be asking yourselves 'well,
how's this our problem?' ... Well, we weren't our rescuer's problem, they
helped us, and I for one don't want to feel like an asshole sponger.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Now, on the news, I don't know how many of you have seen
this, but today, these mercenaries, two of whom are diclonii, stole a shipment
of uranium destined for a nuclear power plant, they are being guided by a
precogniscient individual. It's apparently not known if they're going to use
that uranium to build a full blown nuke or just a slow bomb, but if they aren't
found, hundreds to thousands of people will be killed by them for the highest
bidder.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"So how's this our problem? Well, it's unlikely they'll
get their weapon over here, so hang out here, and nothing will probably happen.
That's the small picture. Now let's look at the big picture effect. You
remember how silly things got after 9/11? Patriot act, Guantanamo Bay,
Operation Iraqi Freedom? And imagine us being the centre of all this just
because two Diclonii were helping these guys. I work for the NSPCC, when I'm
not going on holiday to places that want to use me in a science experiment, I'm
helping children escape situations that can turn them into the kind of screwed
up adults that get trapped in drugs, mental hospitals, prison, who smash things
up, beat their loved ones, steal for- Basically provide the demand for a police
force. Society is like a kid that's constantly growing up, I don't know about
you, but seeing things get constantly worse is depressing the crap out of me.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Whether or not you still consider this not your problem,
we have the ability to sense each other's presence and each other's moods,
sometimes even each other's intentions. This is the part where we can do
something. What I want us all to do, in concert with any released from the
USAES, is we deploy ourselves in as many places as we can so that we can sense
the mercenaries should they approach any of the cities.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"The precog that's guiding them may be effective against
cops, it's improbable any would spot them in the first place, but with us all
over the place, there's going to be nowhere the precog can send them without
getting found out. You're basically going to have to beg, borrow and ste- ... I
could probably buy four air tickets to any western seaboard city, any of you that
decide to go along with this, get your family and friends to help you, lay on
the guilt, the tears, whatever, just get into position. I'll be handing out
contact details to a message board administrator a number of you might be
familiar with."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing align=center style='text-align:center'>]:::[</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"-and so they all got whatever finances they still had in
their name or got their friends and family to get them a seat on a flight to
which ever city they decided to take, and now we're deployed all over."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Okay, do any of them have compasses?" asked Jodie.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Compasses?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Yeah, I may need them to report a position and a vec- a
direction, okay, whose bright idea was it to call your telekinetic arms 'vectors'?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"No idea," said Phil, "one of us called them Vectors and
we just went with it. Anyway, compasses, their positions, thing is, if they get
close enough to nail it to the vehicle, then ... "</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"I'll survey the area, as soon as they report the vehicle
stops moving, if they give me the directions, I can use a time stamp and that
should narrow it to no more than five vehicles, if they then diffract, we can
then have them tell us when they reach a predetermined bearing, provided
they're far enough apart at the time, that should give us their vehicle."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Okay, diclonii senses, they're not some kind of radar
screen, the error is going to be at least plus or minus two degrees, probably
as much as fifteen."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jodie eventually said "Right ... I can manipulate the
traffic lights. ... Also, I can probably get Daria in soon, not being a
diclonius, she shouldn't be detected by the enemy diclonii."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Quinn entered the cockpit and said "The disrupter packs
are ready to go, even if any or even all of the detonators go off from the
force of the water, the detonation will not be symmetrical, so worst case
scenario, we'll have a couple of dump trucks of contaminated soil to dispose
of."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Right," said Jodie. There was another call trying to get
through. "Another call, Agent Flemming? What could he want? Phil, will you
excuse me a minute?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Yeah."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Thanks." Jodie accepted Flemming's call. "What?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"You're off the list. AFIS, CODIS, and any other database
access codes will be restored, and none of your hacking will be prosecuted,
neither will your interruption of Daria's interrogation."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>" ... thanks ... What finally changed your mind?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Kerry admitted obliquely that she had ordered Harman's
people to steal the nukes and her voice patterns match the tip offs we
received, SHIELD agent Wanda Maximoff and Coastguardsman Tiffany Blum Deckler
have Wanda in custody at Oxford Police Station, Oxfordshire, England."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Okay. Thank you. I got some minions to capture."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"They're headed for Los Angeles," said Flemming.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Kerry say that?" asked Jodie.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Yes," said Flemming.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"We're looking at them, they are nowhere near California,
let alone Los Angeles."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"How can you be so sure?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"A load of diclonii are tracking the two working for the
mercenaries."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"How do you know they got the correct diclonii?" asked
Flemming.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Because they left a nuke in the reservoir just behind
Alcova dam. I really have to go now. I'll forward your apology to Daria."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"What apology? If she ha-" started Flemming.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jodie hung up on him, switching back to Phil. "Sorry
about that, the precog's in custody, we're going to set up the capture, standby
while I re-task Daria.." She then used her flight ring to thought cast 'Daria,
Jodie, status?'</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>'Going through the witness names now, Julia and I will be
planning our sequence soon.'</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>'Laramie, head three one five buster, I'll send Jane and

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jane kept looking at Daria as they travelled north west
at mach 3. The magnetic shield she had formed was the slenderest thing that she
could form, a double ended spike 2.5m in diameter, 20m long, this would
hopefully prevent anyone experiencing any hearing loss as they were only at
300ft above ground level. Brittany was in physical contact with both to keep
them invisible.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"So, how you doing?" asked Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"In what sense?" asked Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"That crap Boliver pulled on you in Bangledesh. You
coping with that?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Daria eventually said "Seem to be."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Okay, pick up on that again later," said Jane. They
started to approach Laramie, so Jane slowed them to mach 0.4, she thought cast
'Jodie, Jane, twenty seconds from Laramie, request target location update,
over?'</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>'Jane from Jodie, target is moving south on route 287,
join at route 80 and head south.'</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>'Jodie from Jane, have that, over.' Jane adjusted her
course to intersect Route 80. Even though they were subsonic, Jane kept the
force field up, having to talk over wind scream was an ass pain they weren't
exactly pining for.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Think we're finally safe?" asked Harman.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Boss hasn't called," said Val.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Why?" asked Sal.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"I don't know, something feels wrong here. She was
calling every ten minutes practically, and now no more calls," said Harman.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"What exactly are you thinking?" asked Val.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"She got busted," said Harm.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"No, precog, she'll see it and avoid it," said Sal.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Unless ... " said Val. She looked pensive.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"She was too busy looking out for us to look out for
herself," said Harm.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The silence told him that the two diclonii concurred.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Take the next turn off the road, she calls, we resume,
she doesn't, we re-think our plan," said Harm, "I also think we need to turn
the metajammer on."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Val and Sal looked at each other, and nodded. Harman
nodded to one of his soldiers, he opened a briefcase that held the metajammer
and turned it on. He then held it up to show the vehicle behind, signalling
them to also activate theirs. The field wouldn't go much farther than a few car
lengths, but it would hide them.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Val, Sal," said Harman as he walked into a stall filled
with wood panels, beams, and fixings. He picked up a bag of nails. "what do you
think?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Combine a bucket of those with each of the two quad
bikes outside," said Val.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"We'd be two very mobile gun platforms," said Sal.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One of Harm's soldiers entered saying "we've locked the
farmer and his family in the basement, told him he was suspected of treason,
and that posse commutates had been suspended by presidential order."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>That got a laugh.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"That'll get those militia groups buzzing for the next
decade or three," said another.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Harman eventually said "Alright, cut the funny, time to
figure out our alternative plan. We kept getting captured in each of our bosses
predictions, why? How?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Why don't we just slot them?" asked Val.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Dead people draw attention, live people crying fed-gov
conspiracy repel it," said Harman, "even though they'd have probably not been
discovered for a couple of days, this'll buy us even more time. As soon as we
figure out where to go and how. Our vehicles could be subject to a BOLO," said
Harman.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"That means we can't just leave them here," said one of
his soldiers.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Can't drive them either," said Harman, "if we can find a
tractor and two big enough flat bed trailers, we should be able to hide the
vans in bails of hay, tow them cross country, we can then ditch all of them, carry
the nukes cross country until we can find some alternate vehicles, use some
more of our alternate identities."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jane, Daria and Brittany overflew the farm. 'Jodie from

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>'Jane from Jodie, Vans have not moved from that location,

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Daria, sense anything?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"House has six people in the basement, crapping
themselves, not sensing anyone else, but since we're thinking they're using

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Okay, what do we want to do then?" asked Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Land us behind that fuel tank on the south side of the

Jane and Brittany were stood south of.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>'All Legionnaires from Tom, I see about eighteen of the
X-rays including the two diclonii in the barn north of the house, no X-rays in
the house, just the Yankees stuck in the basement, the X-rays in the barn have
two flatbed trailers attached to a tractor, they have their vans on the trailers,
three are outside the vans, sacking hay bails around the vans, looks like they
intend to move cross country, over.'</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Do you see the nukes?" asked Quinn.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Yeah, there's nine implosion type, detonators rigged to
a relay, looks like they're not yet fused, so up to you, but I don't see a need
for the disruptors," said Tom.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>'All Legionnaires, Brittany, I want the X-rays out in the
open when we attack, that will give us our best opportunity to safely capture
them.'</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The soldier on the tractor drove along, looking around
for signs that anyone was watching them.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Suddenly the engine was blown apart.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"DAMN IT!" He said as he engaged the handbrake.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Zero Three from Zero One Alpha, sit-rep, over?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Zero one Alpha, Zero Three, engine's bent, over," he
said as he got off the tractor to examine the engine. A lot of parts had left
the engine, and the sump was gone, exposing the crank and all the connecting
rod big ends. "What the fuck did this?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The engine block itself was intact, so it couldn't be a blown
cylinder.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>But what else could do this? The force seemed to have
come from underneath the engine, but there's nothing under the engine capable
of doing this.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He then noticed a crater with some scraps of grey plastic,
there were even strands of black plastic connecting the grey plastic, possibly
PVC electrical tape wrapped around a grey plastic container. Looking back under
the tractor, he also noticed a pair of twisted wires, blown back by the
explosion, probably leading back to whoever initiated the blast. This was all
looking very consistent with a certain EOD device Alford Industries had
developed for disrupting car bombs.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He barely raised his radio to his mouth before he was
knocked out.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Zero Three from Zero One Alpha, sit rep, over?" asked
Harman.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They had been sitting still for ten minutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This was starting to grate.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Zero One Alpha, Zero Three, I think we're going to have
to transplant one of the van engines to the tractor, over."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Christ almighty tap dancing Christ on a fucking pentacycle,"
muttered Harman before he responded "Zero Three, Zero One Alpha, have that,
standby, over."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After a few seconds, Harman asked "Which is more likely:
A Tractor engine blowing out, an eventuality most farmers on the planet will do
anything to preclude, seeing as no tractor equals no work and no money, or an
ambush?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"What do we do then?" asked Val.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"When the field drops, will your telepathic link with Sal
allow you to communicate that we're under attack?" asked Harman, "we have to
assume radio comms is compromised."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"I think I can communicate that feeling, I think she'll
respond."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Good," said Harman, he then said "Zero Seven from Zero
One Alpha, I need you to standby to create a defence perimeter, we'll use my
van's engine for the job, also, we'll want the jammers off so Val and Sal can
use their vectors, but we need it to stay off as short as possible, so standby
for my command for that, over."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The instant that command was given, the bails of hay
exploded and nails flew from the buckets to everywhere around the trailers, the
soldiers on the lead one aimed but held fire, probably until some of the nails
fail to hit the ground (Indicating Jane's magnetic field), about half were
equipped with PFT M2s.</p>

air from around the trailers and produced a sound that was deafening and a
light that was blinding to the mercenaries.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Following the flash-bangs, Betty teleported in off to the
opposite side of the trailers from the Legionnaires and threw a charge
equivalent in energy to a BLU82 into the air above him before teleporting out.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This blast knocked the vans and the soldiers off the
trailers, it also turned the trailers over too.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The soldiers on the near side were moving slower than the
vans and were missed by the vans when they fell, the ones on the opposite side
landed beyond the vans.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>'All Legionnaires, attack now,' thought cast Brittany.</p>

knock out the mercenaries. Once this was done, they went about securing the

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All the Legionnaires except Daria left the room.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"From what you said just now, I imagine what you have to
say is the exact opposite of an apology," said Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"That's right. I want to know if we're safe."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"You're safe. Unless the Director decides to make a move
on you, the only thing I can think of that would keep him from firing you is
that he's gay for you. Thankfully Boliver's deniability allowed us to get him
back into his life sentence."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"When I say 'We', I mean the United States, does the
Legion approve of us Americans?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"I see. ... Flemming, we're not you guys, we go out to
save lives, American or non, meta or normal, we use our law enforcement officer
status to assist in that."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"You see us as the bad guys?" Asked Flemming.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"You know, Agent Flemming, for a spy agency that recently
decided we were a terrorist organisation, your inroads into figuring out what
we're like are abysmally short," said Daria, "what is it you think we're about?
Seriously, you've infiltrated everyone from Amnesty International to the
Salvation Army, to Boy Scouts, Stonewall, is there anyone you don't think is
some kind of fifth column for some invasion force? Actually, never mind that,
you probably suspect yourselves of being insurgents you're that paranoid, what
I don't get is why you didn't pick a more suitable method? Infiltration,
eavesdropping devices, you could have sent someone along to 'liase' with us,
that person could have been both a carrier for eavesdropping devices and an
active investigator, instead you decided to abduct me, RIGHT when I was a hair
away from blowing this case wide open, and impede our investigation by placing
us on that watchlist instead of simply watching our internet activity. You
haven't improved one bit, well, except I don't feel like I've had anyone's hand
up my ass, so I guess you've improved there."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Right, this is the part where you attack my self esteem
to throw me off balance is it?" asked Flemming.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Flemming, this is me being honest and straight up. You
are an idiot. You nearly helped a bunch of terrorists nuke some US cities, you
put a proven nut job in charge of an apparently vital interrogation, with no
supervision what so ever, so he could attempt to drive me nuts so I become his
weapon of mass convenience so he could hawk his sentinel robots, you, agent
Flemming, are stupid."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"You know your mind control powers won't work on me, I've
been Esper trained."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Good for you, just need to work on getting that twenty-twenty
hindsight everyone else mastered at age two," said Daria, "anything else?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Yeah. We'll be watching you. Have a nice day." Agent
Flemming then left.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Prick," commented Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Tiffany Blum Deckler here as ordered," said Tiffany as
she entered and stood at attention.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Stand easy," said the Admiral. He then asked "I received
your shrink's report."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"I pass?"</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Frankly ... No, shrink felt your lust for the hunt made
you a potential danger to the mission, he wanted you out of the navy."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Ah."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"He then interviewed Wanda to get her perspective on you,
and Wanda knows how to speak shrink, and saved your job and your active field
status, so you're clear. Just go out, relax, come back ready to kill."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Thank you sir," said Tiffany, now seriously elated for
the first time in days.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Dismissed."</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She snapped to attention again, and was out the door
faster than a cartoon character or the Mask.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>"Shrinks," said the Admiral with a chuckle.</p>
