are the ones that have lasted and thrived? Being a parent of a Legionnaire is
equally difficult, like watching a child go off to war, even moreso to be a

accounts, presenting (at best) a lackluster showing in that area. (For the sake
of consideration, we will set aside any greater mention of his musical
aspirations and the pursuit of same &ndash; especially considering the tension
between Trent and Thomas Sloane, upon the Legion's return from their first
visit to the U.S. Academy for Extranormal Studies.) How, then, must have it
felt for Trent to suddenly see his younger sibling &ndash; the 'baby' of the family,
who in a sense, raised herself &ndash; thrust into a world that he'd always dreamed
of; a world of impossible riches and the worry of financial disaster a

looked like he'd been earning his paycheck; the last time he'd been out to the
Legion compound, he'd seen her running &ndash; and the girl running the course wasn't

strange, too &ndash; the local news jumped on the story of her getting hurt like a
stray dog on a Cluster Burger &ndash; and then, the story just disappeared. Just... gone.)
She was the same, but... different...like fixing up your old beater with a brand
new engine, shocks, replacing the cassette player with a DVD player and
satellite radio, all digital dash &ndash; but not doing any real bodywork, aside from
a good hand wash and a coat of wax. People will see it and not really think

walked like a lioness &ndash; slow and easy, one foot after another, carefree in her
jungle and yet, ready to swat something down if she wanted without a thought &ndash;
of if she got hungry. She still pushed that into the background when she was
around the Fashion Club girls, <i>but when she was by herself, or was just <u>being</u>

shifted on the log he was sitting on, and as he looked up, he focused on Helen

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>He
turned again, and his eyes went to the soft red glow of the Legion insignia,

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Trent
got up to close the window, and as he shut and locked it, he leaned against the
wall and looked out at the tallest building in Lawndale &ndash; almost forty stories
high, he recalled Jane telling him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>A
strange sense of longing suddenly flowed through Trent, and he couldn't tear
his eyes<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>away from Legion Tower. Not

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>The
gun was black and decidedly ugly as Armalin set it down in front of Sandi.
"Before we begin, Griffin &ndash; I want to tell you that I'm glad you've at least
tried to settle down a bit. 'Gung-ho' is a good attitude to have, but common
sense and brains work a hell of a lot better."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Thank
you, sir."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"If
I thought for a moment that you were going off half-cocked and doing something
stupid again, I assure you that we wouldn't be standing here right now," he
told her. "Don't thank me &ndash; you've earned this."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Sandi
looked forward, and Armalin nodded slightly. <i>She'll do,</i> he thought to
himself. <i>She's worth the effort now.</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>"Most people will tell you that a person
should start their training with a .38 revolver or a .22. semi-automatic
pistol," he said, setting a loaded magazine down besides the pistol. "I started
you on the Glock 17 &ndash; the 9 mm semi-automatic &ndash; because that weapon is the most
common weapon that you'll encounter when dealing with armed citizens and
law-enforcement officers, and that caliber is the most prolific pistol caliber
that you'll come across."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Sandi
looked at the gun. "That's not a Glock 17."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Armalin
smiled. "Good. Having you shoot for an hour every day for the past month has
taught you something. Why did I start you on the 9mm instead of the .45?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Sandi
looked around the large, underground area that was the Legion shoting range,
and then back to Armalin. "It doesn't have much recoil, and the 9mm's have a
larger capacity<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>- usually a two-to-one
over a .45."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Right
&ndash; most 9mm pistols hold between ten to eighteen rounds. The thing is, you want
a round that'll put your attacker down and keep him down with one round &ndash;
better one round that stops the bad guy than four or five that keeps his head
down. That's the .45 ACP. The U.S. military has been using that round for
almost a century. Why would they use a specific round and caliber for so long,
Griffin?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>"Because it works."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Exactly."
Armalin nodded. "The M1911A1 pistol was used by the American military from
1911until 1985, when we went to the 9mm to conform to NATO standards. However &ndash;
U.S. Special Operations forces... as well as anyone else who's allowed or who can
get away with it... uses the .45. It's simply a better round for the task."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>He
gestured towards the pistol on the small table in front of Sandi. "This is the
Glock 21SF semi-automatic pistol in 45. ACP. Thirteen-round magazine, front
rails for a mounted tactical light or laser designator, tritum sights, and a
factory-approved Comminoli external safety. It was redesigned for persons with
smaller hands, and this is actually a pre-production model &ndash; one of a handful
in existance. They're not scheduled to hit the general market until the spring
of 2007." <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>He
handed Sandi a pair of eye protectors, and motioned towards the 'Mickey Mouse'
hearing protectors on the wall. "You're a natural shooter, Griffin &ndash; and since
you don't have an active power, armed self-defense is something that you should
be proficent in. I'm not saying that you should go armed &ndash; and certainly not if
you go into action with the rest of the Legion<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&ndash; but you being able to handle a weapon, and handle it well, is
something most people will not expect from you."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"It'll
give me an edge."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Armalin
raised an eyebrow at the way Sandi spoke. "Yes. You'll have an advantage most
people won't see coming. Put your eye and hearing protection on, and then -
pick up your sidearm. Do not load it until I tell you to."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>That's
one thing that's changed dramatically about her,</span></i><span lang=EN
style='mso-ansi-language:EN'> Armalin thought, taking a silhouette target and
sending it downrange as Sandi put her eye and hearing protection on, <i>she
takes orders now.</i> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Sandi
waited until the target stopped before she picked up the weapon...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Load
your sidearm and chamber a round."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Sandi
did as she was ordered. "Aim for your target, grasp your sidearm securely - and
slowly squeeze off your first round. Allow yourself to get used to the recoil
of the weapon."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Standing
with her gun held with both hands &ndash; <i>a proper Weaver stance, she's been
listening to Nemec, too</i> &ndash; Sandi sighted in on the target and fired. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>The
target moved slightly as the heavy slug punched through the shadow-figure
without effort, and Armalin smiled as he saw that the first round was about two
inches below the 'X' mark on the sheet, and about two inches to the left.
"Continue."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>The
sounds of gunfire rang out through the shooting range...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sloane yelped, almost spilling the large cup of orange soda sitting on the end
table next to him as he sat on the couch in Jane Lane's room. "Huh? Oh &ndash; sorry,

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"You've

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Tom
blushed deeply as she moved his hand and placed it on her thigh, then locked

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>In

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Jane
suddenly found herself alone; the wind made by Tom's leaving at super-speed
made her hair blow slightly, then settle back. "Damn," she said, leaning over
and taking a huge swallow of Tom's now-forgotten soda. "Can't a girl even <i>pretend</i>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Tom
tapped his head again and again on the wall next to the door inside his
apartment, and thought dark and cruel thoughts (involving butane lighters and
squirrels) about the people who wrote comic books for a living. <i>And this

like the images you see in the machines at the airports; far, far clearer and
sharper, though, but with no color... I can see everything &ndash; shapes, words, inner
workings of things &ndash; I can even see inside someone's body... their heart pumping,
their blood flowing, and if I focus in even closer, I can see the blood cells
moving through arteries...<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>I
wish I had someone to share this with &ndash; yeah, I know I should have told the

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>That
was something else that was new &ndash; <i>besides my 'shape-vision'. Hopefully I'll
come up with a better name for it.</i> Armalin had gone to Washington the week
after Sandi had come out of the hospital &ndash; the shape-vision came in VERY handy
that night!- taking her with him, and when he returned, all of the others
(especially Brittany!) reacted to the sight of the silver eagles on his
shoulders. Brittany had grilled Sandi unmercifully for details, and just to get
her to stop that squeaking voice, Sandi told her how they went to the White
House (the other Fashion Club girls nearly died with envy later, when they
heard Sandi talk about meeting the twin daughters of the President)... <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Tom
looked over the rows of ribbons and other insignia on his dress uniform, including
the gold wings of a Marine aviator, and the unusual sword-and-shepard's crook
emblem of gold just below... <i>wonder what that is? It's not a SEAL insignia &ndash;
that's what Magnum, P.I. and Admiral Chegwidden on JAG wear on their uniforms &ndash;
but he's got a Navy Cross like the Admiral does, too... wonder what he did to get
that? And <u>he's a pilot, too</u> &ndash; I guess Charles didn't know that, from the
reaction he had when he saw them...<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Brittany
and even Daria sat with mouths open as they heard Sandi talk about how the British
Ambassador and the Crown Prince were at the ceremony in the Rose Garden,
talking about how, during <i>Operation Desert Storm</i>, Armalin had shot down
six enemy helicopters that were attacking British Royal Marines. He did it with
a sniper rifle, shooting even after the helicopters located him and had started
firing rockets and machine guns at him... Apparently, the recon mission he was on
had been declassified, people were being recognized for what they had done, and
he was at the top of the list.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>They
promoted him two steps,</span></i><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>
Brittany said, cutting Sandi off as she told them about how tall and cute the
older Prince was, while the younger, red-haired one kept wanting to hear more
stories about Armalin's time in the desert. <i>People only get promoted like
this when the people on top don't want to give them something else and if they
promoted him from Major to full bird Colonel...</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>I
think that's why they kept calling him 'Sir Kyleton', </span></i><span lang=EN
style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Sandi said, making the room go still. <i>When I
got to talk to Wills later when we had coffee</i> (Quinn actually fell off her
chair upon hearing <u>that</u>, Tom remembered with a smirk), <i>he said that
some general Armalin worked for didn't want him to have some honor medal, so
even though it's just honorary, his grandmother appointed him as a-<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Medal
of Honor,</span></i><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'> Brittany said,
her voice holding awe in it. <i>They were going to give him a Medal of Honor...?
I knew he was hardcore,</i> Charles echoed, <i>but not </i><u>that</u><i>
hardcore... damn.</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>He
dismissed the envious look Charles had as he looked over Armalin's Wings of
Gold, and focused back in on the way Sandi looked as she lay semi-unconscious
on the floor, with flames coming closer, seeming to sense her presence as they
inched closer, eager to lick at her flesh... Quinn came through big-time that
night, he recalled, tracking Sandi's phone and guiding him and Jane towards the
fire &ndash; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>The
other big surprise was Daria. After Sandi's signal had stopped &ndash; her cell phone
had melted in the flames &ndash; Quinn's sister had somehow managed to scan the area
for mental patterns, and after being told where he and Jane were, she pointed
him in the right direction. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>That
was when it first happened. He somehow, strangely enough, saw through the walls
and the flames... and through Sandi's clothes. Tom used his super-strength to
punch through the wall, and his invulnerability to run in and carry her out
unharmed (as a exam later showed, Sandi had just a mild touch of smoke
inhalation), but he insisted on using his flight power to carry Sandi back to
Legion Tower and the medical bay there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>That
way &ndash; his shape-vision wouldn't accidentally kick on. The problem was, however,
it did kick on, or in, or whatever, and at the worst possible times over the
past two months. Like when he was doing sparring sessions with Daria and Jane
(his invulnerability meant that they could hit him as hard as they wanted). The
thing is, they would grunt and make noises as they lunged and struck out at
him, and it sounded just like the sounds the women on those late-night cable
movies and shows would make as they-<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>The
blue bear. This was definitely what they meant when they told the story of the
blue bear &ndash; about the kids that were told that they could have anything they
could think of, as long as they didn't think of a blue bear. Naturally, that's
the first thing that you'd think of... and that's when it happened. Jane was
practicing spear-hand strikes, and getting into it, because her 'Aieeee!' was
more like a 'Aunnnggghhh!", and it was a real turn-on, because she was really
putting everything into it...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>It
was as if she was wearing Saran Wrap that someone backlit through her entire
body. <i>Wow.</i> He never realized that Jane's stomach was that firm and that
flat. He never thought her body was just so... so... <i>oh, my God. She's got a
vicious little body. Of course I want to get her clothes off, but this is &ndash;
this is wrong , and then there's <u>Daria</u>-</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Tom
was so stunned by the view his new power afforded him of Jane's virtually-nude
form that he forgot for a moment as to why he was there. He was reminded six
seconds later, as his entire field of vision went suddenly, totally black... and
then, he saw Jane's fist slowly receeding from his face. That was when his nose
began to tingle with pain...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Even
worse &ndash; Daria had decided to use him as a punching bag a few minutes later. She

and accuracy, stopping herself an inch away, as Armalin had instructed... He
tried, he prayed, he pleaded silently for God to thrn him into a eunich or one
of the 'Straught Eye' guys for the next ten minutes &ndash; but Daria had a certain
tone to her voice, and when she looked him directly in the eye and made that
grunting noise as she thrust her right fist forward...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

sudden shock of the ice-cold water shocked him back to reality, and away from
the image of seeing the elder Morgendorffer sister through every stich of

decided then and there that there were three &ndash; no, four things in life that he

Charles. Apparently, even with the way he'd always acted around girls (he'd
heard the stories), he'd always singled out Daria. Every other single guy there
is a world-class MORON if they didn't notice Daria before...(Tom remembered
coming across 'Ultrasuave Universe' on the Internet Archive after Charles had

stepped out of the showed, and grabbed for a towel. Working the heavy towel all
over himself<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(and noticing that even
the towels were very nice), he slipped into a robe, stepped out of the bathroom
&ndash; and stopped cold as he saw Stacy standing at the table in the center of the

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>A
loud squeak echoed from Stacy, and Tom walked over to her, noticing how the red

to the table. "I just served these pancakes to you about five minutes ago. They

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"But
they are," Trent said, taking a bite of his food. "What is this, man? I thought

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>The
waitress reached out, and her face changed as she looked up and back towards
the kitchen. "I'm sorry &ndash; let me fix this up for you right now. I'm sorry about
this..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"It's
cool," Trent said. "Hey, can I get another order of hash browns with that &ndash;
extra crispy?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Sure

taken care of. "Anything you want."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Trent
looked up to see Anthony DeMartino in the booth directly across from him. "Oh.
Hey, Mr. DeMartino..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Good
evening, Trent," he replied, taking a sip from a huge coffee mug with a faded
military emblem on the side. "How's life treating you?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Okay...
I guess." Trent felt slightly uncomfortable talking to Anthony &ndash; not because he
was a former student of his, but because (for the first time in a long while)
he seemed... calm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"How's things for
you?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Couldn't
be better!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Trent
noticed the table in front of Anthony: the small stack of legal pads, a small
shortwave radio with a pair of earphones, a half-eaten stack of apple-cinnammon
pancakes on a plate with a trio of link sausages, and a worn laptop computer
that was easily showing its age. "I heard that you were working at Men's
Warehouse, or Applebee's-"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>The
sound of Anthony DeMartino laughing &ndash; not manical, or evil, or unbalanced, just
rich, happy laughter - gave Trent a truly eerie feeling. "You have to love the
Lawndale gossip mill, don't you? I'm out of the teaching game &ndash; took the early
retirement package and started doing something else!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"What's
that...?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Anthony
laughed as he turned the computer screen so Trent could see it. "My novel. My
second one, to tell the truth!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"You
write...?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"I
had to find some way to bleed off the stress of teaching, didn't I? Anyway, I
sold the first one over the summer &ndash; first in a series &ndash; and from the chapters
I've sent in with this one, they're talking big money!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"So,
how come you're still here, instead of moving off to New York or someplace?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>For
the first time, Anthony seemed to deflate. "I've got... I've got a friend here.
I'm letting her stay at my place until they rebuild the high school and she
gets her job back."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Ms.
Defoe's staying with you?" It came out of Trent's mouth before he knew it, and
the way Anthony's eye suddenly twitched brought back old memories... "Sorry to
bring it up, man."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>They
were both silent for a few minutes; the waitress brought back Trent's order and
a big smile for him, and then refilled Anthony's mug and gave him a big smile
also. "I usually come in during the off hours to type &ndash; there's background
noise, but not too much," Anthony said. "Say, how's your sister doing? I've
seen those Legion commercials &ndash; looks like she's got a good thing going,
right?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>The
stack of steaming-hot pancakes before him suddenly lost their appeal to Trent.
"Yeah. Yeah, she does."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Your
sister and her friends helped me out &ndash; <u>a lot</u>. Tell her I said hello, and
that if they need anything &ndash; even someone out of the loop to talk to &ndash; my
door's always open for them." <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>He
sipped from his mug. "So, what have you been up to lately?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Trent
looked over at Anthony, and then back to his meal with a somber
expression.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Nothing.

supervised time with the .45, I'd like for you to supervise her."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"I
can do that," Sgt. Nemec said, sitting up in her chair. "She's not bad, and
getting better. What I like is that she's learning how to be thorough &ndash; she
polices the area for her brass, practices good range safety, keeps her weapon
cleaned and serviced... the girl's finally pulled her head out of her ass. She's

her than she ever knew. She just won't quit."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"She
runs an extra few miles more than the others &ndash; well, except Lane," a second
instructor chimed in. "She's learning to like the pain, and to push through it.

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>'Outstanding,"
Armalin said, sitting at the head of the conference table. "What about
Ruttheimer &ndash; how's his flight training going?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>One
of the flight instructors &ndash; a tall, thin man with whitish-blond hair seated at
the other end of the table, spoke up. "Excellent. He's doing solo prop flights
now, and I'll start him on jet training before the end of the year," the man
said. "He's a natural. He's got the brains and the skills &ndash; now, as soon as he
gets a little more confidence..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>The
man smiled a big smile, and several of the others around the table shared a
laugh. "If I were a woman, I'd pray that Ruttheimer never gets a uniform and a
set of wings to stick them on. God forbid he were to start flying off a carrier
&ndash; he'd take every decent women in sight that he wanted."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"I
remember the type, Jahr," Kyle laughed, remembering his two deployments aboard <i>USS
Emancipator</i> &ndash; and some of the adventures he and his fellow Marine aviators
had shared with the women throughout the Med... he'd always remember that wekend
on Corsica; him, his RIO and that idjit Sorich with his RIO Benja &ndash; <i>well,
the Porterhouse Challenge was a challenge that no Marine, and certainly no
Marine aviator, could refuse</i> &ndash; and it wasn't as if the ladies, once they

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Still

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Don't

the smile not only off his face, but out of his voice, the assembed group
thought. "Jahr?" <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"I'll

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>The
conference room rumbled with sound, and Nemec quieted the others down before
turning to Armalin. "Eight days. Do you think that they're ready for that?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"That's
a question that I'm asking all of you," he countered. "Well, ladies and

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>The
wiry Black man with very light brown skin and green eyes pushed his glasses up
from the tip of his nose. "As far as the Legionnaires go in the handling of
their powers, I have to give them the green light,"he said. "They're all
showing remarkable progress in controlling their powers at their current
levels, and several of them are going to start developing their abilities in
differing manners. There's also the ones that probably will find that they have
latent abilities; Morgendorffer, D &ndash; being a psi &ndash; is probably the most likely
candidate for that."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Yes,

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"That's
not the only ability she's developing," Randall said. "I was on a speakerphone
this morning, talking to my fiance &ndash; she's down at EPCOT; she's got the
translator job there with Disney... anyway, we start speaking in Aramaic, she
loves to keep me on my toes, and Daria comes in &ndash; she wanted to get a copy of
that brief on psionic defenses, and she asks me about it. I tell her where it
is and about a section I wanted her to look over when she asks me what language
the person on the phone is speaking. That's when I realized that the two of us
have been talking in Aramaic as soon as she stepped into the room."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Randall
saw the raised eyebrow, and held up a copy of a report. "It's in today's

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Three
seats away from Armalin, a handsome, yet bookish man in his thirties spoke with
a cultured and polished New England accent. "I want to go home."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Kyle's

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Samuels
dropped his head in his hands, and received unanimous looks of sympathy from
around the room. "Okay. Has Taylor demonstrated any other aptitudes or

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"She

shoots at my level. Apparently, she's been a shooter since she was in single
digits &ndash;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>her maternal grandfather was a
Civil War re-enactor, and he taught her. She's dead-on with pistol, shotgun or

to urban combat, as well."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Infiltration

that to that sneaky, one-track mind she has, polish her up on her martial arts,
get her as fit as possible so that people will look at her balloon body instead
of her face &ndash; throw in her invisibility &ndash; and I'd say you've got yourself one
hell of an infiltration unit," Nemec finished. "I sure as hell wouldn't want
her coming after me at night &ndash; she's got footwork like a barnyard cat with a
grudge, and she's already got some nice force in her blows. Yeah, with some
training and experience, I'd say that you've got the makings of a decent T-1000
with Taylor. She's wasted in medical." <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"I'll
