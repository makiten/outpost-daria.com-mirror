<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Your
lips may say no, but the Ping of Death says 'yes, yes, yes," Jane smirked.
"Give him a break, okay? A half-hour ago, he looked up in the air and saw a
willy the size of one of the guns on the <i>Battleship Missouri</i>... and not
only was it attached to the only other guy around in a group of girls &ndash; and you
KNOW everyone's thought of this &ndash; but the other guy can also turn into <u>any</u>
man that <u>any</u> girl could want or dream of. Add that to the fact that
Charles is also smarter than he is, can fly a plane <u>and</u> fly on his own,
too... yeah, our young Master Thomas has been neatly and securely put in his
place."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Don't
forget the Colonel's new nickname for him," Daria said, giving up a loose smile
as she swirled a spoonful of oatmeal around the bowl before eating it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"How
could I?" Jane smirked, taking another bite of her giant waffle. "I'll
eventually let him off the hook... but for the next few days - I'm going to have
a Stepford Boyfriend."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Another
piece of the waffle disappeared, and Jane chased it down with a small carton of
two-percent milk. "So you can speak in other languages now?" "That's not the
way it works," Daria explained. "Mr. Randall said that it seems like I can sub
consciously send out a telepathic signal that causes the speech and language
centers in my brain to actively resonate in unison with the speech and language
centers in someone else's brain, so that we both can understand what the
other's saying."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Wait
a minute &ndash; so it's like you can understand what they're saying?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Guess
so."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"No
&ndash; I mean, no just what their words are, but what the words mean?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"You
mean, like 'ebonics' or 'dudespeak'?" Daria bit off the end of a toast
triangle, and chewed slowly. "Well, if I can understand their meaning because
I'm getting it straight from their brain, I guess so."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"That's
great! You can be just like the grandmother from <i>Airplane</i>! 'Excuse me,
stewardess &ndash; I speak 'jive..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"I
also speak in nonverbal languages. Want to see the universal signal for &ndash;"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Trent!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Daria
looked over to see Trent walk into the Legion cafeteria, and as Jane hugged her
brother and then walked him over to the self-serve lines, Tom came over and
stood next to Daria's table, a tray in hand. "Um... can we talk?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Daria
shrugged, and Tom sat town on the other side of the table. "Before we start &ndash;
should I get you a lead-lined blindfold?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Wouldn't
matter &ndash; I can see through lead," Tom grumbled. "Figured that out really
quickly; I can see through almost anything &ndash; but I can't see colors. It's like
seeing the way an airport scanner does, but worlds sharper and clearer. I can
see into someone's body, all the way down to their arteries, and I can see the
individual cells moving through-"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>His
eyes grew wide as Daria's did, and a huge smile went across his face. "I've got
microscopic-vision!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Probably
'telescopic', too, if it works in reverse," Daria said, her expression souring.
"Super-strength, speed, invulnerability, heat vision, this 'shape vision', and
now, super-vision. You're just so incredibly perfect, aren't you?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>The
smile Tom wore as he reached for a biscuit vanished immediately. "Daria... I was
under the impression that-"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Excuse
me, but as far as I'm concerned, you're still new here &ndash; and you need to be
doing things that allow us to trust you," Daria growled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Trust
me? Where did that come from?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Never
mind," she said, suddenly focusing her attention on the sausages on her plate.
"I'm eating."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Look,
I came over here to tell you that I'm sorry for you thinking that I-"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"You
need to stop right now, " she snapped. "For one thing, you're not a very good
liar. Second, you're trying way too hard."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Trying
way too hard? I'm just saying that I'm sorry!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Jane's
cool with what happened. Let it go."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"But
if you're not going to forgive me, or at least try to, it's going to rub things
wrong with Jane," Tom replied. "I'm the boyfriend, you're the best friend &ndash; if
we can't get along, then it's going to catch up with the way we both deal with
her. All I'm asking is that you forgive me for being a incredibly heinous
jackass who did something very stupid &ndash; even though he really didn't mean to &ndash;
and should have come forward right away. I'm sorry for what I did, Daria. I'm
not saying that because I think that's what you want me to day. I really am
sorry."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Daria
looked at the expression on his face, then shrugged and took another bite of
oatmeal. "Holding a grudge takes up too much time and energy," she said
finally. "Besides, from what happened earlier, Jane figures that you've been
punished enough."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Tom
finally seemed to relax. "She's right &ndash; after my shape-vision kicked in, the
first thing that I did was close my eyes and shift to invulnerability; I was
NOT going to look in Sgt. Nemec's direction, and besides, looking up at Charles
was something that I'm never going to be able to unsee-!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Jane
said, 'a willy the size of a battleship gun..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Funny
&ndash; I was thinking 'the Emperor' from the Star Wars movies."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"HUH?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Large,
pale, deformed-looking and wearing a hood..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Everyone
in the cafeteria turned with shocked expressions as they heard a nearly-unknown
sound &ndash; the sound of Daria Morgendorffer bursting out into fits of laughter.
"What the hell is going on over here?" Jane said, a look bridging shock and
surprise on her face as she led an equally-stunned Trent over to the table.
"Tom, what the hell did you say to Daria?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"He
told me about his punishment," Daria giggled &ndash;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>and at that moment, Jane seriously wondered if she should have Quinn
stun Daria &ndash; or do it herself with a static charge &ndash; and then go search both
Daria's room and the Morgendorffer house for the discarded pod <u>this</u>
person had to have come out of. "Sit down &ndash; I'll tell you about it. Trent!
Hello!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Trent
flashed a quick look between Daria and Tom, and then sat down across from his
sister. "Hey," he said, nodding towards Tom. "So... what's been happening?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Daria's
response was cut off as Stacy, escorted by Armalin, walked through the
cafeteria door. She made for the serving line as Armalin looker around at the
Legionnaires and other assorted individuals there, and then left. "Hey, I guess
that was our warning not to miss the meeting in fifteen minutes," Jane said,
scarfing a couple of Trent's sausages and swiping a carton of milk before
attacking her waffle once again. "So, what did he say to make you laugh?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"If
I tell you now, that waffle will be all over us," came the reply. "After you're
finished. What's been going on, Trent?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Not
much. I ran into Mr. DeMartino yesterday evening; I was at the mall, doing the
Global Flapjacks thing."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"He
works there?" Jane asked, surprise in her voice. "That's not right &ndash; that's not
fair! I heard that Ms.Defoe didn't get hired on by the district, either-"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"She
didn't want the job they offered her," Trent interrupted. "They wanted her to
be the Assistant Principal over at Polk High. They wanted to put a woman in
that spot &ndash; they wanted to put Ms. Li there but the entire faculity rose up and
threatened to quit if they brought her in over them. The ghost of Lawndale High
walks in other places, man."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Daria's
eyes were round as saucers. "I didn't see that one coming."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Trent
smiled a very uncharcteristic smile, and the girls at the table drew back.
"There's more?" Jane asked, and Trent nodded. "Okay, she didn't take the job,
so where is Ms. Defoe now?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Staying
with Mr.DeMartino."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"WHAT?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Oh-kaaay...
didn't see that one coming, either," Daria swallowed, as Jane just stared with
disbelief. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Uh,
Daria," Tom said, looking at the expression on Trent's face, "Consider that one
Zyra. I think he's about to drop Bellus right on top of you."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Cool
&ndash; he watches George Pal movies," Trent nodded. "Mr. DeMartino's not working
because he doesn't have to anymore &ndash; well, he's not a teacher anymore. He took
early retirement and the cash-"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Okay,
that explains how-"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Trent
cut Jane off. "-Because he sold his first novel and got serious advance money
for the second one. He's only staying around Lawndale because Ms. Defoe liked
it here, and wants to go back to work at the new Lawndale High."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>There
was silence at the table. "<i>When Worlds Collide'</i> is right," Daria finally
spoke up. "So they're a couple?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"I
got the impression that that's none of my business, but yeah, I think," Trent
told her. "You could probably ask &ndash; he said to tell you guys thanks for all of
the help, and that if you ever wanted anything, even to talk, he'd have the
door open for you."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Great!"
Jane barked. "Let's get some treats for a gift basket and go over tonight &ndash; I
was wondering how Ms. Defoe was doing! This is great &ndash; she's doing okay,
right?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"I
guess so."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"After
the meeting with the Colonel, I'll have somebody in the kitchen whip up
something like a beef brisket or something with all the trimmings, and we'll go
over!" Jane was bouncing in her seat with happiness. "I'm going to need to go
out and get some flowers..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Trent
spoke up. "Colonel? That Marine guy Armalin's gone now?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"No
&ndash; he came back from Washington with a serious promotion and a Navy Cross", Tom
said. "Hey &ndash; you're looking for him? He was just here!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"No,
I'll talk to him later."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"What
are you up to, Trent? Thinking about enlisting?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>"Eat

slender fingers over his bare chest, and opened his eyes to see the slender,

away from the massive bed. "I have set out your clothes for the day, prepared
your bath and requested-" Alimah hesitated for a moment as Singh cast a
sharpened glance at her. "Pardon me &ndash; I ordered the staff to have your
breakfast ready in exactly thirty-five minutes." She allowed her eyes to drop
for a moment &ndash; the appropriate deference, he thought &ndash; before she spoke again.
"If you would like, I can... assist you with your bath."<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

quarter of the world, as defined by the divisions of the equator and the Prime

fingertips that would shame most nations. He had controls upon the grubworms
that were beyond imagining &ndash; for example, Hollywood was, for all possible
reasons, his personal exercise in lowering the intelligence, moral fiber and
general work ethic of the grubworm population as a whole... <i>Baywatch</i>. That
was one of his better schemes, and he laughed until he cried on that day in
1993, when he sat at his desk and looked at the cover of <i>Entertainment
Weekly</i> that declared that <i>Baywatc</i>h was the most popular program on
Earth. Then, there was also that cuckoo Spelling, and the decades of thought-crimes
he had perpetuated upon the grubworms with the television programs he'd brought
forth... <i>with his powers, he could have created things of actual beauty and
worth, but we all have our parts to play, and the money and influence he had
over the grubworms occasionally allowed him to forget his place... well, for one
who'd done his job so well, a touch of insubordination was allowed from time to
time, especially since neither of his children were allowed to manifest...</i><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

turned towards the bath, letting her thin, silken robe slide free from her as
she entered the adjoining room. <i>Well, the task won't be entirely difficult,</i>
he thought. Twenty years old, handpicked by the Council for him from a pool of
two hundred and forty women first identified and nurtured as potential mates
for him ten years ago, and after being narrowed down to the final three... Alimah
was chosen for him. Actually, he would have preferred Erisa Tal &ndash; a petite
Israeli beauty with dark eyes that burned like fire, she was four years older
than Alimah, not even on the same scale as her in terms of beauty and a touch
too outspoken - she had actually demanded to be allowed to attend the
University of Southern California, for the reason of learning about what the
'grubworms' were like firsthand without Elite resources to smooth her way &ndash; but
she would have been an invaluable resource for him. Easily for her abilities to
literally divine any information ever input or transferred through any form of media
from any computer source &ndash; but moreover, for the immediate connection that they
had made when they first met. He respected her opinion, and he also trusted her
implicitly &ndash; a privilege he gave no other person alive. <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

below the Rocky Mountains. Erisa loved the mountains and had chosen to raise
their child there, in that immensely affluent area (even by the standards of
the Elite)... their child, due in six weeks; a special dispensation allowed by
the Council for his decades of unfailing service in which he had <u>never</u>
failed in an assignment. <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

teaching them that anonymity, and the continual ignorance of what they truly
are in the eyes of the general public, is the only path to travel. Had I any

light and fire jerked about eternity as it made his mind's eye explode, literally
burning away memories, his thoughts becoming ash and choking him from within a
thickening, burning cloud of thought come alive on demon's wings, tearing away
