seemed to have an almost unmatched ability to frustrate his father &ndash; the way he
was fixated upon the fairer sex to almost the point of obsession, and never
seemed able to be able to date was a great example. (This was, of course,
before he joined the Legion and had the notorious 'warning' from Daria
Morgendorffer herself. Even after they became friendly, Charles admitted that
he'd always felt a touch on guard whenever he was around her.) Even worse &ndash;
after almost a year of Legion training and the tutelage of Armalin (which the
older Ruttheimer initially resented deeply) that allowed Charles to shape
himself both physically and mentally into an object of intense female interest,
it seemed as if Charles lost his interest in women. <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>That
wasn't the case, as later stories in this book will relate. Charles was not
destined to go to his grave without knowing female companionship - far from it,
especially considering the infamous <b>Porterhouse Challenge</b> incident,
which took place during (and far after) the Vanity Fair party after the Academy
Awards ceremony that year. It wasn't that 'he'd learned respect for women',
either (although being around his fellow Legionnaires of the opposite sex
certainly had calmed him down somewhat) or that he felt that the way women were
throwing themselves at him and competing for his attention was a big scam at
his expense. At this time, Charles had discovered the allure of flight &ndash; and no
woman could compete. <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>He
had his eye on the Prize &ndash; and it wasn't a trophy wife, either. Charles was now
in a position of wealth, respect, with a physical nature worthy of notice, and
it was now that he seemed to abandon his pursuit.</span></i><span lang=EN

<i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:#323D4F'>Now, this &ndash; is &ndash;
FLYING...</span></i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:#323D4F'><br>
<br>
Charles looked over at the airspeed indicator: Mach 6.9 &ndash; almost 5,000 mph. <i>Only
shuttles, ballistic missiles and the X-15 ever flew this fast, along with the
early space rockets,</i> he thought, looking out at the curvature of the Earth.<br>
<br>
"How long until we get there?" <br>
<br>
"Ten minutes," the pilot said, turning to Armalin, who was strapped in at the
co-pilot's position. "Take the plane, Colonel?"<br>
<br>
"I'll fly her back," Armalin replied, looking at the expression on Charles'
face. "First time in a real plane, Ruttheimer?"<br>
<br>
"This- this is..."<br>
<br>
"I know," Armalin smiled. "I thought my first catapult launch off Emancipator
was something. Global Rapid Infantry Deployment, Mark II &ndash; the <i>Gridrunner</i>,
they call her. Quest Corporation ultratech long-distance, hypersonic recon and
transport craft; able to place or retrieve troops anywhere on the planet within
ninety minutes. Top rated speed &ndash; Mach 10, with V/STOL capability. Built as the
Quest Corporation's response to NASA's 'Hyper-X' program."<br>
<br>
"NASA didn't want it? Or the Air Force or Marines?"<br>
<br>
"People have egos," Armalin said simply. "Department of Defense didn't want it,
either &ndash; to them, no ground troops are worth the one billion dollars upwards
each of these babies cost. The Mark II's can carry one hundred troops and their
equipment, or forty and a support vehicle &ndash; she's got a special interior
modular design that allows the ground crews to swap out interior sections
according to specific mission profiles."<br>
<br>
"These things cost the same as a nuclear submarine?"<br>
<br>
"Easily. The avionics alone run something along the lines of a third of a
billion &ndash; the onboard computer is liquid-based and hardened against outside
interference, EMP's; it can effectively act as an autopilot and complete a
flight without a pilot. All she needs is someone to sit in the pilot's seat and
give her instructions &ndash; she'll take off, do mid-air course corrections, land...
hell, she's capable of fighting a decent air-to-air, but her best defense is to
run. There's only four things out there that can knock a <i>Gridrunner</i>
moving at full speed down &ndash; another <i>Gridrunner</i>, a ballistic missile, an
orbital weapon or a Class 5 metahuman with a serious grudge against whomever's
inside. " You should see the Mark III's - the heavy transports, that can carry
two hundred men and a couple of support vehicles...<br>
<br>
He turned to face Charles. "This time next year, if you can cut it &ndash; you'll be
qualified to fly her. Take a good look &ndash; if everything goes well, this is what
you can look forward to. This is the brass ring, Charles."<br>
<br>
He turned back to the control panel as Charles sat back in his seat,
envisioning the day when he'd be in the pilot's seat... "In case you're wondering
&ndash; Secondary Adamantium," Armalin said. "That's the way they got around a lot of
problems with flying a bird like this &ndash; metal fatigue, temperature variants &ndash;
the entire bird's outer skin is made of a layer of Secondary Adamantum &ndash; that's
a metal stronger than omnium or titanium steel compounds. Perfect for the <i>Gridrunner</i>.
The government gave Quest Corporation access to the creation process of the
base metal in exchange for five of these birds-&quot;<br>
<br>
<i>Actually, eleven,</i> Kyle thought. <i>The sixth is sitting in a secured
hangar at Andrews AFB, on standby in case they need to get the First Family
outta Dodge if the bomb goes up &ndash; and the other four belong to DELPHI. Three
tasked for POGO support, and the other two &ndash; a Mark II and a Mark III &ndash; they're
for... we're not even supposed to think about that. That's Dark Door material.</i><br>
<br>
"-And they used the mass-production variant to outfit this plane."<br>
<br>
"Tell me what else she can do..."<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
"That's a skill I have to work on," Jane said, glancing back at where Stacy was
sleeping soundly before turning to look at Tom. "So, what are we doing...?"<br>
<br>
"Just looking out the window," Tom replied, almost breathlessly. "I was looking
down at the thing on the ground &ndash; we're over British Columbia now. I can see
traffic signs down there &ndash; I could see a guy putting change in a parking
meter!"<br>
<br>
"Okay &ndash; are we checking out those hot Canadian girls down there?" <br>
<br>
Jane chuckled, and snuggled close to him. "Now, don't get any ideas... well, not
about them, anyway."<br>
<br>
"Jane, I-&quot;<br>
<br>
"Just kidding!" she smirked. "Now, you never gave me any feedback or an
opinion..."<br>
<br>
"About what?"<br>
<br>
"Well, since you already got a sneak peek at the merchandise, the least you
could do is tell me what you thought..."<br>
<br>
Tom felt momentarily trapped &ndash; and then, as another image came unbidden in his
mind, words just came out that made a beautiful smile pour out of Jane.<br>
<br>
"Remember the first 'Indiana Jones' movie? I thought <i>-'This has to be what
was in the Ark of the Covenant. This view &ndash; in full, living color..."</i><br>
<br>
He relished the feel of Jane's lips on his own, but as he pulled her close,
another face blinked into view for the briefest of moments... and then, was gone
just as quickly, so much so that he didn't even recognize it.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
"That was really a good idea, Sandi," Quinn said. "Having those bags ready in
the garage just in case we all needed to leave the Tower in an emergency &ndash; what
are those called again?"<br>
<br>
"Bug-out bags," Sandi told her. "There's been a lot of stuff online about being
prepared in case you have to leave the place you live because of something like
Hurricane Katrina &ndash; and after seeing what all those poor people had to go
through... all the stuff they showed of those people without any food, or water,
medicine..." <br>
<br>
Quinn was surprised at the look on Sandi's face. "If something happened like
that in Lawndale, I wanted to make sure that we could have the things we needed
to stay healthy for seven days &ndash; that's how long it took before the government
could get help in to those people. I know that we might not have to worry &ndash;
Quest could get stuff in way before that, like we did down there &ndash; but still,
you never know what things will be like. People get scared and crazy during
times like that, and they'll do anything to get whatever they need to survive-"<br>
<br>
"That's why you put that bear-class pepper spray in everyone's bags?"<br>
<br>
"It'll drive people away without anyone having to use their powers openly." <i>I
think you're going to freak when you see what else I have in my bag, and
Brittany's...</i> "There's also a couple of survival packages I set up with those
&ndash; Sgt. Nemec helped me."<br>
<br>
"It's just so weird that she's being so nice to you now! She still sneers at
the rest of us &ndash; well, maybe not so much at Stacy anymore &ndash; why is she treating
you two so different?"<br>
<br>
"She's not, Quinn. She's just trying to teach us stuff that'll help us help
other people, and Stacy and me are just trying to see things the way she does.
She's not that bad &ndash; Gawd, she needs a makeover, and don't look at her
fingernails when she eats &ndash; somebody needs to go back into Fashion Basic
Training...!"<br>
<br>
Both girls giggled, but Sandi thought, <i>A year or so back, I'd have been
laughing out loud at people like Sgt. Nemec &ndash; and not noticing how hard they
were trying not to laugh at me. Pretty nails aren't as important as a lot of
other things, and those things (and people like Sgt. Nemec) are WAY more
important than any clothes, makeover or being popular-</i><br>
<br>
<i>Well, let's not lose focus here. The Prom IS important &ndash; that's a memory to
be made! &ndash; And then there's the Senior Prom, and the Debutante Ball... I'd say
Homecoming, but we didn't get to have one because there's no Lawndale High to
come back to yet (but they ARE working fast to get it back up &ndash; I heard that
they'll be ready to start classes at the beginning of the next school year...
Seniors at the New Lawndale High, and in the Legion. I can be popular again and
still help people, and mean it... there's nothing wrong with having fun, as long
as you don't lose focus. <br>
<br>
Speaking of having fun, and focus, and all of those cute Prom gowns... we've
never had a formal event since the Legion begun. Something with all of the
popular people... and all of the important people... and since we're the Legion,
and people all over know about us, all sorts of celebrities and stars &ndash; I was
reading up on the Colonel, and even outside of the service, he's a
kind-of-celebrity, so he'd probably know people to invite to our formal Legion
ball...Our Legion Formal Ball &ndash; to introduce ourselves to Lawndale and everyone
else, because now we have the place to have a big dance, and celebration...oh,
yeah. And for the other kids in all of the other Legion chapters. They don't
HAVE to spend money on formal gowns and suits or tuxes for the guys... maybe the
Legion jackets and nice clothes, too &ndash; or how about a Legion dress uniform for
formal occasions, like the Colonel has his dress blues and his regular uniforms
&ndash; something nice, but doesn't cost an arm and a leg, that makes the other
Legionnaires look good; even the ones who aren't fashionable should get that.<br>
<br>
Hey, now. Thinking like we're the old Sandi for a moment. <br>
Still doesn't mean that we can't crack on the unfashionable people for just a
moment. For old times' sake...but just a moment, otherwise I'd have to think
about &ndash;<br>
<br>
I refuse to think about that. People can change anyway, right? That's what I'm
doing, so I guess it's all right if-<br>
<br>
I don't want to think about that.<br>
<br>
But we have to have something for our families first. Thanksgiving's coming up,
and nobody's had much time with their families... maybe we could have
Thanksgiving Dinner at the Legion Tower, and invite everyone...and have a reason
for everyone to dress up...</i><br>
<br>
"Ouinn..."<br>
<br>
'Yes, Sandi?"<br>
<br>
"I was just wondering something; Thanksgiving's a few weeks off &ndash; you're going
to have dinner with your family at home, right?"<br>
<br>
"I guess so..."<br>
<br>
"I was thinking about it, because with the problems that my brothers are at the
table every year..."<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
He sat next to the temporary barracks that he had brought up with him &ndash; <i>if I
don't have to be uncomfortable, then why should I be? I'll be in the muck soon
enough SOMEWHERE around the world, right? </i>&ndash; and looked up into the early
morning sky as he heard the sound of a jet in the distance. <br>
<br>
His name was Betty. <br>
<br>
The Colonel had hired him for two reasons &ndash; but only the first was important
here. Armalin knew that he was a better instructor at survival in hostile
environments &ndash; better in survival than than even he was, and he didn't even
have the powers that should have given the Colonel an overwhelming advantage &ndash;
but he didn't want him to train them. <br>
<br>
<i>Just enjoy your stay up here. If they show up and ask, you're a Brit with
money, a taste for adventure and who likes being left the hell alone &ndash; so this
is my yard for right now, and I'll thank you kids to stay the hell off it! 'Get
offen my yard' &ndash; or whatever you say over there...<br>
<br>
If things go well, you won't even see any of them &ndash; not all of them, and only a
couple, maybe once or twice. Just keep an eye out in case anyone needs help &ndash;
and if anyone needs emergency medical treatment, send us a signal and teleport
them to the hospital here in Lawndale. We've already worked out a protocol with
them as far as Legionnaire injuries are concerned. &ndash; and before you teleport,
MAKE SURE that you remember to dampen the effect field. The LAST thing we need
for you to do is deforest two-thirds of the island and cause a minor tsunami on
the coastline because you jumped a few thousand miles and caused an explosion
in doing it.</i><br>
<br>
That was the second reason the Englishman was hired &ndash;and why he was called
'Betty'. He was an explosives specialist who looked upon the creation and
application of things that go 'boom' as beyond a profession, and more of a
calling.<br>
<br>
He could use explosive devices to do almost anything required; perhaps something
as small and delicate as setting a nano-charge in a dash of jelly to dispatch a
particularly annoying and repulsively large black fly with a minimum of
splatter (the fly was blown neatly in half, but not apart - and for some
strange reason, the folks back at Hereford loved to replay that on Christmas). <br>
<br>
For larger purposes, he was intimate with the latest Class 5 weaponry of this
nature in the British arsenal, right up to the rhenium/antimatter devices that
Her Majesty's Government had created and kept unassembled (but ready to go
within twenty-four hour's notice) in case of a spaceborne ELE (such as a rogue
comet or asteroid) that needed to be effectively obliterated and wouldn't be
scratched by the nuclear devices the other governments had.<br>
<br>
<br>
He also was a metahuman, with an ability that fit his profile (a SBS master
chief working on special detached duty with the Quest Corporation in their
armaments research division); he had the ability to transport himself great
distances with unerring, unnerving speed and accuracy &ndash; and proved it by
teleporting himself from a Royal Navy frigate in the North Sea, to a second
frigate roughly 400 miles dead east of the Falkland Islands, to a small
tropical island located some one hundred or so miles south of the Pitcairn
Islands &ndash; and directly into an empty chair in the dining room at Number Ten,
Downing Street... where he presented a pair of freshly-cut pineapples to the wife
of the Prime Minister, who had ordered the test and was waiting for him. <br>
<br>
Minus the five minutes it took to get the pineapples, it took only twenty-eight
seconds for him to teleport around the world. Of course, the island and the two
frigates were effectively erased from existence in the massive plasma release
caused by the instaneous, microscopic, cross-dimensional convergence of several
universes as his form acted as a tesseract &ndash; as it opened and closed, sending
out a release of energy in direct proportion to how far he traveled. He could
release the energy at the point of exit or entry, but he had to release it, and
it exploded outward from him in a blistering, shearing wave from his waistline...
The first time he demonstrated his ability for the Black Air representatives,
the oldest one (a Cambridge lad who'd felt the need to prove that no Fritz
sniper could outshoot him in WWII) remarked how much like the German weapons
they knew as 'Bouncing Betty's his power was...<br>
<br>
The name stuck immediately. <br>
<br>
The silly ones always do. <br>
<br>
Betty sat back down and sprinkled seasonings on the pair of arctic char he'd
caught earlier, now grilling on his portable grill. He loved the fish, freshly
caught, and the smell reminded him of vacations in Scotland where he'd also
caught them... not to mention Edme, and her huge, gray eyes, and the fact that
she was better as a fisherman than she was. <br>
<br>
<i>Just enjoy your time here. It's on the Quest Corp's bill. Three weeks of
just enjoying the quiet &ndash; and then, you'll transfer down to the Utah site. I'll
have the mansion opened &ndash; I'll have Miss Hall re-open it &ndash; and then, you'll get
to work. Just remember... if you go off like a baby nuke, we'll have to explain
that. If you go off with just enough force to level a few buildings &ndash; that,
people will see and just say, 'Wow &ndash; wasn't that cool...?' In fact, you may want
to have a TV crew come out and see you working with the explosives &ndash; people
love to see things blow up &ndash; and that'll allay suspicion from your primary
duties. Oh, yes &ndash; the night before you leave... have a fireworks display for the
masses. A BIG display. At least forty minutes in length, and something to make
the Millennium celebratory shows look sad in comparison. That's great PR with
the folks at home.</i><br>
<br>
Betty let the scent of his breakfast fill his nostrils. <i>Let's just hope
those kids can survive off Armalin's teat for a few days in the wild. I always
love hearing people tell their Outlast stories; maybe these kids will have a
few things happen that'll be fodder for stories later on. I still get a laugh
talking about the fawn that ate my corn flakes when I set my kit down and went
to take a leak...</i><br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
"Blum-Deckler... are you okay?"<br>
<br>
"Yes... sir," the beautiful Asian girl said, looking up from her portable DVD
player to see Armalin standing next to her. "I'm... watching &ndash;&quot;<br>
<br>
<i>"Buckaroo Banzai Against The World Crime League!"</i> Armalin said, delight
in his voice. "Back at the Academy, me and my friends would always watch all of
the <i>Buckaroo Banzai Trilogy</i> films... "<br>
<br>
"But... there's... seven... now," the girl drawled. "If... there's... seven... why... do...
they... call... it... a... trilogy...?"<br>
<br>
Armalin gave her a look that left no doubt he had seriously considered tossing
her out of the plane for the briefest of moments. "You're not a 'Blue Blaze',
are you?"<br>
<br>
"Nobody... in... the... Legion... can... start... fires... except... Tom... with...his... eyes..."<br>
<br>
"Blum-Deckler &ndash; why are you watching that movie?"<br>
<br>
"I... forgot... to... bring... my... DVD... case... and... this... is... Stacy's..."<br>
<br>
"Rowe brought a DVD player?" He shook his head in disbelief - <i>I'll have a
talk with her when they get back</i> &ndash; and then a thought struck him... <br>
<br>
"Blum-Deckler... what did you bring?"<br>
<br>
"My... makeup... kit... and... a... hair... dryer... because... Quinn... can... hold... the... plug...
and... it... will... run..."<br>
<br>
Tiffany turned away from Armalin, missing the pained look on his face, and
stared out the window. <br>
<br>
"I... was... wondering... how... far... up... we... are... in... the... air..."<br>
<br>
"Actually, we'll start coming down in a few minutes," he said, forcing himself
to smile at her. "Look... we haven't talked much lately, even during your
training, and - I was just wondering... is there anything that you'd like to talk
to me about?" <br>
<br>
Tiffany looked into the universe, and then came back. As much as she ever does.
"Why... aren't... you... dating?"<br>
<br>
Well, that one came out of nowhere. "Blum-Deckler, I don't feel that it's
appropriate to discuss my personal life with you &ndash;"<br>
<br>
"But... you... know... all... about... us," she pointed out. "You... aren't... married... or...
divorced... there's... no... mark... where... the... ring... would... be..."<br>
<br>
"Blum-Deckler, I wanted to just let you know that I don't want you to feel that
you can't just come and talk to me if you're having problems, or just need to
speak freely-"<br>
<br>
"You're... not... <i>gay</i>... are... you...?"<br>
<br>
Armalin dropped his head in defeat, and went to the rear compartment of the
hypersonic transport as Tiffany turned her head upward in contemplation... or
maybe she was just fascinated by the reading light just above and before her
seat.<br>
<br>
That one kind of bit you on the bottom, didn't it?"<br>
<br>
"Morgendorkker &ndash; I mean, <i>Morgendorffer</i>." Armalin stood quietly for a
moment, and then looked back at Daria, who was sitting alone in the last row
with a novel for company. "I apologize." <br>
<br>
Daria shrugged, and Armalin gave a glance to Jane, sitting in the seat directly
opposite Daria's; Jane took the hint and went forward to sit with Tom and
Brittany, who were playing <i>Uno</i>, as Armalin took her seat.<br>
<br>
"That has been a point of minor discussion with the former Fashion Clubbies &ndash;
as well as with the Y-chromosome crowd, especially since you wore your dress
uniform with all of your shiny buttons and ribbons on it. They wonder why you
aren't chasing at least something around."<br>
<br>
<i>Because I take my job seriously, because the pickings are pretty slim around
these parts and because all of the women I've seen that are decent looking are
taken, like that Landon guy's wife and the cute little art teacher that used to
work at Lawndale High &ndash; I ran into her at the Lawndale Mall buying books, she's
really a sweet woman - and when I went over to pay my respect to Mr. Vitale, I
remember getting a very good look at your m-</i><br>
<br>
Armalin was suddenly and profoundly grateful for the training in deflecting
passive psionic scans and mental resistance that he'd received from various
sources since he was sixteen years old, as well as his own natural
psi-defenses. "I'm not dating or seeing someone because I have a job to do here
in Lawndale. This is the <u>last</u> time I'll discuss this personal part of my
life with you, Morgendorffer. Pass that around, and make sure that everyone
understands."<br>
<br>
Daria's eyes were widened by the snap Armalin put into his voice. "Good. Now
that we understand that, <i>let's talk about you."</i><br>
<br>
"There's nothing new to talk about."<br>
<br>
"No, I'd say there's plenty... for one thing, you've actually loosened up a tiny,
tiny bit from when I first met you, six months ago."<br>
<br>
"You're making me blush."<br>
<br>
"That's not a joke, Morgendorffer. After my first meeting with you, I have to
tell you that I was seriously considering other options concerning you being in
the Legion." He looked Daria directly in the eye, and the young woman felt a
distinct spike of ice began to inch its way up her spine. "There are very few
things more dangerous than a psionic without any control over themselves or
their powers."<br>
<br>
Armalin sat forward in his seat. "The doctors say that you've been doing better
with controlling your blood pressure; this is actually a problem a number of
baseline-normals have that suddenly gain psionic abilities-" <br>
<br>
Daria stopped him short. "There are <i>other</i> psychics out there?"<br>
<br>
Armalin was silent for a touch longer than Daria liked; he simply said, "Yes,"
and reached into his fatigue jacket to pull a small device from a pocket. "This
is for you."<br>
<br>
"What is it?" she said, looking it over; the device was meant to be worn on the
wrist, judging from the thick, Velcro-fastened wristband, and it had a small
numerical pad and a small display on the front, covered by a clear, flip-up
panel. "A bit fancy for a watch, isn't it?"<br>
<br>
"This is a Mark 10 psionic interlock," he told her, unfastening the Velcro
strap. "Take off your BP monitor bracelet and put this on. For the immediate
future, whenever you're going into the field, you'll wear this."<br>
<br>
"An 'interlock?"<br>
<br>
"Here's your manual &ndash; if you get bored, it's fascinating reading," he responded
dryly. "Those are standard-issue to all psis who gained their powers as you
have &ndash; accidentally, as opposed to being born with them or having them manifest
around puberty... This device has several uses. First off, it'll act as a health
monitor &ndash; all of your vitals, not just your BP, and if it detects that your
pressure's spiking, it has a 'calming' mechanism built in that will activate to
calm you down. A hypersonic/vibratory wave generator, and it works very well."<br>
<br>
"Why are you just giving me this now?"<br>
<br>
"To be frank, Morgendorffer &ndash; you haven't earned the right to have one until
recently. You've been busting your butt in PT and AIT-&quot;<br>
<br>
<i>Advanced Individual Training</i>, Daria remembered. "-And you haven't had
any further problems with your psi-powers. Personally, I wish that we had a
qualified psi to come in and work with you, but mind-types with the right
qualifications are very hard to come by. Once we're finished, Morgendorffer &ndash;
you're going to have a world of opportunities opening up to you. You've gotten
to a point where people believe that you have a need for a Mark 10. It could
save your life."<br>
<br>
Daria fastened the Mark 10 snug against her left wrist and looked it over.
"Looks like a fancy monitor Olympic athletes would use." <br>
<br>
Armalin decided not to tell her about the GPS locator inside the device &ndash; or
any of the other features... "You said that this was a 'Mark 10'. Is there a
'Mark 20?"<br>
<br>
"There is &ndash; and depending on how you do in your training, you may be granted
access to one someday," Armalin told her. "The people who have those... I
understand that they're... that they have a lot of fun using them."<br>
<br>
"What about a 'Mark 30?' Do you have those?"<br>
<br>
Daria cringed inwardly from the look on Armalin's face as he suddenly rose from
his seat. "There is a 'Mark 30'... and I hope we never need to talk about your
needing one," he said. "Excuse me for a moment."<br>
<br>
Jane watched as the Marine walked past, and then darted back to Daria. "Oh,
look &ndash; he gave you jewelry!" she smirked, noticing the Mark 10 on Daria's
wrist. "Does it have an MP3 player or let you go online?"<br>
<br>
"It's supposed to watch my blood pressure and keep it down with a... 'hypersonic/vibratory
wave generator."<br>
<br>
"He gave you a vibrator? Daria, I didn't think that you liked the military
types...!"<br>
<br>
"Keep it up, and I'll kick you so far off the planet that you'll never be able
to find your way home!"<br>
<br>
"All right &ndash; listen up, Legionnaires!" Armalin said, coming back from the
cockpit with Charles in tow. "Ruttheimer, tale a seat. People, count off by
three!"<br>
<br>
After a quick chorus of "One!" "Two!" "Three!", Armalin looked around at the
young men and women. "I want everyone with the same number in the same row.
Move it!"<br>
<br>
Charles sat just behind Jane and Sandi, who looked at one another and nodded
grudging approval, while Daria rolled her eyes as she watched Stacy and
Brittany bounce into the seats next to her. Quinn gave both Tom and Tiffany big
smiles as they sat down, which made Jane's eyes narrow.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't, like, worry about that," Sandi said, tapping Jane on her forearm.
"She's like that with every guy &ndash; and besides, she's never go after any guy who
thought her sister was cuter than she was."<br>
<br>
"What the hell does <i>that</i> mean?!"<br>
<br>
"Lane, you got something you'd like to share with the rest of the
kindergarten?"<br>
<br>
"Ah, no sir," she said, her face reddening as she saw how everyone was staring
at her. "Just waitin' for a chance to get down there and whup some supervillain
butt, that's all."<br>
<br>
"You know, people were annoyed when I did a Will Smith impression, Lane &ndash; and I
am a Black Marine fighter pilot. Save it for later."<br>
<br>
"Sir, what exactly are we doing down there?"<br>
<br>
Armalin looked down at Quinn, and then around the cabin. "All right &ndash; here it
is, Legionnaires. You are here to participate in an MHAACS- 'Meta-Human Asset
Acclimation and Compatibility Screening- scenario-&quot;<br>
<br>
He pronounced the acronym as 'em-hacks'. "&ndash;One of the five primary qualifications
that all known metahumans must undergo and complete in order to gain
certification and be allowed unrestricted movement and operational privileges
in the United States and those other nations that are signatories to the <i>Bowman
Acts</i>. You did realize that there were other reasons that the training cadre
and I have been here besides teaching all of you how to keep from getting
stomped on by every person who can float in the air and fire an energy beam
from their eyes, right?"<br>
<br>
"I'm not going to work for the government or joining the military."<br>
<br>
"Did anyone ask you if they <u>wanted</u> you to join their group or agency,
Ms. Morgendorffer?" Armalin said, spearing her with that look that all of the
Legionnaires had learned to dread. "While the height of arrogance is supposedly
to say that one would never belong to a group that would in fact have one as a
member, it is actually, in fact, operating under the grossly misplaced
assumption or delusion that they would in fact want you to become a part of
their group. A great woman who I was fortunate enough to train under when I was
younger said something I've always remembered about becoming a member of the
special force she was a commander in. It applies to any group like hers,
however."<br>
<br>
"There are other groups of people like us?" Tom said, stunned. "Organized and
trained like us?"<br>
<br>
"Mr. Sloane, you didn't pay attention to what I said moments ago. 'All known
metahumans'. If there are international protocols set in place, then there's
probably been a few groups of people just like you, right?"<br>
<br>
Tom nodded. "All right, then. Her name was <i>Ororo</i>, and she told one of
her trainees that there was a reason the original five members of that group
were chosen as opposed to others with powers who were active at the time - and
why she and her teammates were specifically chosen to replace them. She told
him that it was why he belonged there, and why some of the others in training
at the time may not... because being a member of that team meant more than just
being a metahuman."<br>
<br>
Armalin walked around them as he spoke, stopping in front of Sandi and looking
directly into her eyes. "It was about being <i>a hero</i>."<br>
<br>
They shared a smile, and Armalin looked around at the others. "Get fastened in,
everyone. We're starting our descent. I'll give you the rest when we're
dirtside."<br>
