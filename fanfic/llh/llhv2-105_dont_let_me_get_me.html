color:#323D4F'>"Would you hold on a little tighter, Sandi?"<br>
<br>
"Oh, sure, like, I'd bet you'd like that!"<br>
<br>
Jane sighed as she looked over the green-on-gray landscape with her binoculars,
the sun surprisingly low in the sky. <i>Just when you think someone's changing,
they do or say something that reminds you of why you don't like them and never
really did.</i> <br>
<br>
Sitting behind her atop a ginger-hued horse, Sandi shifted herself slightly.
&quot;How's that?&quot; she said.<br>
<br>
Jane winced as Sandi pulled tight around her waist. &quot;HEY!&quot; she
snapped. &quot;Not so tight - at least not without a really good night out on
the town!&quot; <br>
<br>
"But I thought you'd like this,&quot; Sandi said, letting up on Jane slightly
as she whispered into her ear. &quot;Well, you do have Tom now... still, I'll bet
you wouldn't mind if I were <i>Daria</i>, and held on just a bit tighter... or <i>higher</i>..."<br>
<br>
<i><u>&quot;What?&quot;</u></i><br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, it's okay,&quot; Sandi continued, and Jane could hear the bubbling
mirth in her voice. &quot;Sooner or later, everybody has a little bit of a
girl-crush... every now and then...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why are you being such a- <i>hey! OW!&quot;</i><br>
<br>
Both Jane and Sandi grunted with pain as they dropped onto the cold, soft
grassy earth from about four feet up! The two young women looked crossly at
Charles, who had transformed from horse to human form and was looking at both
with wide, unblinking eyes. All three of the Legionnaires were dressed in their
standard uniforms, but were also wearing winter coats and gloves.<br>
<br>
<i>"Wha-wh-what..."</i><br>
<br>
"Oh, stop it, Charles &ndash; you, too, Jane," Sandi said, brushing herself off as
she stood up and looked around before turning back and ignoring the looks her
fellow Legionnaires gave her. "We've been out here two hours and haven't found
anything yet &ndash; and Charles' stomach is growling so loudly that we can all hear
it. It's time to stop and have something for lunch, anyway. After we eat, we'll
keep looking for another hour, and then head back to the others &ndash; I don't like
not having much daylight. Charles &ndash; don't change back like that again. Someone
might be watching."<br>
<br>
Jane stood up, groaning; it had been a long time since she'd ridden a horse &ndash;
and having that horse be a boy she'd detested on general principle since
primary school wasn't exactly something that made her feel comfortable,
especially knowing the jokes and stories that he could come up with...<br>
<br>
She looked over at Charles with some surprise. He wasn't paying any attention
to her or Sandi &ndash; in fact, he hadn't been making any of the usual cracks you'd
have expected of 'Upchuck' when he was alone with girls, or trying to be funny...
he was slightly distracted, in fact.<br>
<br>
"Charles...?"<br>
<br>
"Oh, I'm sorry,&quot; Charles said, turning to face Jane. &quot;I was just
thinking how much this looks like &ndash; I came up here for my vacation."<br>
<br>
Sandi looked up from her backpack. "You spent your time on your vacation here
in Alaska?"<br>
<br>
"Well, two weeks of it was on a cruise ship, but I spent about four days kind
of lost and walking around a place a lot like this," he recalled. "It was...
okay. I wasn't in any real danger while I was lost - my father took me camping
every year, so I already know how to take care of myself in the woods - but the
powers do make it easier."<br>
<br>
Charles took a couple of the large stones Jane handed him to complete the small
circle on the ground, and walked toward a clump of trees. "It was... nice up
here," he said, collecting several fallen branches and walking back, then
snapping them easily into pieces just right to build a small fire. "Quiet, with
lots of space, and it doesn't smell like a city..."<br>
<br>
Sandi opened her backpack, and pulled out a folding stool to sit upon. "Why
didn't you just turn into a bird and fly back to the cruise ship?"<br>
<br>
Charles ignored her as he went back and got more wood. &quot;Charles-!&quot;<br>
<br>
"He must have had a good reason," Jane said, and she shrugged in response to
Sandi's annoyed look. "He had a way out if there was any real problems and he
knows the wilderness &ndash; why not talk a few days and just enjoy the quiet?"<br>
<br>
The two young women just watched Charles quietly &ndash; more from a light sense of
shock, really &ndash; as he changed into a tiny dragon, puffed a small stream of fire
out of his mouth and set the kindling on fire before changing back to human
form. "This is better," he said, changing back and rubbing his hands over the
merrily burning campfire. "When I was up here before, I didn't have any trouble
staying warm or with finding anything to eat."<br>
<br>
Sandi suppressed a shudder as she triplicated a sandwich. "What did you eat?"<br>
<br>
"There's lots of edible plants and berries &ndash; but that can get very old fast.
I'd become a bird and check the area out for hunters, change into a Kodiak
bear, swat fish out of the streams, then build a fire and grill them."<br>
<br>
Jane watched Sandi triplicate the one-liter bottle of water she had drawn from
her backpack. "What about at night?"<br>
<br>
"Kodiak bears don't really have a problem with being cold," he said, accepting
three sandwiches and a bottle of water from Sandi. "You'll always be warm, and
if someone's with you, then you can keep them warm, too-"<br>
<br>
"You met someone and they know about your powers?" Sandi said sharply, and Jane
grabbed the bottle of water from her as she drew back on reflex, almost
knocking her trio of sandwiches to the ground. "And you didn't say anything
about it?"<br>
<br>
"I told the Colonel when I got back," Charles said, glancing over at Jane, "and
I told the Legion Leader &ndash; at the time &ndash; too."<br>
<br>
Sandi flashed a glare at Jane. "You <i>knew</i>?"<br>
<br>
"I'm not worried, and the Colonel isn't either," Jane remarked, biting into her
sandwich. "Besides, Bonnie promised to keep it secret-"<br>
<br>
"You know her name &ndash; it was a 'her?" <br>
<br>
Sandi looked between the other two Legionnaires. "You were up here alone for
four days &ndash; and four nights - in Alaska, with some girl, and you let her know <u>that
you have powers</u>? <i>Why didn't you tell any of the rest of us?"</i><br>
<br>
"Why didn't I tell you?"<br>
<br>
Charles looked Sandi directly in the eye. "Remember the way you all acted when
I joined up? Remember back in August, when I came to tell all of you about
Hurricane Katrina?"<br>
<br>
Sandi shrugged. "So?"<br>
<br>
"So? <i>So, when have any of you <u>ever</u> wanted to talk to <b>'Upchuck?"</b></i><br>
<br>
Sandi's mouth opened in disbelief from Charles' words, spoken matter-of-factly
and without any malice; she tried to speak but could find no words, and Charles
turned from the two young women to the fire as Sandi and Jane looked from him
to each other.<br>

bet a million dollars that they still have guns on them somewhere...and I'm sure
that the Colonel knows that, too. Sandi's learning entirely too much of that special-ops

seen the way girls look at Charles &ndash; the ones that aren't from Lawndale, or at
least aren't from Lawndale High, and especially since he's been in the Legion...
They look at him the way they look at me &ndash; but they look at me like I'm covered
in money. They look at him like he should be covered with their hot little
bodies &ndash; what did Jackie Chan say in </i>Rush Hour 2<i>? 'She likes me because
I'm cute. Like - Snoopy.' Oh, yeah. His family has money, the girls think he's
cute &ndash; especially now since he's slowly started to move off that 'Casanova

good &ndash; especially with his growth spurt. He was always short, and I guess
getting his powers coincided with that, because he's grown at least four inches
taller than Stacy, who was always the tallest. He's almost six foot &ndash; but none
of them ever noticed that he's taller than they are because they've always
looked down their noses at him. I wonder how they're going to react when they
see some of the model-like hot girls and the rich girls that they're jealous of

pulled a yellow flag, small and slightly triangular in shape, from his heavy
fatigue jacket. "Here's the deal. See this flag? There are twenty of these
flags scattered across the island &ndash; and trust me, they are <u>not</u> going to
be exactly easy to find. Once you hit the ground, you have seventy-two hours to
find a minimum of ten of these flags and have them in your possession when we
return to pick you up. Do you understand me, Legionnaires? Having ten of these
in your possession will be considered as having successfully completed the
exercise." <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

collectively threw brain bleach on that image. "But, as I mentioned before,
there really shouldn't be much reason for you to use those powers. Of course, I
could be wrong, so I want you people to go in prepared. I want you to use your

Marine's words, and watched as Brittany and Stacy appeared out of thin air as
Stacy set them both down on the ground. "That's one," Stacy smiled, looking at
the flag with a big smile on her face. "There aren't any more in the treetops,

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

planned this out, and he said there's probably no reason to use our powers, but
the only place we've found a flag so far was in a place were we wouldn't have
found it unless we DID use them! So, maybe one of the things we're supposed to
figure out while we're doing this is that what he said things are supposed to
be like isn't the way things really are, so we shouldn't do what he said
because then, we won't win &ndash; so doing <u>exactly</u> what we're supposed to do
is really the way to <u>lose</u> because then, all we're doing is listening to
an adult blindly just because they're an adult, instead of paying attention in
the place where we are because we're here and we know what we have to do and
they're back there only thinking that they know what we need to do!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

aside the fact that someone needs to tell you about comma splices... that
actually makes a great deal of sense."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

color:#323D4F'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Daria noticed that the
woods had gotten a bit too quiet, save for the soft rushing sounds of the river
behind them, and turned to see Stacy at the riverbank, crouched down low on a
large, slippery rock as she looked into the clear, clean waters. "Stacy... what
are you doing?" <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Oh, yeah!" Brittany suddenly spurted out. "It <u>is</u>
supposed to be getting dark soon &ndash; remember, they only get about eight or nine
hours of daylight here in Alaska at this time of the year, so we should start
thinking about getting back to the camp, and bringing some fish back for
dinner, remember?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Okay &ndash; but let's go back first, and you can get the fish on the
riverbank there, all right?" Daria had no problems eating fresh fish, but even
the thought of Stacy actually reaching in and swatting the fish out of the
water &ndash; or worse, reaching in and spearing a fish with her claws &ndash; made her
more than slightly queasy. "I don't want to fly back with you carrying the both
of us and some fish, too!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Oh, yeah &ndash; we forgot to bring something to carry them!"
Brittany said, her face having a slight pout. "Wait a second &ndash; I might have
something in my pack that we can use!" <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Daria watched as Brittany took the large, camouflage-shaded
backpack off and dug through it; like Sandi, Brittany had planned ahead, and
her 'bug-out bag' had a few things more personal than the generic bags Sandi
had packed for the rest of the Legionnaires... "I guess that we could use this..." <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Because you can carry things in it if you need to, and because
you can stuff soft things &ndash; like sweaters or extra clothes - in it and make a
pillow so you can sleep anywhere!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Daria blinked hard, and then shook her head. "No. We can wait.

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Annoyed, Daria turned and marched off towards the riverbank.
"You can look at the fish later, but let's get back to the camp now-"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>A flash of light came from the tree line, and Daria immediately
turned to see what had made it. "What was-EEP!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>A scant second beforehand, Stacy had heard a distinct CLICK!
from behind, rose up and spun about in the direction of the sound so fast that
she was actually facing the sound when the flash went off &ndash; and accidentally
knocked Daria into the cold waters of the river!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Brittany's eyes went wide as Daria's shriek echoed through the
area and raced forward to help, but Stacy reached in and plucked Daria out with
one hand. "Oh, Daria, you're soaking wet!" the wide-eyed blonde bleated,
pulling a large, fluffy towel from her bag as Daria pulled out of Stacy's grip.
"You'll catch a cold or something if you don't get into some dry stuff right
away! Here's a towel, and I've got a spare uniform in here-"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Daria pulled off her soaked coat and tunic, and accepted the
towel from Brittany. "God, that's cold...! Where the hell are my glasses-?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

either of them. "Just a thought."</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Why do I get the feeling that your people

wasn't a fool to think that men only wanted her around in the woods because she
was a hell of a shot. <i>Well, it was a nice bikini &ndash; and it <u>would</u> look

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The photographer and his guide walked along at
a brisk pace. "Now, about that pink bikini..."</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I didn't get it."</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I got it for you. Well, your boss did. She
also got a silver-white one for you &ndash; said that it should go great with your
eyes and hair..."</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>*****</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Several minutes later, Hank and Langston walked
along through a lightly wooded area when they heard the sound of young, female
voices. "Hmn, someone else is wandering around out here," Hank said, checking
the settings on his camera as they approached the faint sounds. "Yeah, there
they are &ndash; oh, my God."</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"What is it?"</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"The sound of my bonus hitting my account.
Legionnaires."</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Who?"</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Those girls &ndash; they're Legionnaires &ndash; THE
Legionnaires," Hank said. "What &ndash; you guys in Alaska don't have a Legion
chapter up here?"</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"That stupid kids' club from the East Coast?"</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I'll be sure to tell them that's what you
think of them," Hank said. "They've been a big news story over the past year &ndash;
this billionaire endowed these kids and set up a youth organization, and
they've been doing service projects... well, all of the other chapters nationwide
have. Chapter #1 &ndash; the Lawndale, Maryland chapter &ndash; the flagship group &ndash; well,
nobody's really sure what they're doing, except building this kick-ass
headquarters and hiring a celebrity psychologist."</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Really?"</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Yeah &ndash; he's like a former Marine pilot, or he's
in the reserves or something, but he's working with them exclusively now. He
used to work with a lot of celebrities when he wasn't off kicking ass &ndash; a month
of so back, he got a medal for saving a lot of British soldiers back during <i>Desert
Storm</i>, and he got knighted by the Queen of England, too."</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"And people actually think this stuff is
important?"</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Hey, if people want to fixate on the 'pretty
people' instead of their own lives, fine with me - as long as I get paid for
the photos."</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"You sound like you know a lot about them."</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Well, since everyone would kill to get
exclusive photos-"</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Which one do you think is the best looking?"</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Well, most of them are kind of hot-"</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Pervert."</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Langston smirked at the way Hank's face went
scarlet. "You fell for that one too easily. Come on &ndash; let's start earning your
money."</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>As the two came through the tree line, Hank
raised his camera and focused in on the attractive girl with long, brown hair
kneeling close to the river's edge. "Hey, that's <i>Stacy Rowe</i>," Hank said,
smiling. "Yeah, she's one of the cuter ones. This is going to be a great shot,"
he said. "Just hold still- <i>whoa</i>..."</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"What?"</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Hank lowered his camera slightly as an
auburn-haired girl with glasses came into sight.</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Who's she?"</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"That's Daria Morgendorffer. She's one of the
original three &ndash; the ones that Russell Stark endowed and started the Legion
with. Oh, ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching..."</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Hank focused in as Daria walked up to the
Stacy; he snapped the shot - and faster than he could have believed, Stacy
whirled around and looked directly at him, accidentally knocking Daria into the
water!</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Oh, hell!" Langston blurted out, stepping
through the trees into plain sight as Hank dropped his first camera to his
chest and started taking shots with his second automatic camera of Stacy
pulling Daria out of the water as a bouncy blonde in camouflage bounded up. She
offered Daria a large towel as she peeled out of her soaking wet coat and blue
tunic down to her sheer white turtleneck beneath, which may have just as well
been invisible for the way it molded over her slender form...</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Hank finished off the roll, dropped the camera
back and then went to his next camera; the flash went off-</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Hank suddenly found himself being held aloft
with one hand by Stacy, and Langston was held up with the other!<span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:#323D4F'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"HEY!" Hank said, more than a bit shocked that a wafer-thin girl
like that could hoist him as if he were a fat-free wafer. "Let me go-!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Langston, however, was a bit quicker on the uptake. "We're with <i>Val</i>
magazine! He is! He's supposed to be up here!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Stacy looked at the two, surprise on her face, and lowered them
to the ground. "So..." Langston said, looking Stacy over before glancing back at
the others, and then back to her. "Your chapter of the Legion is a bit &ndash;
different - than all of the others...right?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Hank said nothing. He was slightly distracted in equal measure
by the insanely high amount of money he was sure that he could get for the
photos he had just taken, the allure of the celebrity life he somehow knew that
he would be entering within the next thirty days, and the smoldering-hot image
of a wet Daria Morgendorffer in what his little voice was telling him would be
the biggest-selling poster of the year.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>*****<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"YOU DID <i>WHAT</i>...?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Trent winced at the sound of Armalin's bellow, which easily
penetrated the doors of the Recreation Center. <i>Oh, man... he's pissed off at
someone.</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"If you're not going to carry yourself like an adult-"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Damnit, Hall &ndash; at least let me know ahead of time if you're
going to do something so incredibly stupid in the name of PR!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Look, you said that you were sending them on survival training
sometime this week-"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"It's an MHAACS scenario, Hall &ndash; which they will probably be
using their powers, and unless you want the entire world to know about what
they can do-"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"I'm sure that they will know not to use their powers around a
photographer, Colonel &ndash; and along those lines, congratulations on the
promotion."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Thank you."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Calmness took hold, and Armalin followed hall into the
Recreation Center. "I just wish that- Oh."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Trent lifted his head up from the huge, lush sectional couch,
set against the walls of the room and almost the entire room in length. "Hey,
guys. I was waiting for you to get back, and, uh... I guess I fell asleep."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Yes... Trent, isn't it?" Dawn walked over to him and shook his hand.
"You may not remember me. I'm Dawn Hall &ndash;"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Yeah. You're the PR chick from Quest that didn't want to move
the Legion to Lawndale. I remember you."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Well, looking over everything that's been done... I supposed that
I could have been... premature in my beliefs about the Legion." Her smile finally
touched her eyes, which, Trent noticed, was actually a very good thing... "So,
Mr. Lane &ndash; how can we help you?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Well, I was coming to talk to the Colonel &ndash; I mean, like, with
the Tower opening up and everything, I was wondering if, like, you guys were
hiring, and what I'd have to do to get a job-"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"You can run to the galley &ndash; the cafeteria &ndash; and get me some of
those rib tips they're serving for lunch," Armalin said. "I also want a salad
with peppercorn ranch dressing and three slices of white bread, and get a liter
bottle of water, and bring it up to my office. We'll figure out what your
official duties are later &ndash; and bring your lunch up, too."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"If you can get a cart, I'd like a little something, too," Dawn
said, giving Trent a meaningful glance. "Steak fries instead of salad, please,
and a saucer of extra sauce on the side. Diet Sprite, if you don't mind."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Ummm... okay."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Okay... that I didn't see coming," Armalin said, looking from a
receding Trent to the woman a full foot shorter than himself. "Isn't he a
touch... young for you?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"What makes you think I've got any interest in him?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"The fact that I may need the Jaws of Life to pull your eyes off
the boy the next time you look at him," Armalin smirked. "Planning on indulging
a previous schoolgirl crush held over from the days of grunge...?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"While you're making light, Colonel, perhaps you could tell me
why you're hiring him, and for what?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"For what &ndash; well, there's a number of unofficial duties and
things that just come up that he could do... driver, errands, and so forth. He
knows them all, and he's not a security risk... and you've just shown another
duty that he fulfills quite well &ndash; he gives the young women something to think
about." Armalin almost laughed. You've got nine young people &ndash; two of them are
male, one's taken and the other, the girls here wouldn't touch with a ten-foot
pole... although, the jealousy factor is going to spike once other women notice
him..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Ruttheimer? I can see that &ndash; he's got a 'Ron Howard from <i>Happy
Days'</i> feel to him; I see that you've gotten him weaned off that
pseudo-Valentino habit he had..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Hey, it's like they always taught us: 'If you have to show off,
you probably can't do it, and one you can, you don't feel the need to show
off.' The boy can fly, and he's getting himself in shape physically and
mentally. He's becoming his own man."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"What's that?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"The Marine Corps offers a lot of things &ndash; but we don't take
just anyone, and there's a reason we have the most difficult entry
requirements. Our door is always open &ndash; but you have to walk through. You have
to want it, even before you get to the door."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
