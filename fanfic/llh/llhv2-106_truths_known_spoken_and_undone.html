<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Mackenzie was the first real 'white hat' among us Legionnaires.
It was the trait that defined him throughout his time in high school &ndash; play it
straight, get good grades, be the best at whatever you do, don't show any
negativity &ndash; be an outstanding example... 'an Ambassador for the Black
community'. That overwhelming pressure lessened with the destruction of
Lawndale High School and Mackenzie's transfer to a school with a larger
minority population &ndash; and returned with a vengeance once he gained his powers
and became a Legionnaire. <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Is it any wonder, then, that the enemies of the Legion often
cited him as the one that they most despised, or that he was the first
Legionnaire to gain an arch-enemy of his own? There was something within
Michael Mackenzie that inflamed the Legion's enemies, as well as those on the
side of Good who weren't as devoted to the cause as they should have been. <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>What was that innate quality? He was a hero. The other
Legionnaires &ndash; including myself - would have to find that quality within. In
Michael, it was always there, and as visible as he himself was when using his
powers.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

color:#323D4F'>"Sir... Miss Barch is here to see you... again."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Angier Sloane sighed; this was the fourth visit this week from
Janet Barch. <i>The woman's a walking time bomb, and if Dynell hadn't
specifically asked me to have the Foundation's Special Projects facility give
her a job...<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Barch was intelligent, without a doubt &ndash; she was actually wasted
teaching high school science classes, he thought &ndash; but that thought was quickly
quashed by memories of many blistering tirades from the woman over the past
year<i>. I'll bet those kids at Lawndale actually thanked God for nuking their
school, because it got them away from her... especially the boys...<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>It took less than two days for a blanket refusal to work with
her to be delivered from the combined men on staff at the Sloane Foundation's
Special Projects Annex, which took up a good third of the Halcyon Hills Corporate
Park. The researchers there were handpicked from around the world, paid
salaries that would make A-list actors gasp, and were afforded luxuries that
rivaled several royal families from across the globe. There was a small
recreation center in the facility; an entire floor dedicated to any pleasure or
comfort needed to keep the men and women who worked there happy, relaxed, and
working hard. Several of the researchers there were big fans of a certain pair
of daytime dramas on the #2 network, and there were several crushes afoot; as a
surprise for Valentine's Day one year, the Foundation managed to lasso a decent
number of actors and actresses from the shows to attend the company V-Day
party. At least four actual relationships developed because of that party &ndash; and
there was a lot of sneaking off to different parts of the facility ('showing
people where they work') that day...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Only the fact that John Dynell himself had made the request for
Barch to be considered for employment caused Angier to allow the Director of
the facility to even interview her &ndash; and only a second call from Dynell,
specifically requesting that she not be fired &ndash; kept him from showing her to
the door when that same Director (the entire male staff crowded into the office
behind him &ndash; and Angier blinked hard in surprise when he saw that the
facilities' cafeteria workers, child care assistants, drivers and the entire
cadre of janitors crowded in as well) and laid a simple demand down: <i>'It's
her or us.'</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>The entire staff got an immediate 5% increase in pay, three
extra personal days and the 'below-the-board' people won a promise that if she
ever attacked any of them, that person (or his family) would receive one
million dollars in compensation &ndash; tax free. (Of course, provoking her was
strictly forbidden, and in a surprising move, Angier didn't have to stress that
point, and no man there was that desperate for money.) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Janet was given her own lab (with full living quarters directly
connecting to her lab, for when she didn't want to go to her own home), an
all-female staff, and was specifically told that if she touched even one
person, regardless of what that person did or said to her, she would be
terminated on the spot. The way the message was delivered &ndash; by a surly female
member of the security staff handpicked for her size and her ability to
intimidate even Barch &ndash; left just enough ambiguity to make her wonder if that
was to mean 'just her employment contract'.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>He was almost certain that he knew what she wanted to talk
about, and shook his head slightly as he sat back for a long, full minute. Too
bad. You designed the rough concept on your own, but you fully realized it and
took it to its current prototype using Sloane Foundation resources and funding.
That makes the devices &ndash; and the patent &ndash; the property of the Sloane
Foundation...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

you to actually use your talents and intellect as you've always wanted, I'm the
only person who's actually wanted to have you work in my company. I've bent
over backwards to have you here, especially considering what happened your
first week in the company, but I'll just say it straight out: You are not going
to get your way and everything you want &ndash; and it has NOTHING with you being a
woman or my being a man."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"It's MY design! It's MY power cell!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"No. <u>You</u> came up with a rough design, but after eleven
months, seventy million dollars and the combined efforts of a number of
world-renowned scientists working in concert with you, <i><u>the Sloane
Foundation Special Projects Division</u></i> came up with the NetCell. You've
been more than adequately compensated for your initial designs, your salary for
this past year has been AT LEAST twenty-five times the amount you made in your
entire career as a high school science teacher, and if you believe that this
company is going to just sit back and hand over billions of dollars in
potential earnings just because you're a loudmouthed, flame-tempered woman who
believes that every man is out to hold her down, back or in some for of
restraint that you don't happen to find pleasurable... your belief system needs
to be seriously revaluated."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Janet stood before Angier's desk, her mouth opening and closing,
but nothing coming out. 'This meeting is <u>over</u>, Miss Barch. Please return
to your duties."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"I WON'T LET YOU GETAWAY WITH THIS!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Enough is enough, </span></i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:#323D4F'>Angier decided, sitting back at his desk. <i>I've paid
this woman more than enough money &ndash;and it'll be worth paying off her employment
contract just to get rid of the screaming harpy.</i> "That will be quite
enough, Miss Barch. I've put up with your attitude and your actions for far too
long. If you want to continue working here, you will begin to carry yourself in
a different manner."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"But-"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

color:#323D4F'>"If you are no longer interested in being employed here, please
submit your resignation at your leisure. I can assure you that we will pay off
your employment contract and all other financial outlay immediately &ndash; and of
course, you are aware that your nondisclosure agreements are still binding.
Good day."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Janet looked at him, aghast at being dismissed so callously, and
spun about to leave Angier's office. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>*****<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>The small group of women talked and enjoyed their lunch in the
comfortable lounge designated as a 'Women Only' lunch area by the directives
Angier had laid down a year ago &ndash; what the staff referred to as the 'Barch Act'
&ndash; when Janet rushed past the glass walls towards her lab, fury all but pouring
off her as she slammed the doors shut behind her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Now that's one woman who needs to run down to somewhere like
Vegas or New Orleans, get a hotel room and some young college boy who wants to
stick it into anything female and moving, and get screwed really hard for a
week or two."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Everyone turned to face the female cafeteria worker &ndash; one Tamara
Rose, a part-time worker whose job duties circled around bringing the lunch
menu for the day to the women's lunch area, serving the female scientists... and
generally being the connection to reality for a lot of the women, who, to a
person, had spent their entire academic careers in libraries, labs and classrooms
with very little time out for romance or even dating. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Tamara (who was more than staff or even a co-worker, but a
friend to the group of scientists), sat back on the couch next to a plain young
woman with brown, bushy hair and a taste for scarlet and gold in her outfits,
and took a drink of the especially strong tea that the ladies had all come to
enjoy with their lunches. "Okay &ndash; maybe she should find some hot little co-ed
who wants to 'experiment' one time when she's supposed to be young and crazy, before
some guy comes along to 'make an honest woman of her."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"I don't know," the bushy-haired young woman said in a proper
English accent, "seems that she's too insane for any woman who wants to go for
a test drive down that lane &ndash; unless they're already into the 'kill all men'
department."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"But she's got a man!" a reed &ndash;thin woman with a rich, almost
charcoal hue to her skin spoke, her tone the neat-stereotypical Colonial
British accent most Americans associated with men and women from the African
continent. "Well &ndash; he has the correct genetalia, he does, but as for the rest..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"No, she's found a lesbian born into a man's body &ndash; the perfect
mate for her," laughed a thirty-something Korean woman as she sat next to a
tray of donut holes; the smallest woman in the room at four-foot-ten, she was
as stunning and brilliant as she was petite. "It's the only reason she allows
someone with a Y chromosome into her house, let alone her bed."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Look, all of you women are messed up &ndash; that's why you're all
big-time scientists instead of &ndash; well, whatever else you could have been!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Tamara ducked the barrage of good-natured jeers. "You all watch
'House'; you all know what I'm talking about," she continued. "But at least all
of you know that there's more use for a man than as a test subject for
'Ball-Cutter Barch' and the latest Castrator Machine from her Evil Lair of
Weird Science..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>All of the women shared a good laugh at that, and none of them
noticed the way that Janet watched them from the slightly opened doorway...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Ooooh, yeah..." a curvy Black woman with thick, gold-brown hair
thought aloud as she sat forward in her chair. "What about that Dr. Armalin,
who's working with those Legion kids? I heard that he's available, right?" <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Tamara fielded that one. "When I took some sandwiches up to the
Director's office last week, I heard him and Mr. Sloane talking about some big
formal thing they're planning for Christmas for the Legion &ndash; ever since his son
joined, he's been really big on getting in good with them, and you know that
the Doctor will be so in...!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"If you're lucky," the Korean scientist laughed. "He's been so
busy with the kindergarten class that he hasn't been talking to anyone around
town."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"How do you know?" asked the bush-haired Brit. "Checking him
out?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Well, he does jog several miles every morning, rain or shine,"
was the reply, "and he just happens to jog past the place where I pick up my
coffee every morning..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Is THAT why you drive all the way over to the other side of
town every morning &ndash; just to watch some guy jog past?" a Nordic blonde
mock-growled, turning to face her with ice-blue eyes peering through glasses
with extremely thick lenses. "I thought you were just crazy about that coffee,
but <i>now</i>...!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"O.S.C.' <u>has</u> the best coffee in town," she retorted,
holding her ever-present 'O.S.C.' mug up. "It just so happens that he jogs past
there every day between 7:45 and 8:05, unless he's got some major business at
Legion Tower - and then... he jogs past between 6:00 and 6:20."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>As the women planned out a schedule of who would go out on
coffee runs for the next month, Janet closed the door to her lab...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

color:#323D4F'>"I see. Well, just give him every courtesy &ndash; let him ask
questions and take photos, and tell Morgendorffer to not say or do anything to
tick the guy off; he'll be gone in a day, and then you guys can finish up."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>The sound of Sandi giggling gave him pause. "Did I say something
funny?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Earlier, I think the guy caused Daria to get knocked into the
water &ndash; they were coming out of the woods and taking pictures when Stacy heard
them, and when she sun around, Daria took a quick bath. The guy got pictures of
her going in, and I think-"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Tell her that if she even &ndash; no. Tell her that I'd like to speak
to her. Now."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Smirking, Sandi called out for Daria, who looked up from her
dinner and walked away from the large campfire.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Hank caught the lingering glance that Tom gave her, even as he
was snuggled close to Jane, but said nothing. "You know your way around a
campfire grill, Charles," he said, taking another bite of fish. "You've been
doing this for a while with your father, right?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Charles stood next to a large camp grill, and nodded slightly as
he gently turned a fish before taking the lid off the large pot of boiling
water and ears of corn. "Since I was a kid &ndash; my father wanted me to have
memories of doing things with him. His job takes him all over the world<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>- I don't get to see him as much as I'd like
&ndash; but when he's here, we get to do things. Oh, and before you ask &ndash; he calls...
well, he <u>called</u> our principal about how I was doing every week. He'd
call around to my teachers at random; that was fun. I couldn't get away with
anything in school."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"One thing that I don't understand &ndash; I thought this was survival
training for you guys. Not that I'm not loving the spread you set out... but is
this what you call 'roughing it?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"See her &ndash; Sandi?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Hank looked over to see Sandi, laughing as she sat with Langston
and Brittany as the two blondes compared hair shades and their 'blondes have
more fun' stories. "She's got a knack for planning stuff &ndash; I think she had an
idea that the Colonel was going to send us somewhere like this, and she had a
LOT of stuff ordered and set up so that, no matter where we were going, we'd
have the necessary equipment to operate effectively. She must have known that
people get agitated and don't work well if they're hungry, cold and miserable &ndash;
and yes, someone could say that we're cheating..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"What do you say?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Charles laughed, and then did a passable Clint Eastwood
impression: <i>"Sandi didn't cheat. She improvised, she adapted - she
overcame."</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>He laughed as he remembered the look on the Colonel's face in
the conference room as Sandi pulled sheets of paper from a folder she had and
passed them out. Twenty minutes later, after several members of the Legion
support staff had loaded four large crates onto the transport out to the
exercise area (where the Gridrunner was to land and pick them up), the Colonel
had gone up to Sandi and Quinn; the look on his face clear that he was going to
protest. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Sandi dispelled that with a wave of her hand.</span></i><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:#323D4F'> <i>"You said to get whatever
equipment we needed, and you told us where we were going. See the numbers on
those crates? They're all marked with a '2', because I had some of the other
Legionnaires help me figure out where we might need to go and what we'd need to
get work done there &ndash; and this is the stuff we need for working in a Type 2
biome."</i> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Remembering that he was actually impressed that Sandi had known
what a 'biome' was &ndash; and even more so that (even though she still acted like
she'd die if she came in physical contact with him) she came to him for help in
putting together lists for the things that they'd need if they were to go into
any of the fourteen biomes &ndash; types of climate &ndash; across the planet, and set up a
short-term base of operations. <i>Thank God the Colonel didn't send us up to
Point Barrow... not looking forward to breaking out the Type 1 equipment or how
it would feel up there before we got it set up...<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>The Colonel looked, for a moment, as if he were to say
something; he gave Sandi a look of slight respect and said, "I gave you a
mission, and you've an idea of what your people need to get it done. Carry on,
Griffin."<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Sandi had a plan. The Colonel said that this is a survival
exercise, and Sandi figured that the best chance of survival is to first set up
a base camp and take care of the immediate needs that the people have. Once
that's taken care of, then you can start thinking about how to get out of the
place you're in, because you'll have some measure of safety and a means to keep
your people warm and fed.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Sounds like you've learned something, too."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Oh, that's old news for me &ndash; I did my fair share of gaming
before I got into the Legion, so I had an idea of the stuff you'd want... and I
also know from camping with Dad that 'roughing it' &ndash; eating berries, using
leaves, is unnecessary. If you can do it, yes &ndash; but why do it if you don't have
to?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Some people would say that, with the money of the Quest

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"GOOD. The Colonel would say probably say that's the best kind
to have."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Hank turned at the sound of Sandi's voice, and saw everyone else
turned towards him as they listened in on his and Charles' conversation.
"People should be sportsman-like at the Olympics &ndash; everywhere else, as long as
you don't break the law, anything goes." <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Despite the way he talked to the Legionnaires, Hank had done his
homework on them before coming up on the off chance he would run into them and
get to talk &ndash; and as he looked at Sandi, he remembered what every source he'd
come across had said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Special training, she went with Armalin to Washington when he
got his Navy Cross and she was allowed to be there at the ceremony when he was
knighted... yeah, they've been calling Sandi Griffin his 'Padawan-learner' &ndash; and
it sounds like it. <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Hank nodded. "Let me ask you kids something &ndash; and if you don't
want to tale about it, I'll understand &ndash; especially you, Miss Taylor &ndash;
Brittany. It's been six months since Lawndale High was destroyed... I won't ask
how you feel about that."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Thank you," Jane said, her face suddenly sullen. "I got SO
tired of reporters always sticking microphones in my face and asking 'you
nearly got blown up with all of your friends, all of the people you've grown up
with and, oh, yeah &ndash; all of the memories of what are supposed to be the best
times of your lives are now bits and tiny pieces of ash floating all around the
world and if someone hadn't been making out in a closet &ndash; not only would you be
dead, but there wouldn't be anything left of you to have a funeral, so do you
think your family members would come to the memorial service, because we've
done a background check on you and it seems that since you began high school,
your parents have only been in the United States to visit you only twice &ndash; so,
how do you feel about that?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Langston noticed how all of the other Legionnaires sat silently
as Jane spoke, and Daria, who came up from behind Jane, put her hand on her
friend's shoulder as she sat down besides her. "I still remember that jerk
reporter from the <i>National</i> <i>Inquisitor</i> who asked me that."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"The one that I remember was when that guy asked me if Mr. Stark
was-" Hank turned to where Quinn and Stacy sat, and the look on her face made
him think dark and evil thoughts about the staff of the <i>Inquisitor.</i>
"They were making up stuff about Mr. Stark, and me and my sister, and Jane &ndash;
They were trying to say that he was some sort of pervert!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"I know that the people in the media have a job to do &ndash; and I
understand that, because of who Mr. Stark is and everything the Legion is
supposed to stand for... and because of who some of us are... the news can get a
bit sensational," Tom said. "The problem is that the media's focusing upon only
the sensational, and not the good things that the Legion is doing. There's been
coverage &ndash; but not enough - of the <i>1.3 million dollars</i> that Legion
chapters across the nation have collected so far for Hurricane Katrina relief
efforts in the Gulf region, or how individual Chapters have been doing some
fascinating things in their own areas. Like the Bronx chapter of the Legion,
and how they've been supporting a homeless shelter by getting donations,
corporate assistance and just getting the word out &ndash; in the past six months,
the work they've done has allowed the shelter to quadruple the number of people
that they've been able to help. There's the Colorado Springs chapter, which has
a cable-access program called <i>All Things Legion</i>, where they cover things
that the other chapters are involved in. I heard that <i>The Youth Channel</i>
is probably going to pick them up for syndication sometime next year."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Everyone stood or sat silently, slightly stunned, as Tom
continued. "About fifty colleges from around the country with Legion chapters
of their own joined together to send a large group of volunteers to New Orleans
to help in any way they could. The Quest Foundation donated a couple of million
dollars for relief efforts and to pay their expenses, and about a thousand
Legionnaires spent three weeks helping out in any way they could. Granted, the
people in trouble down there were the real story, but it would have been nice
if they had gotten credit from the national media."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Yeah, it would have been."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Attention switched over to Quinn, and Daria's eyes narrowed. "I
know that tone," she said, staring at her sister. "What did you do... no, you
didn't. How did you &ndash; Why didn't you tell any of us &ndash; How did you get away with
it?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Quinn turned cool eyes upon her sister. "What one of the
Founding Members SHOULD have done &ndash; been where people could see us doing what
Mr. Stark wanted. Yes, I did. I went with the college chapters &ndash; the Middleton
chapter, actually. Because the rest of you needed a vacation &ndash;" She looked
Daria directly in the eye. "-But I needed to do something. I told the Legion
Leader-" Jane winced openly as Daria's glare fell upon her, then swung back
upon Quinn like a targeting laser. "-And Colonel Armalin after I got back. I
didn't &ndash; he yelled at me for half an hour. Gawd &ndash; now I know how the boys felt
when Miss Barch was in a mood."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Langston and Hank's eyes met; they both felt suddenly very
uncomfortable, as if they were at a family Thanksgiving dinner when a really
big fight had just begun. Both sat silently, and glanced around the group of
silent young people...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Daria shifted her gaze back to Jane and Tom. "That means you
both knew where she went." Her eyes found the other members of the Fashion
Club. "All of you knew, too."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Her eyes flickered across both Charles and Brittany, who were
looking at Quinn with undisguised admiration. "I guess you two didn't." Her
eyes came to rest upon her sister once more. "Why didn't you tell me, though? I
would have gone-"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Daria &ndash; you think too much, and you always go straight to the
worst case scenario. The people down there needed people to help them and bring
their spirits up they needed people who were there to say 'We're here to help
you get back on your feet &ndash; because we know that you'll be able to make it
after that. If you'd seen the things that I saw... you couldn't have done that."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Yes, I do. I know that because I'm strong enough to see it and
get past it &ndash; but just because you're not doesn't mean that I'm not, either,
and HOW DARE YOU &ndash;"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>The redhead turned to see Sandi looking directly at Hank; he
gulped audibly as the eyes of the entire Legion were upon him. "When bad things
happen to me, no matter how bad, I can at least try to get past them on my
own," Quinn continued, nevertheless catching Sandi's reminder that outsiders
were around. "I don't need you to nursemaid me, or decide that you need to
'take care of my problems for me', or that I need you to get into my head and
fix things around for me!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Daria went white as a sheet as her sister locked an angry pair
of eyes on her, and Sandi dropped down on one knee besides Quinn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Damnit, Quinn-"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

color:#323D4F'>"It's an expression &ndash; and she's been doing it all of my life,
because next to her, I'm Quinn the Dummy &ndash; Quinn Know-Nothing, Quinn with the
little label behind her ear that reads 'inflate to 50 p.s.i.'!" Quinn all but
screeched. "Just because you got a 36 on the P-CAT doesn't you know everything,
or everything about <u>me</u>! I met a guy down in New Orleans who's better at
getting into people's heads that you'll EVER be, and he said that I'll be just
fine, no matter what happens, as long as I believe that I can be and I just
face it head-on! I don't need anybody to fix me up the way they think I should
be! My name's Quinn, not Heather! I already have a mommy, so I don't need <i>two</i>!

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Daria stood up without a word, and Jane began to rise and
follow. "No," Daria said, her voice suddenly hollow. "I need to be by myself
for a moment." <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>She started off. "Stacy."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>The Legionnaires were all startled by the tone of Sandi's voice;
she spoke in that command voice Armalin used when he expected to be obeyed
instantly and without question. "Go with her. Take your bear spray. Don't let
her wander far or into the woods."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Langston gave Hank a 'well, check that out!' glance as Stacy
darted off, and Charles, surprisingly, hadn't let any of the food burn during
the entire conversation. "Okay," Hank said, looking up at the delicious fish
Charles had ready for someone's plate; he had managed to finish his large fish
during the argument while not missing a word of what was said (a skill honed
from many years of attending celebrity and high-society functions - one could
go hungry by simply paying attention to the goings-on and not stopping to
finish one's plate). "That one looks good &ndash; may I?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Everyone looked back at him, and he smiled that annoyingly
wonderful smile at them while accepting the fish and a second ear of corn. "Of
course, I have to file all of that in the 'off the record' file," he continued.
"Don't worry &ndash; I've never been a fan of the <i>Inquisitor's</i> style of
journalism, either. People have the right to the expectation of privacy to some
personal matters, no matter how much of a celebrity you are."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>The tension through the small group began to disperse. "It
sounds like you've been keeping up on Legion comings-and-goings, Mr. &ndash; Tom. And
you, Quinn &ndash; you were actually helping evacuees in New Orleans. That's got to
be quite a story. How did you get involved with the effort?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Well, it's actually because of Up- <i>Charles</i>," Quinn said,
standing up and getting in line behind Langston, who was getting her dinner
from Charles - and giving him a smile that made all of the female Legionnaires
seriously wonder what her actual IQ was. "I remember him reading the report off
the Internet about how bad the hurricane was going to be, so I went online to do
some checking, and I came across the Middleton Legion Chapter's MySpace page; I
read about the effort, and I decided that I needed to go &ndash; but that I needed to
do it as just another Legion member, and not as one of the Founding Three,
because that would be too much publicity. I used my mother's maiden name &ndash; the
Leader of the Middleton chapter knew who I was &ndash; but as far as everyone else
was concerned, I was 'Quinn Barksdale." <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"What's the one thing that sticks out in your mind about being
down there?" Hank asked; Brittany nodded, as if she were about to ask the same
question herself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"There's a couple of things," she said, helping herself to some
of the crispy fried potatoes Charles had cooked in a large, heavy skillet, and
then getting a bottle of water. "The first thing is the way the city looked in
several parts. There were a couple of times I had to let someone in charge know
who I was to get things done for people; one of those times led to me going on
a helicopter with the Governor of Louisiana over the city. We came in really
low at one point... it - it looked like something out of a movie. Like someone
had dropped a huge bomb on the city, and then poured water and things in just
out of spite."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>She sat back down and everyone's attention was on her; she had
never talked about what she had seen, even with the people who knew that she'd
gone in. "Something else that sticks out was the people. They were happy and
more than grateful for everything that we were doing and getting for them &ndash; for
all of the stuff that everyone was doing for them &ndash; but the one thing that
everyone I worked with kept getting asked was, <i>'When is the government
coming in? When will the government help us?"</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Quinn stopped for a moment; she looked down at her plate, and
for a moment, the others thought that she would set it aside. Instead, she took
a big bite of potatoes, chewed slowly, and washed it down with half the bottle
of water before she continued. "I also went to the Superdome."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

took in the sight of Timothy O'Neil at the front door of Janet Barch's home,
dressed in his traditional attire of a pink button-down shirt and dark-blue
slacks... now joined by a frilly pink-and-white apron that read 'Real Men CAN
cook' across the front. "Uh... I must have made a mistake &ndash; I'm working as a bike

remembering that each delivery he made was an instant two hundred and fifteen
dollars (plus serious tips that he got each time, and never less than fifty
bucks), Mack stood his ground on the front porch, and looked inside the doorway
to see a home so clean and perfectly kept that it should &ndash; could &ndash; be in a
magazine. "Oh, come in, come in!" Timothy gushed, walking past to see Mack
peering inside. "Janet just LOVED how neat and clean I keep the house &ndash; well,
she wants it kept a certain way, and I'd love to add some of my own personal
touches, but she says that there's a look that she wants so my things would

had learned to do, watching as he went to a closet and brought out a package
the size of a box of cake mix. "There we are!" he said triumphantly, closing

Carter County High School now, is that right?" <o:p></o:p></span></p>

sell for more than I can imagine... and I can imagine a lot. That, and probably
writing a story about you guys, which I can all but name my price for... the

a generous amount into a cup for Charles, and then Tom. "Her photo staff is
almost entirely freelancers &ndash; college kids in their last years, or grad
students earning extra money... I freelance for her and four or five other rags,
but when something really big comes in &ndash; or she thinks it'll come on, she'll
pay out mad money on the off chance it'll pay off. Your Legion's PR people
called the main office to tell them you guys were coming up some time this
week, and I've been up here bouncing around for three days waiting for you guys
to show &ndash; if you ever did. Try riding coach on the cheapest series of flights

reasonable offer &ndash; I can shop them anywhere I like. To great shots of cute

while Charles took a good swallow of the strong, fragrant liquor. "Don't try to
prove your manhood, Chuck &ndash; just enjoy it," Hank said, taking another drink as
he watched the look on Charles' face. "Speaking of which &ndash; I like the 'totally
indifferent' thing you've got going whenever Langston looks at you. That's one
of the better ones to get a woman's attention."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

things have reversed for him. A year or so back, he was trying to chase after
anything in a skirt, and they didn't even notice him. You notice most of the

replied. Now, he's been hitting the track and the free weights, getting some
proper supervision and training, getting into some stuff that he likes doing &ndash;
he's got his pilot's license and does solo flights... and he used to do this
thing where he tried to talk to girls..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Charles turned scarlet, and drank so he wouldn't have to talk.
"His 'Casanova routine'. Jane &ndash; that's my girl &ndash; told me about it. Thing is, he

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Don't..." Charles spoke; one of Hank's eyebrows rose in surprise
at the plain, unemotional manner in which the word came out. He knew when <i>in
vino veritas</i> was the rule of the hour; this, however, was someone who just
had something they wanted to say, and finally had a platform from which to
speak. "That's what people say when they're looking down their noses at you
because they think that you can't find someone and they're trying to be
positive, but what they're doing is just throwing it back up in your face. It's
the nice way of saying 'lower your expectations of who you want to be a part of
your life, because you can't seriously expect to get normal, or average, or
decent- or even good-looking' - depending on their own yardstick. It's what
they tell you when they're too nice to say 'beggars can be choosers."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"No - but they do. The thing is... they forget there's another
choice. I can choose not to play the game at all. I can be alone."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>There was something in the way Charles spoke &ndash; and the way that
Tom reacted slightly &ndash; that reminded Hank of the film version of the old TV
Western <i>Maverick</i>; it was the scene of the first poker match that Mel
Gibson was in, where the young tough who was a gunfighter jumped from the
table, hand going for his pistol, and Gibson tried to calm him down by pointing
out how he was only a gambler, while the kid was a gunfighter, a good one, from
reputation, and if they were to have a gunfight, what chance would he have?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Everyone around the table winced when, as if by magic,
Maverick's six-gun was in his hand, the hammer back and pointed directly at the
tough's heart; the stammering, semi-cowardly man was gone, instantly replaced
by a harbinger of Death with light-green ice for eyes and no emotion whatsoever
as he spoke the answer to his own question... a question, however, which everyone
in the room knew the true answer to immediately.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

color:#323D4F'>Maverick sat down, joking and goofing about afterwards, but the
lesson was learned; they gave the man his respect from that point on. Hank saw
the way Tom nodded almost without moving his head as he drank to cover it, and
he saw the slight change in Tom's eyes...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Perhaps for the first time, Hank thought, Tom saw Charles as an
equal... no &ndash; a rival. Someone who was in the game &ndash; but with a different style
of play... someone who could compete by giving the ladies a clear choice, one
that he'd picked for himself rather than one placed upon him by what life and
Lady Luck had given him...<i>Someone who decided that he's not going to play the
game anymore &ndash; and by doing that, has probably made himself a bigger player in
the game than he's ever imagined. Tom just realized exactly what that means. He
probably thought he did before, but now &ndash; young Mister Sloane just realized
that Charles doesn't care about any women that would want Thomas... and that he
probably has no chance whatsoever with any woman who would want Charles &ndash; because
there's nothing that a person wants more than what they can't have.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Oh, yeah. This should be interesting to watch. From a distance.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>After an uncomfortable silence &ndash; for Tom, anyway, Hank noted &ndash;
Tom coughed and spoke up. "Anyway, a few weeks ago, my sister and several of
her friends came out to the Tower &ndash; Legion Tower, that's our building back in
Lawndale. Turns out that they didn't want to bother much with talking to me..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>" I remember that," Charles said. "These girls just kept
following me around, giggling and squealing. I finally just hid in my room
until they left; I get enough of the 'let's make fun of Upchuck' thing from the
girls I know without taking it from all of the new ones around, too."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Hank's eyes were wide as he digested Charles' words, and Tom
smiled a small, sad smile. "See? You friend all but says 'You sure look like a
Master to me...'- but he doesn't get it. This is what happens when you hit a
puppy too many times &ndash; it grows up to be a big dog, but it runs from even the
ants."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Charles looked back and forth between the two of them, his face
blank. "He's going to have some girl teach him the lesson," Hank said, his tone
not entirely without sourness as he realized Charles didn't even realize
Langston's flirtations for what they were &ndash; and that, even if he did, he's just
mark it down as another pretty girl trying to play a cruel joke on him. "You
know &ndash; not all girls think the way the ones you grew up with do-"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Yes, they do," Charles said, drinking again. "The girls all
want the BBD &ndash; 'the bigger, better deal.' They want the whole package &ndash; looks,
money, somebody that they can show off to their friends and have their friends
be all happy that they landed a guy like that... they want somebody who looks
like <i>him</i>."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Tom stopped in mid-sip as Charles jerked a thumb in his
direction. "He's the money. He's got the looks, the background and the whole
package &ndash; and man, have you seen the way that Daria looks at her friend Jane
when she sees them together? If a guy like Tom can make a girl like Daria Morgendorffer
jealous of her best friend &ndash; and man, those two really are BFF &ndash; man, what
chance does an average guy like me have with the ladies? When they're dreaming
about a guy to sweep them off their feet, there's no way that they're thinking
of somebody like me. They're thinking about guys like <i><u>him</u></i>."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Charles turned to Tom. "I'm not jealous of you. It's just that,
you know, being in the Legion's shown me something. I needed to make a change,
before I got a chance to make too much of a fool of myself &ndash; so I'm making that
change. I'm getting myself in shape; I'm learning new skills... I'll do a couple
of more years in the Legion, and then, who knows? I always wondered about what
it would be like to fly an F-15, or one of the new F-22 Raptors...now, that's
gotta be cool..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>He finished the last of his rum. "I'm not doing the stuff in the
Legion to try and get girls. I figure that maybe someday, I might meet somebody
&ndash; I might, it could happen... but hey, whatever. I don't need to have someone in
my life to do this. I'm doing this for me."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Tom just sat between Charles and Hank, a confused expression his
face. "Daria is jealous of Jane because we're <i>dating</i>...?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Most of the girls in the English-speaking world are jealous of
Jane because you two are dating," Charles observed, holding his cup out with an
amused, unforced levity that made Hank think that Charles just might be sincere
with everything he'd said. "Yeah. Sucks to be you."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Grass is always greener, boys," Hank wryly observed; he had
excellent vision, and noticed how a small head with blonde hair would turn and
look off in their general direction with a regularity that made any lingering
thoughts of hitting it off with Langston Chambers walk sullenly towards the
'EXIT' sign in his mind... "Always greener..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in a doorway on the side of the Reception Area and held the door open with her

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Oh... just thinking aloud, ma'am," Mack said quickly, putting a
counter full of electronic equipment between himself and his former science
teacher. "Looks like a movie in here..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Janet ignored the comment as she went to the door of her office,
connected directly to the lab, and pulled her chair out as Mack came to the
door. "So, how did you become a messenger? I thought you were playing football
for your new school &ndash; I've seen the articles on you in the paper."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"I still play &ndash; this is just a part-time job, so I can pay for
school expenses and save money for college," Mack said, side-stepping her
comments on football and the number of scholarship offers that he and his
family were already considering. If there was anyone who hated the idea of 'men
getting ahead because they were muscular brutes', it was his former Science
teacher... "Two or three times a week... nothing much, I still have to keep up my
GPA..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Janet's expression didn't even change as she fished four crisp,
new $100 dollar bills from her 'petty cash' envelope, and drew a pen from the
drawer as she put the envelope back into the desk. "I need you to sign this,"
she told him, holding out a clipboard with a sign-in sheet attached. "Make sure
you mark down the date and time... yes... and here's your money."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>She looked up at Michael Mackenzie, and Janet Barch's hold on

bit shocked that she'd given him a tip of over a hundred dollars. "Thank you,
Miss Barch..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Mack turned to leave when blue-white agony punched through the
small of his back and exploded out of his mouth; his knees unlocked, and his
bladder and bowels immediately voided as he dropped to the floor, his limbs
twitching with feeble spasms as he thankfully slipped into unconsciousness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>The young man twitched again as Janet calmly placed the taser
weapon she'd modified back into the top drawer of her desk and then stood, her
outer features surprisingly calm in relation to the burning fury that seemed to
build with each step closer that she took to Mack... <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Worthless, freeloading, do-nothing man," she spoke, only a
slight edge to her voice as a release to the emotions roiling within her. "I'll
show <i>you</i>... and I'll show <i>him</i>... and I'll show you all..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Ignoring the scent that had begun to rise to her nostrils, Janet
dragged Mack out of the room with surprising strength, and began to move him
towards the far end of her laboratory. "I'll show you all..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>She wasn't exactly fond of Mack Mackenzie &ndash; not that there was
anything wrong with the boy; it was just that she saw her own marriage (at
least over the past couple of years, or since Jodie had begun high school) as
parallel to her daughter's relationship with him, but in reverse. She loved
Andrew, and she would kill to protect her baby son Evan &ndash; but she hated to
admit that she resented giving up her career track just to have a child and to
raise him... as though she were just an average wife. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Along those same lines &ndash; she wasn't exactly sure that she
approved of Jodie dating the boy just because he was the most eligible of the
horribly small pool of eligible African-American young men in Lawndale, and
even then, spending only cursory amounts of time with him. She wondered if they
were sexually active, but doubted they were; from what she had gathered, Mack
was the type who wanted to have a real relationship, but like Jodie, was simply
with Jodie because it was just easier on everyone involved than to get involved
with someone else of another race. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>She was also &ndash; at the moment &ndash; more than a bit annoyed at her
husband. Apparently, he'd had a conversation a few months ago with some of the
local movers and shakers, who'd floated the idea that he'd make an excellent
candidate for Mayor. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

the people',</span></i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:#323D4F'>
she huffed in her mind. Ever since Andrew had told her about the unofficial
feelers that he'd been putting out about the possibility of a Black candidate
as Mayor of Lawndale, she'd unconsciously been feeling more than a bit
resentful that she'd allowed herself to be bullied into giving up her job at
V.P. of Operations position at U.S. World to have her son, and then again when
she wanted to try to return, only to have Andrew tell her that he didn't want
to see his son in daycare... <i>And now, he's thinking about becoming Mayor,
while I get to sit at his side with Evan in my arms, a perfect matching
ornamentation for his campaign posters and TV spots...<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Michelle had long thought about her own qualifications for a
political career, never even mentioning it to Andrew, even in the days when
they were just dating; she was a slightly conservative Democrat, with views
that would stand her in good stead with the majority of Democrats but make her
appealing to Republicans as well. For example, she was a steadfast Second
Amendment supporter, but believed that a seven-day waiting period and
background check to purchase weapons was a compromise that everyone could
accept. She also found the idea of abortion (particularly as an 'alternate form
of birth control') to be personally distasteful, yet firmly stood by the notion
that Roe vs. Wade was The Law of the Land, and had to be adhered to as such
until it was changed in the rightful manner &ndash; through the courts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>She was (well, had) a rep for being able to work back-alley
deals and boardroom compromises with people from all walks of life and
commerce, as well as build coalitions in order to assure that everyone that
associated with her would benefit from that association. You may not get
everything you want dealing with her, the general wisdom went, but you
certainly won't leave empty-handed, knowing that you got something worthwhile. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Of course, being a woman &ndash; a Black woman &ndash; was also a major
point in her advantage over her husband, not to mention that she had a talent
for seeing the overall picture, while Andrew was somewhat goal-oriented.
Imagine &ndash; <i>'I want to integrate the Country Club!</i> &ndash; And he said it as
though he felt that was actually important!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>That's your grand plan &ndash; your Prize at the end of the race?
Being able to go to the Country Club? That's not going to make them accept you
if they didn't want to as a person or as a friend in the first place &ndash; and you
DO know that they don't, because if they did, you'd have been a member long
ago! Right? RIGHT? <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>I love you, Andrew, but you &ndash; both of us &ndash; have got to get past
this attitude of allowing our race to define us; not to others, but to
ourselves and the way we do things. I remember how overly sensitive I was to
Helen Morgendorffer when we were at Grove Hills with our daughters... and I'm
embarrassed when I think about how I acted. She was trying to reach out, and I
threw it back in her face. That was stupid. <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Michelle remembered reading up on Helen, on how she was once a
college-aged activist who had actually gotten into law as a way of trying to
change 'The System'... but had instead been caught up in it, only to slam up
against the 'glass ceiling' at her law firm. <i>They're never going to give her
a partnership there; it would take away any power they have over her, and the
bastards know it &ndash; she's easily one of the best sources of money that they have
with the clients that she brings in... and if she can bring in even a touch of
money from the Quest Corporation, or the Legion...well, they'll just give her a
profit-sharing package, a nice bump in salary and buy her a new car, but not
her name on the letterhead. Not even if she was sleeping with one of them &ndash; and
I've seen the way that rat-bastard Schrecter looks at her a few times. He's the
type to actually dangle the partnership over her head for a weekend of bouncing
around in a hammock in Aruba &ndash; and then screw her over again when they got
back. <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>I need to think about repairing some fences, and build a
coalition of my own. I need a power base &ndash; and from there, start slowly

color:#323D4F'>Michelle ran a finger across the top of her copy of <i>Global
Finance</i> magazine and looked up as Jodie walked into the living room from
the kitchen, looking very nice in her new outfit of black and gold. <i>She's
