"She's attractive &ndash; but she needs to get some new clothes, but her complexion
is excellent, she doesn't need any work except to highlight some things and her
eyelashes are PERFECT &ndash; how could someone like that like... Upchuck...? It's just

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>In the second large tent, soft sounds of sleep filled the air;
only Daria was still awake, and she turned and tossed in her sleeping bag. She
glanced over to Jane's empty bag; she was standing watch, along with Charles &ndash;
and Daria almost laughed aloud at the look on Jane's face when she saw how
Langston smiled at the boy before she disappeared into the tent...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Upchuck &ndash; <i>hot</i>?" She thought aloud, her voice low. "<i>Not
possible...</i>"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>She lifted her head and looked across the tent at where Langston
was sleeping soundly. "I wonder..." she said, and lay back down. "I wonder..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Daria closed her eyes and concentrated on trying to read the
blonde girl's thoughts; suddenly, it was as if Daria was swept out of her body
in a cocoon of the most crystal-blue water she'd ever seen! She began to move
through a thick, glistening channel of that same blue water with her cocoon
protecting her, allowing her to move with ease as if she were actually flying
rather swimming, her every thought turned to action and movement as she swirled
and spun down the channel...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>It was the most natural sensation that she'd ever experienced in
her life; more natural than breathing, or the feeling of her heart beating
within her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>In an instant, Daria found herself standing at the edge of the
most beautiful forestland she'd ever seen, with a long, wide runway aside the land
and several buildings on the other end. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><b><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>&gt;&gt;Where the hell am I?&lt;&lt;<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Daria turned as she saw an airplane &ndash; a factory-new, gleaming
and perfect P-51 Mustang with the insignia of the American Army Air Force &ndash;
coming in for a landing. <b>&gt;&gt;She doesn't look like the type to be into
World War II airplanes &ndash; but then, I don't know anything about her...&lt;&lt;</b><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>She turned to watch the Mustang land, and sat a woman with
blonde hair that could only be Langston emerge from one of the buildings. <b>&gt;&gt;I
need to get down there and see what's-&lt;&lt;<o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>In the blink of an eye, Daria found herself at the other end of
the runway, off to one side as Langston watched the Mustang taxi to a stop. She
noticed the outfit that Langston wore; it was the uniform of a Lieutenant
Junior Grade in the WAVES &ndash; the women's component of the U.S. Navy during WWII.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><b><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

too many.&lt;&lt; <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>The canopy of the fighter opened, and Daria blinked hard in
surprise as Charles stepped out of the plane and, in something that seemed to
come straight out of a movie, a slight breeze came in to gently tousle his hair
as &ndash; also as if on cue &ndash; sunlight shone through the early morning mists to
perfectly backlight Charles (dressed in the uniform of an Army Air Force
officer, silken scarf and all) as he took off his aviator shades and looked
down at Langston with an award-winning smile.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Hello, Langston.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><b><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>&gt;&gt;Oh. My. GOD. This has GOT to be a dream &ndash; and Upchuck
must have slipped her some of those 'glitter berries' that got Mom, Dad and
Quinn a couple of years ago.&lt;&lt;<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>With a subtle, yet dramatic motion, Charles stepped from his
plane and walked towards Langston; Daria noticed that he was wearing the eagles
of a full Colonel on his lapels. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

color:#323D4F'>Of course, he and Sandra (he always called her that) NEVER
mentioned making out that night to <u>anyone else</u>; he wanted to avoid
'death by outraged Black woman' by any means necessary, and he KNEW Sandi
wasn't saying anything (especially to the FC &ndash; God knew that they couldn't keep
secrets about each other). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Despite that &ndash; he just wasn't a sun-worshipper. He just wasn't
into 'soaking up rays' or 'being out in the sun' just to do it. He just hated
that sensation, as though he were just soaking up more and more sunlight, as if
it were just soaking into him as if it was just an annoying tickling all over
his body...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>As Mack lay on the floor less than thirty feet from the breached
Outer Containment Chamber of the experimental miniaturized Tokamak fusion
reactor within Energy Research Lab Delta, he felt that sensation that he always
felt when he was out in the brightest of sunlit days... but now - much, much more
intense...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>It wasn't a tickling, but poking, prodding... a HARD prodding, as
if something was sticking him with hundreds of drumsticks all over his body,
trying to punch into him, harder and harder, over and over in a smothering
blanket of pressure, increasing from discomfort to painful and approaching
excruciating-<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the way Coach Gipson used to tell him and the other players to drink in the
fatigue and pain when they were doing laps or having an especially rough
practice. <i>Drink it up, man! Pull that damned pain in and walk it off! Is
THIS what they made you the captain of the football team for &ndash; hell, that idiot

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Rising up on one knee, Mack began to concentrate, forcing
himself upwards as he focused on driving past the sensations and sucking up the
pain... literally, he thought, as he thought he could actually feel himself
absorbing the pain and the prodding and poking... now, it was starting to ebb
back town to an annoying sticking...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Somehow, he managed to open his eyes, and he saw a world of
unbelievable color infused within everything in the area &ndash; the furniture, the
floor and walls, the lab equipment, even his clothes &ndash; with a floodlight of
color so strong that it almost had &ndash; it did have &ndash; a physical force, like a
blowtorch the size of a spotlight, so strong that it felt as though he was in
hurricane-force winds and he should be blown away, flapping away on a Technicolor
gale-<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Mack came to his feet, and somehow, impossibly &ndash; he began to
drink the color in. More and more of it, every bit of it &ndash; there was so much
light and sensation that he knew that anybody else would have been torn apart
like balsa wood and rice paper... but he stood firm in the rainbow storm, feeling
strong &ndash; strong like he'd never felt in his entire life. He became a waterfall,
a grand river that the light crossed over and just poured down deep somewhere
within him, to a place so deep and endless that he knew that he could take
every bit of it and send it into that chasm of light...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>All of it</span></i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

the light away...</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Mack concentrated, raising his left hand, and the light seemed
to funnel towards his palm, streams of energy swirling from points all about
the room, filaments and thin tendrils angling and dancing across and away from
the walls and equipment in the room, spinning through the walls &ndash; <i>if that
were actually possible, what the hell does that mean?</i> Mack thought &ndash; and in
a thick, waterlike gout from within the other room...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>He drank it all in. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>The room was suddenly dark. Very dark. The kind of Dark that
Mack had actually feared, ever since he was a little boy-<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Light exploded across the room &ndash; a pure, absolute, all-consuming
light that drove away every shadow from every corner and crevasse in the room...
and as Mack realized that his eyes were not in the least bit harmed by the
light, he suddenly reasoned out <u>why</u>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><u><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>A loud, grinding sound spun Mack around, and as he turned to
face the source of the sound &ndash; something just outside the pair of double doors
leading into the lab &ndash; he saw a trio of hulking, vaguely human forms just
outside the first set of doors. They meandered outside the doors, and moved
back; as Mack watched, another form walked into view and through the doors,
stopping just in front of him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Hello, kid," the man said, and Mack recognized him as the guy
who worked with Jane, Daria and all of the others in the Legion &ndash; Major
Arminton, or something like that-<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Armalin, kid," the man said, smiling at him. "<i>Armalin</i> &ndash;
and I'm a Colonel, now, too. I'm glad that you're friendly with Jane, Daria and
the others..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>The man walked away from him, lifting his right hand as he
moved, and it was only then that Mack realized that he was holding something,
moving it around as he walked about before he took the radio from his belt and
spoke into it. "It's reading cold in here &ndash; not even background radiation or
traces, even from the chamber. It's safe for you to enter."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>An awestruck voice echoed out of the radio. "Are you sure, sir?
I mean, we were picking up indications that the Tokamak had-"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"It's cold &ndash; and as for being safe, there's a teenager standing
five front of me and he's very alive. One Michael Mackenzie, I believe."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>A second, equally awestruck voice came on the line, but Mack
recognized this one. "Mack's in there with you, Colonel? What the hell is he
doing in there &ndash; and he's <i>alive</i>?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"He's very alive, Mister Sloane &ndash; although, he is a little
sour-smelling," Armalin said, flashing a grin in Mack's direction. "Come on
inside and see for yourself."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Clicking off the radio, Armalin turned back to Mack and almost
laughed as the boy moved behind a counter as he realized he'd completely soiled
himself. "I'd say that's the least of your problems, Michael... how do I say
this... you do realize that you're glowing, don't you?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Even though he already knew that, Mack held up his hand to see
the pure white light that poured from his hand, and from every point on his
body. "What... what's happened to me?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Armalin smiled again as a number of people began to walk into
the lab, shading their eyes from the radiance bursting away from Mack &ndash; and it
was only then that he realized that only Armalin wasn't affected by the light.
"I don't know, Michael... but if you're interested, after we get you checked out
&ndash; and find you a shower and clean clothes - we're going to find out."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Six hours later, Mack sat in an examination room at Cedars of
Lawndale Hospital, sipping from a large cup of Sparkle Zero soda with crushed
ice as he watched Soaper Central (the soap opera channel) as they played the
Halloween episode of <i>Fandemonium</i>, which featuring Angelinhel and Vlad...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Mack cringed and took a big drink of soda as Angelinhel set one
of the two small boxes she carried down in front of Vlad, who also cringed at
the sight of it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Man, AiH always was one of the big draws," Mack said to
himself, reaching for another steak fry from the small basket of fries brought
to him by one of the nurses earlier. "Wonder what's going to happen when she
goes up against this new NightGoblyn person, especially since he became an
Angst Lord &ndash; and speaking of them, who' have ever believed that the Supreme
Angst Lord was the &ndash;"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Yeah, okay."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Dr. Hanley Phillips walked in, a clipboard in his left hand as
he offered his right to Mack. "Hello, Michael. I'm Dr. Phillips. How are we
feeling?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Just fine, doc," Mack replied, setting his soda aside as Dr.
Phillips turned the TV off. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Well, Michael, I'll have to say that you're absolutely fine &ndash;
no problems that I can see, and you're healthy as the proverbial horse. No
signs of... any unusual problems, but I do want to ask you about those bruises on
your back."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"What bruises &ndash;oh," Mack said, gasping slightly as he pressed
his back against the bed and winced slightly. "Yeah. I don't know what that's
from- wait a minute..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Memories flooded back into his mind. "I was just about to leave
Miss Barch's office &ndash; she'd just paid me for that package &ndash; and there was this
pain in my back that went all through me. Next thing I knew, I woke up on the
floor, and..." He looked up at the doctor. Did I fall on something and hurt my
back?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"I don't think so &ndash; but we'll check that out, too," the doctor
told him. "Like I said &ndash; 'healthy as a horse."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"I hope that you tell that to Mr. Sloane and my parents &ndash; as
well as that Colonel Armoire guy," Mack said, catching how the doc said the
last words. "They've been freaking out &ndash; well, my parents were..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Don't worry about the costs of the tests &ndash; apparently, our resident
rich guy is quite concerned about you, and he's covering everything," the
doctor chuckled. "He's out in the waiting area with your parents... are they
always that loud?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Mack actually blushed; the sounds of his parents' combined
yelling for answers about their son and why they weren't allowed to see him had
penetrated through two sets of heavy ER room doors and all the way to the back
section of the ER, where his examining room was located. His mother had a voice
that was especially capable of being heard at a distance... "They're not used to
hearing the word 'no' when it comes to me."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"I've seen a parent or two like that before," Dr. Phillips
grinned. "Look &ndash; I'm certain that there's nothing wrong with you &ndash; but I'd like
to do one more test on you. It'll take a couple of hours for the test results
to come back, but aside from the length, there shouldn't be any more problems.
I'm going to have a nurse come back in and draw another blood sample, and I'm
going to let your parents come back now-"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Yeah &ndash; why wouldn't they let them come in before, and why were
the nurses and the ambulance drivers all wearing those big yellow suits &ndash; the
HAZMAT suits the firemen wear when there's a toxic spill or something?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Dr. Phillips hesitated for a moment, and then looked up at Mack.
"Has... did Mr. Sloane talk to you about what happened at the laboratory?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"No... nobody has &ndash; nobody talked about what happened," he said.
"It was weird... I saw all of these weird, lights, and the entire place was
glowing, and what was really weird &ndash; it was, I mean... it was like the light was
solid, like it was a really strong wind, but-"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Mack stopped talking and looked up into the doctor's face,
afraid that he'd have an expression on his face that gave every impression that
he was talking to a crazy person; a very real sensation of cold, however, swept
over him as the doctor gave him a probing, examining look... a look that seemed
to say that he'd seen things like this before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

parents come back now to see you, Michael. I'll be back when your test results
are ready. Oh &ndash; let me turn the television back on for you."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"He's just confused, and a little anxious," Hanley said, not
even looking up from his clipboard as Armalin fell into step besides him as he
walked down the hall towards the nurses' station. "I'm sending a nurse in to
draw a blood sample for the metagene test battery. You'll have results within
ninety minutes."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"I heard," Hanley replied. "The Academy's been in Indiana since
the mid-1980's, and the SSC opened ahead of schedule &ndash; their first class began
a few years back. There's really no need for you even to act as a recruiter &ndash;
both schools have their own."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"I know," Armalin told him. "They've already come up with a

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"Definitely a sign of a good school cheer." Hanley slowed down
his pace. "One unusual thing &ndash; the boy was tasered. A powerful one, too &ndash; but
it's as if the area's healed itself up with superhuman speed. From the reaction
you said it had &ndash; it caused his bowels and bladder to release &ndash; there should
still be the puncture wounds from where the darts hit him, as well as slight
burn marks, and I'm surprised that he didn't go into cardiac arrest. He was hit
with a lot of voltage."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>Armalin's face grew somber. "Somebody tried to kill the boy?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>"If they did, they really screwed it up &ndash; between that jolt and
the amount of radiation that was supposedly in that area, I'm surprised that
the government hasn't evacuated the city and lost several hundred people in the
process... as for Mackenzie, he shouldn't even be a radioactive skeleton on the
floor there," Hanley told him. "Why would anyone want to kill a high school
football player?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

her Glock service pistol. "If we leave him here, with or without others, I'm
afraid what he might do."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:#323D4F'>First, Brittany had found a flag, deep within the upper branches
of a tree; she climbed up the tree, retrieved it and sauntered back down with
the agility and speed of a bobcat after a mouse. Hank took several shots of
her, including a shot of her as she landed in a crouching position she must
have learned in martial arts, which led to a ten-minute conversation on the
seven forms of martial arts she was fluent in (Tae Kwan Do, </span><span
lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Krav Maga, Wing Chun, Jeet Kun Do,
Hapkido, Savate and Aikido), as well as a quick demonstration of several moves
with Charles as the throwing dummy (which earned him several dewy-eyes looks
from Langston and much eye rolling from Daria). That was caped off with a story
from Charles of an especially energetic sparring match between Brittany and the
Colonel ("It was like the subway fight between Neo and Agent Smith in <i>The
Matrix</i>!" Charles gushed). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>That
was followed up by Charles finding two more flag. (actually, Daria seethed
because Langston had to take a bathroom break and found one; she then pointed
out that Charles should perhaps take a nature break as well, and all but forced
him to the spot where the flag was located). To cap that off, Hank stopped at
an especially pictoresque location on the way, where the stream met with another
to form a series of beautiful waterfalls, and Hank asked for each of the
Legionnaires to pose for shots there. Daria posed, begrudgingly, not wanting to
hear Quinn or Jane complain about her not not being helpful, but Charles and
Brittany really got into the spirit of things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>With
the waterfalls as a backdrop, Brittany performed a eye-popping pattern from her
Tae Kwan Do learnings (she had to correct Hank, politely, that 'katas' are in
karate and judo) that made even Charles' eyes go wide. He caught a disapproving
look from Daria; remembering her threats, he quickly turned his attention
elsewhere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Langston
caught the exchange of looks; a wicked gleam in her eye, she took Charles' hand
in her own. "Come on &ndash; I want to take a picture with you!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Leading
him to the shot where they were framed by the waterfalls, Langston asked
Charles to remove his tunic and roll up his sleeves; when he protested, she
coyly said, "Tell you what &ndash; I won't ask you to do anything that I wouldn't
do!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>As
four sets of eyes bugged out and four mouths dropped open, Langston slipped her
coat off, slid out of her heavy denims and pulled her thick sweater over her
head to reveal the tiny pink bikini that she was wearing. Hank almost dropped
his beloved Leica and Charles' resolve to put girls down as a secondary
priority evaporated as she walked up to him, wrapped one arm around him and
said, "So &ndash; wanna take a few shots with me...?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Even
Hank couldn't begrudge the speed at which the Legion tunic &ndash; and
unsurprisingly, the turtleneck beneath it &ndash; flew through the air and landed, in
a case of poetic justice, in a rumpled heap at Daria's feet. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Daria

because she got to him first when the boys see the shots that I took of her
that problems vapor they'll be beating down the door to get to know her and
maybe she'll lighten up then when she has some boy toys to just play with maybe
she just needs some sex like tracy ullman told ally mcbeal that she tried not

suddenly found herself down on her hands and knees, retching out her breakfast

in the wilderness. Yes, I still think that you skirted the whole point of the

the difference between a grizzly bear and a Kodiak bear. I'm glad that you were

Sloane didn't go off the way that you'd planned," the man said, fixing himself
a drink. "My sources tell me that there were reports of a serious nuclear
incident, with a massive release of radiation &ndash; but then, the source later
reports that the entire facility is free of radiation and the reactor which was
the cause is totally inert, as is every last bit of radioactive material on the
premises."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

glass of the amber-colored liquor. "Not only were people able to walk in, but
also a young man by the name of Michael Mackenzie was able to walk out. Now,
how do you suppose that a seventeen-year-old football player managed to survive
what should have been a dose of radiation lethal enough to wipe out the entire
population of that little suburb &ndash; and also rid the entire area of that
radiation?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

turning back. "I have a special project... a project that studies such subjects.
