<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:#323D4F'>No one who knew either Kyle Armalin or Alexandra Griffin
would have, or could have, believed that the relationship they shared was
anything more - or less - than that of Master and apprentice. <br>
<br>
This is most effectively shown in the photograph of the two taken at the U.S.
Academy of Extranormal Studies, where both are seen wielding Armalite PFT-M3
CC2 'force batons' [7], which to untrained eyes look like the ubiquitous
'lightsabers' of Star Wars fame. The pose that Armalin and Griffin are caught
in, and the way they hold their weapons, is eerily similar to the image of Liam
Neeson and Ewan McGregor in <b>Star Wars: The Phantom Menace</b>, the first
time they ignite their weapons. <br>
<br>
Still, proponents of the 'Armalin/Griffin were lovers' theory (or 'Kandi'
shippers, as they refer to themselves) point to several inconsistencies in
their relationship. Those points have been refuted at great length elsewhere;
it is not necessary to do so here. <br>
<br>
However, one point should be addressed again, because it is not one of the more
salacious points that the media has glommed upon to a great extent. With the
knowledge that Daria Morgendorffer had psionic powers and the fact that he had
possessed such powers at one time himself - why, then, would Armalin's
attention be focused upon Griffin and not Morgendorffer, who clearly seemed to
need the added attention more?<br>
<br>
Again, the answer is obvious to anyone who knew Armalin. As a career Marine
officer, and of a past that easily rivals the exploits of any cinematic or
literary adventurer, the choice between the two young women was clear; so, too,
was the path that led Griffin to Armalin's side. Armalin's attitude towards
educating the young was legendary; he felt that either the trainees wanted to
be there, or they did not deserve to be there. <br>
<br>
Griffin wanted to become more than she was. She wanted to become a better
person, and wanted to explore the depths of her abilities and potential more
than Morgendorffer ever did. She simply wanted it more than her fellow
Legionnaire, and because of this, Armalin one day called her to walk by his
side as she learned. <br>
<br>
She would remain there until, in the fullness of time, she proved herself to
have learned what she knew to honor his teachings on the field of battle. To
everyone's surprise - that day was not long in coming...</span></i><span

&ndash; I understand that you didn't mention to your sister that, in order to fool
me, you actually <u>did</u> spend three days at that little spa in Arizona...
before you sneaked away to join up with that National Legion group heading into
New Orleans."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>No, sir, I didn't," Quinn
Morgendorffer said, a touch of smirk that Kyle Armalin recognized as being a
Morgendorffer trait appearing on her face. "She didn't need to know that I had
just a tiny bit of fun before I got some work done..." <i>Or that I got
Juan-Carlo's phone number, if I ever happen to pass that way again... and since
he's going to be starting up a Legion chapter in Tempe &ndash; once I talk to the
others about that tiny little change to the Legion Constitution...<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Or that you're better at being
sneaky than she is," Kyle replied, looking down at the small hard-shell case on
the table next to him. He looked around the firing range, then back up to
looking at Quinn and Sandi Griffin. "Good call. Ladies, as the leaders of the
Legion, I wanted to talk to you about a couple of things &ndash; and as they're
related to this area, I asked you to meet me down here."<br style='mso-special-character:

<![if !supportLineBreakNewLine]><br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>
<![endif]></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"You're giving us a new weapon
to test, Colonel?" Sandi asked, smiling in a way that made Quinn slightly
uncomfortable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"No, not 'test' &ndash; but that's
later. First, there are a couple of membership matters I'd like to discuss with
you in a strictly advisory capacity. Obviously, I have no authority on your
internal operations, as to who stays, goes, or how you run your chapter of the
Legion. I only have authority over the training cadre and Legion matters
directly related to that."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The girls nodded. "First &ndash;
there's Taylor. Upon joining, she was given the option of a specialized training
regimen, as you all were &ndash; and she chose paramedic training. Unfortunately,
Miss Taylor doesn't have the... appropriate skill set for her to complete the
training in a satisfactory manner."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>He just called her an idiot
in the most polite way that I've ever seen, </i>Quinn thought, as Armalin
continued. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"However, after speaking with
the heads of the training cadre, we think that there's an alternate avenue that
she may wish to consider," he finished. "The general consensus is that Miss
Taylor would make an excellent infiltration and intrusion specialist &ndash; with her
powers, her skills and he looks, she could go places few others could, and just
as easily, get back out again."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"You want us to talk to her
about asking her to change over." The way Sandi spoke made it clear that
Armalin's phrase wasn't a request.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"No, tell her everything. She's
frustrated in medical training, she's frustrating her instructors, she hasn't
really learned anything... if I can give you a piece of advice on as how to
approach the subject, start with talking about the sparring match she had with
me some time back." Armalin remembered it well &ndash; he wasn't ashamed at all of
his skills or training in the martial arts &ndash; but he knew that if that had been
a REAL fight, he would have had to work at killing her (using his skills) or
use his metahuman abilities to subdue her without harm. <i>Taylor was really
that good, easily in a class with that red-haired cheerleader-turned-special
assignments-type from Middleton,</i> he remembered. <i>She just needs some polishing
up...<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"When you talk to her, you also
need to use those Fashion Club talents that the two of you have and find out
about getting her some personal items that will help her with her exercises and
field work &ndash; for example, the bras that she wears."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Kyle ignored the looks on the
girls' faces. "This doesn't have anything with being a pervert, ladies &ndash; it's
about keeping your operatives combat-effective. Anyone with eyes can see that
Miss Taylor's... endowments... are causing her some discomfort during exercise
sessions and doing her roadwork. There are a number of, shall we say, special
establishments that deal with clothing for people in this field... and
undergarments capable of reducing Miss Taylor's distress are available... and in
reasonable prices which the Legion stipend you all receive should easily cover,
although I'd recommend that these be covered under 'equipment costs'. For some
of the more, shall we say, 'mundane or exotic' clothing choices &ndash; those would
have to be purchased out of pocket, unless they were to be used for Legion
purposes."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"What kinds of clothing?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"The type I think you'd have
wished you were wearing when that Black Majesty character dropped by," Armalin
said. "Unstable molecules' &ndash; long story short, it's a process for creating
clothing that can be used to respond to your powers as your own body does,
without being damaged or destroyed when you use your powers."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"So I can use as much
electricity as I wanted and my clothes won't burn away, or Brittany could turn
invisible and her clothes would, too?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Or Charles could turn into an
elephant or a sparrow, and his clothes would disappear during the transference
but reappear when he returned to human form." Armalin noticed the looks of
distaste on the two girls faces... and decided to bite the bullet. "Okay, that is
another subject that I might as well touch upon, because it leads to something
else I wanted to talk about. Yes, Charles has &ndash; <i>in the past</i> &ndash; been
someone who hasn't been up to your high standards for what a man is in the eyes
of women such as yourselves, with such sophisticated, well-educated and worldly
experiences and tastes..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Quinn and Sandi flinched as
Armalin's Fujita-scale irony struck them as he had intended. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"...But need I remind you that he
happens to have several things that you do not. First, he's from a wealthy
background, so the funding of the Quest Corporation is not something new to him
and therefore, he's able to more effectively move through the use of such
resources &ndash; as you found out, Miss Griffin. Second &ndash; and not to put too fine of
a point on this, because sometimes, some people need to be shocked out of their
complacency zones &ndash; he's more intelligent than the both of you put together...
and that goes for even when you access your enhanced intellect, Miss Griffin.
He's been doing college-level studies online since your return from your
vacations, as well as beginning flight training for jet aircraft. He'll be the
first of you to fly the <i>Gridrunner</i>, sometime in the middle of next year...

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Sandi had nothing to say,
remembering the piece of conversation she had with her teammate in Alaska;
Quinn's eyes went wide as she absorbed the insult fully. "If he really wanted
it and came to me to ask for help in doing so, I can almost promise you that
Charles would be a cadet to any of the military academies that he wanted to
attend, or he could attend an Ivy League school starting in January. "Third &ndash;
with the possible example of you, Miss Griffin, Charles has progressed the most
of ALL Legionnaires in his physical training regimens since he began his
training. You don't notice him because he spends more time in the weight room

many years looking at him as a piece of crap."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Armalin let his words sink in.
"He's a fellow Legionnaire, he more than pulls his load, he has an unique set
of abilities that could get him in anywhere in the world and which he hasn't
used in a untoward or unethical manner since his arrival OR your sister's talk
with him &ndash; which we're <u>also</u> about to talk about. He is easily one of the
best pieces of publicity that your Legion could have; the fact that you
collectively feel he's as appealing as a piece of mold-covered piece of bread
is one that you alone share, because it appears that many other young ladies
find him interesting. If you keep going as you are, <u>you're</u> going to lose
credibility. No one said that you had to invite him in for slumber parties, but
give him the respect he's earned as a member of your team. <i>LAY OFF THE

Sandi. "A Mark Four PFT - for field use."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>As Sandi took the device

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Armalin was about to answer
when the red light above them went off; the three turned to see Tom Sloane
watching them from inside the viewing room, standing behind a window made of
crystal clear, bulletproof plastics. "Right on cue, Sloane," Armalin spoke,
waving the young man inside. "This is a PFT &ndash; <i>point-force transference</i> &ndash;
weapon. This fires a pulse of energy that delivers high-level concussive force
to a very small area on the target, but instead of delivering the energy upon
impact - it transfers the force through the initial layer of material... skin,
clothing, armor, a door and so forth, even forcefields - and delivers the full
effect from the other side. Don't ask me about the trans-dimensional physics
involved that make it work, either &ndash; it would take me an hour to explain and
I'd probably get some of it wrong. Basically, think of it as an energy version
of an armor-piercing weapon, but with <i>technically</i> non-lethal effects... on
lower settings. Even on it's lowest setting, it'll knock a person for a serious
loop."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Hey," Tom said, walking into

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I need you to help with a

"Please go invulnerable and put this on."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Tom's face took on an uneasy
look as he saw the bulletproof vest that Armalin had sitting next to the
hard-shell case. "You're going to shoot at me...?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Not with a gun &ndash; and you're

&ndash; it's for the demonstration." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Still uneasy, Tom put the vest
on and began to walk down the lane in which Armalin had placed a target. "Walk
about another twenty-five feet further down," the Marine growled, his thumb
flicking a switch on the second PFT baton to the eleventh setting and locking
it down. "Okay, that's good, Sloane. You've gone hard?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Yes, sir," Tom said, blushing
slightly as the girls beside Armalin smirked; he really wished that the Marine
would use another term to describe him becoming invulnerable. "Ready."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Faster than any of the teens
would have believed, Armalin brought the PFT up and fired six pulses so quickly
that they seemed to be the same blast &ndash; and Tom didn't even have enough time to
shriek before he was blasted down the length of the range (a full 150 feet)
like a leaf and into the backstop (a full nineteen inches of omnium armor) with
enough force to leave a VERY well-defined, upside-down Tom Sloane-shaped
imprint in the metal. <i>"OH MY GOD-!"</i> Quinn screamed, jumping back before
the sound of Tom's impacting the wall had faded away. "You <u>KILLED</u> him-!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Armalin turned to give Quinn a
look of ultimate dismissal, noted that Sandi's eyes were wide &ndash; but that she
didn't move from her spot - and then looked back as Tom fell away from the
imprint he'd made in the wall. He stood gaping at the impression of his form in
the armor plate for several seconds, and then looked back at Armalin with a
look of absolute awe on his face. "THAT &ndash; WAS &ndash; FREAKING &ndash; <u>AWESOME</u>!!!"
he yelled, total boyish giddiness in his voice. "I have GOT to get one of
those-!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Perhaps," Armalin promised,
his annoyance with Tom fading somewhat. "If you can manage to do better on your
physical qualifications &ndash; without using your powers."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"That's a PFT on its highest
setting &ndash; with several shots placed just right," Armalin said, deactivating the
weapon. "That's why you want to be sure that you always check your settings before
you fire, and they're designed with an activation default, so that they won't
fire past Setting Four unless you actively use the setting switch."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Armalin looked over at Sandi,
who'd been silent and watching. "Because your average person can survive a hit
on Setting Four without any permanent damage &ndash; they just won't wake up for
several hours. Think of getting hit by Mike Tyson, but with him pulling his
punch."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Quinn looked at the PFT in
Sandi's hand, and took a slight step behind Armalin. "Do they fire like that &ndash;
one blast?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"That was four pulses &ndash; I'm
just quick on the trigger," Armalin replied. "PFT's can fire single pulses &ndash; as
fast as you press the firing button &ndash; or you can set it to fire a number of
pulses, and at several rates of fire. The highest rate of fire &ndash; well..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Armalin tapped another button,
raised the PFT towards the backstop, and the Legionnaires' mouths dropped open
as the metal flashed and rang with a flurry of energy pulses connecting! "Oh...
wow," Sandi spoke. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"You could do some damage with
one of these," Armalin told them. "The power cell holds enough charge for 200
pulses at Setting Eight &ndash; that's your first lethal setting. Think of getting
hit by a car at fifty miles an hour. At Setting Eleven &ndash; your highest setting -
you'll have twenty pulses, and down on Settings One and Two &ndash; the ones you
would use for normal people and small animals to knock them back or out for a
bit &ndash; you're effectively unlimited... about 1500 pulses. The PFT can recharge the
power cell, and plug into even a common power socket to recharge or fire from &ndash;
although it would be funny to see someone using this with an extension cord attached."</p>

example, Mr. Sloane here simply flew up into the air, hovered there and
vomited, whereas Mr. Mackenzie's first manifestation was an uncontrolled burst
of illumination that was later calculated at just over five million
candlepower... or bright enough to light up the entire side of a mountain as
though it were daytime. Imagine if that had been his flame power manifesting,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Correct me if I'm wrong, but

the term that was beginning to be used for people in the Legion but not members

of the observation chamber he was in. "Tonight's spaghetti was really good, and
the salmon patties from yesterday rocked. They also don't mind if you raid the
fridge for leftovers.'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Mack's voice rang clearly from
the speaker in the wall next to the massive door to the chamber. "Is there any
more of that oxtail soup from Tuesday left?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I can check," Trent told him.
"Hey, did the Colonel or Mr. Sloane tell you how long you'd have to be in
there? I mean &ndash; you're basically in a vault, and this window's as thick as a
couple of engine blocks, end to end."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Until they're sure that I'm
not going to blow up like a bomb or something, I guess," came the surprisingly
calm reply. "Did Jodie bring my homework yet?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I'll check," Trent promised.

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"From what they've told me, I'm

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Trent averted his eyes as
Mack's raised left hand started to shimmer, and a burst of pure golden light
shone forth to fill the room &ndash; and the viewing portal immediately darkened to
protect the vision of anyone in the adjoining chamber. "For the past week, ever
since I woke up on the floor in Ms. Barch's lab, I can... glow," he said,
dampening down his output and watching the portal go clear again. "I can
project light &ndash; either all around me, or like a flashlight &ndash; like a beam, from
my hands, eyes, even out of my mouth like that Lo Pan guy in <i>Big Trouble in
Little China</i>. Want to see something really wild, though?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Mack stood up and went to the
middle of the large chamber, decorated like a very nice bedroom, and turned to
Trent. "A couple of days ago, I was eating a hot dog, and thinking about how I
like a bit of scorch marks on 'em, like you get in real life but how you don't
ever see on TV? Anyway, look what I started doing with my hand..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>He held up his right hand, and
it was immediately sheathed in gold and scarlet plumes of flame! "This is so
cool," he said, leaving a circle of flame in the air as he traced a circle with
his finger. "It doesn't even burn &ndash; I don't feel it! Look at this-!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Mack closed his eyes, as if to
concentrate &ndash; and a sheet of flame immediately flowed over his body like a
waterfall! "It's even better," he continued, beginning to rise up into the air
several inches over the spot where he had stood &ndash; and Trent noticed that the
carpet wasn't even scorched. "I have no idea how I'm doing it &ndash; but I can fly!
I've tried it out a couple of times, and I can fly all around the room &ndash; it's
like I've been doing this my entire life!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Trent suppressed a touch of
jealousy as he watched Mack take a quick and controlled spin around the room,
twirling in a spin and doing a couple of fancy little loop-the-loops before
setting down in front of the viewing portal. "I can do it without the flames,
too &ndash; it gets kind of boring, so I played around with it &ndash; that's how I figured
out that I can do the heat alone, without the flames &ndash; I guess I heat up the
air around me when I fly and become lighter than air... I bet that I can go like
a rocket by burning the oxygen and hydrogen in the air beneath me &ndash; Man, I
can't wait to try this out!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Mack immediately powered down,
a somber look on his face. "Yeah. Jodie went to the funeral. They had a casket,
even though there wasn't a body..." His voice trailed off. "Mr. O'Neill's messed
up over it. He really cared about her."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Trent thought about the news
through the grapevine about the monster settlement that the Sloanes made with
O'Neill &ndash; the insurance, funeral costs, and a boatload of money so he'd go away
and not sue... <i>even with the other rumor that she had deliberately sabotaged

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"So what is it now &ndash; third

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The elevator doors opened at
just that moment, and Tom, Quinn and Sandi stepped out as Harrison and his

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Admiral Harrison gave Cadet
Lyter &ndash; the female cadet &ndash; a disapproving glance, and the Legionnaires turned
as one from the closing doors on the elevator to Armalin. "What's that all
about?" Quinn asked, her eyes questioning. "Nothing - just touching up on a
quick field trip for all of you. Since you're all in your uniforms, head out
front and tell everyone you see on the way to slip on their uniforms or toss
their Legion jackets on &ndash; and if anyone takes over an hour to get dressed, I
will not be amused."</p>

snapped the Mark 40 onto his wrist moments after stepping through the lengthy

him. "When they sealed off the top of that building after the City Council
meeting and played a free concert the night, and the cable news people carried
it live because of the police trying to get them down and the crowds blocking
them, I had to buy their CD."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"So, how does it feel to be out

Mack turned to her. "Not bad," he said, and looked down at the indicator face
on the Mark 40. "I guess it works &ndash; I can't even make a tiny flame on my
fingertip, or flash any light."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Just wondering why she didn't
kill off most of the guys at Lawndale High &ndash; and probably a few of the girls,
too," he said, remembering some of the comments made about the older
Morgendorffer sister ever since she'd arrived at Lawndale High as a sophomore &ndash;
none even remotely about her attitude, and nearly all about her figure and what
she'd probably be like alone with a very lucky person. "Some of the things

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Jane smirked, and Mack pushed
to the far reaches of his brain a dream he'd once had after watching the <i>Wormhole
X-Treme!</i> spin-off <i>Wormhole Lemuria</i>&ndash; where he was an alien
warrior-prince (on the show, the people of that race all dressed up like they
were WWII-style Japanese warriors, complete with period swords), with Daria and
Jane both as members of the Earth team, now his captives, and dressed up as his
Asian concubines... that was a <i>really good dream</i>...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I know &ndash; Dad's a big fan &ndash; and

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Quinn looked around at the

"Stacy, make a note in the minutes that on this date, with a show of hands and
