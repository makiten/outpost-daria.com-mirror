<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The Bowman Psionics
Regulation and Operations Act, or what would become more infamously known as
'Bowman's Telepath Act' 'BTA' or most famously, 'Section Ten') became the
reason why the United Nations refused to recognize the Bowman Acts. In an
impassioned speech before the General Assembly (one that, surprisingly, was
actually kept secret by even 'rogue nations' like North Korea, Qumar and Quarc)
in which he explained the rational nature of enacting his proposals &ndash; and
giving a shocking practical demonstration of what could occur if those
proposals were not signed into law &ndash; Senator James Bowman in fact actually gave
the UN the ironclad reason to vote down the implementation of the laws that
would become his namesake &ndash; and without a single abstention or 'nay' vote.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:162.3pt'>It is because of this,
however, that in over twenty-five years of life under the Bowman Acts, a
surprisingly minute number of psionically-endowed citizens in the 'Western
world' have been pursued, let alone prosecuted or incarcerated for violations
of Section Ten. Bowman wisely surmised that men and women with these gifts
would be tempted to use them for personal gain, and he felt that to summarily
suppress their legal rights or to severely curtail their Constitutional rights
to 'life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness' would result in a precedent
that could have grave repercussions for the future. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>Article Nine, Section Ten of
the Bowman Metahuman and Extraterrestrial Affairs Act of 1982 (the official
name of the legislation in question) was the telepathic-skewed version of
President Clinton's 1990's 'don't ask, don't tell' policy regarding gays in the
U.S. military, but with more leeway. In essence, Section Ten said 'If you have
telepathic powers, fine. If you actually use your telepathic powers, for good
or ill &ndash; that's your choice. However... if it comes to our attention that you're
doing it AND people are getting hurt... we will come looking for you. Not
'telepaths', not 'your family and friends or children' &ndash; just 'you'. An
individual who's broken the law.</i>'</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:162.3pt'>It is amazing, however, that
as a group, the nations of the world felt that they had to vote against the
Bowman Acts &ndash; but individually, almost all either ratified them or follow them
unofficially. They made sense, and allowed nation-states and corporations to
use telepaths for any purpose they chose, but also allowed plausible
deniability for those actions; also, telepaths could actually market themselves
as a viable commodity, since they would be held personally responsible for
their actions. Rumors persist to this day that the primary reason for rejection
was that the Bowman Acts could have been seen as movement towards a unity of
action within the nations of the world that, with the realization of what could
be a possible threat or cause of action, a canny individual could use as a
viable first step towards a world government. </p>

give him that kind of power... which is why, some say, he never found himself
short of contributors for his Senatorial campaigns ever again, he was more than
once approached for a spot on the Supreme Court, and (after President Clinton)
only the second American ever seriously considered for the post of
Secretary-General of the United Nations. <o:p></o:p></i></p>

barely-toughed lunch of crab salad and sweet tea to the somber look on Sandi

things from her side."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"One &ndash; she didn't erase your
memories, but just made you forget; like you said, The Doctor retrieved your
memories, and helped you there. Two &ndash; while she was in your mind, she didn't
change anything around, didn't go snooping around for dirt, and didn't do
anything but do what she had to do to give you some peace. Three &ndash; and I don't
believe I'm saying this &ndash; <i>she was doing something nice</i>. She was being
helpful &ndash; it was her first instinct. Okay, it could be considered wrong to do
what she did, but she was thinking' right now' instead of 'later'...'it's better
to do something constructive now than think about what the right thing to do
was later."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Quinn looked at Sandi
strangely. "Where did you hear that?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"It came out of a book that the
Colonel gave me to read &ndash; he told me to take my time, and don't be afraid to
ask questions," Sandi told her. "It's about this guy from Argentina who goes
into the army to fight these giant bugs after they blow up the city he lived
in."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Stacy Rowe's eyes snapped
upwards, and a heavy chunk of ground beef swirled in melted cheeses hung from
her fork for several seconds before it fell back to the plate as the girl
suddenly began to listen attentively to the conversation going on at the table.

worker.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>She looked back down as Sandi
continued. "Oh, and you should have heard the Colonel on the speakerphone with
some lady &ndash; Jean Grey. She was doing everything she could to make him stay calm
&ndash; it sounded like she's a telepath, too, and she was telling him to sit and
think before he did anything."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Stacy's eyes rose once more

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I wasn't snooping &ndash; I was taking
a CD copy of <i>All Things Legion</i> to his office so he could watch it, and

Evansville, Indiana &ndash; known to the faculty and cadets as 'The Axe' &ndash; had begun
to refer to them since they had arrived earlier that day) looked with surprise
at Sandi. "I guess that he thought that he could set a good example for her &ndash;
just help her not consider using her powers like that. Dr. Grey told him that
he'd be better off if he stopped thinking of her as a potential military asset
and just as a teenage girl who probably just wants to have a life, friends, a
cute guy and so on. Oh, that's when the Colonel went off on her &ndash; I haven't
heard language like that even in the gangbanger movies. I didn't know you could
make having red hair an insult like that... that was so rude..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Eyes were very wide as Sandi
took a bite of her shaved mesquite chicken breast sandwich, washed it down with
a long sip of diet root beer (her choice of soda amusing the others to no end)
and continued. "She got him back, then &ndash; made him sit down and go quiet for a
few moments. She told him that if he wasn't such a coward and kept his
telepathic power like any other good bloodsucking fiend has - then maybe he'd
have been able to work with her like he should have done in the first place,
instead of having to just talk and watch it do no good."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Quinn gasped, Stacy almost
choked upon a slender tomato wedge and Tiffany's spoon fell from her grasp into
her bowl of tomato and tofu bisque. "The... Colonel... can... read... minds... too?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Not any more, I guess." She
snapped a crisp French fry in half, and swirled it through a dab of ketchup. "I
was thinking... if being a telepath is so bad that it's the one power of his that
<b>he</b> didn't want... then maybe &ndash; maybe, we should think about how Daria
feels. I mean &ndash; imagine if, all of a sudden, you knew what everybody around you
was thinking... you knew what everyone really felt about you, even if you weren't
trying to hear them, because people probably just throw their thoughts out
about what's on their mind right at that moment. Think about how she must feel
if she were to walk past the boys' football team &ndash; "</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>A collective 'Ewwwwwwwww...' from
the table made several cadets from other tables glance over in their direction.
"We... haven't... been... any... better," Tiffany pointed out. "She's... snobby... but...
she's... <u>our</u>... snob. Maybe... we... should... try... to... be... her... friend..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"We tried," Stacy thought
aloud, remembering Daria's rebuff that night on Grace Island.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I don't know if it would
matter now, anyway," Quinn said sullenly, glancing around the area. "It looks
like Daria's found all sorts of new friends here."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"They're just there &ndash; except
for whenever I transform or keep something partially shifted," Charles
Ruttheimer said, smiling at one of the many cadets gathered around him in a
circle on the quad the Legionnaires had appeared on when they arrived, the
fixings for a picnic dinner all about them. "That's why I started with the
longer hair."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>He concentrated for a moment;
the antennae disappeared as his hair returned to the length he'd kept it at
since he returned from his enforced vacation. "I found that I can hold a
smaller transformation like this almost indefinitely, even when I'm asleep or
unconscious, and I've almost learned to make it 'muscle memory' &ndash; that's what
the trainers call it. The longer that I do it, the easier it is for my body to
remember to just go back to that appearance, as if it's part of my natural
form. Makes it easier to go out in public."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Well, I think you should keep
your hair like that," a cadet with a thick, heavy mass of jet-black hair said,
her hair seeming to slowly snake about her shoulders on its own. "I really like
the look."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Several feminine murmurs
chorused their agreement; a lanky cadet in her early teens, with hair the same
shade as Charles, poked her hand up. "Excuse me &ndash; but they said that when you
transform, you take on the properties of whatever you've changed into?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Pretty much," he replied,
nibbling on one of the honey-brushed corn muffins someone had brought out for
the impromptu nosh on the quad &ndash; apparently, the female cadets who'd cornered
him outside the Admiral's office in the Main Building had planned ahead, and
led him to where they had everything ready for him. <i>Just for him</i>, he
noted, as none of the other Legionnaires were in sight... and none of the cadets
were male. <i>Okay, whatever &ndash; they'll probably want to know all about
Shapeshifting, the Colonel said that it was a pretty rare ability, especially
at the level I do it on.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"We studied your fight with the
other polymorph at the beginning of the semester," a cadet who was a dead
ringer for Christina Ricci spoke up, her blue eyes taking in every inch of
Charles as he turned around to face her. "The fight you had before you
officially joined the Legion &ndash; I guess you think of it as your 'initiation' &ndash;
he actually tried to eat you?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Yeah, he did..." Charles told
them, shuddering at the memory, and then a thought popped into his head. <i>You
studied the fight &ndash; but how? Do they have copies of our records about stuff
like that here?</i></p>

took him out of the fight! How did you think of that so fast - and with you
never having been in any sort of combat with a metahuman before, especially
with someone with your own abilities, much faster, more powerful and more
experienced..." The cadet's eyes practically swam with admiration. "You were <i>incredible</i>..."<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Hey, Charles, what's going
on?" Tom Sloane called out, Michael Mackenzie at his side as they came across
the quad towards the gathering &ndash; and both pulled up short, stopped in their
tracks by a rain of hostile stares. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Hey, Tom &ndash; Mack!" Charles rose
up on one knee. "I was just talking to a couple of cadets, and people brought
food out for supper &ndash; come on and sit down! I was just telling them about some
of the stuff we were doing in the Legion-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Near the back of the group of
female cadets (and out of Charles' sight), a incredibly beautiful set of
letters, seeming to appear in air as if written in the most perfect shade of
blue light either of the two Legionnaires had ever seen, appeared to form the
words <i>Go away.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Tom and Mack looked at one
another, then at the crowd of decidedly hostile faces and the face of Charles,
who seemed honestly unaware, and back to each other. "No, it's cool," Mack
answered. "We had just finished trying out some of the exoskeleton simulations,
and were going to grab some dinner-" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The group of cadets focused
their attention back upon Charles; Tom and Mack hung back to listen. "I heard
that you're qualified on that Mach 5 scramjet that the Quest Corporation
built," said a female cadet with a flawless chocolate complexion and a figure
that made both young men feel a slight touch of envy as she moved closer to
Charles. "What's it like to fly something that fast?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I didn't get to fly the <i>Gridrunner</i>

not qualified to fly her, either &ndash; they only started me on jet training about
six weeks ago-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"You're already training on <i><u>jets</u></i>?"
The new speaker was a pert, athletic girl, a heavy lock of her sun-bleached
hair falling carelessly over her left eye and wearing a uniform blouse that
seemed quite impressive, for its ability to contain her equally impressive
bosom. "Really?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Tom and Mack walked away, twin
smirks on their faces as Charles seemed totally unaware of the efforts of some
of the female cadets to notice them personally. "That boy needs help," Mack
laughed. "He's been like this HOW long?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"For a few months &ndash; from what
I've seen, since just after I got here. The Colonel must have had a talk with
him, and he started getting really focused on his studies." Tom glanced back,
then over to Mack. "I think he got tired of making a fool of himself trying to
make girls like him, and now that they like him for what he is, he's got it in
his head that he's not going to make a fool of himself in front of them again."</p>

like those girls do keep throwing themselves at him, he'll get that out of his
mind. Did you see the last two that asked him about flying...? If you can get
girls like that by being a pilot, sign me up for 'Top Gun!" Mack caught the
look Tom gave him. "Joking, man. I actually like Jodie &ndash; and besides, if I was
going to cheat on her, I'd have done it long ago."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"It wasn't like that, man,"
Mack said, remembering a conversation in an empty band room just after Mack
made Captain and Brittany was chosen as Head Cheerleader... and a single kiss,
after they agreed that people would complain, and talk, and it would be too
much trouble if anything was to happen between them... He idly wondered, in that
moment, if that was the reason why he tried his hardest to knock the stuffing
out of Kevin when he sacked him in that game against Polk.</p>

solid flicking upward of her left elbow, rotated backwards to deliver a reverse

the process, leaving herself open, and the attacker (in the same flicker of

that we can call that one a draw," a solid Black cadet with an earthy Georgia

how the bean-counters and the scientists want everything nice and tidy on the

rose, and refilled his wine glass. "Instead of being scared or confrontational,

allowed him to 'minister to the needs' of several members of the congregation &ndash;

exceptionally pleasant session; divorced four years ago, she'd not been seeing
anyone recently. The dark-haired woman wanted to speak to him about her

encouragement to slide out of her dress. Thank God that no one else was at the
church that afternoon; Madelyn was a very vocal woman, and after that hour with
her, Odell forever wondered why in the world her husband left her. The next
time she came to talk, she told him that one of the reasons Mr. Cooper had left
was because she wanted more in the bedroom than he had ever been able to
provide, and being a very conservative man, it had eroded his confidence.
Another glass of punch, and she was showing him just what she needed...</p>

satisfied, though; he'd had to have Renee Andrews, that sweet-faced little
fifteen-year-old who'd come to talk about her idea to build a web site for the
church. Reverend Harris thought it was a good idea and had told her to work on
it with Odell, and early one Thursday afternoon, on a day when classes were out

stupid idea to try and get her. The Andrews family had a reputation for being
able to hold their liquor that went back to before Prohibition &ndash; after all,
they'd been the local moonshiners up until the eighties, when they took the
bulk of the family profits and went legit by building a small distillery. The
Andrews' distillery had become one of the biggest employers in the area, and
the <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:#323D4F'>Carthage United
Methodist Church had benefited greatly from many members of the congregation
also being employees there. It seemed that every Andrews that ever was had a
inborn talent for drinking everyone else in sight under the table and then
finishing the bottle themselves; even Ferrell Andrews, Renee's grandfather and
the only Andrews to not go into the 'family business' since they began, could
down a full bottle of whatever you had and have it effect him as if he'd just
drank a bottle of water. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

several deputies had arrived both at the church and at Odell's home (partly to
search for evidence, and partly to find him and get him into custody before the
Andrews family or any of the employees could get their hands on him). Odell

someone trying to rape Carol Andrews when she was in college, the year before
she married into the family, and how she'd actually slashed the offender's
member with a straight razor she kept under her pillow in case of emergencies
(she had grown up as one of the only poor White families in the old
Cabrini-Green apartments in Chicago before managing to scrape her way into
college, and knew how to defend herself). He shuddered as he remembered hearing
Reverend Harris talk about his meeting with Carol and Peter Andrews &ndash; and how

church to a person. He had money, clothes, medicines (he loved Alka-Seltzer
cold medicine and that 'Airborne' stuff &ndash; with that, he could keep little colds

a prissy little steel .38 with mother-of-pearl grips, and a silenced .22 High

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Odell was sighting in on a pair
of squirrels that had run down the side of a tree and were playing with one
another; he was about to fire the suppressed weapon when he saw an unusual
flash of blue-green streak in front of the squirrels. He looked up to see a
third squirrel &ndash; this one normal looking, except that it had a beautiful coat
of the most unusual blue-green hue he'd ever seen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>I can sell that</i>, he
thought, and sighted in on the squirrel; slowly, he squeezed off a single
round, right through the squirrel's right eye-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>He was thrown away from where
the squirrel was, and the world washed over him to dissolve into a numbing
flash of white.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>*****</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The sun was low in the sky when
Odell woke up, and he was shivering. He lifted himself up, turned over - and
gasped as he felt the sudden cold, wet sensation of wet leaves and mud on his
bare bottom... </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The back of his clothes, the
back of his boots, and the hair on the back of his head &ndash; all of it had been
seared off as if by a blowtorch... but his body, and the parts of his clothing
facing the ground, were undamaged. Odell stood up, feeling distinctly
uncomfortable as he tried to keep his remaining pieces of clothing up so he
wouldn't be totally exposed &ndash;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>That was when he felt it. Odell
trembled as he felt waves after waves of energy pouring through him, surging, a
flood of energy burning across his entire body, all draining from every pore,
every inch, all of it coming towards the center of his right hand... the
sensations stopped, all except for a warm feeling, right in the center of his
palm. Taking off his calfskin glove (thank God that rich guy and I have the
same sized hands, Odell thought at the time), he noticed that there was now a strange
mark on his palm &ndash; a pronounced, perfect circle of darkened-pink, about the
size of a half-dollar coin, and was warm to the touch. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Odell noticed that the hat he
was wearing had fallen off and was lying undamaged next to a tree. He reached
for it &ndash; and yelped a loud, vulgar curse as it exploded with a loud hissing
puff and a flash of orange-pink light as he touched it with his right hand!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Whatever else he was, Odell
Jones was surprisingly quick on the uptake. He quickly found out that his body
&ndash; and the gloves that he was wearing when &ndash; well, when whatever that was that
happened when he shot that funny-looking squirrel, were immune to whatever it
was in his right hand... the warm energy, anti-matter, the Devil's own fire,
whatever it was. Everything else, when he touched it with his bare right hand...
POOF. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>If he grabbed up a large
handful of mud and threw it, it was like throwing a ball of dynamite. He
knocked down several trees and cracked several more like twigs with exploding
mud balls, yelling out with boyish abandon as each one made huge booms that
rang in his ears. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>It even cleaned him off better
than a shower, he thought, finding out that by holding his hand to his chest,
the energy (or whatever it was) cleaned off everything on his body, leaving him
naked as a jaybird... but feeling fresher and cleaner than he'd felt in years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Wearing nothing more than the
calfskin gloves that seemed invulnerable to his newfound power, Odell Jones
walked naked through the forestland; thoughts of squirrel and vegetable stew
now replaced by thoughts of how to gain wealth... and revenge. </p>
