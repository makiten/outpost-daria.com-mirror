<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>I remember the first time
that I met Quinn Morgendorffer. I wasn't impressed. However...that <u>would</u>
change. <o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>From <b><i>Inside The Tower</i></b>,
by K. M. Sherrie. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The tall, slender brunette sat
atop her bed and watched as Quinn Morgendorffer exited the bathroom and walked
over to her bed. "Nice outfit," she remarked, noticing the pink, frilly
nightgown that Quinn had in her hands. "Is that what the well-dressed superhero
wears to bed?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Quinn looked over at Sherrie &ndash;
she remembered that as the female cadet's name &ndash; and shrugged. "I always wear
things like this &ndash; even before I got my powers. You never told me what you do."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Sherrie looked her over for a
long moment, and Quinn got the distinct feeling that the unremarkable brunette
&ndash; not unattractive, but just average in looks and presence &ndash; was considering if
she was worth even speaking to. Quinn knew that look very well; it was the same
look that Daria had leveled in her direction countless times.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The girl shrugged. "I'm a
'fixer."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"A what?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"A 'fixer'. I have the power of
intuitive awareness of a problem or a situation; I look things over, study it
for a while, and then, I can tell you just what needs to be done in order to
fix it or improve it. If I'm personally exposed to something, my body adapts to
protect me from it, and then allows me to synthesize materials that perform the
same function."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Huh?" Quinn's eyes showed her
complete ignorance of what Sherrie had just said. "How does that work?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Okay... demonstration," the girl
said, sliding off to the side of her bed and fixing her eyes on Quinn. "You
generate and control lightning, right?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Yes..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Sherrie looked her over for
about a minute, and Quinn grew distinctly uncomfortable by the way the girl ran
her eyes over her. "Okay, I see," she said, standing up and taking a plastic
drinking cup from her dresser as she headed for the bathroom. "I see how it
works, now... oh, yeah." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The girl went to Quinn and ran
a finger across her forehead, then stuck the finger in her mouth as Quinn
flinched. "Oh, stop that," she said, filling the cup with water from the
faucet, then went back to her bed and sat down, holding a finger in the water
as she did so. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Quinn's face crinkled as she
watched. "Ewwww... I hope you don't think that I'm going to drink that after
you-" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I can't believe that <u>you're</u>
the Leader of the Legion," Sherrie huffed, her voice making Quinn sit without
further comment as she stirred the water with her finger. "I could see your
sister, or Jane Lane doing it again, or even Sandi Griffin &ndash; but <u>you</u>..."
She finished stirring, and handed the glass to Quinn. "Drink this &ndash; wait a
minute."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>She rose again from her bed,
and took a couple of ice cubes from the mini-fridge on the floor, which she
held in her palm for a minute before letting them fall into the cup. "Oh, stop
rolling your eyes and crinkling your face &ndash; you said you wanted to see how my
power works, right?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Quinn looked uneasily at the
cadet, and then lifted the cup to her lips. "Drink all of it," the girl
ordered; when Quinn finished, she took the cup and stepped back. "Okay &ndash; let's
see you use your power."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>As Quinn stood in the middle of
the floor, she let a electrical current leap and flow between her outstretched
palms &ndash; and noticed that, instead of the usual golden-yellow bolt of power, her
electrical arc was a burning bluish-white arc that seemed more powerful than
usual!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Sherrie walked to the bathroom,
refilled the cup and without warning, threw the water on Quinn, whose scream
filled the room!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Why did you do that?"
Quinn asked, looking at Sherrie with total confusion on her face. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I adapted your body chemistry
so that you can't be affected by your own powers," the female cadet calmly informed
her. "Before now, if you'd been using your powers and someone tossed water on
you, you'd have been zapped by your own blasts &ndash; now, you could be underwater
and fire at full power without hurting yourself. You're also immune to the
negative effects of superconductivity, too &ndash; that's what the ice cubes were
for. Cold will boost your powers, but you'll be able to fully control them if
that happens &ndash; and your powers won't be affected by heat any longer... you did
know that heat would reduce the intensity of your powers, right?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Quinn stood in the middle of
the room, water dripping from her nightclothes as Sherrie dropped the cup on
the desk and went back to her bed. "I've got dry pajamas in the top drawer,"
she said, curling up beneath the covers. "There are plenty of towels in the
closet, too. Get the water up before you go to sleep, and if you decide to go
out, don't make noise when you come back &ndash; I'm turning in early because I need
some sleep for tomorrow. I don't want to slip and fall when I wake up. Oh, yeah
&ndash; you've powers are boosted; your output's probably doubled &ndash; and you should be
able to use your powers in any environment the way you do normally. In vacuum,
you'll generate streams of conductive gas when you use your power."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The girl turned towards the
wall, and Quinn stood open-mouthed for a moment before starting towards the
closet. "Thank you," she said, wiping her face with a thick, fluffy towel.
"But... but why did you-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Sherrie rolled back over to
give Quinn a look of dismissal that Daria would have been impressed by.
"Because a nitwit like you needs all the help that she can get. Stop talking
and dry up the floor. I have tests this week, and just because I agreed to let
one of you Legionnaires bunk in here doesn't mean I have to be a celebrity
babysitter."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Sitting in a cool, secluded
spot on the private beach her family frequented for vacations for five
generations on the Caribbean island of Cristal Cielo, Natalia Lucchini was in a
foul mood that even the excellent wine she sipped could dampen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The lovely young Argentinean
woman reclined upon a pair of plush, decorative pillows she had brought along
and looked out over the incredible view of the setting sun, unbothered by the
servants from her family's mansion about a mile away (several of whom had
experienced her flamethrower temper before, but not without cause). She sipped
her wine and snacked upon the wonderful appetizer of 'sea marbles and blood'
(tiny meatballs of shrimp, crab, scallops and calamari, lightly breaded and
baked with tiny amounts of cheeses inside - provolone and freshly-made <i><span
lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>mozzarella di bufala campana</span></i><span
lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>, flown in from Italy specifically for the
making of that dish &ndash; and served with an extraordinarily thick and savory
tomato paste seasoned with Italian flavorings, kept warm in a special dish
heated by warm water in a second receptacle) provided for her and her now
VERY-late date, who Natalia ('Nat' to her friends and family) decided that
she'd be only wildly infuriated with &ndash; if he had a good reason for not being here,
and on time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:
EN'>Nat was a young woman who didn't like for her plans to be interrupted. She
knew exactly how her evening was to have played out &ndash; first, she'd worn a very
nice dress of the richest cream hue, one that contrasted nicely with the
bronzed luster of her flawless skin. She'd taken ninety minutes to decide which
dress to wear - </span>up to the knee (not too long, not too short), not too
revealing, but very attractive. She had examined herself in the full-length
mirror and pronounced herself worthy to be seen outside the walls of her
bedroom. Of course, she expected her boyfriend to see her and think that she
was gorgeous, even breathtaking... how could she be anything but?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>They would have dinner at
sunset, here, on the Lucchini's private beach (her family owned fully half of
the tiny island paradise outright, and for all practical purposes controlled
the other half). A main course of homard lobster, prepared perfectly, with a
wonderful dessert of a decorative, custom-made strawberry and mint <i>helado</i>
from her home of Buenos Aires that she adored afterwards. A walk on the beach,
afterward, with them finding a nice place to sit and watch the almost divine
beauty of a Caribbean sunset, with his strong arms around her as she marveled
at the amazing panorama of color in the slowly darkening skies over the sea...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Afterwards... Nat felt her body
beginning to respond to just the imagined touch of her boyfriend. For an
American, he was surprisingly sensitive and responsive to her own needs, and he
was more than capable in bed. He was, as the saying goes, 'a real catch'.
Wealthy, intelligent, capable of thinking for himself, quite fit physically and
handsome...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h2 style='margin-right:162.3pt'>His only flaw is that he's not here, right
now. Damn! Where is he?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Nat stretched, showing off her
legs (wonderfully sculpted and long) as she turned to look behind her at the
single road leading to the beach, and her large, dark eyes narrowed. <i>Darren
Appleton, you'd best have a world-class excuse for standing me up,</i> she
thought, spearing another sea marble with a toothpick and allowing the tiny
morsel to dissolve upon her tongue. <i>If you're not dead or two steps away

up from a very large, loose-leaf binder as Tom Sloane and Mack Mackenzie walked
into the large, comfortable area known as the 'Cadet's Club'. "Oh, hey, guys,"
the young man replied, waving them over to his table. "We've got major exams
next week, including the Federal Certification boards. Just brushing up on some
of the basics &ndash; people should remember that they always ask some of the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Martin smiles. "You're pronouncing
it wrong," he said with a friendly smile. "Meta-GEN-etics, instead of
'meta-gen-net-ics.' It's the study of the 'how and why' behind people
developing metahuman abilities. You guys haven't had to study this yet?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>He looked from Tom to Mack; Mack
held his hands up in a friendly gesture. "Hey, I joined the super-powered part
of the Lawndale Legion just today," he said. "I still haven't even really used
my powers for anything big like the others have; I've just done a few tests.

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Martin shook his head. "That's
another thing about you guys that's got everyone all buzzing. Almost all of you
either have powers that are very rare, or you've got power levels that are
higher than almost anyone else who's ever come through here. The power levels
that your friend Daria's putting off... if she were here, she'd be one of the
five most powerful psis to ever go through the program, and the most powerful
female telepath in fifteen years." He reached over for the chocolate Pop-Tart
lying in its wrapper, and broke a corner off before popping it into his mouth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Tom had opened the binder, and
flipped through the first couple of pages. "What's this stuff about 'forms?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"That's how they classify the
way people with metahuman abilities got them," Martin explained, turning the
binder and flipping to a foldout chart. "Form One is people who were born with
their powers &ndash; that's single-generation independent metahuman development.
People born like that are classified as <i>Homo Sapiens Superior</i>, or just <i>Homo
Superior</i>... <u>mutants</u>. Less than one percent of the metahumans known are
classified as Form One."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Form Two is anomalous-catalyst
metagene activation," he continued. "Without boring you to death, about twenty
years ago, they found out that roughly twenty percent of the population has the
potential to have metahuman powers &ndash; that's actually gone up since then. If you
were to grab five people off the face of the planet &ndash; five people at random &ndash; <u>at
least</u> one of them would have what the scientists call the 'metagene' &ndash; a
chromosomal variant that causes metahuman development if the person is
subjected to some form of life-and-death situation, usually involving some form
of chemical or radiation... the ultimate version of the 'fight-or-flight'
reflex. Why do you think World War Three hasn't happened yet, even with the way
America and Russia were at each other's throats in the 1980's? Everyone starts
throwing off nukes, and we'll have a world of metahumans... in a world of
billions of people, we'd have millions of metahumans."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The two Legionnaires looked at
Martin with a bit of shock on their faces, and then Tom looked to Mack. "Sounds
like what happened to you, doesn't it?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Mack nodded numbly as Martin
continued. "Your friends Daria, Jane and Quinn? The legendary 'skunk attack?'
Classic Form Two development &ndash; but considering that Daria and Quinn are
sisters, they might be considered under Form Three, too &ndash; that's linear
generational manifestation. If you have powers, it might be because your
parents had them, or that your brothers and sisters may have them, and there's
a very good chance that your kids will, especially if you and your mate both
do. Ninety percent chance in that case - and even then, they still might have
the metagene..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Mack noticed the look that
passed over Tom's face so quickly that he wiped it from him mind as Martin
spoke. "Then, there's people who got their powers through Form Four &ndash;
radically-induced metagenetic development. Those are the people who were
normal, baseline humans, but they went through some form of procedure to
specifically give them powers. A lot of people mix up Forms Two and Four; what
I just mentioned about specifically trying to get powers is one of the two
differences."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Mack looked up from the chart.
"What's the other?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"People who gain powers that
way wouldn't have survived a Form Two activation incident." He ate another
chunk of Pop-Tart. "Want one? I've got a couple left..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Both declined; Tom noticed a
couple of very pretty women, one in casual attire and another in an Air Force
uniform, sitting with a couple of men in shirt and tie as they enjoyed drinks
as they sat near the surprisingly large stage up front, where a quintet of
musicians were warming up. "They serve alcohol here?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"21 and older &ndash; for the most
part," Martin said, smiling as he remembered how the club was closed for the
night two weeks ago last Saturday; he and the graduating First Class cadets
celebrated the completion of the practical exam portion of their Federal Boards
&ndash; a seven-day, full-power training exercise on the west coast of Ellesmere
Island, in the Canadian territory of Nunavut. "It's actually a nice little club
&ndash; they have live music four nights a week, and some sick person decided that
Thursday night should be 'Karaoke night', so it's usually crowded then... they've
got a serious selection of juices, smoothies and they mix up specialty drinks
that aren't bad..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The cadet sat up a bit
straighter. "You ought to check out a few of the jocks around here," he said,
looking in Mack's direction. "We've got a few sports teams here."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The Legionnaires spoke at the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Nobody's allowed to use their

In the First Academy, there's football, basketball, baseball, soccer, rugby,
and swim teams that compete with other schools &ndash; regular and like ours &ndash; and up
in the Elite Academy &ndash; we've got a few other sports, too. About three years

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"And in the movies &ndash; and in
real life, so to speak," Martin said, a smile on his face. "Yeah, I know that
sounds crazy, but wait until you read the back story on Rowling &ndash; it's the
biggest international government disinformation campaign since the whole <i>Wormhole
X-Treme</i> franchise. You should see the way they tricked out the brooms &ndash; you
haven't lived until you've gone 200-plus miles an hour on a broomstick. Funny
thing &ndash; the teams are usually mostly female..." He turned to face Tom. "You know,
it's kind of unusual to see you getting along so well with Daria and Jane,
after all I've seen of you guys together... in the tabloids, I mean..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>A very curious look went over

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Well, they take a hundred new
students every year &ndash; getting into the Academy is a serious prestige thing, if
you make it through, you can basically write your ticket, career-wise &ndash; you do
six years in the First Academy, and five years in the Elite Academy, including
a year's internship off-campus somewhere... there's about a hundred
special-assignment students in both academies and a hundred or so students from
other nations whose governments sent them ...roughly thirteen hundred students
are enrolled here."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>He looked again at Mack. "You'd
probably like it here, Mack &ndash; Mack, right? You'd probably come in as a Cadet
First Year &ndash; that's a senior in regular high school &ndash; and from what I've seen,
you'd be able to walk onto the football team when they begin summer training.
Then, if you decided that you still wanted a shot at the pros after your senior
year here, getting your powers down solid, they would probably swing you an
appointment to one of the main service academies so you could play on one of
their teams, but doing summer classes here at the Elite Academy as your
internship year. They can be flexible for people here."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Mack sat back in his chair, his

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Tom also looked up as he saw

of the other Legionnaires until last year; you know them and you all like each
other, but you're not part of the team yet &ndash; you haven't made yourself a place
among them. You could do that &ndash; you would be a great asset to the Legion on

wanted to say, if you decide to stay with the Legion... something that most
people don't want to hear. The Legion gets a lot of publicity, and by becoming
a member, you're going to get a lot of it... mainly because you're a
'first-black'. Someday, if you're a Legionnaire and they go public... you're
going to get a <u>lot</u> more. As an Academy student, you'd just be another
potential military officer, or Special Agent, or whatever your fancy carries
you toward &ndash; but where you are now... you're the first Black Legionnaire. For
good, ill, just out of morbid curiosity and as a 'role model' &ndash; people will be watching
you."</p>

Cadets for the next three years, as well as the new fleet of Academy vehicles.
She transmuted four entire banquet tables full of food and about six tables
into pure platinum; the Admiral let her keep her plates, silverware and
glasses, kept one of the turkeys for his trophy room and had the rest melted
down and sold. Things like that happen all of the time &ndash; it's one of the
reasons we have so many things here, because the Academy is mostly
self-sustaining. We don't take in nearly as much government money as you'd
think."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Jane looked over at Leda; even
with the money of Russell Stark, a lifetime of being two steps ahead of bill
collectors had anchored Jane firmly in reality when it came to money- or any
way of getting it. "Has she ever transmuted anything for you?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Leda snorted. "Not <u>for</u>
me, on purpose... it's not that they say you can't use your powers for personal
gain, but they teach us here that if you're always coming up with things to
make money and you can't easily explain where it comes from, people will start
looking for you. They've actually got a class on the subject &ndash; and they say
that it's okay to survive using your powers to make your life easier, but you
need not to attract attention. Hey... they give you money for being in the
Legion, right?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"We get a stipend..." A sudden
stab of guilt flashed through Jane; even though Trent had just gotten a job
with the Legion, she had started paying the bills at the Lane home... and she'd
forgotten all about them for the month. "Why?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Well... let me show you." Leda
slip off her bed and went to her closet; moments later, after opening a small
safe, she turned back with a strange clacking sound in her hand. "Want some
M&amp;M's &ndash; the coolest M&amp;M's you'll ever see in your life?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>She walked over to Jane, and
held up a faded, crumpled one-half pound bag of M&amp;M's, Jane gasped in
surprise as Leda poured nine of the candies out into her hand &ndash; and that they
looked like small, shining baubles in the light of the room. "Three years ago,
just after Rhonda and I had moved in, I'd gone on a trip to town &ndash; okay, I had
a date. I got back, and I found Rhonda raiding my stash of M&amp;Ms &ndash;I'd just
opened the bag &ndash; and I yelled 'GOTCHA!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Leda shook the bag. "She
jumped, screamed &ndash; and transmuted all of the M&amp;Ms in the bag into diamonds.
She said that I could keep them, but it might be a good idea not to go
spreading it around. That's another thing they teach in that class &ndash; it's the
height of bad manners to ask someone with powers like that to help make you
rich. Of course, people help out their friends all the time; you know, everyone
has families, not everyone is rich, and things have been bad overall for a lot
of families &ndash; the war in Iraq and the way the country's going..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>She turned to head back to her
safe. "This is my safety net, in case something very, very bad happens. Between
this and my powers, I'll be able to have a decent life anywhere in the world."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Jane was dumbfounded by the
fact that Leda had left the nine diamond M&amp;M's in her palm. "Um, Leda &ndash; why
are you telling me all about this... and don't you want these back?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"No, those are for you- and I'm
telling you because Daria trusts you... and if she trusts you, then I think I
can, too," Leda replied. "As for those... oh, I've got more than enough. Think of
them as... a gift. Something from a new friend that you can put away for a rainy
day, just in case you, Daria and her sister have to run away again. This time,
you'll have the cash to do it right, and Daria won't be so afraid."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"She let you see what happened
when we ran." Jane's tone ensured that her words were not a question, and Leda
nodded. "Oh."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Just... just take care of her. I

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Get up, Lane," a familiar

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Jane looked inside the bundle,
and her eyebrows rose as she saw that it was one of her Legion uniforms and a
pair of the boots she wore with it. "Good morning, Sgt. Nemec. What's so
special about this?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"They'll explain it to you
later," she said, turning to the door. "It's oh-seven-eighteen. You're expected
in front of the Administration Building at oh-nine-hundred, so if you want an
actual breakfast, I suggest you get moving... or should we go back to Legion
breakfast schedules?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Nemec allowed herself a smile

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Fourteen minutes later, Jane
(dressed in her Legion uniform and getting appreciative glances) walked into
Trueblood Cafeteria &ndash; the smallest of the three cafeterias on the Academy
grounds &ndash; and headed for the twin serving lines when a female cadet about her
age walked in after her and tapped her on the arm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Hello," the girl said, and
Jane took in her appearance; shorter than even Daria, but with butter-blonde
hair and huge, dark-blue eyes flecked with gold, a face and legs that would
have instantly gotten her into the old Fashion Club, and a bosom that rivaled
Brittany's (but firmer, Jane sighed, feeling a bit self-conscious). "Jane Lane,
right? I didn't get to meet you yesterday, but I was hoping... I'm Alison
Cockrum."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>A light went off in Jane's
head. "Hold on... Leda mentioned you last night, I think. She said that you've
got powers like mine." <i>Not to mention what she said about her 'torpedoes'.
Oh, I bet she doesn't need magnetism to attract guys &ndash; and I bet she hates
come-ons like that already.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Yeah, I do," she said,
slightly shyly. "I... ah, I'm really not supposed to be over in here to eat &ndash; I'm
a second-year, and Trueblood's for the Elite Academy and special guests only. I
just wanted to meet up with you and ask you things..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>A tall, stately cadet,
first-class insignia on his lapel and a tray with wheat pancakes and peaches in
his hands, walked up to the two of them. "Cockrum &ndash; you're cute, but you know
that you're not supposed to be here, and you know that you're not supposed to
be trying to get autographs or anything, right?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Jane immediately disliked the
pompous tone in the otherwise handsome cadet's voice, and her dislike
intensified as she saw the way the younger cadet reddened as she snapped to
attention. "Excuse me. I'm having a conversation, and I don't recall asking you
to step in &ndash; so why don't you step off?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The noise level immediately
dampened down in the general area around the two cadets and Jane; the older
cadet looked around and drew himself to his full height as Jane noticed that
they both wore the same braided silver-and-white cord off their left shoulder.
"People under my command are expected to follow my orders &ndash; and I'm giving you
one, Cockrum. Leave."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I see punks are punks even
when they wear nice uniforms and have some rank," Jane said, not backing down
one bit as the cadet looked down on her with the same contempt he would show a
dog vomiting in front of him. "I guess that means that I should address you in
the right manner &ndash; Major Asshole, right?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Alison's eyes widened (even
more than she'd have thought possible, Jane thought) as the older cadet flushed
crimson. "I am Cadet First Class William T. Feltson &ndash; and you will speak to me
with the proper respect. Not everyone here is all starry-eyed over you and your
little club of publicity-hounds... Lane. Some people actually worked hard to get
where they are." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Jane looked at him, then
snorted and turned her back on the cadet. "Oh, <i>screw</i> you-!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>A hand clamped onto her
shoulder, and without thought, a tight, heavy beam of pure magnetic force
speared out of Jane's back and threw William through an ocean of gasps and
cries of surprise as he flew across the full length of the cafeteria and hit
hard against a wall!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"You locked onto the iron in
his blood, put a charge in him and reversed the charge in your own body... and
you did it in a heartbeat," Alison said, looking at Jane with respect. "I can't
do that..." "Well, I'm sure that you can do lots of things that I can't," she
replied. "Come on. I don't think that I want to eat in any place that has him-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Jane turned to see William rise
up from the floor. "If you want to dance - I wouldn't be a gentleman if I
didn't finish out the waltz!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Before she could take another
breath, Jane found herself savagely immersed in a thick, overflowing torrent of
pure sound that seemed to press into her from every single square centimeter of
her body, as if she had suddenly appeared in at the bottom of a giant swimming
pool, but with sound instead of water smothering her, drowning her, crushing
into her, forcing itself down into her throat and driving up into her nostrils...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>It was as if Mystik Spiral had
suddenly hit the opening riff on every single song that they had ever played,
every single time that they had ever played them, and all at once, right
besides her, around and inside her, ripping that single, brutal combined note &ndash;
magnified over and over and tripled again - at a level that seemed to drive it
straight through her eardrums and into her brain-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>William started towards her
when a solid blow to his jaw from off to his left knocked him over a table, and
Jane looked up to see Charles Ruttheimer rubbing his fist as the slightly
taller cadet scrambled to his feet! "Hey, look &ndash; it's the freak geek with the
antennae like a giant mutant cockroach. You don't impress me, either."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Charles' face didn't change
expression as his skin took on a metallic glimmer; six seconds later, William's
jaw dropped as he was staring up at a twenty-five-foot tall, factory-new-and
gleaming blue-with-orange-trim <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:24.0pt'>VFA-6Z
Veritech Alpha Fighter in Battloid Mode... straight from the animated world of <i>Robotech</i>,

added to the braid) walked through the door from which, it seemed, he had seen
