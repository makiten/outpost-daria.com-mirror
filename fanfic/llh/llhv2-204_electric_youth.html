<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;color:#323D4F'>Jen Scotts would have been proud of Quinn Morgendorffer.
They both wore pink as team leaders, instead of the traditional red, and wore
it well. <br>
<br>
<i>Farkas Bulkmeier and Mackenzie Hartford, <b><u>Power Rangers Forever</u></b></i></span><b><i><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Quinn was slightly steamed as
she left her room that morning. She wasn't happy that Sherrie had left without
waking her up &ndash; <i>not that she had to, but it would have been a courtesy,
right? <o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Then, to make matters worse...
she burned out the female cadet's hair dryer. 'Executed' might have been a
better term; a jet of flame a foot long shot out of the front end as Quinn,
without thinking, turned the appliance on and used her own ability to generate
AC electrical output to power the dryer. Her eyes wide, she threw the dryer
straight into the toilet - and cringed at the impressive gush of steam that
rose from the bowl. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>A curse slipping from her lips
that would have made Armalin draw back, Quinn pulled the dryer out by its cord
and winced at the drippings of plastic, metal and water that came from the
totally ruined object. <i>Okay &ndash; no problem... I'll apologize, and I'll buy her a
new one &ndash; I'll buy her a better one, and I'll even offer her a visit to Legion
Tower, and we can give her a tour and a makeover-</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The thought of what Sherrie
would say to the offer of a makeover made Quinn go cold - and she simply dropped
the dryer in the trash. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:162.3pt'>I'll just buy her a new hair
dryer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>She found a fresh Legion
uniform in her colors on the desk, with boots sitting nearby, and wondered
where they came from. <i>I wonder who brought this &ndash; and why they didn't say
anything to me &ndash; I should have been up early anyway, I'm team leader, I need to
find out what we're doing today-<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>She pulled her cell phone from
the desk drawer, and winced as she saw the time &ndash; 8:50. <i>Gawd! They're
probably all wondering where I am, and they've already started the testing that
cadet I met last night mentioned - somebody probably thinks that I've been
messing around and lost track of time, or that I'm doing something stupid &ndash;
Would it have been so hard for her to just say 'Wake up, Quinn?' <o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>Fine. Be rude to me, while
everyone just kisses up to Daria and acts like Upchuck is a movie star. If
people want to treat me like that while I'm here, then okay. I can do that.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>She hit the quick-dial to reach
Sandi &ndash; but the phone immediately went to the 'searching for service'
indicator... <i>Weird,</i> Quinn thought, <i>that I can't get a signal out here &ndash;
it's not like this is a hospital, or I'm underground - why can't my cell phone
work in here?<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>She shrugged, put her
cell-phone in its pocket, and headed out the door. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>*****</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>As Quinn walked down the hall
of the dormitory, the female cadets she passed weren't even pretending to not
snicker at the way her wet hair hung unfashionably limp; a few simply laughed
openly at her, slowly raising Quinn's temper to a level usually seen only in
male Morgendorffers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Where do you think you're
going to school, ladies &ndash; the Laguna Beach Academy for Tanning and Gossip? I've
told you BOTH again and again and again about PROPER DRESS CODES when you're in
uniform!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The catty tone caught Quinn's
attention; she retraced her steps and turned towards the verbal beat-down,
finally arriving to see a trim, red-haired female cadet (her hair was a rich,
dark scarlet tone compared to Quinn's strawberry-blonde) towering over two
younger girls, both probably not even thirteen. "That's twenty demerits each &ndash;
and I want those pins off your uniforms, right now-" The older cadet's glare
followed the suddenly wide-eyed stares of the younger girls directly over to
Quinn. "Oh. It's one of you guys."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The redhead turned fully to
face Quinn and scoffed as she looked her over. "What's wrong? Lost?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Quinn seethed as a long,
perfect finger pointed almost lazily towards a stairwell. "Head down those
stairs and out the door, then turn right and go down three doors. The on-campus
hair-care center is there; they <u>might</u> be able to help you."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Looking from the telltale worn
and practiced look of boredom on the girl's face to the awestruck looks of the
two 'tweens' and the pins on their uniforms (the tiny pins that all National
Legion chapter members wore), Quinn put things together very quickly &ndash;
especially since the pins that the two girls wore were pink with black trim. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>She'd heard that the Laguna
Beach chapter (which was ironic, considering the redhead's comment) had started
making a LOT of money for their charity by selling tiny Legion insignia lapel
pins &ndash; and had come across the fact that a lot of people wanted pins with the
colors of their favorite Legionnaire; they were clearing serious sums by diving
in on this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The two young cadets were
wearing <i>her</i> pins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Quinn looked at the way the
older cadet wore her hair up in a severe styling that held it into place. "With
hair like that - I doubt it." She looked over at the two younger cadets. "Oh,
yeah. I learned that if you want people to actually respect you for more than
just being a higher rank than they are - maybe you should try to treat them
better. Not yelling at them helps."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The cadet scoffed. "You? You &ndash;
trying to talk to anyone about how to lead?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:162.3pt'>All right. With that, you
have all officially gone over the line. I don't care how petty it sounds &ndash; but
if someone shows up at your house, you're supposed to at least treat your
guests decently, right? <u>Fine</u>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Every hair follicle of hair
stood up on Quinn's body as electricity danced and splayed across her form;
miniature spikes and arcs of blue-white lightning played across the tips of her
perfect eyelashes and the tiny, nearly invisible hairs along her ears, fingers
and nostrils as she took a step forward. Several female cadets who'd stopped
for the entertainment took involuntary steps back as the Leader of the Legion
turned up the power and yet kept it perfectly in control, glowing like a
halogen lamp and not letting a single iota of power travel more than a millimeter
from her body...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Quinn motioned to the cadets,
and turned back to their harasser. "You should try that on <u>me</u> sometime."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The thick, tangy scent of ozone
trailing behind her as she walked away with the electrical sheathing still
burning around her form, Quinn didn't notice the wide-eyed looks of the two
young cadets &ndash; or the thoughtful look that passed over the face of the redhead
&ndash; as she walked towards the stairwell.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>*****</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Martin saw the way Quinn
marched out the doorway of Swedlund Hall &ndash; one of the two dormitories for Elite
Academy cadets &ndash; and knew that she was in a bad mood. <i>Yeah, I'd heard that
people were giving her a hard time &ndash; and if they knew what I knew - what she's
been through, so to speak &ndash; they'd cut her a very big break, as well as give her
a lot of space. She's <u>not</u> the one to mess with. <o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Morgendorffer!" Quinn turned,
a scowl on her face as she saw the cadet walking towards her, and stopped to
let him catch up. "You - you don't look happy."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Quinn visibly bit back a
response, but then took several breaths before speaking. "You guys are not nice
people."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I'm sorry," he replied,
sincerely enough so that Quinn's body language relaxed. "I'll speak to people
about that. There's a lot of cadets who have a superior attitude, and if they
read between the lines about you, your sister and your friends, they'd shut up
and treat you better very quickly."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The smile that had conquered
the young men of Lawndale returned, and Martin understood immediately another
reason why a lot of people wanted to think the worst about Quinn Morgendorffer:
<i>Someone this pretty isn't supposed to be smart, or good at anything, or be

Sandi noted), did one-handed push-ups with their left hands (the other hand

it, you'll progress to generate more forms of stellar radiation along the
electromagnetic spectrum: hard radiation in many forms, microwaves, radio
waves, energies in the visible spectrum, as well as the various gases formed
within a stellar mass, but independently of using your flame powers..." The

this is going to be somewhat simple &ndash; to gauge your level of strength, we've
come up with a number of simple and fun tests that most of our cadets with
meta-levels of strength have told us they prefer, rather than simply lifting
free weights or gravity bars," the elderly Black man in the lab coat told him
as they walked into the chamber, where an arm-wrestling table was set up.
"Don't worry &ndash; once the test begins, we'll activate an inertial stasis field in
a sphere beginning two meters from the table. If something happens and you're
flung away at super-speed, the field will capture you and instantly dampen your
inertia, so you won't go flying into a wall."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"What about this?" Tom asked,

taped across the length of his body &ndash; he didn't exactly enjoy wearing only
boxer shorts for the test, either &ndash; that didn't seem to be hooked to the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"That's connected to the 'wimp
button'," a familiar voice said, and Tom sighed as Maryann Lyter, clad only in
a sensible (albeit very tight) one-piece swimsuit (and the same number of
electrodes as he wore), walked in just behind Tom and the researcher.<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Yes, sir, I understand, I'm

and attached the lead into a socket just beneath the table. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Despite Cadet Lyter's colorful
euphemism &ndash; the analogy for what this lead connects you to is correct, Tom,"
the man said. "If at any moment during the test you subconsciously feel that
you're in real danger, your body will put off a specific series of neural impulses
that you probably know from your studies in school as the 'fight or flight
response'. If that happens, the testing system will immediately send out the
proper neural response that will instantly activate what your body will
construe as the specific counter to that response &ndash; in this case, to instantly
activate your invulnerability."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"That also means that your
super-strength goes bye-bye &ndash; and a second or two later, so do you," Maryann
laughed pleasantly; Tom took that moment to notice that the swimsuit was very
tight on her, and the color of Maryann's suit was a powder-blue that almost
shaded into white - and left very little to a young man's imagination. "I won't
laugh at you too loudly. We all go flying, sooner or later."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>They were both quiet for a long

stop sign, a gas pump, a plasma-screen television that was the size of a mobile
home, and 'Iron Eyes' Cody) before Daria turned to Martin. <span

<br>
Martin jumped slightly in his seat, and looked away. "I'm sorry. I'm just not
sure what to talk about."<br>
<br>
"So you have to stare at me instead? Why? Is a third eye showing on my
forehead? Or have you developed x-ray vision and not told anybody yet?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Martin blushed and swallowed hard as he saw the way Daria glared at him.
"Sorry. I wasn't staring at...those."<br>
<br>
Daria sat back in her chair. "O.K. How did you end up playing babysitter for
me? I heard that guy in the lab coat tell David Allen to come up here and wait
with me while they were getting the test machines ready for me, not you."<br>
<br>
"I traded with Farrington. I asked to do this, and he gets my spot on the New
York trip this weekend."<br>
<br>
"Why?" Daria felt she already knew the answer, but she wanted to hear him say
it before she guessed it out loud.<br>
<br>
"Because I get to play babysitter for you."<br>
<br>
Daria sighed and closed her eyes. "Uh...Martin?"<br>
<br>
"Well, Daria... I'll just be direct." <i>Finally,</i> he thought to himself, <i>After
all of this time of seeing her, and being afraid to talk to her, or go near
her, and after all that I've seen of her with my powers...Well, pull pin and
throw. 'Who dares, wins' - as the Brits say.</i> "Are you seeing anyone? If
not, I was thinking..."<br>
<br>
"Martin, I know where you're going with this. But I don't know you and you
don't know me. Besides, the Legionnaires are just guests here. We aren't going
to be here that much longer."<br>
<br>
The boy looked slightly crestfallen. "You already have a boyfriend." He snapped
his fingers once. "Darn. That's just my luck."<br>
<br>
"I didn't say I had a boyfriend."<br>
<br>
"Then, I'm not quite what you're looking for, is that it?" His face fell
further. "You really like Leda, then. I understand-"<br>
<br>
"Will you stop that?" Daria stood up and moved in front of him. "If you keep
putting yourself down, no girl will be interested in you. So stop it!"<br>
<br>
His face registered shock briefly, and then he smiled. "Sorry. That did sound
pathetic, didn't it?"<br>
<br>
"It made you sound desperate. Don't try so hard." She moved to the door, looked
out, and then glanced sideways at him. "You don't believe that - about Leda and
me?"<br>
<br>
Martin rolled his eyes. "Oh, please. Leda jumps at everything, just to get a
reaction." He covered his eyes with his left hand. "She once slipped into my
room, two years back; I'd turned on the shower and went down to Farrington's
room to borrow some shampoo &ndash; when I came back, she was waiting in the shower
for me." He shuddered. "The thought makes me skittish every time I remember it.
I wouldn't look at her in the shower or anywhere else. It wasn't a bad sight at
all, but I don't like being played with."<br>
<br>
"Oh?" she asked. "Who would you rather watch in the shower?"<br>
<br>
"Colonel Cooper," he said without hesitation, then suddenly slapped a hand over
his mouth.<br>
<br>
Daria laughed and smiled, despite herself. <i>It's a pity that Jane wasn't here
to hear this one.</i> "That's an interesting confession. She's kind of young to
be a Colonel... isn't she the Vice Commandant of the Academy?"<br>
<br>
The cadet covered his eyes and nodded briefly.<br>
<br>
"Does she know this?"<br>
<br>
The boy then looked at her, horrified. "Are you nuts? If she didn't kill me
first... no, she'd just kill me! If her husband was still alive, he'd kill me,
too."<br>
<br>
Daria decided to tease the cadet a bit. "A word of warning, Martin. If you find
her in your shower, the steam will probably fog up everything and you won't see
that much. You'll have to feel your way around."<br>
<br>
The look on Martin's face reflected a slight bit of panic. "Please, don't tell
anybody about this. You'll get me in trouble with everyone. They'll think I'm
some sort of pervert."<br>
<br>
"Don't worry," she said. "I'm teasing you."<br>
<br>
He sighed in relief. "Daria, would you at least be willing to be my friend?" He
held out his right hand.<br>
<br>
She took the offered hand and they shook. "Sure &ndash; if you'll stop acting like a lovesick
puppy every time you see me. My friends are having too much fun with that
already."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The lead researcher smiled at
her. "Okay. What I'm going to do is get some things in here, and we're going to
let you see if you can make them invisible. As we go on, the things will get
bigger and bigger, so it might take a bit more work for you, all right? You
might have to concentrate a bit more with the bigger things, but we'll take it
slow and easy, and remember &ndash; this is a test, but it's not a 'test', all right?
You can't fail, so if things don't seem to work like you want, it's still a
good thing, because that means we've found out just what you can and you can't

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Quinn was a little surprised by
the size of the testing area that the very handsome Navy captain in the lab
coat, followed by a trio of equally handsome civilian researchers, led her
into. Lengthwise, it was easily over five times the length of an indoor
football stadium, twice as wide, and had eight other large entranceways leading
inside &ndash; four of them seemingly large enough to drive small airliners through. <i>They've
got the space here &ndash; Gawd, this is so big, it echoes as we walk around!</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"This is Zero Area &ndash; the main
testing area for the Academy campus," the Captain said, and Quinn actually felt
herself with a tiny (<i>okay, MORE than just tiny! -</i> she admitted to
herself) fluttering in her chest every time he looked at her. "This is where we
test the cadets who have the high-level powers &ndash; powers that might cause damage
if they were tested anywhere else. Here, they can cut loose without worry of
anyone accidentally getting hurt."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Walking several feet away from
the cavernous entrance and deeper into the huge artificial canyon that was Zero
Area, Quinn turned back to the Captain when a flash of light made her look up &ndash;
and she saw the faces of numerous cadets looking down at her from the huge
observation gallery thirty feet up! "Why are they all up there?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Well, Miss Morgendorffer &ndash;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I'm sure that there are more
than a few of those up there as well," the Captain told her, and Quinn looked
back at him with a touch of respect. "You wouldn't want me to lie to you, or
treat you as though you were... well, what a lot of them think you are."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The Captain pulled a small
earpiece out of his pocket and inserted it into his right ear, adjusting it so
that the thin microphone lead extended out; he then handed another to Quinn and
watched as she placed it as he had. "Outstanding, Miss Morgendorffer. Today,
we're going to go easy &ndash; just some basic electrical generation and
manipulation; gauging your upper levels, how much you can generate, and how
well you can manipulate the various forms that you can output. Don't worry
about trying to show those cadets up &ndash; the fact that they're so interested in
seeing you fail means that you've already beaten them."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Quinn nodded, and the Captain
walked away, followed by the others. Several seconds later, the lights in the
entire area were activated, and Quinn then saw just how big Zero Area really
was...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>A bad feeling at the base of
her neck (one gained through long years in the battles for social domination at
the schools she'd attended) made Quinn turn around and look up; she saw the
redhead from earlier, the one who was harassing the younger girls, looking down
at her with undisguised disdain. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>A slight crackling of sound in
her ear made Quinn's head bob up. "All right, Miss Morgendorffer &ndash; let's start
the magic. We'll begin with simple AC generation &ndash; let's see how much power you
can put off to power other devices."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>As the Captain's voice came
through loud and clear, a large, metal column with several handholds rose up
from the floor. "This is going to be simple," the Captain continued. "Just grab
onto any two handholds, and when I give you the signal, I want you to
concentrate on putting out as high of a level of electricity as you can &ndash; but
only in AC; we know that you've been working on generating various forms of
electrical output."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Ready when you are," she said,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The column instantly began to
glow with an intense blue-white color as Quinn began to channel her power
through the handholds; seconds later, the column began to blister, and before
long, thin wisps of smoke began to rise from the discoloring spots on the
surface. "Back it down, Morgendorffer!" the Captain's voice came through,
prompting her to stop. "Not bad at all &ndash; you could power a small state if you
wanted!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The obvious admiration in the
man's voice made Quinn smile; she turned to look back up at the redhead, who
made a funny face at her. "Okay, Morgendorffer &ndash; now, a bit of the fun stuff.
See those targets rising up on the other end of the area?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The redhead watched as, roughly
more than five hundred yards away, seven large 'bulls-eye' targets rose from
the ground, each the size of a garage door. "Basic target practice. Let's just
see how good your aim is, as well as your control of your lightning output.
Go!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Before the word left his lips,
six blue-white lightning bolts leapt from Quinn's body to spear directly
through the center of the three targets to the right and left &ndash; converged to
slice the center target apart along the lines of the circles... and then, punched
though the center before it fell to the ground. "Oh, I'm sorry &ndash; did you want
me to hit them one at a time?" she said, her voice oozing sugar and girlish
charm. "Did you want me to point my finger at them? Oh, I don't know what's <i><u>wrong</u></i>
with me, I just don't know <i><u>how</u></i> to follow instructions, I am just
such a <i><u>nitwit</u></i>..."</p>

the redhead, Quinn noted &ndash; with satisfaction &ndash; that the girl was nursing a look
that was somewhere between disbelief and shell shock. <i>Reality. It is a

another pulsing shade of luminosity; a human form composed of light &ndash; no, of

that was incredibly peculiar; as she hovered in the air within what seemed to

back, as far as she could reach, and then whipped her arm forward as hard as

together, and then slowly brought them apart. "B... O... O... M. It looks like she's
launching a quantum torpedo from <i>Star Trek</i> when she does it, so people
call them her-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"That's what Leda was talking
about when she said 'I had to see her torpedoes?'" Jane's eyes were wide as
memory swept over her. "Oh! <u>That's</u> what she meant!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Yeah &ndash; what did you think she
was talking about?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Well, you know &ndash; I thought &ndash; I
mean, Allison's kind of, well, she's really &ndash; you've seen her &ndash; I thought Leda
was saying &ndash; well, you know Leda better than I do, don't you?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Martin was trying not to
snicker as the Morgendorffer sisters looked on, confused. "Jane," Daria asked,
"What the hell are you talking about?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"What she's trying to say is
that, ah, to be polite, that Cadet Cockrum is, well, shall we say-" Martin was
spared further attempts at description by the arrival of Allison at the doors
of the cafeteria, staying outside and waving as she tried to catch Jane's
attention. "Oh, there she is. That's Cadet Cockrum."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Oh," Quinn said, immediately
noticing the size of her bust. "She looks like she'd give Brittany a run for
her money. You said she's got magnetic powers, too? Good. With a set like that,
she'll need her own magnetic field to lower the effect of the Earth's gravity
on her and keep those boys floating like UFO's."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Three cool, yet slightly
surprised gazes fixed on Quinn, who brushed them off. "Oh, please," she said,
snorting at Daria. "You're just surprised that I could say something smart and
catty at the same time. It's a gift." She rose up, and waved the young cadet
inside. "You don't mind if she has lunch with me and Jane, do you, Cadet
Commander Peters? She can tell us all about the school from the cute, powerful
point of view, and you can tell Daria all about that tiny little town of yours.
Maybe, you can talk her into letting you give her a tour of the place &ndash; and you
can show her all of your special hideaways where you take your girlfriends..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Happy laughter flowing behind
her as she went over to meet Allison, Jane shook her head as she picked up her
tray and followed along. "I'd better go and watch over the government's
investment," she said, winking at Daria. "Don't do anything I wouldn't do, <i>amiga</i>
&ndash; well, you haven't gotten close yet!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria blushed as Jane scampered
off, and Martin looked her over before he spoke. "Are they always like that?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Actually, Quinn's being
incredibly cordial &ndash; for Quinn. In her twisted little mind, that means that she
thinks you're okay, and its all right if you try and get on my good side."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"That's some kind of

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Honed through a lifetime of
wallowing through the rivers of the Fashion Underworld," Daria shot back. "She
is my sister, though. I'd miss her if she wasn't around."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I know," Martin said without
thinking, and Daria looked at him curiously. "I mean, it just seems like you
two snipe at one another because you're not the types to do all of that hugging
and kissing stuff."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Okay," she replied. "Back to
you and your big origin story. How'd you end up here?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Well, I ended up coming here
when I was fourteen. Silly story... you remember how you found out about your
powers?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"With me, it turns out that I
actually had my powers a couple of years before I really knew it," he told
Daria. "Ever seen the movie <i>Logan's Run</i>?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Yeah, long ago."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria's right eyebrow rose.
"No. It doesn't exist. Somebody made a soundtrack to that, but it's a fictional
sequel &ndash; I read about that once."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"No, it isn't." Martin smiled
at Daria, and something inside her suddenly went very, very warm... "Want to come
over to the commons area and see it? It'll also let you see what I can do."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>To her great surprise, Daria
heard the word, 'Okay' come from her own mouth; at another table, Jane and
Quinn watched as Martin and Daria rose from their table and headed for the
exit. "Oh, look, our little girl's becoming a woman," Jane smirked, noticing
how Daria seemed to walk a touch closer to Martin than she apparently realized.

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Jane, we must let her go. She
has to spread her wings and fly, or, whatever." Quinn finished her pizza, and
turned back to Allison. "So, really, you've never been on a date? Come on &ndash;
there HAVE to be some cute and rich boys around here in the city, and even
wearing THAT thing, you should be able to attract all of the good ones!"</p>
