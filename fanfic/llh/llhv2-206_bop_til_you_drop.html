<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>The greatest opposition to
the Bowman Acts was embodied in Professor Richard Hiram Blumenburg. A balding,
tiny man of Jewish descent, Blumenburg escaped pre-World War II Europe as a
child in his mother's arms, and was an instinctive scientific genius,
particularly in the area of genetic research. This research led him to a
lifelong career in the United States Government &ndash; and for over two decades
before his death in 2006, the post of Deputy Commandant at the United States
Academy of Extranormal Studies (a prestigious and extraordinary position for a
man who had never served a day in uniform). James Bowman and Blumenburg were <u>not</u>
enemies by any means &ndash; in fact, they were quite friendly in their dealings and
kept in frequent contact, mostly to exchange information to sway the other's
opinion. <o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>Blumenburg firmly believed
that the 'secret' of metahumans should be revealed to the world in general, so
that these people could openly share their abilities for the betterment of
mankind. He wasn't blind to the fact that wrongdoing would occur; it was a
little-known fact that &ndash; while Blumenberg opposed the Bowman Acts in general -
he was the unacknowledged co-author of the Bowman Act of 1982, for both men
shared common ground in what the U. S. Government's disposition on telepaths
should be.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:162.3pt'>What he wanted to see most of
all was to see the day when - as in the comic magazines and literature of his
childhood that featured such heroes as the Justice Guild, the Grey Ghost and
the Flying Moor - a new breed of men and women would rise. A breed above those
in the uniforms of the Armed Forces and the First Responders who serve the
nation; men and women who would also serve as symbols that spoke to the best of
the human condition, and inspire others to see beyond the trivialities that man
always found to deem more important than joining together to make the world a
better place for all. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>Roughly ten years before he
passed away, Professor Blumenburg took an extraordinary interest in several
cadets in that year's incoming class at USAES, and personally saw that they
were all placed into a single cadre. He closely monitored and tailored their
studies, activities and even social habits; he made himself available to that
cadre in such a way that - on several occasions - he received formal reprimands
on the grounds that his tutelage might be interfering with the indoctrination
that was required of future U.S. military officers and law-enforcement
personnel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also interesting to
note from his diary entries that the last trip he ever took was to a suburb of
Baltimore, Maryland, one cut short because his host (who was never named in his
journals, but was apparently a man with superior connections within the
government and possessed of incredible wealth) took his leave in order to
travel to Los Angeles<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&ndash; and that the
subject of discussion was Academy Training Cadre 2996.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>The events that occurred
from 2006 to 2008 were therefore not unexpected. Even with the fact that all of
them went on to careers and lives of great renown, the cadets who were
informally known as 'The Alliance' would always feel (on some level) that <u>they</u>
were the bastard children, hidden away from the world while the members of
Legion Chapter Number One (Lawndale, Maryland) received the adulation,
trappings and legitimacy of being the publicly recognized heirs to the legacy
of Russell Stark's dream for a better world. Even so, those ten cadets served
as pallbearers at Blumenburg's funeral at Arlington National Cemetery, never
spoke ill of him or his teachings, and most followed his dream into
distinguished service as members of the <u>Eagle Guard</u> and <u>Strikeforce;
America</u> &ndash; the American government's premiere metahuman operations groups of
the 21<sup>st</sup> Century.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>There was, of course, one
exception to that group of cadets &ndash; the one who went on to become a Legionnaire
herself. </i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Very few cadets missed seeing
the now legendary 'Legion vs. Alliance' fight in person. It didn't make that
much difference, since everyone was eager to give his or her first-hand
accounts of the battle. Plus, the video is awesome. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The young man hesitated just
for a moment before pressing the small cybernetic device, shaped roughly like a

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The sensation passed, and
Graham turned slowly to the video camera positioned next to his laptop
computer. "<i>Trans-Human Anatomical Resequencing Optimizer-Cybernetic</i> test
run &ndash; fourth attempt," he said. "As my records show, I've used the prototype
three times before. Test One was two nights ago, on a fifty-four year old
African-American homeless man from Oakdale, who was suffering from an advanced
form of Wilson's Disease and also had his right arm amputated just below the
elbow. Test Two took place yesterday morning, on a forty-nine year-old morbidly
obese woman living in Lawndale who has a history of sleep apnea and <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>hypoglycemia</span>. Test Three took place
last night, on a forty-two year-old woman of Korean-American descent in the
long-term, secure-care section at the Adelaide Gardens Convalescent Center who
is suffering from a condition resembling <span lang=EN style='mso-bidi-font-size:
7.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN'>Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, but seems to have a
genetic/hereditary factor involved. I chose all three at random, and paid off
the appropriate people for access to the three subjects and transfer to a
secure location for the purpose of the test. Money hasn't been a problem in the
last week."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-bidi-font-size:
7.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN'>He paused for a moment, and continued on. "The
tests on all three subjects were successful. All subjects were completely cured
of their conditions, and the prototype worked perfectly in that it restructured
their physical forms to anatomically-perfect human specifications &ndash; age, early
twenties." <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN style='mso-bidi-font-size:
7.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN'>Graham smiled. "After successful completion of the
tests, I released each of the subjects back into their lives. Each subject was
also given a series of subconscious behaviorial modifications &ndash; in case I need
them again &ndash; as well as... specific mental and physical enhancements necessary to
allow them to find the necessary resources needed to re-integrate themselves
successfully into society, and a special submolecular information device to
allow them the knowledge to use their new abilities. The test is ongoing."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and set the glass back on its coaster. "I have just placed the new version of
the <i>THAROC</i> device on myself; the device has locked in place, and the
readings show that all neural connections to the device are secure &ndash; everything
is locked at ninety-seven percent or higher. The transformation will take place
when I give the mental command. With the prototype, the transformation took
almost one hour to complete; with the system upgrades and the modifications
that I've made to the on-board replication suites in the nanite, I estimate
that the entire sequence should take less than five minutes, with a significant
reduction in the level of... discomfort sufffered by the subjects in the past

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Stacy suddenly had an
uncontrollable urge to wiggle her fingers; as she flicked her fingers outwards,
ten slender blades of solid green energy flashed away from her hands, spiraling
outwards in every direction and somehow, leading the force-charges away in
their wake! "Oh, wow," she said, the air behind her suddenly coming to life
with a curtain of multi-colored explosions as the blades and the force-charges

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>In one fluid movement and
without a word, Sandi triplicated as she drew her PFT and slid the power

flew out of Sandi's hand to fly into the mirror pool, now awash with waves from
the rain of cobblestones, dirt, wood and concrete from moments earlier. "Right

spider-webbed with cracks. Fire hydrants, street signs, trees, traffic signals
