<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Well &ndash; that was interesting,"
said Admiral Martin Harriman as he turned slowly in his chair, briefly looking
over the clipboard with several sheets of paper attached. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"May I make a recommendation
before you begin to jump down the collective neck of your cadets?" Colonel Kyle
Armalin asked, watching the expression on his friend's face for a few moments
before speaking. "You've probably already received some blistering feedback on
their actions."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"You could say that. The
President's National Security Advisor is screaming bloody murder &ndash; despite
almost thirty years of USAES students, apparently this was the first time she
ever bothered to watch a simulation. The sad thing is that this was a basic
urban combat scenario - no personal armaments or armor for the cadets,
equally-matched forces, no aerial or ground units - the people whining about
this would probably soil themselves if they saw the real-life 'Midway' scenario
we run the graduating ground-pounding cadets through. Just the number of
Cyberroid AI combat units alone would freak her out; since we program in
35-to-1 ratios, depending on the number of cadets in the program, we've had
times where we've thrown over three hundred Cyberroids at them."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"You tell that ultraliberal bi-
please tell the National Security Advisor that we're running a <i>military
installation</i> that's supposed to turn out members of the Armed Forces of the
United States of America, not tour guides who use stern language and wear silk
gloves when they direct the bad guys to the location of the high-security vault
and the bedchambers of the President's twin daughters," Armalin snarled. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The last few members of the
USAES staff that had delayed leaving after the scenario exchanged curious
glances, noticing how Armalin used the term 'we're' instead of 'you're', and
then began to file out. "You've been quiet through all of this, Mr. Luthor,"
the Admiral spoke up, addressing the tall, handsome man sitting in the front
row &ndash; the only person besides them still in the theatre. "Opinions?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"The scenario looks vicious,
inhuman and cruel," Lionel Luthor said, turning to face the two officers.
"Inform the National Security Advisor that effective military training usually
is &ndash; <i>that's why it works</i>. We put your people through the worst
imaginable now, so they can deal when the real thing hits them later."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"LuthorCorp is the provider for
our VR tactical simulation systems," the Admiral explained to Armalin, all
three men rising as Lionel smoothed out his beard walked over. "Lionel Luthor -
Colonel Kyle Armalin."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"We've met - a martial arts
competition in Seoul," Lionel said, shaking hands. "The Colonel makes quite an
impression &ndash; especially with the <i>kodachi</i>."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I remember that you walked
away with a respectable ranking yourself," Armalin allowed. "Your son's doing
well, I trust?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Yes, he is," Lionel said. "I
spoke with Miss Elliot in Washington last night and she mentioned this, so I
flew in to see for myself. You've done some wonderful work with those kids, by
the way, Colonel &ndash; but you know that Elliot and her ilk are not happy about the
use of metahuman assets. They prefer their weapons to be less capable of
personal opinion &ndash; and to be secured in ways and places that they can control
completely. That's why the current administration hasn't been as, shall we say,
open with the purse strings as they could be."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The Admiral turned to Armalin,
who turned to him with a questioning glance. "We've had to become more
self-sufficient than one would expect of a federal military academy &ndash; the
appropriations bill for USAES ran into problems in committee last year," he
agreed. "Still, this will just give her a bit more to harp upon."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Oh, and she will," Lionel
said, sipping from his glass of ice water. "I particularly enjoyed her comment
on &ndash; how did she phrase it? <i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>- </i>the
way USAES<i> 'is nothing more than a cross between a government-funded 'Animal
House' and a Saturday-morning cartoon stuck out in a cornfield masquerading as
a military academy, with a bunch of oversexed, overpowered and under-managed
children who lack the necessary discipline and oversight required to ensure
that their abilities are directed in the proper fashion for the good of the
country.</i><i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:#323D4F'>'</span></i><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:#323D4F'>"</span><i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"You see, this is the problem
with civilians who don't like the military but have power over it," the Admiral
growled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Elliot ignores the research
benefits and practical applications that have come out of Academy cadets &ndash; both
on studying and training them <i>and</i> the <u>warehouses</u> of technology
they've developed here &ndash; but can't wait to leap on anything remotely negative
that happens. Also &ndash; point out to me a crop of normal, healthy teenagers of
both sexes kept in close quarters within a high-stress, physically challenging
environment who <u>aren't</u> thinking about sex, no matter how
well-disciplined they are, and I'll point you towards a funeral home that gives
great volume discounts."</p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:162.3pt;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:
0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Armalin scowled as he spoke.
"The way she phrased that, one could wonder why you don't have a pregnancy
problem here."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"That's because we address <i>that
issue</i> right off," Admiral Harriman said bluntly. "<u>Every</u> cadet coming
into the USAES First Academy takes a <u>mandatory</u> one-semester course in
human sexuality as a fourth-year or in their first semester - and we sugarcoat <u>nothing</u>.
They take a one-month refresher course during their first semesters as Second
Years and as Cadets Fifth Class in the Elite Academy - we provide birth control
<i><u>with no questions asked</u></i> - and we've gone above and beyond in
providing discreet, absolutely confidential medical care and counseling for
cadets on the issue." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Nevertheless, Admiral &ndash; you do
not have a friend in Naomi Elliot," Lionel said. "I would take great care in
dealing with her, for she would like nothing more than to shut your Academy
down, or better yet &ndash; put it under the control of persons who believe as she
does. This episode does not help your cause any; as a friend of mine is fond of

National Security Advisor that if she wants to tell you how to train your

plush chair, and get out here to actually spend time on the campus learning

gets worse. It seems that there are a number of - certain people -who
resoundingly approve of Farrington's actions, especially your old friend
Bakeson. He's already put in a request that, upon their graduation next year,
Farrington and Robertson be assigned to his personal staff in D.C. as his
personal pilot and staff medic."</p>

comment. "-And if not for the fact that we've both been around, well, a
telepath or two that's taken a few steps over the line. This kid isn't like you
were, Kyle. He's a nice kid, and the government's put far too much of an

double major in pre-med and aeronautics. Here's my problem - he stomped on a
group of civilians. If he'd plowed through another group of cadets like that,
everyone would mark it down as a learning experience, and the other group would
probably work on anti-psi measures, come up with new tactics, and go up against
them again. That's the funny thing; if this had happened against anyone other
than the Legion &ndash; it would probably be the beginning of another team, because
they'd want to work together to beat <i>'The Alliance'."</i> The Admiral
stretched a bit. "So, that's what Richard was going for by having those kids
together for all of those years. He was creating a group like the Legionnaires...
a decade earlier."</p>

"Everything up to that kiss was all him &ndash; but afterwards... well, you know that
telepaths and illusionists can enter VR and work with it as if it's actual
reality, and because of your electric Legionnaire, the scenario was far
different than usual. They had to exponentially expand the parameters of the
simulation to allow for Morgendorffer to absorb power from the Earth's magnetic
field &ndash; in fact, you might want to speak with her about not doing that in real
life. As for Farrington - in a regular VR run, he wouldn't have been able to go
all out like that. He'd <u>try</u> &ndash; he's a stubborn kid who doesn't like to

all of the <i>Alliance</i> girls shuddered as one over that thought. "Man, you
guys are lucky," Lindy told them. "The Professor wouldn't let us do pool
therapy for the first week of our VR training, and for the rest of our first
year, we only got a third of the time in the pool that anyone else did.
Building up our endurance, in case we have to do a session somewhere else and
get no therapy afterwards &ndash; there's reports of some people being interrogated
in VR and subjected to serious physical torture - and then being left to go
through the spasms in real life afterwards. We've logged far more time in VR
than almost anyone else around here who isn't a cyberpath; most cadets do the
required semester of VR training and then stay away from it like the plague."</p>

"Everyone in <i>The Alliance</i> has had <i>six</i> years of VR training," she
said, swimming past as she did a perfect, lazy backstroke. "The Professor
started us in VR training as third-year cadets. He got into trouble for it when
we were First Years &ndash; some brownnose navy commander found out and reported him.
Turned out that he was a bad guy himself, and only found out because he was
swiping VR data records of all of the cadets, their powers and training

her from a distance, she wouldn't have taken out you or your teammates. Refer
again to number one. Four &ndash; your wanting to prove yourself in single combat
against an opponent is and should <u>always </u>be a secondary concern to your

misfortunes of another person because of a preconceived notion which is
actually based in hard, cold factual reality, I would consider, if I were you,
that one - you were bitch-slapped down a street. Two &ndash; you were dropkicked
across a river. Three &ndash; in the greatest tradition of Jackie Gleason, you were
literally punched to the moon. If it were not for that one spectacular punch of

You and Griffin should work more with the idea of her replicating you in
battle; you don't seem to have a psychological problem with being replicated,
and your 'doppelgangers' all work in harmony. I especially liked how you used
that building to your advantage, and while potentially messy, that tactic with
the trinary magnetic fields was very effective against your hostile &ndash; even more
so when considering that you were not only able to think that up in the midst
of combat, but that you were severely injured when you did it. Had you been
wearing a uniform when you pulled that off, I would now be recommending you for
a Bronze Star. If you were a cadet here, I would probably be presenting you

individual critiques of your performance with the Legionnaires, and in

for you, too. As you both found out today, just because your powers allow you a

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>John Dynell turned from his
dinner companions as Michael Baker came to the door of the quaint dining room
of his penthouse; excusing himself, he rose and followed his subordinate out of
the room. "Sir, I thought you should know that the video of the Legion combat
simulation is ready for your viewing."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I can watch that tomorrow." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Dynell's irritation was
beginning to pour from him with tangible force, until Michael continued. "The
Legionnaires had an encounter with Farrington's son in the simulation."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>An eyebrow raised in interest.
"They sent Blumenberg's trainees in?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The look of interest spilled
down across Dynell's face. "The Legion won?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Interest turned to disbelief.
"They won. They defeated - against <i><u>Farrington's</u></i><u> </u>son?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"No, sir &ndash; not exactly. It
appears that the young man wasn't fond of the attitudes some of the
Legionnaires had expressed towards him &ndash; and he made them aware of his
displeasure in a most forceful and... <i>creative</i> manner. If his team leader
hadn't ordered him to stand down, he would have-" The young man felt bile rise
up in his mouth. "It's on the tape, sir. Apparently, he's been disciplined for
his actions."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>William Appleton set the phone
receiver down, and let off an aggressively offensive comment directed at his
nephew's girlfriend before he reached over and took a long pull from his glass
of Irish whiskey. "Shame I didn't see her first &ndash; I'd have taught the bitch
some manners."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The Chief Financial Officer of
Appleton Industries finished his drink and looked over towards the window of
his bedroom, impatience on his face. "And where the hell is she? She's supposed
to have been here fifteen minutes ago!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The phone on his nightstand
rang, and he picked the receiver up to bellow into the mouthpiece. "WHAT DO YOU

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>His hair-trigger temper cooled
immediately. "Oh, yes, yes. Sorry. 'Darren's latest bed warmer's been a bit of
a pain. Yes, I know. That's the thing with women like that; they fail to
realize that the sun does not rise and set between their thighs-" He listened
to the speaker on the other end. "Of course &ndash; if you tell them that and put it
that way, they run to get in the bed!"<br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>William laughed. "Look, I need
you to send your friend down to deal with the girl. No, not eliminate her &ndash;
have your friend 'glamour up' again and break it off with her, so she'll stop
bugging us about the boy! Yes, he can sleep with her all he wants while he's
there &ndash; he's been doing that as 'Darren' for the past year, right? - As long as
he makes sure the breakup's so painful that the girl will NEVER want to see him
again. The <i><u>real</u></i> Darren's still in a coma from being exposed to
that mutated skunk's spray last year &ndash; no, we haven't been able to figure out
how to revive him."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The sound of the window opening
drew William's head around. "I have an important matter to attend to. Call me
tomorrow evening."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>William put the phone receiver
back; he then reached into the top drawer of the nightstand and drew a small
hard-shell case from within before he turned back to stare directly at the
window. "I'm waiting..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>As he spoke, a shape seemed

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The tiny feet of a young woman
touched the floor. "Good evening, Fran," he said, his aggressive, brutish
personality rising up as he saw the petite, delicate young woman turn her face
away from him. "Did you do as I asked?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The young woman nodded, trying
to keep her face hidden. "Yes. I got inside Legion Tower and loaded the program
into their computer &ndash; just like you told me to."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>She went to William, who took a
syringe and a vial of a milky, violet-colored fluid from the case. He filled
the syringe as the girl knelt in front of him, and she gasped in pain as he
injected her in the back of the neck. "It's done," he told her, replacing the
items in the case. "Go see for yourself."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The light in the adjoining
bathroom flicked on as the girl entered and looked at herself in the mirror;
she flinched as she looked over the heavily scarred side of her face, and a
sense of wonder filled her soft gray eyes as the scars began to unknot, filling
in and smoothing out, restoring a gentle, wonderful color to her complexion as
her face was completely healed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Stop being so infatuated with
yourself &ndash; I'm doing this for me," William's voice barked from the direction of
the bed. "I'm not sleeping with the child-bride of Frankenstein. Just remember
&ndash; the Cinderella drops only last for eight hours. Now, come to bed."</p>

into the mirror at the gently attractive face she now wore; her<span

the image looking back at her. "I'm sorry," she whispered. "If I knew how... If I
