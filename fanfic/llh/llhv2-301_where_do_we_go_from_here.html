<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Hi, diary! It's been three
weeks since I've had a chance to write anything &ndash; we've been at the Academy
learning about our powers. You should see what Quinn does with her powers NOW-!
We've been having lots of fun with the cadets - Jeffrey's so cute, and his arms
are SOOOOOO big-! He doesn't even mind if I'm taller than him&ndash; he's 5'5 &ndash; and
some guy at the House of Blues (we snuck off to Chicago to go clubbing &ndash; don't
tell!) was teasing him. He told the jerk 'it's not the size of the dog in the
fight, but the size of the fight in the dog.' The guy left us alone. Hee-hee!
Oh, yes. Four words &ndash; 'The USAES Commencement Ball.' You should have seen us
dressed up &ndash; you should have seen Mack and Charles in their evening suits! Who
knew the Colonel could dance like that? </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:162.3pt'>There's all sorts of new
stuff in the Tower now, and it's SO COOL!! The <u>government</u> came in while
we were gone &ndash; they sent <u>lots</u> of engineering and computer majors from
the Academy (one of the girls said it's part of some' financial aid program'
they're in., There's another pool &ndash; it's one of those TIDE-pools, just like the
ones they have at the Academy &ndash; and we got a VR simulator to go with it. (The
Colonel says it's cheaper, takes up less space and is easier on the scenery
than a 'Danger Room'. Wonder what that is?) They did LOTS of work under the
Tower, along with the people from Quest International &ndash; there are a couple of
new sub-levels, and the bottom one is so HUGE!</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Tiffany left for the Academy
today - and Sandi's thinking about going, too. (They made her an offer &ndash; Mack,
too, but he said no &ndash; and they want Sandi to be a <u>Phantom Eagle</u>!)<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's almost like a trade, because Julia
Carlyle &ndash; she's the one with the <u>wings</u> &ndash; they want her to be a
Legionnaire! Daria, Quinn and Jane (they're the Committee on Standing Matters)
said they'd think about it (especially since Julia's eighteen). From the way
Julia acts (when David Allen's not around, mostly) &ndash; it'll be like Sandi never
left, if she goes. Daria said that she can <u>already</u> see how Julia and Quinn
are going to be jockeying for the number one spot &ndash; or that they'll both just
walk into the room and expect everyone to just know that they're the one with
the scepter. Well, they call Julia 'Duchess', and Quinn's always been treated
like she's the Queen of Lawndale High... well, before it blew up. I've got a
feeling they'll become best friends &ndash; so, what happens to me? At least Julia's
nice to me, and she seems like she'll miss her friends in The Alliance... if she
joins, it'll be the first time she's been away from them for a long time since
she was little, except when they all had to go off by themselves, for all of
last year. From what Jeffrey told me, Julia didn't take it well when their
Admiral asked her to come here. I think Daria will have problems with Julia &ndash;
and I also think that Julia likes Charles. Not crushing hard or anything like
Langston was, but she still likes him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Mack's been spending a lot of
time with Jodie since we got back &ndash; no, he hasn't told her about his powers.
You probably heard how Jodie's dad became Mayor &ndash; well, the word's out that
he's about to resign. Tom and Charles were talking; Tom said that <u>EVERYBODY</u>
is trying to get in good with Mr. Landon because of something new with his
folding cups &ndash; and he's going to make BILLIONS and BILLIONS and BILLIONS of
dollars from it. The people from McDonalds went to see him last week &ndash; Tom said
they wanted him to give them the rights to the new cup, and tried to get tough
&ndash; but he laughed them out of his house, and told them that they'd now have to
pay TRIPLE what <u>everybody</u> else would have to pay to use it... for the
first year, of course. After that, he'd have the entire world by the &ndash; well,
you know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mack brought Jodie over and
she mentioned that her dad finally became a member of that country club he
always wanted to be in. It was sad, though &ndash; a couple of days later, the place
burned down while the Board of Directors was having a meeting. It was on CNN
how the fire got all but one of them &ndash; Tom's dad was out of town&ndash; and it spread
so fast that they never had a chance. Something else happened that was weird.
Jodie &ndash; well, she's always been smart &ndash; she heard two of the instructors and
Sergeant Nemec talking about working a math proof.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I didn't know that the Sergeant was that smart (turns out that
she's got a couple of degrees in math, but she likes being a 'gropo' - what's
that? - and that's why she didn't become an officer) but Jodie listened to them
talk for a minute, then went over to the table, borrowed a pen and wrote
something out on an instructor's sketch pad. The Sergeant and one of the
instructors just stared at Jodie &ndash; and the other one had to run to the
bathroom. Spooky.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Charles' parents were waiting
for us when we got back, along with the police and a couple of FBI agents &ndash; his
mom couldn't let go of him, she was crying so hard... They knew that he was
alive, but not much else &ndash; until somebody showed them the 'Val' issue with
Charles in it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Colonel and Miss
Hall took everyone into his office, and they talked for about an hour before
they came out, and that was that.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Charles' dad &ndash; Eeewwww.
Remember what I wrote about Charles long ago - how he was always trying to hit
on every girl he saw? Now I see where he got it. He was looking all of us girls
over (you <u>know</u> what I mean), and he was REALLY looking at Daria,
Brittany and me &ndash; he saw the pictures of us. Everyone was so blown away by
Daria's pictures that nobody really mentions Brittany; she had her hair down
and it actually looks better. Not so much like a bimbo &ndash; when she doesn't have
her eyes open so wide and doesn't speak, she's got a Jeri Ryan thing going on.
Not that I was looking at her like that. I mean - I wasn't looking at her like
that. Besides, if I was, I think short hair looks better, along with a hard
body, a <u>really</u> flat tummy and boobs that aren't so big, but really firm
- you know, somebody like that Maryann girl in The Alliance. Wow... I mean &ndash; if I
was looking at <u>girls</u> like that. I'm not looking. Really. I'm not.
Anyway, Brittany looks better with her hair down.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I heard Daria and Jane talking later &ndash; thank you, enhanced
senses! &ndash; And Daria said that he was thinking about the three of us at his
place in the mountains, and all of us- Eeewwww. She said that he couldn't stop
thinking about what he wanted to do with me. Eeewwww. ) He made a mean comment
on how Charles 'actually looked like a man now' &ndash; and I HEARD him ask Charles
'how many of us he'd been porking'. EEEWWWW. Charles looked at him, and then -
just walked away. It made his father so mad, because I suppose he expected
Charles to tell him all sorts of stories about what he did with us girls &ndash; '
like the ones I've always told you!' Later on that day, I had to give Charles a
little kiss on the cheek for that. Jeffrey told me about what Charles said to
him and Ian, not to mention how Charles stood up for Jane in the cafeteria when
that Phantom Eagle got fresh with her.</p>

know she's <u>still</u> a hard case &ndash; a couple of weeks back, she took a girl

homework for a week. One of the asshats on the team got his score reduced by a
grade for 'misusing ellipses.' Man, he's strict! Almost makes me glad for when
they open the new Lawndale High and she goes back to being principal. Shame
I'll have graduated by then."</p>

screwing me and the rest of the guys in her class over," Mack said. "Even
though we all knew the stuff because we had to or she'd scream at us, that
psycho gave us all bad grades in her science classes that screwed our
transcripts &ndash; and it turns out that we're actually ahead of the stuff they're
teaching at Carter County! The thing that really sucks is that all the guys who
she screwed over applied for grade changes, using out tests as proof that we
know the stuff &ndash; but because she went and got herself nuked, they said that they
can't change the grades because they have to assume that she was giving us the
appropriate grades." He shook his head. "Boom. I could always go to the
Academy, but that means that I'd be working for the government for the next
twenty years or so, or going into the service. I don't know exactly what I want
to do yet, especially now, with these powers, but I don't want to lock into

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Charles passed a plastic dinner
plate with two cheeseburgers and a healthy serving of fried potatoes over to
Mack. "Anyway, Ms. Li heard about the GED, went to the Board of Education and
had them change that over to a diploma &ndash; for Daria and Jane, too. They're
giving them to us next week at the graduation ceremony at CCHS - oops. I guess

Jodie's <u>in</u> the graduating class... and I'm supposed to be." He looked down
at his plate and sighed. "They made her 'co-valedictorian'; the girl who would
have been CCHS valedictorian was actually a quarter of a point behind Jodie,
but people were saying that it wouldn't be fair for either of them to be
cheated out of the number one spot, since they would both have had it free and
clear at their own schools if Lawndale High hadn't gone 'boom'. They're giving
us former Lions LHS diplomas instead of CCHS &ndash; they decided that, because of
the time of the year when the school got it, we were going to be seniors, so
asking us to be considered Jaguars wouldn't be fair to us. They're going out of
their way 'to be fair'. When it doesn't mean admitting that they allowed
someone to be unfair for her entire career, that is. "</p>

the night sky with an ease that Quinn &ndash; although she hated to admit it &ndash; was
slightly jealous of. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Not even Tom or

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Quinn watched as Julia let her
wings flutter a bit, then folded them close to herself as she started towards
the Legionnaire. <i>Well, she's been flying almost all of her life &ndash; of course

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Don't worry &ndash; you'll be flying

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I was curious," Julia
admitted, her wings fluttering a touch; she reached out and picked a tiny
pebble from between several feathers in her left wing. "Ow... I hate that. That's
the fifth time I've gotten a rock in there since I've been here. Putting your
HQ in a quarry? God... couldn't you guys at least dump a few metric tons of dirt
around the place, throw down some grass, put in a fountain so there's the sound
of running water, put a couple of trees and a bench or two in - and make a
little nice little pocket park?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Piece of advice, then," Quinn
exhaled, motioning towards the beautifully manicured circle of lawn Legion

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Ignoring the dig, Julia walked
in a slow circle as she let her wings extend to their full width, and a small
cloud of dust swept past Quinn's ankles. "I guess I'm a bit spoiled, with the
excellent landscaping on the Academy grounds."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Julia turned, the look on her

comment; the look went away as quickly as it appeared. "Yeah." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>She walked up to Quinn. "I saw
what you did for that little boy at the hospital. That was... that was decent.
It's not what &ndash; you know, I don't know how to describe you. You're supposed to
be a ditz, but you can think on your feet <u>and</u> you're crazy about shoes.
They said that you're not supposed to be that tough &ndash; but you went one-on-one
with David Allen... and that's saying something."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Julia ignored the comment. "You
were listed as the number two of your club in high school, but from what we
heard, you were really in charge &ndash; you just knew that it's better to let
someone else be up front and take the heat. That shows brains."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I thought that you thought we

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Julia thought for a moment; she
pulled a packet of spearmint chewing gum from a pocket of her <i>Alliance</i>
jacket, and offered Quinn a stick before slipping one in her mouth and chewing
slowly. "As competition... we were told to take out Grif- <i>Sandi.</i>" She was
still getting used to addressing the Legionnaires by their first names. "We
were told to get Sandi and Tiffany first, before anyone else. Stacy took me out
without my even seeing her, and she managed to evade David Allen in the air.
He's a hell of a flier and our heavy artillery, and he didn't take her down &ndash;
well, she managed to keep him interested enough so that he didn't just blast
her out of the air, like he was supposed to. As for you... like I said,
one-on-one with David Allen. That's a resume credit."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Quinn smiled at Julia's
comment. Julia continued to speak. "As people &ndash; I don't know you yet, just like
you don't know me. All I know about you is what you let me see, and vice versa
&ndash; and what I saw tonight told me a lot. You can be a bitch, Quinn, if you have
to, and sometimes because you can be &ndash; but you care about people, too."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>They were both silent; Julia
glanced off into the distance, where she could see the three male Legionnaires
sharing a sweet potato pie. <i>Eating it with their hands. Boys! Use a saucer
and a fork &ndash; that's what those opposable thumbs are for!</i><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Oh &ndash; what am I doing here <u>now</u>,
halfway across the country from the Academy?" Julia's wings gently fluttered as
she shrugged her shoulders. "School's out for the spring semester &ndash; they're
doing 'special entry' students now, like your friend Blum-Deckler, so they can
spend a few weeks getting used to the place without much pressure before the
summer session kicks in... and that's stress in spades. I don't even want to
think about what's going to happen to them all come second week of June &ndash;
that's the start of the 'Summer of Light'. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Quinn gave her a questioning
look, and Julia continued to speak. "Summer session for cadets - Second Years
and Fourth Class - is mandatory; eight weeks when they throw <u>everything</u>
at you. Literally. Advanced survival training, your first solo and cadre
full-power, live-fire tactical exercises, our major comprehensive exams on all
of the major subjects, individual and cadre psych evaluations, our individual
metahuman ability development boards, which includes our metagenics
comprehension and usage examinations &ndash; written, orals, practical applications
trials and the active/passive defenses exam &ndash; basically, if you survive, you
pass, you don't, you fail. Not even remotely as easy as it sounds. Oh, yeah...

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The taller girl brushed a lock
of hair from her eyes. "Think of all of the stuff I've just mentioned. It's
really, really hard work, it's demanding physically and mentally, you're <u>always</u>
kept at a high level of stress, and they find ways to keep you going
constantly, to see just how far they can take you &ndash; then, they push past it.
You'll always be tired, you'll never have enough time to do anything &ndash; and your
body keeps reminding you that you have to sleep. You'll barely have enough time
to close your eyes. That's why they call it that. It's designed specifically to
wash cadets out of the program."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Quinn gave her a curious gaze.
"What happens to the cadets who wash out?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Julia shrugged. "The ones who
may actually be worthwhile someday go to the SSC in Georgia and might get to
come back to the Academy. The others get sent to NCO Special Powers Training at
Camp Gregory in Alaska or Tolnai Air Force Base in Puerto Rico. The <u>real</u>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>She looked around the area, as
if she were looking for prying eyes; Quinn decided not to ask. "Anyway, I went
home to see my family in upstate New York for a while, and I thought I'd swing
by to say 'hello' before I did the official 'checking in'. I saw you heading
off all sneaky-like, so I thought I'd follow along... you know, see what kind of

shrieking rang out faintly from the campsite, followed by a sudden flash of
yellow flame. "That second pie never had a chance," Julia giggled, and Quinn
stared at her with a touch of confusion as the taller redhead turned to her.
"An offshoot of my sonic powers allows me to throw my voice to anywhere I can

those handicapped bars the people who used to live there put on the walls in
there. I almost went blind. It's a wonder we don't have a houseful of brothers

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"No &ndash; I like boys." Quinn
looked at her closely. "Why? What did you hear? I didn't do anything &ndash; well,
nothing anyone else wouldn't, and it's not like other people haven't played
'spin the bottle' at a sleepover and it's not really like you really are, you

refresher courses that you take at the start of your first semester as a Second
Year, as a Fifth Class and as a Second Class." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>She stopped and shuddered as
memories filtered back through her mind. "By the seventh week of the course,
you'll wish you'd never even <i><u>heard</u></i> of puberty. Thursdays are the
worst. During the even-numbered weeks, they show - <i>films</i>. <i>You <u>WILL</u>
blush.</i> During the odd-numbered ones... mandatory group round-table
discussions on current topics related to human sexuality. The year I took the
class, the topic the instructors started off discussing &ndash; I forgot to mention,
they teach the class in teams of two, it's a way to protect everyone involved &ndash;
was gay marriage. Like I wanted to talk about <i><u>that</u></i>, especially

than usual, I mean, it <u>is</u> sex we're talking about &ndash; and besides,
everybody's done something crazy at a slumber party. Someday, we'll share

messes with <i>everyone's</i> head that way if she gets half the chance and
within touching range &ndash; she asked your friend Lane if <u>she</u> wanted to make

the wall - that made the auburn-haired young woman burn scarlet with
embarrassment from her scalp to the soles of her feet, had Quinn turning
several shades of red with horror, disbelief and a barely-controlled urge to

deserves, but has enough heart to tell her every now and then, 'You need to sit
down and shut up,' &ndash; because she learned entirely too much of the wrong stuff
on how men and women relate by how her mother plays her father with zero
respect and kicked his manhood all the way out to the curb? You think that I <u>haven't</u>
heard the stories about 'Tom the Sex Bomb' - and how you'd play that Tom Jones
song out of that crappy car of yours whenever you got laid the night before &ndash;
