<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Chapter 13:2 &ndash; 'Angel Of The
Morning'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>Of course Daria didn't like
Julia Elaine Carlyle. They were both cut from the same cloth, but with one
difference; Julia had been fortunate enough to have had someone notice that she
was special at an early age, shield her from a world that brutalizes those
outside of the norm, and gather around her a group of friends who accepted her
for who she was &ndash; for good or ill. For lack of a better description, they could
be seen as Sith Lord and Jedi Knight &ndash; with Daria as the former, secretly
thinking of her fellow Legionnaire that 'the grass was greener', while as for
the latter, Julia's impression of the charter member was 'There, but for the
grace of God...'<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:162.3pt'>This was particularly visible
when the Legionnaires went before the public. Daria shrank from the limelight's
glare, whereas Julia seemed to revel in it. Daria, a talented writer with a
flair for debate, was at her best when in small groups or when encountering
individuals one-on-one; Julia, a gifted singer whose skill at manipulating an
audience &ndash; on or off the stage - had no peer within the Legion's ranks (save
perhaps the iconic Quinn Morgendorffer) and gave no indication that she
actually had a problem with stage fright, which she handled by thinking of
every performance as 'a mission' which she needed to complete. She had one
advantage over Daria; her years as a cadet had taught her how to control her
fears, and to handle them by direct attack instead of in the passive-aggressive
manner that Daria had perfected over the years and honed to a razor's edge in
Lawndale, pre-Legion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:162.3pt'>That was the problem that
defined the two of them in what some historians refer to as 'the expansion
period' of the Legion, where they gained several new members &ndash; a number of them
in quite the unusual fashion, to say the least. Daria was in a group that
accepted her but could never quite take her to its heart &ndash; and this was
partially her own </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i>fault, by her own admission
&ndash; while Julia had left her group, and never really accepted the fact that she
could be a Legionnaire as well as a member of <u>The Alliance</u>.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:162.3pt'>They would eventually develop
a working relationship, and respect for one another's abilities and skills &ndash;
but friendship? Readers are free to decide for themselves if the two women ever
reached that social plateau. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I'm only doing this because I
really like you &ndash; I mean, 'like you', like you," Tom Sloane said, glad for his
superhuman powers as he jogged alongside Jane Lane. "I usually don't go running
with girls &ndash; girls usually come running after me."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Jane put along a burst of speed
as she cleared the lightly wooded area that bordered the northeast edge of the
beach below Legion Tower, and rolled her eyes at the comment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Why is it that all of the male
Legionnaires have super-ego as a power?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Because we're all so

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>They stopped, and Jane
momentarily considered using her magnetic powers to toss her boyfriend into the
waters of Lewis Bay &ndash; the body of water that gave Lawndale a direct connection
to the Atlantic Ocean &ndash; before she moved in close to accept his kiss-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Backlit by the rising sun and
with wings fully extended, Julia Carlyle rose from the waters of Lewis Bay not
more than thirty feet from them in a torrent of foam, garbed only in a
cream-colored, string mesh bikini.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Tom suddenly found himself on
the ground, spitting out sand and nursing the left side of his face as Jane
winced, her left hand stinging from the force of the slap she had instinctively
dished out! "Ow!" she said, looking up from her hand to where Julia, wiping her
hair from her face, looked at her and Tom with a mix of curiosity and humor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"What's with the Botticelli
riff out there in the surf, Carlyle &ndash; and haven't you noticed it's daylight AND
this is more or less a public area?" Jane snapped as the leggy redhead walked
out of the waters towards her and Tom. "People could see you with those things
hanging out like that!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Julia smiled, and Jane scowled
at both her and Tom, who suddenly found a way to occupy his time by tossing
rocks into the distance with his super-strength &ndash; <i>smart thinking, Tommy boy,</i>
Jane thought. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>You'd BETTER not be
checking out her goodies with that shape-vision of yours... not that it takes
x-ray vision with that half-a-bikini she's almost wearing. Wonder if she'll

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Oh." She withdrew her wings
back into her shoulders, where they were tiny wing buds just below the skin. "I
just love swimming &ndash; and I haven't been anywhere near the ocean in months." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Tom threw a small, glittering
stone into the next time zone, and glanced at Julia. "The other seagulls made
you Stand to Center - and sent you to farm country as a punishment?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The huge smile Julia gave Tom
made him feel weak-kneed for a second &ndash; and then made him step back quickly
from Jane, who looked as if she were about to do something very unpleasant to
him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"You'll pay - later," Jane
promised, turning back to Julia. "So, Carlyle - where'd you get the swimsuit?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"A place in Baja," she replied.
"Got it the January before last &ndash; needed something for the Polar Bear swim, and
I was supposed to make sure every guy noticed me." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Jane smiled. "You think that
you can point it out for me?" <i>A trip to Baja California &ndash; now, that would be
a nice weekend getaway...</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"If you want something like
this, hold on until summer classes start at the Academy. They offer a minor in
fashion design, and the cadets bring in lots of money by making clothing like
this for metahumans - and they understand style. They'll cut you a deal, too,
just to say that you're wearing their clothes."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The redhead walked over to
where her towel and giant beach blanket were placed, and she begin to towel off
her hair before slipping on a pair of sandals and wrapping a sarong around
herself. "Anyway, I just wanted to get a few miles in before I got dressed and
came up to Legion Tower," she said, shaking her hair out. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"We're having our meeting about

didn't speak to my mother for almost a year after she let me go. She's always

brute-force your way into respect as there is with the boys, where even
standing up for yourself and taking an ass-kicking in the process will make
people look at you in a better light. If the Legionnaires were mostly men, he'd
have taken his respect <u>his first day</u> here, when he stepped into
Thunderdome with that other shape-shifter &ndash; a combat to the death, the first

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Everyone saw how Julia restrained
herself from firing back after Daria's comment. "Oh! Before I dig myself in any

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I caught it after you dropped
it, actually." This comment caught everyone's attention, especially from Stacy

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Quinn gave him one of her

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria watched as the other
young woman left, then started towards the door herself. <i>I can't remember
the last time I had some good sweet-and-sour pork, or crab Rangoon</i> &ndash; <i>and
if Jane can go off to new places with new people...</i></p>

building and into open air, Daria suddenly found herself spiraling into the
sky, moving so quickly that she had no time to react!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Trapped in some kind of energy
field that held her fast as it <i>grabbed</i> her from the sidewalk and lifted
her up to the top of the tallest building on campus, the psychic Legionnaire
dropped to the roof. She looked around, and then turned to look up &ndash; and
astonishment took her voice away as she saw &ndash;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria stared upwards numbly as
she saw Jodie Landon levitating overhead, wearing one of the new Legion
uniforms (black, with a purple undershirt and purple trim) and a white belt &ndash;
which was glowing with the same energy that had swept her up to the roof.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>As Daria watched, Jodie pushed
a couple of buttons on her belt. She floated down to the rooftop, and the
energy filed around the Legionnaire faded away. "Hey, Daria," she said, holding
her hand out to help her up. &quot;Got a minute to talk?&quot;</p>
