<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Okay. Let's go down the list.
Quinn &ndash; you've got electrical powers. Sandi, you can create duplicates of
yourself or other people &ndash; with some people, it's easier than others - and you
have the combined physical and mental qualities of all of your own duplicates.
Brittany, you can turn yourself and other things invisible. Charles, you can
change into &ndash; wow. You can change into almost anything you can imagine &ndash;
people, animals, things, and even imaginary creatures. Stacy, it's like you've
gone &ndash; I guess the word is 'feral'. You're strong, fast, your senses are more
advanced than normal persons &ndash; you can also fly VERY fast, and you have some
kind of energy power, I don't know what yet, I haven't seen that before."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Jodie Landon drew wide-eyed
stares as she walked around the Legionnaires seated in the main conference room
of Legion Tower, briefly stopping at each teenager to hold what looked like a
modified MP3 player close to their foreheads . "Mack, you've got the powers of
a little sun &ndash; heat, light, gases, radiation &ndash; you can also drain any of those
energies, and you can fly."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>She stopped at Julia Carlyle's
chair. "Hi. Julia, right? You've got some kind of powers that deal with sound.
You also have some sort of mental power &ndash; I can't tell what, it doesn't work
that well with psychic stuff, and you've &ndash; wow. Your body can regenerate from
anything that happens to you, I guess &ndash; and it's also in your body fluids, too.
Your blood, saliva, probably even in your tears and your-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Does she know what 'too much
information' means?" Julia said, wincing as the collective stares of everyone
present turned upon her. "That's why people with advanced healing powers keep
it on the downlow; nobody wants to be stuck in a little room <i>Night of the
Comet</i>-style with tubes draining blood and spit so rich people and their
friends never die." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The newest Legionnaire gave her
a look that clearly said <i>you need to stop talking, right now</i>, and Jodie
took a step back. "Stop doing your Daria impression, Julia," Quinn spoke up,
clearly impressed by what Jodie was doing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Oh, and you missed something with
your little toy," Julia said, letting her wings rise from her shoulders.
"Overall &ndash; it's not bad. It's a little crude, but it works."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Colonel Kyle Armalin (who was
standing off to one side and gave Jodie a scorching glance when she brought out
her scanner, ensuring that she didn't go near him with it) lifted himself from
the wall he leaned against. "Put them away, Carlyle. You can turn that thing
off, too, Miss Landon."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Both girls did as they were
asked as Sandi sat up in her seat. "You <i>made</i> that? How? I knew that you
were, like, smart, but I didn't know that you were <i>that</i> smart!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"It wasn't that hard," she said
pleasantly, looking around the room. "After the bird bomb, everything's been a
world clearer and easier for me. Math, science, languages, all sorts of
things-" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Her next sentence came out in
Russian. &lt;"It's as if my brain's been set on permanent fast-forward."&gt;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>&lt;"If you're going to
continue to speak different languages, you need to study your speech patterns
and nuances, as well as accents,"&gt; Armalin spoke up, drawing attention as he
answered Jodie in flawless Russian. &lt;"Right now, you sound like one of the
better voice processors &ndash; lifelike, but no intonations that make it sound
human. Have you studied any other languages?"&gt;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>&lt;"Well, I spent a day
studying French-"&gt; Jodie began, but was immediately cut off by a flurry of
French from the table.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>&lt;"You can speak French? Wow
&ndash; that is so cool!"&gt; Quinn spoke up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>&lt;"Yes, but the Colonel's
right &ndash; you do sound like an answering machine,"&gt; Sandi told her. "You sound
TOO precise when you talk."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>&lt;"Her voice sounds so pretty
when she talks in French, though &ndash; she sounds like the lady in charge of the
French section down at EPCOT when we went on vacation last year!"&gt; Stacy
gushed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>&lt;"Did you learn how to speak
French in one day? Wow, Jodie, you're really, really smart - even smarter than
everybody says you are!"&gt; Brittany spoke up, twirling one of her ponytails
in that way that had always annoyed Jodie.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>&lt;"There are a couple of
other languages I went online to look up, &gt;" Jodie continued, now speaking
in a gentle tone that made Julia's head snap about before she switched into
another harsh, sharp language, "&lt;just for the fun of it."&gt;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>&lt;"Now that's interesting &ndash;
why did you pick Gaelic? My family has a serious Irish background, so trust me
- I was speaking the language when I was very small."&gt;<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Julia drew stares as she changed from
speaking in Gaelic to very sharp, precise German. &lt;"Have you come across any
other languages that you speak? Oh, and for German, that's not bad at all."&gt;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>&lt;"Have you heard this one,
Jodie?"&gt; Charles spoke from the far side of the table, catching the other

everyone as he spoke out in Klingon. &lt;"Esperanto was an unsuccessful
attempt, but ever since <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i> and <i>Star Trek

are looking to it as Esperanto's successor. Oh, and it's 'Klingonasse' &ndash; 'the
language of the Klingon people', not 'Klingon'."&gt;</p>

she could have been a cheerleader, in the Pep or Glee Clubs, Student Council,
any number of activities where she could have become incredibly popular and
gotten much, much more attention than she received at Lawndale High &ndash; but

sadness crossing her face. "Your grandmother thought you were, but I knew
different - I always thought that it would be a surprise if you brought anybody
home at all... anyone except Jane, of course." She ignored the cross look from
her daughter. "Let's be honest, Daria &ndash; that's part of the problem you're
having now. You wouldn't let anyone in but her, but even then, I couldn't see
that happening. I can't see you getting physical unless you felt totally safe

think.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"You know &ndash; for some reason, I
can't see Quinn with a blonde. For whatever reason, I just can't see Quinn
getting together with a blonde. Dark hair, shapely, probably more than a bit
exotic looking, I could see her going that way &ndash; but Quinn's not going for a
blonde, and not a 'girl next door type', either. Her little friend Stacy will
just to have to accept that... or maybe not, with the way she comes across

particularly large chicken drumstick. "Remember that time when Jane's brother
stayed over, and that girl came by? Jake thought that the girl was here to pick
Quinn up for a date, and he didn't freak out." Helen finished her drink. "I was

one he'd spent the past couple of hours by himself on the observation deck
practicing for. "Along those lines, Mack - let me let you off the hook, okay?"
she said, walking over to him. "You and me as a couple &ndash; it's been fun, and we

shuddered at the thought. "See? As for you, Mack - you'd always be angry with
me because you'd feel like I kept you from opportunities with other girls.
Right or wrong, you're young, and guys and girls look at sex differently. Guys
regret all the girls they didn't get a chance with, and girls regret the guys
they let all the way in. I like you, Mack. I think you're wonderful, and
special, and I love the way it feels when I run my fingers over your arms - God,
the weight machines did you a world of good &ndash; but we're both eighteen, you're
in this Legion and maybe they'll let me in, too &ndash; we can't be a couple. It

'Tittany and The QB', letting everyone in sight know just how idiotic we really
are?" Jodie shrugged. "Okay, that was a bit mean &ndash; Brittany's actually nice,
and Kevin... This was one of Polk High's worst years ever in football, and he did
horribly in class because he's not getting any slack from the teachers &ndash; he
wasn't the 'Great White Hope' they expected to give them a name in football
like he did with Lawndale - so no benefits, and no graduation. He started
working in his father's contracting business, and the rumor is that Kevin's
father might not even bother letting him try to repeat his senior year."</p>

for his former schoolmate; it was common knowledge that the only reason that
Kevin Thompson had gotten as far as he did was because of Mack paving the way
in many areas. "So, that's that. We can still be friends, we don't have to
tiptoe around each other if I get into the Legion &ndash; and if you want, you can go
out with Brittany or Sandi Griffin... I'd add Jane Lane in there, too. She

purpose of showing her powers to her former arts &amp; crafts teacher,
fashioned the ingot into an attractive statuette of Anthony and Claire, a baby
in her arms and happiness in their faces. "A Jane Lane original," she smiled,
as Claire ran her fingers over the figures. </p>

hard-wired into him. Mack told me how that officer from the other world had an

themselves at you, not to mention that you've also behaved like a gentleman

small box tossed in his direction; looking inside, he saw a very nice watch
inside. "That's a Mark 60 psionic dampener &ndash; without the details, it keeps
telepaths from reading your mind or using their powers on you. If you feel
uncomfortable about being around Morgendorffer &ndash; take it and use it. It's also

"Take a day or two to think about leaving &ndash; if that's what you really want. Oh
&ndash; and a personal observation. There's a difference between the person that you
were and the person you are now, and you worked hard to get there. There's
nothing wrong with you spending time with someone who likes you for what you've
become. It's called 'getting a second chance'. Don't waste it on people who
can't see past what you were and won't even try &ndash; and don't waste this
opportunity by punishing yourself, or being alone. Dismissed."</p>

wolfed down a pair of large chef salads with Thousand Island dressing and
crackers, a rib-eye steak sandwich, three bananas, four slices of banana bread,
and a half-gallon of milk. (When she was doing her bugging of the Tower for
William, she rewired the sensors to show that this room was empty, and sealed
the doors &ndash; she could get in easily enough by shrinking and slipping between
the gap, as if she meant for this to be a hideout.) As she savaged the feast,
she knew that she'd pay later &ndash; she learned through painful trial and error
that some foods would cause her trouble &ndash; but it all smelled so good, and she
was so hungry...</p>

corrective surgery, she knew that she would attract just as many boys as any of
