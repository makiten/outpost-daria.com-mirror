style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;letter-spacing:0pt'>"Come for your tribute
from your favorite minion, hmm?" she said, taking a slice of roast beef from
the sandwich she had made as the stray stood up on its hind legs. "Well, you'll
have to enjoy this one &ndash; the cafeteria's closing. You'll have to find another
sucker to feed you, because I'm out of here."<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The stray rubbed against
Andrea's hand, licking it gratefully before it took the slice of roast beef
with unusual grace &ndash; even for a cat - and hopped to the sidewalk and began to
enjoy its breakfast. "Here," Andrea said, setting the remainder of the sandwich
down for the cat, before tucking her things away and mounting her bike. "<i>Vaya
con dios</i>, little guy. Hope you have a nice life." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>As she rode away, there was no
way that Andrea could have noticed the way the cat's eyes shifting colors as it
ate. The cat's irises went from black, to a shining bronze, to a brilliant
scarlet red... and as it finished its meal and went to lie in the cool, grassy
area beside several shrubs, enjoying the shade as it began to wash itself, the
cat's eyes had taken on a beautiful azure hue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The next few months were happy
ones for Andrea. Rolling up and down the East Coast; bed and breakfasts in
Maine, hanging out with people on the Jersey shore, partying with Alpha Phi
Alphas in Atlanta and beating the crap out of some pretentious, grabby grad
student in Boston, spending time in the Florida Keys... Good times.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Things took an interesting turn
five months after she left Lawndale. Andrea was in Pensacola, lying on the
white sands and sipping ice-cold kiwi-mango juice, totally unaware of the
happenings around her on the beach... until a pair of women and a man with
'coke-bottle-bottom' glasses came up to say 'hello'.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The conversation that followed,
to say the least, was interesting. They worked for a top-flight agency on the East
Coast and were just taking an afternoon off on the beach when they happened to
see her... and the way men were looking at her. They departed almost an hour
later, leaving Andrea with a business card and several questions in the young
woman's mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>That evening, in her hotel
room, Andrea took a look at herself &ndash; a serious look at herself &ndash; in the
mirror, the first time in a long time that she had done so. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Her eating habits had changed
somewhat since leaving Lawndale &ndash; not that she was trying to diet, eat
healthier or was even a vegetarian, she simply liked fresh vegetables and
fruits, and didn't care for waiting for cooked meals. Her weight had dropped,
she had lost at least thirty pounds, but didn't think of it because she simply
bought new stuff that fit whenever she needed it. There was no vanity involved,
just efficiency and comfort. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>As for looks &ndash; she didn't think
about it much. Of course, there was Charles Ruttheimer, who had chased after
every girl in sight and had approached her once or twice &ndash; but for the most
part, she was sure that most guys had never noticed her. <i>They certainly
didn't, back at LHS; the shallow boys let their tongues hang out over
cheerleaders, those stupid Fashion Club bimbos &ndash; and when the Morgendorffers
showed up, oh, the attention they got!</i> </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Quinn was just a standard
'teen queen' &ndash; but Daria really had the boys' attention. Of course she was
attractive, and she had to know it; the way she kept that auburn hair of hers
screamed 'look at me', not to mention her love of skirts. Anybody who paid
attention knew that she had great legs and a decent rack, clamped down by those
sports bras and hidden by those baggy, drab outfits she practically lived in &ndash;
as if those hideous clothes and glasses would actually hide how she looked.
Maybe if she'd worn a normal bra and blouse once in a while and let herself get
close to Mack (of course she had a little thing for him!), she wouldn't have
been such a bitch. A few good make-out sessions, and the entire school would
have been happier.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>It was the image of Daria -
that smirk, that 'Mona Lisa' smile that appeared on her face whenever something
happened &ndash; and the way that boys looked at her, but quickly looked away, before
she tore them apart with her monofilament tongue, that made Andrea reach for
her cell phone, and the business card...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Three months later, she was <i>'Hecuba'</i>.
Slender and curvy, with dark hair and eyes that captivated, she was an exotic,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Even stranger than that was how
her hair was changing colors... for some strange reason, her hair was becoming
lighter, shading into a brilliant whitish blonde. She tried dying it back to
her normal shade, but even thousand-dollar trips to the best hairstylist in New
York only resulted, within several days, a week on the outside, in her hair
returning to its blonde color. (It sucked that her agent really liked it; he
pointed out that a number of other people had seen some of the shots he
insisted on having her take with the new hair, and they were getting calls
about her from 'name' people...)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The worst of the dreams kept
coming back, repeating over and over; she experienced it as if she were
watching a sci-fi movie of some kind, about people with super-powers ... In her
dreams, she saw several of the kids she'd gone to high school with &ndash; all with
powers, fighting a woman whose powers seemed to come from her ring... a woman who
seemed to be as powerful as all the others combined. It was the same dream,
every night for almost two weeks, and it only went away when she did one simple
thing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Residents of Lawndale who
hadn't been drawn from their homes by the earlier sounds of battle now gazed in
wide-eyed wonder &ndash; and fear &ndash; at the sight of the glowing shower of liquid over
the abandoned quarry where Legion Tower stood, and the massive cloud of steam
rising from Lewis Bay.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria's hands gripped the
steering wheel of her borrowed car even tighter as she saw blue-white lightning
that she instantly recognized as Quinn's blasts &ndash; <i>though nothing like she's
capable of,</i> she thought, seeing similar blue-white blasts striking all
about the Tower. <i>If someone's attacking, why is she choosing <u>now</u> to
hold back, when she usually tries to turn everything into charcoal?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Why don't we just fly there,
Daria?" Fran asked; moments earlier, she had squealed in terror as Daria turned
a corner on two wheels at almost sixty MPH. Daria had given her a cool glare,
and Fran had asked the question to divert the bespectacled girl's attention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"No," Fran said &ndash; a bit too

started out into the street. "Watch out for the dog - <i><u>watch out, Daria</u>!"</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria jerked at the steering

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The sound of the dog barking
caught Daria's attention; in the rear-view mirror, she saw the dog as it ran
off. "Look, Daria," Fran said, glancing back at the bulldog. "No harm done."</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria seemed to calm down as the dog's image
quickly disappeared from the mirror. "God, that was close." </p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Fran leaned back in her seat. "No harm done."</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>"I
couldn't live with myself if I hit a dog," Daria said, Fran drew back as the
auburn-haired Legionnaire glanced over at her. "After you meet her - would you
mind telling Quinn I killed him?" </p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>There was a moment of silence, broken by the
sound of thunder, the screeching of the car's tires, and sirens heading in the
direction of Legion Tower. "Didn't you see him?" Fran asked. "He came running
right up on your side of the car!" </p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria jerked the steering wheel; the two girls
bounced about as the car went over train tracks. "I don't see way off to the
side too well," Daria told her. "My glasses sort of block the view."</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I didn't know that," Fran replied. "Isn't that
a problem?"</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria shrugged. "It is for dogs."</p>

<p style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Fran looked over at her - seriously considered
shrinking down and flying far, far away for a brief moment &ndash; and then, saw the
smirk on her face. <i>Sarcasm. It's Daria's preferred way to deal with bad

Ruttheimer watched from high above as the blur that was Armalin &ndash; who seemed
unaware of the fact that his uniform and skin were aflame - dodged globs of
magma and bolts of Quintessence raining down upon him as he continued to attack
the Ringbearer. <i>He's like something out of a vampire movie... the bad guy,</i>
he thought, as the Marine tore long, scoring gashes through Danielle's fields

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Blow up a planet," Mack said,
taking the Ring and slipping it on his own finger as the other Legionnaires
watched; the giant metal Labrador turned its head to look as Armalin shifted
back to normal form. "I'll hold onto it, Jane. It's not safe for anyone else to

once again seethed inwardly at the way he was once again dismissed. "And
speaking of 'cleanup..." He raised his ring hand, and drew the blood and dirt

telekinetic ability. "Never let it be said that I didn't give you anything,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I had a friend who let me

that we can give some cash to."</p>
