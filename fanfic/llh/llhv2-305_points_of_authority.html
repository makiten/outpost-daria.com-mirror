vision of an alternate past where we &ndash; Daria, Quinn and me &ndash; made it to Los
Angeles, because a flat tire delayed Russell Stark, and he never made the
flight which changed all of our lives. In her vision, we argued, she left us almost
as soon as we arrived &ndash; and we never saw her again. That was because she ran
into Fran, who was living in a locker at LAX &ndash; and William Appleton found both
of them almost immediately. The bastard was very smooth...Daria had this look of
total shame on her face, because in the vision - well, let your mind swan dive
into the gutter, and it still would be much cleaner than what Appleton had them
doing. After seeing that vision, Daria didn't think she had a choice but to
help Fran &ndash; after all, but for the grace of God...<o:p></o:p></i></p>

&quot;Not a bad time,&quot; said Armalin to Tom. &quot;Twenty two minutes and
thirty seconds.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well...I try,&quot; said Tom.<br>

Armalin pointed a finger at Tom. Tom looked at Armalin's fingertip, and before
he could figure out what he was doing with it, Armalin reached up to Tom's
forehead and drew the tip of his finger across it. <br>

Pointedly, he walked over to Brittany, still gasping for air and sitting with
her head between her knees. Armalin reached down and took a finger from his
left hand and drew it across Brittany's forehead.<br>

Without saying anything, he looked at the one finger, which was almost dry. He
then flicked the sweat from the sweat-soaked finger at Tom.<br>

said, his gaze holding Tom aloft as he spoke in a calm, even tone. "Do so
again, and I will pen letters of resignation to Mister Stark and the Legion,
take you into VR, and attend to you as if you were a red-haired Irish stepchild

style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>"I need to talk to you."<br>
<br>
Sandi nodded, indicating that she was ready to listen.<br>
<br>
"What did you see happen today? I sort of missed most of the excitement, and
I'd like your point of view on it."<br>
<br>
Sandi quirked an eyebrow, wondering why Daria had tracked her down to ask her
for a situation report. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Of course</i>,
she thought<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>. I'm the deputy leader, and
Quinn is notoriously unreliable. I'm surprised Daria doesn't come to me more
often with her problems, it's not like she's been talking to Jane much
recently.</i><br>
<br>
Daria's eyes narrowed and she crossed her arms. "Maybe I should have gone and
asked Stacy, she has an eye for detail, right?"<br>
<br>
"We were attacked by some girl, with a magic ring or whatever," Sandi said,
sounding annoyed. "She was after the you-know-what crystal."<br>
<br>
Daria reached under her glasses to rub her eyes. "Well, I guess that could be
the reason why Jane is so pissed. We went to a lot of effort to keep that thing
hidden and secret, with this being one of the results we were hoping to avoid."<br>
<br>
"No, Jane is . . . pissed . . . for completely different reasons," Sandi said,
suddenly flashing a catlike grin. "It turns out that Tom and Mack know the
girl, and they went on some kind of alternate reality tour with her, and Tom
propositioned her and she totally turned him down."<br>
<br>
"What?" Daria asked, her voice suddenly becoming icy.<br>
<br>
"Yeah, apparently he was sleeping with anything that'd have him. Typical guy,"
Sandi said, rolling her eyes. "Even rich guys, you dig deep enough and they're
no different. I mean, I pretty much knew what kind of person he was by the way
he was slumming it with . . . ."<br>
<br>
<b>&lt;Be very careful what comes out of your mouth next, Griffin.&gt;</b><br>
<br>
Sandi's eyes got wide for a moment, and then narrowed with anger. "How dare you
. . . ."<br>
<br>
<b>&lt;You see, it doesn't count until it you say it out loud. That's my rule .
. . that's how I deal with having everybody's worst impulses shouted at me all
day long. It doesn't count until you say it out loud.&gt;</b><br>
<br>
"Yeah, I can see that," Sandi said quietly. "I'd sort of wondered what it was
like."<br>
<br>
"Pray you never know," Daria said.<br>
<br>
"I'm not apologizing," Sandi said. "You're a stone bitch, Daria, you're
miserable and you bring most of it on yourself. I said it out loud, so what are
you going to do about it?"<br>
<br>
"Graciously accept the compliment, one stone bitch to another." Daria sighed.
"Look, I'm not apologizing for anything either. Everything I did, I did it
because it was the best thing I could think of to do at the time, even if it
did end up costing my own happiness. If you people don't like it, then you can
collectively take a leap."<br>
<br>
Sandi rolled her eyes. <i>Same old Misery Chick, right? Even Charles grew away
from his 'Upchuck' thing, got a little bit cute and started dating that blonde
from Alaska<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>- but <u>you</u>...</i> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN-GB

gave Daria look of pity. "For God's sake, Daria. You don't just sacrifice your
own happiness - you wallow in misery, and think it makes you a better person.
News flash: it doesn't, it just makes you miserable."<br>
<br>
Daria stood firmly atop her soapbox. "I still think it makes me better than a
person that sacrifices other people to the altar of her own ego - or are you
going to try to convince me that Stacy came pre-packaged with all those
neuroses?"<br>
<br>
"Like I haven't watched <i>you</i> reduce people to tears with just a couple of
sentences, back when we were at school," Sandi said scornfully.<br>
<br>
Daria barked off a derisive laugh. "Is this the part where I realize that we're
not so different after all, and we go get facials together and be best friends
forever?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<br>
"Actually, yeah - I came down here with a purpose. Jane is very angry, and I
bet she's about to break up with Tom. I'd like to give them a little privacy &ndash;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN-GB

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><span lang=EN-GB
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Daria continued, annoyed by the indecently
proud look on Sandi's face. "As I was saying &ndash; we need to talk about the
Ringbearers and what just happened - and about the girl that was with me when I
showed up earlier. I was thinking of calling an emergency meeting, but I
figured it might have a little more oomph if <i>you</i> did it."<br>
<br>
"Why not ask Quinn?" Sandi said, the words escaping before she could catch
them.<br>
<br>
"Because she'd want to play twenty questions just to needle me, and then she'd
refuse to help because of something I did to her when we were in Elementary
School," Daria said dryly.<br>
<br>
"She's not that childish." <i>Well, not as much as she used to be.</i><br>
<br>
"Maybe, maybe not," Daria said. "Maybe I'm not as riddled with self-loathing as
you think I am. Maybe you're not as self-centered and clueless as I think you
are. Hell, while we're at it, maybe Upchuck isn't really a perv."<br>
<br>
"People change," Sandi said, looking away. "Even you, Daria. How can you walk
around with the ability to see right inside somebody, and not be able to know
how much people can change? How much people <i>have</i> changed?"<br>
<br>
Daria stared at Sandi for an endless moment, and then rubbed her eyes again. "I
can't believe I heard that from the Queen of Superficiality."<br>
<br>
Sandi put her hands on her hips and glared at Daria. "Excuse me?"<br>
<br>
"That's my line," Daria said, smirking; her face hardened as she continued. "I
haven't forgotten about you folding on that group running idea because you were
afraid you'd lose face in front of your Fashion Flunkies."<br>
<br>
Sandi waved her off. "Gee, Daria. Too bad you didn't grow up in Lawndale,
because then you'd be able to, like, complain about things I did even further
back than that. Like Elementary School, maybe?"<br>
<br>
<b>&lt;!!!&gt;</b><br>
<br>
Sandi's hand flinched towards the PFT on her belt, and Daria suddenly looked
guilty. "I didn't mean to . . . mean to . . . lose my temper." Daria's voice
drifted away as she followed a train of thought, remembering something her
mother had told her once while they stood under the stars in the yard back
home.<br>
<br>
"I have to be the bedrock," Daria muttered, and Sandi looked at her sharply.
Then abruptly as it came, the moment passed and Daria refocused on Sandi. "I'm
sorry."<br>
<br>
Sandi blinked in surprise. "For what?"<br>
<br>
"For not thinking of you as a human being," Daria said. "Look, are you going to
call a meeting or not?"<br>
<br>
"Sure," Sandi said, still watching Daria carefully. She pulled her Legion phone
out, flipped it open, and then glanced down at it with a frown. "I'm not
getting any bars. This thing gets bars everywhere."<br>
<br>
"Oh hell," Daria swore. "Ok, I'll do it - but you be ready to do a better job
of backing me up than you did last time."<br>
<br>
Sandi nodded, and Daria did something that she found difficult to describe to
the mind blind. Of course, there was no need to describe it to a fellow
telepath, but that was beside the point. After a moment, she'd pinpointed
exactly the minds she was looking for in the tower.<br>
<br>
<b>&lt;Please assemble in the secure meeting room on the second floor of the
Tower for an emergency Legion meeting. This is not a drill, and this meeting is
called on the joint authority of myself, a founding member, and Deputy
President Alexandra Griffin. Meeting is to begin in three minutes.&gt;</b><br>
<br>
"I need get some things from my quarters," Sandi said. "But just in case I
don't make it before you seal the room . . . ."<br>
<br>
". . . I'll be right along behind you," Sandi 2 said, stepping away from her
twin.<br>
<br>
Daria nodded and headed for the elevator. Sandi 1 quickly stripped off her VR
gear and stowed it, and then jogged to the elevator. When it reached her floor
she stepped out, leaving Sandi 3 behind as the doors closed and the elevator
headed further up the tower. All three Sandis wore the same thoughtful
expression as they went about their duties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"She's not your enemy," Mack
said quietly. "Think of this as a jurisdictional dispute. She's the FBI and
we're the local cops; she came in waving her badge around and got smacked down
for it. She'll be fine, you'll see."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Quinn nodded but didn't look
convinced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Ok, I have two things I'd like
to move through quickly before I get to the 'meat' in the 'meeting.' The first
is why we're in the secure meeting room with full defenses in place."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"You have evidence, or believe
you have evidence, that the Tower is no longer a secure information zone,"
Jodie said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"It's going to be hard getting
used to the idea that I'm not smarter than you anymore," Daria said with a
smirk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"It shouldn't be too hard,"
Jodie said, returning the smirk with interest. "Since you never were to begin
with."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Jodie's <i>first</i> statement
is correct," Daria said, addressing the group once more. "The entire building
has been compromised top to bottom, including every major computer and
communications system. They even found Ruttheimer's secret stash, and I
understand they're very impressed."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>A nervous chuckle rolled
through the room and Charles blushed slightly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Who are these people?" Sandi
asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"In a moment," Daria said. "I
am aware of this infiltration because the spy turned herself in to me, in
exchange for asylum and medical treatment. I want everyone to meet Fran
Lawrence."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>It was all Fran could do not to
shrink away to nothing as every set of eyes in the room turned to her. "Hi,"
she whispered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Fran is suffering from the
effects of injuries she sustained in a car crash when she was much younger,"
Daria continued. "She was being blackmailed by her employer, who provided her
with a drug that was able to temporarily regenerate the lost and damaged
tissue. Apparently, her system has built up a tolerance to the drug, and her
employer had planned to kill her before she found out."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Fran stared silently at the
tabletop as the room filled with angry muttering. Daria glanced around the
room, confirming her personal prediction of the Legion's reaction to the story.
Stacy and Charles looked particularly upset, Mack was practically thunderous,
and both Brittany and Sandi's faces held the cold, calculation expressions
she'd seen on her own mother's face... when she had a court case that she took
personally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I believe that coming clean
with what she's done goes a long way towards evening the balance sheet, even if
she does nothing else to help us," Daria said. "I also believe that we, as
Legionnaires, have a responsibility help her, if we can."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I'll take care of it," Julia
said. She had already noticed the terrible facial scars that Fran kept hidden
behind her hair. "We're going to talk more about this infiltration issue, but
I'm not going to let her suffer over it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria felt a touch of respect
for the new Legionnaire bubble up inside her. "Thank you - <i>Julia.</i>"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Fran looked up at Julia, the
shock and fear on her face quickly replaced with hope. "You . . . you can fix
me?" she whispered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Julia nodded and it was all
Fran could do not to launch herself across the able and beg the redhead to
start immediately. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>I've been
Fran-kenstein this long . . . a little longer won't kill me,</i> she thought to
herself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Um . . . Daria?" Trent asked.
"Not that I'm not cool with this and all - but why am I in here? This is <i>Legion</i>
business."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"We're going to talk about
Ringbearers in a minute," Daria said. "You picked up a weapon and stepped up to
defend the Tower; you deserve to know what you defended us against. You may not
be a Legionnaire, but you've earned a place in this room, Trent."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Trent nodded, and then sat down
in the empty chair he'd been leaning on. "That's cool, Daria."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I'd like to finish up this
topic by nominating Fran Laurence for membership in the Legion," Daria said.
"She's got a distinct power none of us has, she's of membership age, and she
has skills that we're going to need very soon."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"She was <i>spying</i> on us,"
Stacy said. "How can we trust her?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"And if those bugs are still in
place it could be a serious problem," Sandi said. "Daria, do you know what kind
of information we share over those secure lines? This could be a national
security crisis. We have to cut off communication, now."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"It's taken care of," Daria
said. "I had a quick conversation on my way here with a few of the techs. If
any information is flowing out of the Tower, I can assure you that it isn't
information that will do anyone a bit of good . . . and at this point, I don't
want the rat to realize there's a trap attached to his cheese."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"But what about her?" Brittany
asked. "If she betrayed her boss, why won't she betray us?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I have to agree with
Brittany," Charles said, a note of reluctance in his voice. "While her r&eacute;sum&eacute;
is impressive, I don't appreciate having my privacy violated."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I know that, Charles - but
I'll point out three things that might help allay everyone's suspicions. First
of all, we aren't likely to threaten to kill her, which was the final nail in
the coffin for her last job. I think I can also guarantee that her living
conditions will be much better than what she's used to. Secondly, she's already
told me that she could have already downloaded everything in the computers &ndash;
but she didn't - and if she had, all of our secrets would <u>already</u> be in
Appleton's hands."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria paused, and looked around
the table. "Most important of all is that I trust her. How many times have you
heard me say that? I . . . <i>know things </i>about her."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Like what?" Julia asked, the
investigator in her overriding the slight sense of jealousy she felt towards
the other girl. <i>I've been thinking about how I'd do a B&amp;E of Legion
Tower ever since I've heard about the Legion &ndash; just to say I'd done it, of
course &ndash; and I haven't found a good way through their security system yet!<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The scarlet-haired Legionnaire
leaned forward and made what looked like an innocent gesture on the table; she
smiled inwardly as Fran turned several shades paler than she usually was and
made a similar gesture. <i>Ah-ha. You've been trained by the <u>Thieves' Guild</u>,
just like me &ndash; and you're a better thief than I am</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I'm not at liberty to discuss
Fran's private details," Daria said, arching an eyebrow as she felt Julia's
Academy training kick in. "But it wouldn't be the <i>first</i> time we took in
a less than ideal candidate."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Julia smiled as she gestured at
herself. "<i>Moi?</i> I'm flattered." <i>Now, <u>that's</u> the Daria all the
telepaths at 'the AXE' lined up to love and know. Bitch.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I second the nomination,"
Sandi said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria looked surprised for a
moment, and then raised one hand to draw everyone's attention. "Thank you,
Sandi. However - I'm not going to dismiss everyone's concerns out of hand. Fran
has earned my trust, and I think she deserves the chance to earn trust from all
of you as well. I'd like to table the actual vote until the next regular
meeting."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Fine with me," Quinn said
absently. "Motion tabled, or whatever."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"I won't let you down," Fran
said quietly. "You won't regret this, I promise."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"Okay. Our second order of
business today is the <i>Ringbearers</i>. You'll find a great deal of
information on their history, operational standards, and other minutia in our
databanks; I <u>strongly</u> suggest everyone go read up on them. If you don't
have the clearance to read it, talk to Quinn or Sandi and they should be able
to get it for you. This isn't high school, people: failing a test against the
Ringbearers can get you killed, or worse."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"You make them sound a lot
worse than they are," Mack said. "The Ringbearers isn't like that-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>"No. If I were talking about
worse - I'd be talking about <i>Ringwraiths</i>," Daria said. She smiled thinly
when Mack looked surprised at her knowledge. "It's true that the Ringbearers
aren't villains - but they <u>are</u> serious business, and I intend to treat
them that way." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Daria's eyes flicked down to
the Ring that adorned Mack's right hand. "You obviously have more personal
experience with Defender Rings than I do. Why don't you take the floor and tell
us a little about how they operate."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Mack stood - after shooting
Daria a mild glare - and began describing his experiences with the <i>Corps of
Ringbearers</i>. Daria glanced around and noticed that a few of the
Legionnaires were taking notes, and all of them had their attention firmly
directed towards Mack.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Before Daria could send a
response the double doors leading into the room opened, the computer giving a
resonant chime to remind everyone that the room was no longer secure. Quinn's
head immediately snapped up, and she stared down the hallway past Armalin and
Sandi 3 as they entered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>The redhead bristled in her

ultra-compressed steel and iron slamming into Tom's left cheekbone at over two
hundred miles per hour. The skin on his face split, blood immediately flowing
from the wound and spattering Jane. The lightning bolt that followed the bat in
turned his uniform to ashes and dazed him for a second, allowing the force of
the strike to propel him seventy feet across the parking lot into a two-ton
military truck.<br>
<br>
Tom staggered out of the huge dent in the vehicle and looked around for Jane.
Between the stars dancing around his head and the sudden heavy rain he couldn't
see much of anything. He took two steps forward before he heard the rushing
noise and looked up - just in time for Jane to slam him with the bat again.
This time she hit him from above,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>and
drove him into the asphalt parking lot up to his shins.<br>
<br>
"T-ball!" Jane screamed, torquing around for a grand-slam swing. The bat arced
around and landed in the palm of Tom's left hand.<br>
<br>
"No," he said calmly, yanking the bat away from Jane. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the magnetic fields Jane was using to control it dissipated, and Tom's eyes
widened as he felt the full weight of the bat as it began to fall. He managed
to get his other hand under it, and lifted it in a two handed grip, one hand at
each end.<br>
<br>
His arms flexed and the bat exploded, sending shrapnel flying across the
parking lot. The military truck flipped over behind him, and several other cars
were knocked onto their sides and skidded away. Jane snagged the largest chunk
in midair and swung it around, catching Tom right in the crotch with the jagged
steel missile.<br>
<br>
"Why do girls always go for the balls?" he asked, his voice tight with pain.<br>
<br>
"They're what got you in trouble," Jane snarled.<br>
<br>
"I was taught that it's bad manners to hit a woman," Tom said. "So how about <i>this</i>?"

style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>He brought his hands together in a single clap,
and the force wave from the impact blew a few more cars out of the parking lot,
spider-webbing the asphalt for nearly a hundred feet in front of him. The
windows on the first couple of floors of Legion Tower shattered, spraying glass
into the air.<br>
<br>
Tom's eyes widened as Jane remained airborne; a cruel smile spread across her
face, and her force field sparkled as bits of debris bounced against it. <br>
<br>
"No, Tom. You don't get to just wave your hands and send me away," she hissed;
holding her hands out in front of her, she caused the air to grow thick with
shards of metal. "That must be a shock to you. Here's another."<br>
<br>
The fragments of metal began to coalesce and spin about Jane's body in two
thick rings that whirled about her body in separate directions with frightening
speed - and as Tom's mouth dropped open, a massive stream of bluish-white
electricity leaped from Jane's chest! <br>
<br>
The hell-bolt burned across the space between the two Legionnaires, causing the
asphalt directly beneath it to boil like water as Tom screamed, lightning
exploding out of his mouth!<br>
<br>
Tom dropped to his knees, gasping for air and tasting ozone in his mouth. He
looked up, and made his decision. <br>
<br>
"Sorry, Jane."<br>
<br>
In less than an instant, Tom accelerated to the speed of lightning - one-third
the speed of light itself - then lashed out with one mighty, invulnerable fist
just before he made contact with Jane's force field!<br>
<br>
A crash like thunder shook Lawndale as Jane was knocked out of the air and
bounced across the broken ground, gasping with pain each time she hit the
ground. When she sat up, her mouth was busted, blood was slowly dripping out of
her nostrils and both ears, and her left arm was bent back at an obscene angle.
Screaming with anger, pain and frustration, she motioned with her right arm and
started pelting Tom with broken cars.<br>
<br>
Tom slapped the flying vehicles out of the sky as he started walking towards
his ex-girlfriend. He waited until she drew her good arm back and glared at it;
blue beams from his eyes quickly speared out to punch through Jane's
force-field and strike at her arm a few inches above the wrist - but Tom drew
back in surprise as the beams struck what had to be a <i>second</i>
force-field, rotating inside Jane's outer field!<br>
<br>
"What - you thought you were the only one studying Maryann Lyter back at 'the
Axe'?&quot; Jane growled. "You think I didn't learn anything fighting <i>The
Alliance</i>? Jackass! <i>You think I'm going to let someone pull the same
trick on me <u>twice</u>?"</i><br>
<br>
A hovering Tom dropped to the ruined asphalt and raised his hands in
exasperation. "Are we done here?"<br>
<br>
Jane glared flatly and Tom suddenly felt nauseous as his body began to ache all
over. He seemed to feel heavy, so heavy it was hard to stand, and fell to his
knees as the impossible weight kept piling on.<br>
<br>
When Tom's eyes rolled back in his head and blood started running from his nose,
Jane walked towards him, standing over him like a monument to tranquil
insanity. <br>
<br>

eyes shone with a flickering blue light. Tom was leaning backwards, still on
his knees, and blood was running from his eyes, nose, ears, and mouth. His
whole body seemed to tremble slightly.<br>
<br>
"Jane," Daria said softly. "Come back, Jane. You don't want this, I know you
don't."<br>
<br>
"And <i>you</i> can go to hell," Jane said, her voice sounding rusty and
broken. "You can die and go straight to hell."<br>
<br>
Daria blinked and glanced nervously at Tom. "Jane, please. I know he's a jerk,
but I can't let you kill him."<br>
<br>
Jane barked off a laugh filled with condescension. "Like <i>you</i> could stop <i>me</i>?
Oh, yeah . . . you need him around so <i>you</i> can screw him. He's screwed
with my mind already - you <i>should</i> get the fleshy stuff."<br>
<br>
Daria cocked her head. "Excuse me?"<br>
<br>
Jane slowly turned her head, looking at Daria instead of Tom, and Daria could
feel the power washing over her. "<i>You think I haven't seen the way he looks
at <u>you</u>?</i> <i>You think I haven't seen the way <u>you look at him</u>?</i>
If you aren't fooling around with him, <i>it's just a matter of time</i>."<br>
<br>
Daria struggled for an answer, but luckily one was provided for her.<br>
<br>
"You know Daria wouldn't do that to you, Janey."<br>
<br>
"Trent?" Daria glanced around, but the musician was nowhere to be seen.<br>
<br>
Trent's voice seemed to come from all around the raven-haired girl. "Come on,
Janey. You defended your honor, but we both know this jerk isn't worth killing.
They'll kick you out of the Legion, and you'll have to go to jail," Trent said.
"You know what kind of food they serve in jail?"<br>
<br>
Jane tried to remain angry. "But . . . but he . . . ."<br>
<br>
The one voice that could always calm Jane Lane continued to speak. "I know what
he did, Janey. He's just another jerk. If you want to punish him, there's
better ways. Let it go."<br>
<br>
Jane blinked once, and the glow faded from her eyes. She blinked again and the
tears started falling; she staggered forward into her brother's arms, and
winced slightly as she hugged him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Daria!" Brittany squeaked, running over to check her for injuries.<br>

Daria took a deep breath. "I'll live, keep an eye on Tom until Carlyle gets out
here. Don't get close enough to touch him."<br>
<br>
Brittany nodded vigorously as Daria limped over to where the Lanes were
standing. Jane had pulled away from her brother and the siblings were smiling
at each other. When Daria stepped up, Jane flashed her a guilty look.<br>
<br>
"I'm sorry about all the crazy accusations."<br>
<br>
"He was attracted to me. I had a crush on him. I'm sorry," Daria said, seeing
Trent wince out of the corner of her eye.<br>

<br>
"I never acted on it, and whenever the thought popped up I crushed it," Daria
said. "I'm just . . . I'm just not going to lie to you, Jane."<br>

Jane nodded slowly. "I need some time away. There's this artist's colony, and
Mom knows some people there. It'll help me clear my head - and if you still
want me on the team, I'll be back in a couple of weeks."<br>

"When does the next session start?"<br>

"Anytime," Trent said. "People come and go all the time, it's pretty cool."<br>
<br>
"So you won't mind waiting a day or so?" Daria asked.<br>

"Um," Jane said with a frown. "I'm not sure if I'm going to pack a bag before
going. I just wanted to let you know before I got some medical attention and
then flew away."<br>

"Please stay a little longer," Daria said.<br>
<br>
"What the hell did you do to him?" Julia exclaimed, looking down at Tom and
then back to Jane with a look that said she was clearly impressed. "Never mind,
I don't want to know. Nice work, though. Do you want him completely patched up,
mostly patched up, what?"<br>
<br>
"I'm pretty sure nobody over here cares," Daria said dryly. "Suit yourself."<br>

"Right," Julia muttered, recalling the stories that David Allen Farrington told
her about the Sloanes when they were children in the <i>First Academy</i>. <i>Snooty

looked over to Daria. "Why do you want me hanging around?" <br>
<br>
Daria stepped forward. "It's a bit long to explain. Can I just show you?"<br>
<br>
Jane nodded slowly and looked into Daria's big, brown eyes . . . becoming lost
in them for just a moment before suddenly seeing a series of flashing images...<br>
<br>
<i>Fran being given the Cinderella drops for the first time... the thrill she
felt as William Appleton slowly unbuttoned her blouse for the first time as he
told her that he loved her, wanting so badly to believe that someone could, and
that someone could want her like this... the training she received from various
sources...<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>living in the locker at LAX...
screaming out William's name as she gave herself to him in the back of a
limousine...<br>
<br>
Fran performing multiple acts of espionage for William culminating in her
infiltration of Legion Tower... feeling as if she wanted to kill herself as she
lay beside a sleeping William... the way she felt, as if she were less than
nothing the entire gym class laughed after little Kimberly Liu called her
''Fran-kenstein' for the first time... holding her sister's hand just moments
before the crash that changed her life...<br>
<br>
Crying for hours as she slept beneath a pair of wool socks in a closed
department store on the night she ran away from home, the overheard
conversation in which William calmly planned Fran's death, the way fear and
desperation fell away from her as Daria invited her inside the Morgendorffer
home... how jealous she felt as she watched from inside a heating duct as Jane
and Tom made out in his room, her shirt and bra off as she moaned with
pleasure... watching as the Quest Foundation personnel and USAES tech-support
cadets wired up the hardware in the monitor room, and planting her bugs so that
they were part of the normal system...</i><br>

Daria's eyes flickered, and Jane saw something that she knew Daria hadn't
intended to share: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Armalin smiled slightly. "It's
the same light - but depending on where you stand, it casts a different shadow.
You would do well to focus not on all of the women he bedded, <i>but on all of
the millions of people whose lives he saved by staying there to fight.</i> Even
the gods have feet of clay... and many great men have done things in their youth
they have always regretted. Things they've done out of the ignorance of youth,
things because no one took the time to teach them better, and some things... some
things they do because they're scared that there won't be a tomorrow. Words to
consider, as it were."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:162.3pt'>Armalin took a couple of steps away,
and then turned back. "Something else you might also consider, Miss Lane," he
said, after examining her for a moment. "After finding out about Mister
Sloane's indiscretions, you could have just broken up with him. You could have
punished him in a multitude of ways &ndash; but you chose to hurt him as much as you
