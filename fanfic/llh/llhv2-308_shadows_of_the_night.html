<br>
There are still many people who, even in hindsight, question the logic of Quinn
Morgendorffer's choice - to send Brittany along with her (Quinn's) sister Daria
for recon duties on the night of the raid at the Appleton Industries animal
research facility. <br>
<br>
Those people are not very bright.<br>

<u>- Mostly Harmless: The Brittany Taylor Story</u>, by Shawn Anthony Wright,
Jr.<br>
<br>

We're running with the shadows of the night <br>
So baby, take my hand - you'll be all right <br>
Surrender all your dreams to me tonight <br>
They'll come true in the end<br>

<br>
"I don't see why we couldn't just bust in there, grab this freaky molester guy,
and stomp on anybody who says we can't."<br>
<br>
"That's why we get to wait here, Sandi," Mack Mackenzie, standing with the
former members of the Fashion Club - Sandi Griffin, Tiffany Blum-Deckler, Stacy
Rowe and Quinn Morgendorffer (along with Tom Sloane, who sat slightly off to
the side) - as they looked over the city of Lawndale from the 360-degree
vantage point they had from Legion Tower's fifteenth floor, which also served
as a public observation deck. "Subtle is sometimes a good thing. You can't just
always go in somewhere and bust heads &ndash; that'll always come back and bite you
in the butt."<br>
<br>
Mack didn't understand why Sandi suddenly turned to look at him with a scowl,
and the other girls began to titter. "What did I say?" he asked, actually
taking a step back from Sandi. "What?"<br>
<br>
Quinn stopped laughing long enough to prevent Sandi from taking a step towards
Mack. "Sandi &ndash; he wasn't making fun of you," she said, barely controlling her
mirth. "He doesn't know &ndash; He wasn't even a Legionnaire back then, remember? -
And it <u>was</u> funny. Not right then, you know, but afterward."<br>
<br>
She snickered as she made a big production out of leaning back to look at
Sandi's bottom. "Get it? '<u>Butt</u>-?'"<br>
<br>
Sandi looked Mack over, his earnest, yet confused expression making her relent.
"Yeah," she said, the anger in her face sloughing away. "Sorry, Mack. You're
not the type to make fun like that, anyway." <br>
<br>
Turning back to the huge windows, Sandi looked out over the nighttime sky of
Lawndale. "How soon until they get back, anyway?"<br>
<br>
"They... should... have... let... me... go...too," Tiffany spoke up, coming as close as she
could to pouting. "I... could... help... them... get... inside..."<br>
<br>
<i>Yes, but Daria and the others are trying to get information &ndash; and we didn't
want you pulling people into walls and leaving them there, Tiffany,</i> Quinn
thought very loudly, remembering her talk with Maryann Lyter after they (and
most of the other female Legionnaires) watched the male Legionnaires and Rafael
Vargas have a B.S. session over Cluster Burgers and fries. <i>You've got a bad
rep, sister. Thank God you're on <u>our</u> side.</i><br>
<br>
"How long until they get back?" Tom asked, turning in his chair to face the
others. "It's been over an hour since they left."<br>
<br>
"It takes as long as it takes," Jane Lane's voice rang out from behind the
Legionnaires; they all turned to see Jane step from the elevator. "Jodie's in <i>MTAC</i>
&ndash; she wants us all to come down there."<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Three minutes later, the Legionnaires were standing in the <i>Legion Multiple
Threat Operations Center</i> &ndash; the huge area on the fourteenth floor of Legion
Tower where all Legion operational, monitoring and communications duties were
handled in concert with current metahuman and meta-oriented special-operations
organizations under the aegis of the Unites States. "Glad that everyone decided
to show up," Jodie Landon said, turning from the multi-purpose monitor that
took up the entirety of the west wall in the room. "The first act of tonight's
show is about to start &ndash; thought that you guys would want to see this."<br>
<br>
Jodie reached back to touch the monitor with her left hand, and the Mercator
projection of the Earth on the screen retracted back to a six-by-six foot image
in the upper left-hand corner of the display. "They're here, <i><u>M</u></i>,"
Jodie said, "How's everything going on your end?" <br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
In the parting lot of the Lawndale Post Office, Daria Morgendorffer and
Brittany Taylor sat in a silver Prius. "Everything's fine, <i>Braniac</i>,"
Daria said, her annoyed expression directed at the tiny video camera mounted on
the dashboard of the car. "These code-names are dumb."<br>
<br>
"But yours is cool, Daria!" Brittany Taylor squeaked out. "Everyone can say it,
it's something that everyone will remember, and it's the same as the lady who
tells James Bond what to do!"<br>
<br>
Daria silently counted to ten before she spoke. "Well &ndash; at least I got the
satisfaction of payback."<br>
<br>
"Not really, Daria," Jane smirked, looking at the giant image of her best
friend. "Quinn will probably get trainloads of cash with that code-name &ndash; well,
if she decides to go with <i>'Coppertop'</i>. Meanwhile - it's night, you're in
your cool car, and you've got a cute blonde with you."<br>
<br>
Brittany's expression perked up. "Thanks, Jane!"<br>
<br>
Daria shook her head. "Brittany..."<br>
<br>
Jane's comment didn't disappoint. "Nobody's going to complain if you uncover <i>'Cover
Girl' </i>for a quick make out while Charles and Fran do a quick recon of the
area."<br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<br>
Sergeant Brenda Nemec, helping to monitor events in Legion MTAC, had to smile
at the expression that crossed the buxom blonde's face, and the
skeleton-decalcifying squeal of disgust. <br>
<br>
<i>"<u>EWWWWWW</u>!"</i> Brittany squealed. "Jane &ndash; that's <u>gross</u>!"<br>
<br>
Jane wasn't finished, now that she had a fish on the hook. "How would <i>you</i>
know, Brittany? Speaking from experience? Does the former cheerleader squeal
too much. &ndash; or only with the right person?"<br>
<br>
Laughter filled the room as the image of Brittany turned a bright pink - and
suddenly vanished from view! "Wow, look at that," Jane sniggered, getting in
one more shot. "Form-fitting shoulder seat belts."<br>
<br>
An annoyed sound came from the empty space next to Daria. <i>"Hmmph!"</i><br>
<br>
"Anyway," Daria continued, looking out the window at a large, windowless brick
building that sat about two blocks from them, partly hidden by the forest,
"Chameleon and Fran have been gone for twenty minutes. I told them to call in
every thirty minutes."<br>
<br>
"Okay, ladies," Jodie said. "Check with us as soon as they call in."<br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<br>
Back in the car, Daria turned to Brittany as the signal shut off. "Well, I
guess now we just wait-"<br>
<br>
A large shadow fell across the car, and the two Legionnaires had no time to
scream as the Prius was swatted across the parking lot to crash against a light
pole!<br>
<br>
As Daria and Brittany lay unconscious in the twisted wreck of the car, a
hulking, metallic figure, a full fifteen feet tall, strode across the lot -
followed by two others just like it. <br>
<br>
The first robotic figure reached the car. "<i>Winkie One</i> to <i>Oz</i>, come
in," a voice spoke from inside the first mechanical. "We've taken care of the
ones outside. The area is secure."<br>
<br>
"Good work, <i>Winkie One</i>," a second voice replied from the cockpit radio.
"Secure the 'Munchkins', their vehicle, and return to the Farm."<br>
<br>
"Roger that, Oz." Marvin Delos &ndash; the operator of the <i>Sceptre</i> (the name
of the robot chassis) known as <i>Winkie One</i> &ndash; switched from the main radio
channel to the inter-team frequency that the other pilots in his three-man team
of Scepters were on. "Okay, boys &ndash; let's clean it up. <i>Winkie Three</i> &ndash;
grab that wreck and bring it in. We'll watch your back."<br>
<br>
One of the <i>Sceptres</i> walked over to the twisted wreck of the Prius,
picking it up with surprising ease as it turned and walked through the lightly
wooded area towards the brick building; the other two followed along.<br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<br>
One mile above the factory, Julia Carlyle hovered above the hidden animal
research lab, watching what had happened below.<br>
<br>
The color of her new Legion uniform (built with active camouflage elements for
flight) had shifted from black to gray-white (the pink trim and her tunic had
shifted color as well), helping to make her less visible to anyone who might
happen to be looking upward; for this reason, she had also chosen to fly with
her Legion flight ring, instead of using her own wings.<br>
<br>
"<i>Archangel</i> to <i>MTAC</i>," the tall redhead broadcast through the
Ring's mental-communications link. <i>"They've taken the bait.</i> Green
lights, all the way. <i>Start the show."</i><br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<br>
On the other side of the parking lot, where a row of eight Post Office service
vehicles sat empty, the third vehicle momentarily disappeared &ndash; and Daria's Prius
(with Daria and Brittany inside, unharmed) appeared in its place.<br>
<br>
Daria looked down at the Mark 30 Psychon-series augmenter on her left wrist,
and ran her right index finger over the tiny display. <b>&gt;&gt;I'm still
projecting the image of us and the car into the minds of the guys driving those
robot-things,&lt;&lt;</b> she thought-cast, as she and her teammate exited the
car, <b>&gt;&gt;and the image of the truck in a wide-spectrum mental signal.
Even if anyone sees the car on closed-circuit TV, their minds will still tell
them it's a truck, and they're still seeing what we want on their robots'
screens. Hurry up and get down here-&lt;&lt;</b><br>
<br>
Daria almost screamed as a figure touched down directly in front of her. <i>"Good
&ndash; save the screaming for your own room, when you've got a guy who can
appreciate it," </i>Julia said, still communicating through the link as she
picked up Daria with her left hand and Brittany with her right. <i>"Cloak us,
Cover Girl, and both of you - <u>hang on</u>!"</i> <br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
The top floor of the large brick building (it was three stories tall, with
several subterranean levels) was split into two sections, reachable only by two
elevators. <br>
<br>
The first elevator was for the secure documents storage area; the entrance on
the first floor sat right next to the main security office, and anyone managing
to get past that point would meet up with a group of guards who always wore
tactical gear, carried assault weapons (including machine pistols as sidearms),
and more than enough ammo to fight a holding action long enough for the real
backup to arrive.<br>
<br>
The second elevator opened onto William Appleton's personal quarters whenever
he was in Lawndale... accommodations as luxurious as any five-star hotel.
Different than the first elevator, it was instead designed to act in the
fashion of the turbolifts (of <i>Star Trek</i> fame) and was designed around a
series of shafts that provided full access to anywhere within <i>Kansas</i> -
the underground areas beneath the building, and the true heart of the facility.<br>
<br>
That access included including the secure VIP parking area in the <i>Badlands</i>
(the name given to the service area on the first subterranean floor that
everything had to pass through going in or out of the building), <i>Topeka</i>
and <i>Wichita</i> (the respective containment areas for the smaller and larger
animal 'research subjects' called <i>Totos</i>) &ndash; and <i>Lawrence</i> - the
human research and containment area. <br>
<br>
The turbolift system was one of the many changes made by Appleton Industries to
<i>Kansas</i> in the roughly two-year period since the humiliating infiltration
of the facility by three well-meaning (but utterly clueless) <i>Animal
Liberation Front</i> activists. The three college students had freed hundreds
of test subjects (unknowingly changing the course of human history in the
process) at the cost of their own lives &ndash; and also, accidentally, proved the
worth of <i>Kansas</i>. <br>
<br>
The <i>Emerald City</i> &ndash; the main research facility &ndash; was vastly expanded,
taking up the former space of <i>Topeka</i> and <i>Wichita</i>; three
additional subterranean levels were built, with <i>Topeka, Wichita</i> and <i>Lawrence</i>
each occupying fully one-third of what was now Level Two. <br>
<br>
Level Three was dedicated to storage, the on-site power systems and The Farm &ndash;
the hanger for the <i>Sceptres</i>, and Level Four &ndash; also known as <i>Kansas
City</i> &ndash; was home to on-site living quarters for the hundred or so members of
the research staff. It boasted 24-hour food service (of four-star quality, no
less), excellent exercise facilities (including a pool), and a media services
center that could provide any film, television program or televised event
requested within a day.<br>
<br>
The security force for the facility &ndash; augmented since the ALF debacle - easily
rivaled that of many heads of state's personal security details, and was
located in the <i>Badlands</i> (except for the ones in the secure records
section). A security breach of these grounds would never be allowed to happen
again.<br>
<br>
<i>Kansas</i> was now an incredibly secure, self-contained facility.<br>
<br>
Or so William Appleton believed.<br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<br>
Enjoying the smoky taste of a particularly fine single malt scotch, William
lounged on a couch in the living room when his eyes were drawn to a small metal
box on the table just in front of him.<br>
<br>
The touch-screen on the box began to blink with a slow blue light; William
sighed, and put the crystal tumbler to his lips.<br>
<br>
"Hello, Fran," the man said, supremely unconcerned as he took another sip. "You
know I'm not fond of your using your powers when you're here. Take your normal
form."<br>
<br>
The room remained silent and empty; William leaned back and held out his
tumbler. "Frances. <i>Take your normal form, and freshen up my drink. <u>Now</u>."
</i><br>
<br>
A tiny speck in the middle of the room began to grow larger, expanding; William
looked on with annoyance as Fran grew to normal size. "I am not happy with
you."<br>
<br>
Fran stood quietly in the middle of the room; her posture the gentle, slightly
restrained feminine carriage that he had cultivated in her &ndash; but now, something
was different. <br>
<br>
<i>Something...</i><br>
<br>
The young woman visibly flinched as William hurled the tumbler across the room;
the sound of fine crystal shattering hadn't begun to fade as he leaped to his
feet. "Do you think I'm <i>a fool</i>, Frances? <i>Do you</i>?"<br>
<br>
The fact that she barely stepped back from his vocal explosion caused his anger
to fully blossom. <br>
<br>
<i>Oh, you think that something's changed in our 'relationship', do you now,
you little bitch?</i> William thought. <i>Do you really think that?</i><br>
<br>
William stopped, forcing calmness over himself before he took a single step
towards Fran, whose lower lip was now trembling. <i>Oh, no,</i> he thought,
looking her over. <i>You think that little thing you do when you get nervous or
scared will save that perfect, tiny ass of yours now, woman?</i> <br>
<br>
Fran began to speak. "I &ndash; I needed just to get away for a while, and think-"<br>
<br>
William's voice seemed to calm; a peaceful vibe seemed to flow from him, making
the young woman's lip quiver even more than before. "About what, Frances?" he
said. "You know that you can talk to me about anything..."<br>
<br>
Fran looked directly into his eyes. "I... I was at the Tower, and I saw-"<br>
<br>
William took a single step towards her. "You saw what?" he said.<br>
<br>
"Jane Lane," the tiny girl replied, her voice wavering. "She &ndash; she was with her
boyfriend, that Tom Sloane, and they were-"<br>
<br>
"You're not an innocent virgin, Frances," William said, cutting her off
bluntly, "and you've seen plenty of people fuck before-"<br>
<br>
"But it was different," Fran interjected, not realizing how much effort it took
for William to restrain himself from launching across the room and smashing his
fists all across her body for her &ndash; <i>disrespect</i> &ndash; of speaking out of
turn. <br>
<br>
<i>I won't hit her again,</i> William thought, forcing his anger back.<i> No.
The last time I had to &ndash; discipline her &ndash; I had to go to Bras&iacute;lia, and
personally ask Mikayla if she would allow Sarasota to heal Fran.</i><br>
<br>
William remembered the humiliation that he felt as he had to stand before
Mikayla Aguilar &ndash; a regal Brazilian woman ten years his junior, and the
Executive Director for South America - <i>and <u>so full of herself</u> that
she looked down on me as if I were a <u>child</u>!</i> he thought, remembering
his humiliation, and then ask for her permission for Sarasota Meyers - the most
powerful of the four healers within the Elite's ranks - to come to New York
City. <br>
<br>
<i>That's another one that I owe John,</i> he thought bitterly, thinking on how
John Dynell &ndash; flush with power on his own recent ascendancy to the Executive
Directorship of North America &ndash; had actually made him wait a full day before
answering William's constant, desperate calls for help. <i>If it wasn't for
that Toto down in <u>Wichita</u> &ndash; the albino orangutan with the purple eyes
and the ability to drain health from one creature and use it to heal another,
but both only in modest amounts &ndash; I might have lost Fran that weekend.</i><br>
<br>
William abruptly changed direction &ndash; and went to fix himself another drink. <i>They've
both lorded that over me ever since... and I'll be damned if I give him another
marker to call in on me someday.</i><br>
<br>
The gentle splashing sound of the Scotch as it flowed into a fresh tumbler, and
the smoky flavor of the liquor as it flowed down William's throat like gentle,
liquid fire, allowed him to regain a measure of calm as he continued to go over
his current circumstances in his head. <br>
<br>
<i>If I could only use the formulas we have to create an all-powerful healer,
or a stable regenerator - one whose powers didn't simply start destroying his
body the first time he's wounded or sick, because his power just sees
everything as a threat, or act as a super-inducer of cancers, because of the
uncontrollable growth... Jesus. If some of the new lymphomas that our 'healers'
generated in their bodies <u>had ever made it into the general population</u>...</i><br>
<br>
William suppressed a shudder of fear that momentarily erased his anger. <i>Thank
God for plasma-based incinerators &ndash; they even vaporize the bones.</i><br>
<br>
Fran shifted uneasily. She knew that Appleton was lost in thought. Sometimes
there was an explosion at the end as something would set him off. It could be a
terrifying prospect, as William had taught her &ndash; literally and figuratively &ndash;
that she was to 'stay in her place'.<br>
<br>
The image of a tall redhead with spectacular legs from a Christmas party a few
years back caused him to sigh inwardly. <i>I wish I could have gotten my hands
on that Julia Carlyle &ndash; in more ways than one. I've heard about her healing
factor &ndash; but from what I heard, not even she could help Fran much more than the
drops do. Perhaps I could ask John about those three paranormal mercenaries
he's used for several jobs here in the States...</i><br>
<br>
William stepped up to her, and reached out to stroke Fran's face. <i>You're the
most docile, demure woman I've ever had &ndash; and you're still not demure or docile
<u>enough</u>,</i> he thought. <i>It's a pity that actual regeneration &ndash; and
healing &ndash; are the two most difficult abilities to isolate and induce &ndash;
otherwise, I'd have punished you as you deserve.</i><br>
<br>
Fran somehow managed not to draw away or even flinch as William's right index
finger slid gently down to the nape of her neck, teasingly stroking just
beneath the locket she wore (a gift he had given her the first time he had
given her the Cinderella drops, and then bedded her). <i>You're still wearing
that, eh?</i> William marveled silently.<i> I guess you're not as free of me as
you &ndash; or your new friends &ndash; think.</i> <br>
<br>
William smiled as he walked slowly around Fran, allowing his finger to trace
along her neck as he stopped behind her. <i>That's all right, then,</i> he
thought.<i> I guess that I'll keep you around &ndash; ragged face and all &ndash; until I
beat every trace of backbone out of you. Like the man said in that old film &ndash;
'You're going to be respectful, compliant and appreciative &ndash; the way a woman <u>should</u>
be' &ndash; and you'll get to watch as I do the same with your big-breasted blonde
friend... and that ice cube &ndash; Morgendorffer. I've wanted to spread <u>those</u>
slender legs and defrost that little bitch ever since I saw her at the Quest
special powers demo.</i><br>
<br>
William felt his throat burn as he finished his drink. <i>Did you think</i> <u>we
didn't know</u> <i>that you'd bring friends back here?</i><br>
<br>
"You didn't answer me, Frances," he said, towering over her; his face still
calm, even concerned. "Do you think that I'm a fool?"<br>
<br>
"It &ndash; it was different," Fran spoke; the stammer in her voice. "They were &ndash; it
was &ndash; they care about each other... well, she cares about him, and-"<br>
<br>
William cut her off by pressing his index finger to her lips. "They should have
let you practice <u>more</u>."<br>
<br>
Fran's soft, gray eyes went wide as William stormed back to the table where the
small box lay, the blue light still blinking, and thrust it out for her to see
after scooping it up. "You stupid <i>bitch!</i> Do you think I'd let you go <i>anywhere</i>
without <i>a <u>leash</u>?</i><br>
<br>
The girl's voice wavered with a blossoming tinge of fear. "Wha- what is that?"<br>
<br>
William shook his head. "It's a tracking device &ndash; keyed to the radioactive
'tag' my people placed in your artificial wings. It registers as part of your
own body's own energy signature, so radiological scans wouldn't have detected
it &ndash; but our monitors <u>can</u>."<br>
<br>
Fran's voice held a touch of defeat. "You know."<br>
<br>
Almost apologetically, William nodded his head. "That you went to Daria
Morgendorffer's home? That she took you to Legion Tower? That she and her
friend were down at the Post Office doing surveillance while you decided to
sneak back in here &ndash; for what, by the way? What were you going to try and steal
from me?"<br>
<br>
Fran's resolve seemed to break; the girl took a step back. "I wasn't going to-"<br>
<br>
William's eyes bore into her like lasers. "Do not lie to me, Frances. Do not
lie to me, <u>ever again</u>. Why did you come back here?"<br>
<br>
The girl tried to avert her eyes from William's predator glare. "I &ndash; I thought
that, maybe, I could get some money &ndash; from your safe &ndash; or I could get something
from the computer and sell it, a file about the animals, or about the drugs
you're making, and some of the Drops..." <br>
<br>
Fran backed up three steps as fire began to flicker into life behind William's
eyes; her voice began to break as she felt the man's anger wash over her. "I'm <i>[i]sorry</i>![/i]
I &ndash; I don't want to &ndash; I didn't want to-"<br>
<br>
The fury in William's eyes never touched his voice. "To do what, Frances? To
steal from <u>me</u>? To take what's <u>mine</u>? To go behind my back, use the
skills that I provided for you, and use them to stab me in the back and then,
slip off into the night as if you were a distaff, modern-day Jack Dawkins, as
if you'll be able to have a life of beaches, bikinis and night life, full of
fine food and well-hung Senator's sons with <u>my money</u>? After you were
going to let that bastard Stark's kid club of little paranormals into my
property and give me over to them like the little Judas goat you are?<br>
<br>
William took a breath before continuing. "Or is it that you think that
somewhere out there, you'll find someone with the power to heal your face? I'm
sorry &ndash; but that's not going to happen, either. None of it &ndash; and by the way,
your new friends are downstairs, in the 'Emerald City'."<br>
<br>
Fran reacted as if he had hit her. Her knees wobbled, almost as if they would
unlock and send her falling to the floor, but she somehow steadied herself as
William watched.<br>
<br>
William sighed. "Frances. If you think that somewhere out there, you'll find a
healer that can help you look normal, so you can go off and have a 'normal
life'... <i>you are deluding yourself.</i>"<br>
<br>
Fran's eyes seemed to focus at his words; she looked into his eyes, and for a
moment, supreme joy flooded through William as he realized that she was close
not only to tears, but to a sudden mental breakdown. "No..."<br>
<br>
William nodded. "I asked your friend Sarasota to heal your face, and your
internal injuries. She tried, but she couldn't &ndash; because of your powers."<br>
<br>
Fran looked small and lost in the center of the room. "Your injuries &ndash; your
disfigurement &ndash; it's simply a physical part of who you are, now," William
continued. "When your mutant powers manifested themselves, it became part of
your body's default template; the part of your powers that allows you to retain
absolute control of your molecular structure also locks it into the form you
had when you first manifested."<br>
<br>
William walked three steps to the left. "Your slender form is a result of your
nutrition deficiencies caused by your accident. Though your physical form
suffered &ndash; you most likely would have been taller and had a fuller figure,
we'll never know &ndash; it nevertheless became a part of who and what you've become.
As for the Drops &ndash; and of course, you stole some of the formula, I'm looking at
your face &ndash; <i>they won't work on you forever."</i><br>
<br>
Another crack in Fran's armor appeared; the young woman flinched at his words.
"That's not true," she said, more to herself than to William. "That's not
true..."<br>
<br>
"Diminishing returns, <i>mon petit ange,"</i> William replied, smiling as he
addressed Fran with his pet name for her in bed: <i>'my little angel.'</i> "The
Drops can heal a normal human <i>completely.</i> For those with powers - well,
physical powers - the effect is only temporary. It differs in duration,
depending on what abilities one has, but after a period of time, no more than
twenty-four hours &ndash; any injuries or trauma you had beforehand return. Even
worse...the more you use it, the shorter the duration of effect becomes."<br>
<br>
William's smile grew wider as he allowed his eyes to roam over Fran's body. "I
know for a fact that you took a dose no more than two hours ago. The science
boys determined that with your powers and the length of time you've been using
the Drops, the effect would have been lessened to that period. It's why they
aren't really effective for medical use, either &ndash; even with normal humans,
every use diminishes the effect the next time it's used... and for humans, it's
even less. However, on people with mental powers - it's the silver bullet.
Perfect healing &ndash; and no side effects whatsoever to the user. One of the
biggest successes we've gotten out of this lab "<br>
<br>
Fran couldn't even speak as William continued. "The average human can only use
the Drops three times for healing &ndash; and I wouldn't use that third dose on a
critically injured person. Sixty-percent failure rate."<br>
<br>
The room became absolutely silent as William let Fran digest all that he had
said. "You used me," she finally spoke.<br>
<br>
"With a sense of enjoyment that is beyond expression," William acknowledged,
bringing himself up into perfect posture. "As an infiltration specialist in my
service, you are superb. As a woman, in my bed... you are <i>transcendent."</i><br>
<br>
Allowing himself a smile of triumph, William walked across the floor to the
computer terminal seated besides his magnificent oak desk on the far side of
the huge room. "Come see for yourself."<br>
<br>
Fran didn't even bother to turn and follow him with her gaze; tears had fallen
from her eyes, and one hung precariously upon her chin. "See what-?"<br>
<br>
"Oh, I'm sure that you know what this is, being the excellent little thief I
paid good money for," William chided her, tapping at keys after turning the
terminal on. "Everything that you were hoping to get your... <i>talented</i>
little hands on: complete and unfettered access to not only everything here at
the lab, but all of Appleton Industries. Finances, ongoing projects, complete
access to all reports from all divisions &ndash; but here's what you were probably
looking for. Take a look over at the television."<br>
<br>
Fran's eyes flickered over to the eight-foot, wall-mounted plasma-screen
television &ndash; and her face drained of color as she saw a crystal-clear image of
her and William, both unclothed and passionately embracing as they slid deep
into the roiling waters of an exceptionally large outdoor Jacuzzi, with several
palm trees visible in the shot and the dark-blue waters of an ocean in the
background. "Turn it off," she said, her voice pleading. "Just - just turn it
off..."<br>
<br>
William watched as Fran turned her head, unwilling to watch as her image slowly
lowered itself down upon William; the sound of her sudden, strangled cry as
their bodies became one echoed through the room, gurgling off into pained,
gasping huffs of feminine pleasure as they began to move together. "Frances
Irene Lawrence," he said proudly. "I've had more than my share of beautiful
young women, but you... are... <i><u>flawless</u>."</i><br>
<br>
Fran could barely bring herself to speak. "Turn it off..."<br>
<br>
William nodded; the screen went off, and he reached into his desk for a small,
silver case. "How... many?" Fran asked, forcing the words from her mouth. "How...
many... how many times did you tape us -?"<br>
<br>
"Oh, Fran, that's not important," William said, opening the case. "I tape all
of my young lady friends. What's important is that you are my special girl -
and that you came back to me. Now, you <u>will</u> have to be punished &ndash; you've
been a bad girl, and you must take your medicine &ndash; but you've also done me, and
yourself, a great service."<br>
<br>
Fran looked up at William. "What do you mean?"<br>
<br>
"Your little friends in the Legion," he told her. "With them &ndash; my scientists
can do research that will expand what we've done here a hundredfold, especially
since that bitch Luthor has working for him won't share any of her data &ndash; and
she doesn't leave any of the males capable of breeding afterwards, so we can't
get any genetic material from them."<br>
<br>
The young woman looked at William with puzzlement. "Why do you want the
Legionnaires?" <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, most of them will go into the labs, but the girls &ndash; I'm going to
personally see what they're capable of," William said, taking a small bottle
from the case and filling the injection needle in his other hand with it.
"Then, they'll all go &ndash; except for Daria Morgendorffer. I've been thinking,
Fran... I've been thinking that you need - <i>a friend."</i><br>
<br>
Fran looked at him in horror. "You don't mean-"<br>
<br>
"I'm already going to punish you later on, Fran," William said tiredly. "Don't
make me add to that by your being prudish. Now, come, take your medicine...
your scars are starting to reappear. We'll enjoy ourselves while my people take
care of any other Legionnaires who decide to show their faces &ndash; we've been
preparing for them for a bit, that's why we replaced the security staff, in
case you'd wondered &ndash; and then, a late dinner. I had Elijah fly in some lobster
tails for you; I know how much you love them." <br>
<br>
"Oh, that won't be necessary," murmured Fran, causing William to look at her
with a touch of surprise.<br>
<br>
"What did you say?" he asked. <br>
<br>
Fran shrugged. "The lobster tails &ndash; and the sex. That's not happening. I don't
sleep with men."<br>
<br>
William's laughter rocked the room. "Really? Since when?"<br>
<br>
Fran's gaze was icy. "To quote two guys from one of my all-time favorite movies
- <i>'you're ten seconds away from the most embarrassing moment of your life'."</i><br>
<br>
William looked at the young woman with a touch of confusion in his eyes. "I beg
your pardon-?"<br>
<br>
Fran looked directly at him &ndash; and her form shifted and grew into that of a
young man with flame-red hair... and the expression of an avenging angel arriving
to greet a horde of sinners. "For all <i>[i]you've</i>[/i] done? Even if it
were my place, <i>I wouldn't."</i><br>
<br>
Appleton's face twisted with recognition of the young man standing before him. <i>"Ruttheimer."</i><br>
<br>
Charles nodded, and looked at his watch. "I'll tell my dad you said 'Hi.' <i>Ten."</i><br>
<br>
A length of thin, gold-hued chain, reminiscent of the weapons martial artists
use, somehow, impossibly, passed through the ceiling from a point halfway
between Charles and William! <br>
<br>
"What the &ndash; <i>FWAHAAAAAAA?"</i><br>
<br>
Before William could react, the chain wrapped around William's waist and he was
jerked upwards, passing through the ceiling without leaving a mark!<br>
<br>
<i>"The Rapture - <u>Legion</u>-style, "</i> Charles said, grim satisfaction in
his voice. "I'm sorry that we &ndash; I'm sorry that you had to go through all of
this, Fran. You can come out now."<br>
<br>
Smaller than a speck of dust, Fran emerged from her hiding place on Charles'
collar, reverting to normal size as she looked at the ceiling. "He's not &ndash; <i>dead</i>,
is he?"<br>
<br>
"Legionnaires don't kill &ndash; even if they deserve it," Charles said gravely,
walking over to Fran. "Especially if they deserve it. Why deny everyone the
chance to see him in 'day-glo' prison gear for the next century or two?"<br>
<br>
Charles opened up the telepathic com-link. <i>"This is <u>Chameleon</u>. <u>Legion
Espionage Squad</u> &ndash; report!"</i><br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
In the <i>Badlands</i>, over forty security personnel lay unconscious, their
weapons strewn everywhere, with the walls pock-marked with bullet holes and the
scorched blast-points of energy weapons-fire. Brittany &ndash; standing in the middle
of the carnage in the loading/transfer area that lead directly to the surface -
turned visible to briefly survey the havoc she had wrought before she answered
Charles' call.<br>
<br>
<i>"This is <u>Cover Girl</u>. The security guys in here are on their break. I
got the ones in the room across from you, too!"</i><br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<br>
In the vehicle storage and refurbishment area known as <i>The Farm</i> - one
floor below Brittany, thirty <i>Sceptres</i> lay in broken heaps. The
unconscious pilots hung limp in their harnesses, while other personnel lay
unconscious all over the area as Julia &ndash; hovering in the air, her wings fully
extended and her PFT-M1 in her left hand &ndash; entered the link. <br>
<br>
<i>"This is <u>Archangel</u>. All hostile Robbies are down."</i><br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Directly across from <i>The Farm</i>, in the main foyer of the massive research
area known as <i>'Emerald City'</i>, Daria looked about at all of the
researchers, support workers and security guards that she had disabled with a
single telepathic command: <br>
<br>
"<u>Sleep</u>."<br>
<br>
<i>"This is <u>M</u>. I've knocked down everyone in the lab areas, but there's
no way that I'm calling this place secure. Somebody give me a hand down here!"</i><br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Fran's gasp of surprise caused Charles to turn around just in time to see
William's unconscious form hit the floor - followed by Tiffany and Jodie, as
the two female Legionnaires phased through the ceiling and set down in front of
him. <i>"<u>Phantom</u>,"</i> she said, releasing Jodie's hand. "I... brought ...
Jodie... innnnnn."<br>
<br>
"Not bad, Charles," Jodie said, stepping over William as she went to the active
computer terminal. "My turn." <br>
<br>
Fran watched as Jodie took several cords from a pocket on the left leg of her uniform,
and plugged them into the terminal. "What are you doing?"<br>
<br>
"My 'Niobe' impression," Jodie said, actually cracking a smile as she took out
a pair of wraparound sunglasses and put them on - then plugged the cords into a
pair of gloves she took from another uniform pocket before putting them on.
"I'm in."<br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<br>
Her mind working faster than the ubertech artificial intelligence in the
Emerald City that serviced the entire facility, Jodie took less than thirty
seconds to take absolute control of all systems in the merry old <i>'Land of
Oz'.</i> <br>
<br>
"I've got full access," she told the others. "I'm shutting down all security
protocols. M &ndash; the internal monitors show that you're the only human awake in
your section. There's still a few stragglers running around through the
facility, and there are over a hundred people in <i>'Kansas City'</i> &ndash; the
on-site living quarters for the research staff. They've gone 'hard-shell' and
are trying to get messages out."<br>
<br>
"Can they?" asked Charles.<br>
<br>
"No," Jodie said with brutal honesty. "I've disconnected all signal access to
this facility by using a free-form reconstituting wide-band data simulation
generator."<br>
<br>
"What... does... that... mean...?" Tiffany asked, her eyes blinking as she tried to
understand what Jodie had just said. <br>
<br>
Jodie glanced over at Tiffany, and then, kept typing. "It means that I've got
every form of communications going out of or coming into this entire place
fooled into thinking that they're all still talking with who- or whatever they
need to be communicating with and at what they would consider nominal readings
or comm traffic." <br>
<br>
The Black Legionnaire spared them all a glance. "As far as the computers at
Lawndale Power and Light are concerned, their meters are all connected and
still running."<br>
<br>
Fran's eyes were huge. "How can you do that? William said that the computer
here was better than the one the government has for the Pentagon-"<br>
<br>
Jodie held up a metal case the size of a package of cigarettes, which had the
cords from her glasses and gloves leading into it. "This is a logic machine &ndash;
and it is <i>five times</i> more powerful than the one in the basement," she
said in a flat tone. "I built it <u>this morning</u> &ndash; <i>moving on."</i><br>
<br>
She reactivated her connection to the Legion comlink. <i>"This is <u>Brainiac</u>.
<u>Legion Heavy Squad</u> &ndash; the alarms are off. <u>Kick the door</u>."</i><br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Brittany had barely taken cover when the heavy doors that led up to the surface
went white-hot, twisted, and exploded in a shower of burning, twisted metal! <br>
<br>
Their PFT batons extended into fighting-staff mode as they marched through the
gaping hole like Terminators hunting prey, two of Sandi's triplicate selves
(each wearing her new Legion uniform of black and burnt gold) were the first
ones through the breach. They were on either side of the third Sand (her
uniform gloves and sleeves were aglow with gold 'Tron lines' from the firing of
her MAGNUMS energy sleeves to blow the door down) - with Stacy, in full-feral
form, a heartbeat behind. <br>
<br>
<i>"<u>Triad</u></i> on point," the Sandis spoke through the link in unison as
Stacy, her energy claws extended, leaped past them in a blur, pulling up short
in the middle of the area as she began sniffing the air for prey. <i>"<u>Wildcat</u></i>
has our backs. The <i>MAGNUMS</i> work - just like promised."<br>
<br>
Jane came through seconds later, stepping through the metal with Quinn on her
right, and Mack to her left &ndash; the latter two's powers fully active as both
checked their fields of fire for targets. <i>"<u>Polaris</u></i> here," she
broadcast through the link. <i>"<u>Lightning Lass</u></i> and <i><u>Inferno</u></i>
are with me. Looks like we missed the party &ndash; Cover Girl filled everyone's
dance card."<br>
<br>
"Roger that, <i>Ops,</i>" the Sandis spoke, looking around the area &ndash; and each
suppressing the need to grimace as Brittany popped up from behind a massive
concrete beam, waving to her teammates as if they were on a field trip. "The <i>Badlands</i>
belong to <u>us</u>."<br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<br>
Back at <i>Legion Tower</i>, Tom Sloane turned away from the multi-purpose
monitor as he heard the sound of applause behind him. He blinked in surprise as
the Legion support and monitor personnel gathered in <i>Legion MTAC</i> the
room, huge smiles on their faces were applauding him.<br>
<br>
"Not bad, Sloane," Colonel Kyle Armalin said, something that might have grown
up to be a smile passing across his face. "Between this and your plans against
the Academy cadets - you seem to have a winning flair for tactics. If we can
keep your mind out of your pants, and teach you to keep using the only muscle
that matters <i>first-"</i><br>
<br>
Armalin poked Tom in the forehead. "You might just grow up to have a future in
this. Carry on &ndash; <i>and <u>well done</u>."</i><br>
<br>
Tom couldn't keep the smile out of his voice as he turned back through a warm
sea of applause to the monitor. <i>"Legionnaires, this is <u>MTAC</u>. <u>Ultra
online</u>. Good work, everyone. Secure the area."</i><br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<br>
William was still unconscious when the elevator doors opened to allow Daria,
Jane and Quinn access to the personal quarters. "Nice digs," Jane remarked, a
low whistle passing her lips as she noted the paintings on the walls and the
sculpture around the area. "For an absolute bastard, he's got great taste in
art."<br>
<br>
"Then he can teach the Art Appreciation course in prison &ndash; when he's not
face-down on the laundry-room floor wondering where his pants went and the
'curious anteater' came from," Daria hissed. "Jodie &ndash; what have you found?"<br>
<br>
"I'm in everywhere but the executive-access section &ndash; and that's really
protected." Jodie said, still typing as she spoke. "I've downloaded everything
I can get my hands on to my machine &ndash; but Appleton lied when he said that he'd
unlocked the entire system."<br>
<br>
"Get what you can," Daria said, noticing with a start the way Charles couldn't
look Fran in the eye &ndash; and as she looked him directly in the eye, the way he
couldn't face her, either. "What's wrong with you?"<br>
<br>
Charles looked down at the unconscious form of William Appleton. "He is."<br>
<br>
"Hmph," muttered Jodie, drawing the attention of everyone there. <br>
<br>
Daria turned to Jodie. "You have something you'd like to add to the discussion,
Brainiac?"<br>
<br>
"Charles thinks that because he was a horny, sex-crazed little geek through
high school and up until he joined the Legion &ndash; and especially because of the
way you threatened him with your mental powers, which is valid to a point,
considering the section of his web site devoted to you &ndash; that he can see
himself, or a possible future of himself, in Appleton there," Jodie
pontificated, drawing the attention of everyone there. "It's just easier if you
get it all out in the open."<br>
<br>
Jodie turned to Daria. "That's not who he is anymore. He's still a teenage boy
&ndash; which means that he's got hormones and he'll ride anything that offers, given
the chance &ndash; but he's not the freak that all of you treated him as back at
Lawndale. He's grown four-point-one inches and put on 22.11 pounds of muscle in
the time between the day that LHS was bombed and today, and has cut his time
online at porn sites down by 99.57% from this time two years ago &ndash; that
accidental stop that you had at that one site back in June doesn't count. You
need a new anti-malware suite; I'll make a new one for you when we get back. He
also hasn't tried to cheat on that Langston girl once, and he's had 4, 396
confirmed opportunities in the past nine months, three weeks and two days to do
so, including eighty-four opportunities for sex when he and other Legionnaires
were at the Jerry Lewis Telethon in Las Vegas on Labor Day."<br>
<br>
The room was silent.<br>
<br>
"Actually, that figure only includes women who made clear, overt attempts to
offer you sexual favors," Josie continued; her fingers never left the keyboard.
"Counting women who gave you <i>very clear signals</i> that they were
interested in having sex with you, the number jumps to four hundred ninety-six,
and factoring in men who also gave you equal signals, the total number of
sexual opportunities that you were offered at the Telethon was 1,156.
Apparently, you've become something of a minor gay icon, and in this year's
July issue of <i>The Advocate,</i> you were voted number three in a poll of men
that straight men would 'go gay for'."<br>
<br>
"But how straight could they be if they read <i>The Advocate</i>?" Jane
smirked. "Jodie &ndash; do you read <i>The Advocate</i>?"<br>
<br>
"No, Polaris &ndash; I wasn't sublimating my desire for sex, nor am I interested in
experimenting sexually with any of you," Jodie said, taking her glasses off as
she turned to face her teammates. "Miss Lawrence has been traumatized by her
recent experiences, and while 'M' would prove more than satisfactory, her
passive-aggressive, somewhat caustic personality, one which she obviously uses
as a defensive measure to defend herself from the possibility of developing any
emotional involvements that could cause her pain, doesn't balance out the
overwhelming pleasure such an experience with her would provide."<br>
<br>
Daria drew back in shock. "Hey!"<br>
<br>
Jodie barreled on through a field of stunned stares. "Lightning Lass' has her
own matters to deal with involving this subject, 'Phantom' evidences a 74.54%
probability of being sexually frigid, barring mental or physical impediments we
are currently unaware of, and as for you, 'Polaris'-"<br>
<br>
Jane felt Jodie's brown eyes all but burn through her. "With all due respect &ndash;
and my condolences upon your recent relationship &ndash; I calculate only a 12.3%
possibility of you actually engaging in a sexual encounter with anyone,
regardless of gender, under any circumstances barring your being in a long-term
romantic relationship &ndash; said encounter involving actual penetration. <br>
<br>
Even Jodie was impressed by the way Jane didn't appear to be embarrassed.
"However, factoring in 'petting behavior' only, your chances of having an
intimate encounter jumps to a solid 79%. By cross-referencing a database of
known individuals that you would be most likely to engage in these encounters
with dating from your joining the Legion, that number goes up to 92.51% - with
'Inferno' - and 97.95% with M. Going by the analysis results, you two should have
already had a minimum of eleven sexual encounters in the past two years,
including seven with full physical intimacy."<br>
<br>
Quinn felt herself growing sick. "I need to sit down somewhere. Is there a
shower nearby &ndash; or a waterfall?"<br>
<br>
Charles felt as he had been dropped feet first into a giant deli meat-slicing
machine. Afraid to say anything, he simply stood back and hoped that Jodie
wouldn't talk about his sex life... or the beginnings of it.<br>
<br>
Jodie turned to see Tiffany tapping on her shoulder. "Yes?"<br>
<br>
"Are... you... still... <i>connected... </i>into... that... <i>computer...?"</i><br>
<br>
Jodie blew an errant lock of hair out of her eyes. "Yes-?"<br>
<br>
Tiffany looked at the micro-sized computer, and then, turned back to Jodie.
"Maybe... you... should... <i>stop."</i><br>
<br>
"Or at least stop talking and keep typing," Jane said. "Especially if you're
not going to say <i>who</i> you'd want to-"<br>
<br>
"Ultra'," Jodie answered without hesitation. "He's the most sexually
experienced member of the Legion to date and the most sexually experienced male
member &ndash; pun certainly intended &ndash; and his powers are the most well-suited for
providing the optimum sexual experience for a partner. His ability to channel
his energies into the power whimsically known as 'super-endurance' would ensure
that he remains-"<br>
<br>
<i>"Thank you,"</i> Jane said, cutting her teammate off. "Daria &ndash; read this
prick's mind so Jodie can have what she needs, and unplug herself from the
Matrix &ndash; <i>DON'T-"</i><br>
<br>
Jane turned and held up her hand before Jodie could get a word out "Don't &ndash; <i><u>say</u></i>
&ndash;<i>anything.</i> You &ndash; scan."<br>
<br>
She turned to Charles. "You &ndash; pick up that slug and put him in a chair
somewhere."<br>
<br>
Nodding, Charles shifted into the form of a massive silverback gorilla; he
easily picked up William and trundled over to a couch, where he deposited him
without ceremony and shifted back to human form. "Daria-"<br>
<br>
Daria waved him silent. "From what I saw with us and the <i>Planesrangers</i> &ndash;
and what a friend of mine showed me a while back concerning you &ndash; I think I can
cut you some slack," she told him. "If nothing else &ndash; for what you said about
Stacy the other day, I can cut you a break."<br>
<br>
Charles drew away from her as he recalled hanging out in Tom's room the night
before - <i>and realized what Daria had just let slip</i> &ndash; but wisely stayed
silent. "Charles-"<br>
<br>
Even Jodie took notice of Daria using that word as she continued. "Why don't
you take Fran out of here? You're not a pig like this guy. You want to be
better than he is &ndash; you're trying &ndash; and as far as I'm concerned, you already
are."<br>
<br>
Nodding, Charles escorted Fran to the elevator; just before they entered, Fran
took off the locket that she wore. <br>
<br>
"Thanks for helping with this," Charles said, watching as she tossed the locket
out the elevator door, "and for agreeing to let Daria mindlink us. It took a
lot of trust from you &ndash; and I couldn't have fooled him if you hadn't been
guiding me through all of it."<br>
<br>
Fran tried to smile, but failed. "I'll do whatever it takes."<br>
<br>
The doors to the elevator closed, and Charles looked at the tiny girl. "Fran &ndash;
about those recordings-"<br>
<br>
Charles hated himself as tears began to flow down Fran's cheeks. "There are so
many girls that he took advantage of," he continued. "When the police &ndash; when
the Feds step in, and they will, because he brought you here from California-"<br>
<br>
"All over," Fran said, the tears dripping. "We went all over the world
together. That &ndash; that &ndash; what you saw &ndash; that was from this summer, in Mazatl&aacute;n,
during the Memorial Day weekend last year. He wanted to go..."<br>
<br>
"There's so much evidence against him that one more case won't matter," Charles
said, "and with you in the Legion, the media's going to try and run you into
the ground, even though you're only seventeen; they'll find out who you are.
It'll be too sweet for someone to resist selling your name for a lot of money."<br>
<br>
Fran pressed back against the wall of the elevator, going white as a thought
went through her head. "My <u>aunt</u>... my <u>uncle</u>... they're going to see
this," Fran continued, her hands covering her face as she tried to block out
the images in her mind's eye. "They're going to find out... they're going to <i>see
what happened</i>...what I <u>did</u>... oh, God <i>- they're going to find out
what I did..."</i><br>
<br>
The tiny girl began to shake with tears, and Charles took her hand in his, not
drawing away as Fran went into his arms and began to sob. "It'll be all right,
Fran, he said, letting her cry. "You're part of the <u>Legion</u> now... we take
care of each other."<br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Daria wrinkled her brow. "That's odd."<br>
<br>
Jane turned to her. &quot;What's that?"<br>
<br>
Daria turned away from the unconscious William. "I'm picking up his surface
thoughts easily, but when I try to probe deeper, I'm being blocked."<br>
<br>
Jodie looked up from the terminal as Jane went over to Daria. "Blocked?" <br>
<br>
"In a strange way," Daria confirmed. "I can see all sorts of things in his
mind, but when I try to push in for information about this place whatsoever,
it's like a big, black wall comes up in his head."<br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
In Legion Ops, Tom whirled around as he heard Daria's comment. <i>"<u>What did
you just say</u>?"</i><br>
<br>
****<br>
<br>
<br>
Daria and Jane jumped at the sharpness of Tom's comment. "Ease up off the
decaf, Tommy boy," Jane said. "She said that she's-"<br>
<br>
"I'm not talking to you, Polaris &ndash; and this is important," Tom shot back. "M &ndash;
what you just said. When you try to do a deep scan on Appleton, <i><u>what
exactly are you visualizing</u>?</i> Is it a giant black wall, some sort of
huge barrier that separates you from something as if it's a force-field or a
barrier &ndash; or a wall, as in one wall of a giant cube or block?"<br>
<br>
Daria thought for a moment before speaking. "Umm... it's more of a &ndash; hey! It is a
giant black cube-"<br>
<br>
Tom's voice was as forceful as any of the other Legionnaires had ever heard it.
<i>"Step away from him <u>right now</u>, M. Polaris &ndash; don't let her scan him
again!"</i><br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Predictably, Daria exploded into pure, absolute anger.<br>
<br>
<i>"Who the hell do you think you are to talk to like that, Sloane?"</i> Daria
hissed, her voice full of venom. "You <i><u>DON'T</u></i> raise your voice and
dictate to me as if I'm one of &ndash;"<br>
<br>
"It's a <i>'trip box',</i> Daria!" Tom said, forgetting all about code-names as
he recalled his own experience with the psionic 'booby trap' in his own mind
from several months back. "It's a special kind of mental block that seals off
very important memories and information from even really powerful probes &ndash; and
if you try to push it, <i><u>it goes off</u>!"</i><br>
<br>
There were several seconds of dead silence before Daria's voice came through
the link. . "Would you define 'goes off' for us?" <br>
<br>
"The long and short of it? He dies, you get no info, and you either end up
brain-dead, lobotomized or just burned to a crisp by the backlash!" Tom could
see the way that Daria went pale on the screen. "If he's been set up with a
'trip box', someone's gone through an awful lot of trouble to keep his secrets
secure."<br>
<br>
Jane came into the conversation. "How do you know so much about this thing
anyway, Tom? Something you learned while you were off playing Jake Ryan's stunt
double in the off-world production of <i>Zombie High</i>?&quot;<br>
<br>
"No &ndash; I learned about those <i>here</i>. He can't be subjected to deep scans."
Tom let a tiny smile cross his face. "You can always tell Tiffany that you
heard him refer to her as <i>'Kobe beef walking'</i> &ndash; and watch her get info
out of him the old-fashioned way."<br>
<br>
Tom could hear the smile in Daria's reply. "We'll hold <u>that</u> in reserve,"
she said. "I won't try to scan him again."<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Jane saw Daria turn back to William, and she grasped her friend's arm as she
saw Daria's irises momentarily turn electric-blue. <i>"DARIA-! I thought that
you weren't going to scan him again-!"</i><br>
<br>
"I didn't," Daria said, the thin smile she wore only when she had mayhem and
manipulation on her mind suddenly present as she undid one of the leg pockets
on her uniform. "I keep my promises. You can say that I set us up with some... <i>insurance."</i><br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<br>
Having gained the access she needed (after linking her portable logic machine
to another computer at the Tower that the other Legionnaires hand no idea
existed until that moment), Jodie was busy at work on the Appleton main
computers from the terminal in William's quarters. <br>
<br>
After binding William's wrists and ankles with plastic restraints, Tiffany had
suggested that she check the couch for any weapons or means of escape that
William could use after waking up - as well as for other surprises that even a
person under restraint could use to turn the tables on them. <br>
<br>
"Stacy... likes... those... kinds... of... movies," the young Asian beauty said,
wrinkling her nose at the memory. <br>
<br>
The others agreed, and Tiffany spent several minutes using her powers (with
Jane's powers to help) removing a wealth of weapons and communications devices
from the immediate area where William had been placed &ndash; including several
heat-sensitive/ touch-sensitive panels embedded in every single piece of
furniture in the quarters, and a number of retina scan-capable devices that
could be activated by a simple, pre-set signal of his eyelids blinking. <br>
<br>
"Nice," Jodie said, quickly looking over one of the panels retrieved from the
couch. "These are combination heat sensor-enabled ID scanners &ndash; everyone has
their own unique heat-signature &ndash; and broadcast-quality two-way communications
suites made with nanotech systems imbedded throughout the microfibers. It's a
miniature, portable TV studio that records everything in the area."<br>
<br>
She tossed the panel back to Tiffany. "In all respects, this is only a couple
of steps down from the holographic generator panel-strips that they use to coat
the walls of the 'artificial reality' chambers at the Academy &ndash; or the
'rumble-cams' I built for use in our uniforms."<br>
<br>
She looked up at Daria and Jane, both of whom were fingering the Legion patches
firmly attached with Velcro backing to their uniforms &ndash; each patch, in
actuality, a removable nanotech-level, secure videocom system outfitted and
built to withstand the stresses of metahuman activities. "Not the VR
rooms,&quot; she continued. &quot;The 'artificial reality' training &ndash; oh, never
mind."<br>
<br>
Jodie placed the five-by-five-inch panel &ndash; designed with a passive cloaking
element, so that it would blend in almost anywhere &ndash; back in Tiffany's hand.
"You learned about these at the Academy?"<br>
<br>
"Kaliq's... learning... to... be... a... security... guy," Tiffany droned on. "He's...
okay... with... me... around."<br>
<br>
From listening in on Julia's conversations with her Academy friends, Jodie knew
Kaliq Murat to be a telepathic Iranian-American student at USAES who was in
Tiffany's training cadre, and who'd become a good friend of hers.<br>
<br>
<i>Tiffany's put what she's learned at that place to some good use,</i> Jodie
thought. <i>Maybe I could do the same - so to speak.</i> <br>
<br>
Jodie's fingers kept moving across the keyboard with a speed that would allow
her instant employment in data entry anywhere on Earth. <i>Haven't actually
been to the Academy yet, but I've met more than a few cadets from there. They
keep popping up as if Legion Tower's a vacation spot &ndash; and from some of the
looks I've gotten, as if I'm on the dinner menu!</i> <br>
<br>
A tiny smile peeked from behind the eerie, neutral expression she usually work.
<i>Sooner or later, I'll have to fly out there for a 'meet-and-greet'. You
never know. Lots of boys with super-strength and loads of endurance... after some
tutoring, they could prove... <u>useful</u>.</i><br>
<br>
<i>After all, even a super-girl with a super-intellect has the occasional... <u>needs</u>.</i><br>
<br>
Jodie's reverie was disrupted by Mack's voice coming through on the link.
"Jane, Daria, Quinn &ndash; we need you down in <i>Topeka."</i><br>
<br>
The Legionnaires could feel the pain in his voice. <i>"You need to come down
here <u>now</u>."</i><br>
<br>
"I'll... guard... him," Tiffany said, her eyes fastened upon William's form, now in
a deep sleep, courtesy of Daria. "If... he... tries... <i><u>anything</u>..."</i><br>
<br>
Jane nodded as she and the Morgendorffer sisters headed for the elevator.
"Amen."<br>
<br>
"I'll send you down to <i>Topeka,"</i> Jodie said. "That's listed here: Level
Two, Section Two - <i>'Subject Containment Area Beta &ndash; Class Two and Three
subjects only'.</i> That does not sound good."<br>
<br>
