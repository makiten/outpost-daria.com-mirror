<i>Shanghalla. Ever since there were metahumans working for the government,
there was Shanghalla &ndash; the final resting place for the heroes. There are sick
people in the world, people who would do anything to get hold of a metahuman's
body &ndash; especially a famous one, or someone who was really powerful &ndash; and then,
the bad guys would trash the place on general principle. Because of that, it
became one of the most secure places on Earth.<br>
<br>
Shanghalla is a place that, thank God, I rarely had cause to visit. It was
unavoidable, though, if you were going to be in this line of work.<br>
<br>
When it comes to sex, they say that you always remember your first time. I
guess that sex and death really are similar &ndash; because I've never forgotten my
first visit there. <br>
<br>
I'll never forget who we buried there, either. He was never a superhero, he
never did anything of the sort, he wasn't even human &ndash; but if it hadn't been
for him, none of this would have ever existed. A hero's funeral, and the Torn
Cape Ceremony, was the least we could do for him.<br>
<br>
-from <b>The Collected Diaries of Anastasia Rowe, Legionnaire</b></i><br>

<br>
<br>
<i>And it seems to me you lived your life<br>
Like a candle in the wind<br>
Never knowing who to cling to<br>
When the rain set in<br>
And I would have liked to have known you<br>
But I was just a kid<br>
Your candle burned out long before<br>
Your legend ever did<br>

*****<br>
<br>
<br>
Daria vomited the second that the elevator door opened.<br>
<br>
"What the hell-?" Jane shrieked, she and Quinn catching Daria before she fell
against the wall or the elevator. "Daria, what's wrong?"<br>
<br>
Daria began cleaning herself off as Sandi's voice rang out, colder and sharper
than Jane had ever heard it before. "Come and see for yourself, Jane."<br>
<br>
"It was &ndash; it was like a knife was just rammed into my head," Daria whispered,
fighting to suppress the avalanche of pain exploding through her mind as Jane
and Quinn helped her off the elevator &ndash; and into a nightmare. "There were all
of these thoughts... oh, God, Jane, <i>they're all screaming..."</i><br>
<br>
The three girls stepped out into a corridor that consisted of two levels, the
second with walkways accessible by staircases and electric lifts. The corridor
was thirty yards wide, and easily the length of a football field...<br>
<br>
The area was full of holding cells that ran the entire length of the corridor
on both levels &ndash; and each enclosed cell held an animal.<br>
<br>
As Jane, Quinn and Daria walked to the spot where the other Legionnaires were
congregated &ndash; at one of the 'supply stations' (there were six, with two at the
mid-point of the corridor, and the remaining four positioned opposite one
another one-quarter of the way from either end of the corridor &ndash; Jane noticed
something that was truly frightening.<br>
<br>
Even though there were literally hundreds of animals held in the area; dogs and
cats, raccoons, squirrels, groundhogs, owls, foxes &ndash; and the majority of the
ones that were able to move about seemed to be trying to catch their attention...<br>
<br>
...but there was no sound. The corridor was dead silent, save the sounds the
Legionnaires made. <br>
<br>
The Legionnaires, including Charles and Fran (and Daria felt a slight swell of
anger as she saw them &ndash; <i>why didn't you take her back to the Tower?</i>),
were at the station nearest to the elevator on the right-hand side of the
corridor, barely acknowledging the arrival of the three original members as
they looked about the area with increasing horror...<br>
<br>
"Oh, God," Brittany said, crossing herself as she saw a badger inside one
holding cell writhe in pain as it exploded into blue-white flame, its eyes
showing that it was beyond insane from the pain even as the hideous burns it
suffered healed instantly, and its fur grew back at a frightening rate-<br>
<br>
The badger's mouth opened wide with a soundless howl of pain as it arched
itself and exploded into a larger fireball. As the Legionnaires watched, it
rolled about in agony as the flames filled the holding cell, briefly
illuminating the area in front of the cell as the unfortunate creature's fur
and flesh were seared from its body once more. <br>
<br>
"This isn't right...this is so &ndash; <i><u>so mean</u>! It's <u>Evil</u>!"</i>
Brittany cried out, unable to turn away from the sight of the badger as a third
flash of blue-white light lit up the holding cell and it continued to undulate
with unending pain. "Who would do this to these poor animals?"<br>
<br>
"Someone who I'm going to enjoy snapping handcuffs on," Julia growled,
fingering the thigh pocket where her provisional FBI badge rested, and
momentarily nursing the thought of taking her service pistol (in the closet
safe in her quarters, back at Legion Tower) across the temple of anyone who
could walk even once down this corridor and still call themselves human. <br>
<br>
<i>Don't fool yourself, Carlyle,</i> she thought, as she saw a tiny brown
streak in a holding cell stop for the briefest of instances &ndash; it was a
squirrel, bone-thin, unable to remain still, moving so fast (even while
attempting to stand still) that it took the use of her enhanced vision to
perceive that it actually was a squirrel.<br>
<br>
The squirrel stood still, in normal speed, for less than three seconds &ndash; and
then, blurred out as it once again shifted into hyper-speed. <i>Each and every
one of those bastards <u>resigned</u> from humanity when they stepped out of
this area, and <u>didn't</u> go directly to the police and the media.</i> <br>
<br>
<i>I might learn to like her after all,</i> Daria observed, as she passed by
Julia and caught her thoughts.<br>
<br>
"They soundproofed the entire damned place," Sandi said, unable to take her
eyes off a large Persian cat with sparkling, snow white fur... a cat that simply
sat primly and watched them with unblinking eyes. <br>
<br>
Daria, supported by Jane, approached the cat's holding cell. "Oh, God, Daria,"
she said, moving closer. "The cat ... <i>it's crying."</i><br>
<br>
"That's impossible," Jodie said through the link <i>"Cats do not shed tears as
an emotional response!"</i><br>
<br>
"This one does," Mack said, reading from one of several thick three-ring
binders he had found at the supply station. "Subject FW-CF-117 &ndash; <i>'Powder'</i>.
Species: <i>Felis catus.</i> Breed and gender: Persian/male. Approximate age:
one year at time of procurement. Means of procurement &ndash; purchased from
independent contractor after random sweep for feral animals. Paranormal
activation protocol: genetic augmentation procedure 0012 &ndash; mental enhancement.
Subject shows signs of exhibiting uninterruptable empathic ability allowing
subject to monitor of emotional states of all beings within a 100-meter radius;
subject shows signs of exhibiting tactile-activated empathic ability, allowing
subject to initiate viable communications with other species. <i>DO NOT COME IN
CONTACT WITH SUBJECT UNLESS WEARING PSI-RESISTANT COVERINGS. AVOID ALL DIRECT
CONTACT WITH SUBJECT UNLESS NECESSARY."</i><br>
<br>
As Daria turned to face the cat, her autonomic power of immediate
language-fluency kicked in; a soft, desperate voice rose up in her mind.<br>
<br>
<b>==You can hear me. You hurt &ndash; you hurt, too, but you can hear me.==</b><br>
<br>
Daria knelt down in front of the cat. <b>&gt;&gt;I can hear you.&lt;&lt;</b><br>
<br>
The cat's voice was clear, and desperate; she suddenly remembered how she felt
in the first days of having her powers, hearing voices &ndash; and how she felt when
she found that her parents wanted to have her committed. <b>==I want to go
home, I want to go home, I want to go home.==</b><br>
<br>
<i>Oh, God. This is what it would have been like for me in that place,</i>
Daria thought, remembering how, after her telepathic power had manifested, her
parents wanted to institutionalize her for observation and tests to check and
see if she was schizophrenic. <i>They would have locked me away like this, in a
little room. I would have sat there, hearing everyone's thoughts, and I would
have slowly gone crazy.</i><br>
<br>
The cat continued in mind-speech. <b>==Nobody touches me. Nobody pets me. They
took me out of the yard. They took me. I want my family. They stick me with the
sharp things. They pick me up with the cold metal hands. They hurt me. They
hurt everybody. They hurt. Everyone hurts. Make it stop. You can hear me. Make
it all stop. Make them stop hurting. I want to go home. I want my family. I
want to go home. I want to go home.==</b><br>
<br>
Daria looked into the cat's eyes; refusing to give way to the tears that
Brittany and Quinn had allowed - even as the cat put a single paw against the
clear observation wall, quiet desperation in its eyes.<br>
<br>
She placed her hand to his paw. <b>&gt;&gt;If I can,&lt;&lt; she told the cat,
&gt;&gt;I'll see that you go home. Tell me everything that happened.&lt;&lt;</b><br>
<br>
The cat's irises began to glow with the same brilliant blue witchfire that
filled Daria's irises as Daria's mind opened up to the cat's power &ndash; <i>they
missed that he's also a telepath, too,</i> she thought &ndash; as the furry
prisoner's lifetime of memories flowed into her head. <br>
<br>
<b>&gt;&gt;Let me help you,&lt;&lt;</b> she told him.<b> &gt;&gt;Do you
remember the fence in your family's backyard, the solid one of wood that kept
that collie out? Think of that fence in your head. Think of your family putting
it up for you; every single piece around the basket that you slept in. Go and
lay down in your basket; let them put the fence up around the basket. Every
time you feel the hurt, watch them put up another part until all of the hurt
goes away.&lt;&lt;</b><br>
<br>
"What's she doing?" Stacy asked, drawing back from the sight of Daria and the
cat with identical, glowing eyes.<br>
<br>
"She's in a mindlink &ndash; probably helping the poor cat put up his mental
shields," Julia answered, remembering how more than a few Academy telepaths
ended up in the hospital after having a 'breach' &ndash; a failure of their basic
mental shields, the ones that protected a telepath from the overwhelming
thoughts of everyone in the area around them. "The poor furball developed
psi-powers, and didn't know what was happening to him - let alone how to
control any of it." <br>
<br>
The glow in Daria's eyes faded. The cat's eyes lost their shimmer as well, and
he rubbed against the wall where Daria's hand had rested before lying down
against a wall in a soft ball, the tension and pain seemingly gone from his
tiny body. <br>
<br>
Daria rose from the front of the holding cell. "Before this is over... <i>I &ndash; am
- going &ndash; to - make &ndash; someone &ndash; hurt &ndash; for &ndash; this."</i><br>
<br>
"Yes," Sandi said, looking at the resting animal, and remembering her own pet.
"Oh, yes."<br>
<br>
As Daria brushed off her knees, Mack &ndash; having flipped through several pages in
his book, was walking towards the halfway point of the corridor, counting off
the numbers on the clear front walls of the enclosures. "Guys. Look at this.
Jodie &ndash; can you get a feed off any of the cameras in this area?"<br>
<br>
<i>"They're running 24/7 camera surveillance throughout the entire complex,
except the sleeping quarters in Kansas City,"</i> Jodie's voice rang out in all
of their heads. <i>"I've been running live feeds to MTAC for the past six
minutes."</i><br>
<br>
Mack's voice was sharp and bitter as he looked directly at the small, plastic
sphere at eye-level in the wall beside him; with a sense of disbelief, he
suddenly noticed what had been obvious all along &ndash; that he was looking into a
camera, and that the entire corridor &ndash; the ceiling, the walls the interior of
every cell &ndash; was lined with cameras, giving complete and constant coverage of
everything that was happening there. <br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Back at <i>Legion Tower</i>, the men and women in Legion MTAC were beyond angry
at the images coming through of the abused animals.<br>
<br>
"Focus, everyone!" Tom barked, surprising everyone (including himself) at his
tone. "I don't want to hear anyone hissing 'evil animal researchers' again,
either!" <br>
<br>
A young woman &ndash; a part of the Legion training cadre, Tom remembered - flushed
bright pink as Tom looked directly at her. "'Voice of reason', everyone. This
is something entirely beyond 'normal research' &ndash; <i>right?" </i><br>
<br>
The woman rushed out of the room, and Tom shook his head. "Sergeant Nemec &ndash;
she's about to do something stupid. Do you mind?" <br>
<br>
As the former marine NCO left Legion MTAC &ndash; an overly pleased look on her face
as she took off the headset she wore and headed for the exit &ndash; Tom turned back
to the screen. "What did you just say, Inferno?"<br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<br>
"They're all part of the same litter," Mack said as he pointed out several
holding cells, each holding a puppy several months old. "Subjects H-S2-201
though 211. They were chosen for this test simply because their mother had a
larger-than-normal litter."<br>
<br>
Mack turned a page in the folder and looked directly into one of the multitude
of cameras, managing to rise above the anger he felt as he watched one of the
puppies standing up on its hind legs, wagging its tail furiously as it tried to
get his attention. "They're testing some sort of formula that reduces the
body's need for food and water. Their test deals with giving most of the dogs
given different amounts of the formula after they were weaned off their mother.
Two are control animals. One was fed normally and given no formula, they gave
another nothing but the formula - and then, they starved and denied water to
the rest of the litter for five days in order to record the levels of --
'physical distress'."<br>
<br>
Mack put down the folder. "This is the eleventh round of tests with this
formula. And the eleventh litter of pups. <i>Ultra</i> &ndash; tell the Colonel that
we could use some backup down here to deal with this. Remember?" <br>
<br>
<i>"Roger that, Inferno. I'm on that."</i><br>
<br>
The dam behind Quinn's emotions burst fully at that moment. "We have to let
them go!" she cried out. "We have to get them all out of here &ndash; we have to let
them all go!"<br>
<br>
Daria's voice rang out through the corridor. "We can't."<br>
<br>
Julia looked at Daria as if she were insane. "Daria &ndash; I know that you can be
cold, but not even you can think that this is a good thing and-"<br>
<br>
Daria ignored Julia as her right hand rose from her side. <i>"Quinn. <u>Resemble
anyone you know</u>?"</i><br>
<br>
Julia fell silent as her gaze followed Daria's pointed finger to the first
holding cell, past the last of the litter of puppies (a brown and gold hound
lying listless on the floor of his cell, his ribs showing through his skin) to
see a skunk inside. "It's a skunk," she snorted. "What's so special about a &ndash;
oh, my God." <br>
<br>
As Julia remembered the meaning behind the small animal, Quinn &ndash; not even
realizing that she had walking over to the cell - found herself kneeling in
front of the skunk that looked so very familiar. Her heart nearly jumped up
into her throat as she recalled that morning, so long ago:<br>
<br>
<br>
<i><span style='color:blue'>"Why the hell are you here?" said Daria. <br>
<br>
"Mom wants you. She's been trying to call Jane for the last fifteen minutes,
and someone picked up the phone but she couldn't understand what he was saying.
Something about boats." <br>
<br>
"That was Trent," said Jane. "Probably dreaming about being a submarine captain
again." <br>
<br>
"Why does Mom want me home so badly that she sent you over here?" <br>
<br>
"She figured you had been gone too long." <br>
<br>
"This is Saturday," said Daria. <br>
<br>
"Yeah. But Mom has a day off and she's decided that she wants the whole family
together, and God knows why. Hey, look!!" <br>
<br>
Everyone turned. A rabbit was chewing on the overgrown grass at the edge of the
Lane back yard. <br>
<br>
"It's a rabbit. We have those every now and then," said Jane. <br>
<br>
"It's so cute! We never have anything in our back yard! Here bunny bunny
bunny!"</span></i><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Quinn leaned in closer, her eyes blinking as she saw not the interior of the
cell, but some bushes in the thickly wooded area behind Casa Lane:<br>
<br>
<br>
<i><span style='color:blue'>There was one bush, it was moving, and the rabbit
had to be near it. <br>
<br>
"Oh, you're so cute! Here little rabbit! I have some grass for you!!" When
Quinn began to resort to baby talk, Daria and Jane began to sneak up quietly
behind Quinn, to scream at the most appropriate moment. <br>
<br>
Quinn got closer to the rabbit. Daria and Jane got close to Quinn. <br>
<br>
Daria and Jane screamed! Quinn leapt two feet in terror!</span></i><br>
<br>
<br>
The interior of the holding cell exploded with light &ndash; exactly the way it had
happened so long ago, on the day that changed her life forever - as the skunk,
looking for food, saw Quinn's face close to the wall... <br>
<br>
<br>
<i><span style='color:blue'>...As the skunk, looking for food, decided that he
was now under attack... and should defend himself.</span></i><br>
<br>
<br>
Quinn fell away from the holding cell, sat back on the floor and simply stared
at the enclosed skunk &ndash;<br>
<br>
<br>
<i><span style='color:blue'>-Who was happy that the threat was gone, and chose
that moment to resume his foraging for food.</span></i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>"It's him,"</i> she said, her voice barely audible, even in the eerie quiet
of the corridor that was 'Topeka'. "It's <i><u>him</u>."</i><br>
<br>
Mack, having heard the story of the 'electric skunk' before and still (even
after what he'd seen and been through) a little skeptical, looked as if he had
just seen a UFO land in front of him. "It's true. <i>It's the skunk."</i><br>
<br>
Jane was a bit calmer as she looked at the animal. <i>"Yeah. <u>That's the one
who got us</u>."</i><br>
<br>
Daria slid the folder Mack had from his suddenly loose fingers, and began
flipping pages. "Yes - and no. 'Subject #71282005-1:09 &ndash; <i>'Fuzzems'.</i>
Fourth-generation genetic replicate of 'Subject #71282005-1:05 &ndash;<i>'Cuddles'</i>.
Paranormal activation protocol: augmentation method 0004 &ndash; energy generation.
NOTE: ALL subjects in this genetic strain display evidence of augmentation
methods 0003, 0004, and 0014. <i><u>IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE RISK OF ACCIDENTAL
GENETIC AUGMENTATION, SUBJECT SHOULD BE HANDLED THROUGH REMOTE ACCESS ONLY</u>."</i><br>
<br>
Daria felt herself go cold. "It's a <i>clone.</i> Julia &ndash; Jane. Go get Appleton
&ndash; <i>and bring Tiffany with him."</i><br>
<br>
Jane looked into Daria eyes &ndash; and without another word, nodded, and started
towards the elevator as Julia turned to Daria.<br>
<br>
"Daria-" Julia began.<br>
<br>
"Go with her - <i>Archangel."</i><br>
<br>
The tall redhead looked around the corridor at the suffering animals, and then,
turned her gaze back to Daria. "Okay."<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<br>
Colonel Armalin stepped into the room on the ninth floor of <i>Legion Tower</i>,
and closed the door behind him. "Mackenzie considers you 'backup'", he said,
looking at the figure bound to the bed by sturdy restraints.<br>
<br>
He closed his eyes, took a deep breath &ndash; and when he opened his eyes, his
pupils were glowing with a bluish hue &ndash; a sign that his telepathic power was
active. "Let's talk."<br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Jodie shuddered as William, a piece of duct tape covering his mouth, began to
struggle as he saw Tiffany, a black drawstring bag in hand, prepare to put it
over his head. <br>
<br>
Tiffany turned William's head so he could look into her eyes; she held his gaze
for a few seconds, turned to look at the bag, and then, turned back to him. <i>"Orrrrrrr...elseeeeee."</i><br>
<br>
Having learned how to accurately read people over the years, William recognized
the signs of a person who meant exactly what they said - and immediately
stopped moving, remaining still so that Tiffany could slip the bag over his
head. <br>
<br>
"No... <i><u>sounds</u></i>... or... <i>move... ment,"</i> she said. "No... <i>sigggggg...nalssss...</i>
orrrrr... elseeeeee."<br>
<br>
"As much as I'd love to see the 'or else' part &ndash; Daria wants Appleton
downstairs," Julia said, stepping from the elevator. "She wants you down there,
too, Tiffany. After you see what's down there &ndash; she may let you have him as a
scratching post. <br>
<br>
As the Legionnaires took Appleton into the elevator and the doors closes, Jodie
turned back to the computer terminal.<br>
<br>
A panel in the ceiling behind her slid open silently, and Elijah Russell
watched from his perch as the young woman worked at the terminal.<br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<br>
"Look at them."<br>
<br>
Daria, the mental screens of her Mark 30 active to protect her from the
overwhelming thoughts of the animals, watched as a Sphinx cat with gills swam
around in its water-filled holding pen, the environmental reprocessors filling
the pen with bubbles. "These animals have no place in the world."<br>
<br>
"What do you mean, Daria?" Brittany sniffled, wiping hard at her tear-streaked
face. <br>
<br>
"What she means is that the last time some 'do-gooders' like you blew in here,
they released hundreds of test animals into the open."<br>
<br>
The Legionnaires turned to see William, flanked by Tiffany and Julia, as they
exited the elevator. "Why isn't he gagged or something?" Jane asked, as the three
approached.<br>
<br>
"Because I'm not a fool," the man spoke up, shooting a sideways glance at
Tiffany, who never took her eyes off him. "I plan on walking out of here on my
own power."<br>
<br>
"Tiffany, heel," Jane said, noticing how even Sandi was slightly unnerved by
the predatory gleam in Tiffany's eyes &ndash; <i>damn, she really wants him to try
something. It'll give her <u>an excuse</u>.</i><br>
<br>
"Plans change," Daria said simply. "Talk."<br>
<br>
William sized Daria up, and some of his bravado returned. "On what subject, my
dear? Female undergarments? I must admit, you don't seem the type to sport
anything in the V.L. Riley 'Mystique' catalogue... but those photos show that you
wear it well."<br>
<br>
His view was suddenly blocked, and he looked into a pair of wild brown eyes
he'd seen once before, long ago. "Answer the woman," Stacy growled, "and
without being funny."<br>
<br>
"What you're doing here is worlds beyond simple drug or product research,"
Daria said, noting how William immediately focused on her instead of Stacy and
Tiffany, who were giving him looks that dared him to glance in either
direction. "This entire place is worlds beyond simple research."<br>
<br>
Daria took a step forward. "You're developing ways to create powers &ndash; a world
of powers, it looks like &ndash; but you haven't gotten it down yet, or you've got a
lot of failures-"<br>
<br>
"Or you aren't thinking anywhere nearly as big as you need to," the man said
with disdain. "You want to know why I'm doing all of this? <i>Turn to your
left."</i><br>
<br>
The Legionnaires (except for Tiffany; William suppressed a shudder as she continued
to start at him) watched as Daria turned to her left &ndash; and came face-to-face
with her reflection in a highly polished metal panel on the wall beside her.
"That's why I'm doing all of this... <i>because of all of you."</i><br>
<br>
"What the hell are you talking about?" Mack asked, moving closer to William.
"What do you mean, 'because of us?'" <br>
<br>
"I'm not talking about you, <i>mutant,"</i> William said, dismissing him
without preamble as he turned to look Julia in the eye, "although a family line
such as <i><u>yours</u></i> is worth studying. You're in one of <i>the Twelve
Clans</i>, aren't you? The <i>Clan Carlyle</i>; your appearance and wings are
like fingerprints to my people."<br>
<br>
Charles stopped Julia before she could speak; as they talked quietly, William
turned back to Daria. "I assume that you can't scan me &ndash; because you would have
already, if you could. I'm not telling you little bitches and punks anything,
except this: <i>you're trespassing.</i> You've violated God knows how many laws
including felony destruction of property, computer espionage, kidnapping,
unlawful search and seizure, unlawful restraint, mob action, felony assault,
God knows how much property destruction-"<br>
<br>
The man didn't even flinch as Brittany all but screeched "And you've been <i><u>torturing</u>
animals!"</i><br>
<br>
A sigh escaped from William. "Performing research on test subjects legally
acquired. You don't have a leg to stand on, none of you have the legal
authority to do a single thing to me, and since you-"<br>
<br>
Charles cut him off as he glanced in Julia's direction. "I believe that the
lovely Miss Carlyle has something that she would like to show you."<br>
<br>
William let a lecherous smile cross his face &ndash; one that dropped away as Julia
brought out her FBI credentials. "I never leave home without it," the redhead
said, her smile hard. "You probably know your Miranda rights, you bastard.
Let's hear them!"<br>
<br>
The glare he threw in Julia's direction could have melted the Arctic. "You
bitch, I'll have my-"<br>
<br>
"Threatening a federal officer," Julia snipped. "That's going to be another
lump of coal in your stocking. Let's take it from the top."<br>
<br>
William scowled at Julia, than spat out, <i>"You have the right to remain
silent. Anything you say or do can and will be used against you in a court of
law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will
be appointed to you. Do you understand these rights as they have been read to
you?"</i><br>
<br>
"Very good," Julia said, and William winced as Julia grasped the upper part of
his left arm. "Keep going."<br>
<br>
William looked as if he could chew through diamonds. <i>"You can decide at any
time from this moment on to terminate the interview and exercise these rights."</i><br>
<br>
<i>"Very</i> good," Julia said, mocking him. "What else?"<br>
<br>
The man looked away from Julia as he snarled, <i>"Do you understand each of
these rights I have explained to you? Having these rights in mind, do you wish
to talk to us now?"</i><br>
<br>
"Wow, you should have become a soulless lawyer, instead of a piece-of-****
corporate head who doesn't mind causing widespread pain and suffering to get
profitable products out there on the market," Julia replied. "Now &ndash; <u>our
bonus round</u>! <i>Do you understand each of these rights that <u>you</u> have
just explained to <u>us</u>?</i> Come on, be honest..."<br>
<br>
<i>I am so going to buy her a beer for this</i>, Jane thought, smiling as she
watched William - wincing in pain from the way Julia held his arm &ndash; at which
point Julia released him and repeated her question <br>
<br>
"Yes," William hissed. "I understand."<br>
<br>
"Great!" Julia said. "Now, having these rights in mind, do you wish to talk to
us now about <i><u>exactly</u> how much of an animal-abusing, underage
girl-molesting, hell-blowing-open-once-you-get-there, absolute bastard you
really are?"</i><br>
<br>
William looked Julia directly in the eye; any sense of composure vanished with
his retort. "Go <i>fuck</i> yourself, Bureau whore."<br>
<br>
"You're about to hurt my feelings," Julia replied. " Am I <i>too old</i> for
you? I'm arresting you for multiple violations of Article Seventeen of the <i>1982
Bowman Act</i>, at least one confirmed violation of Article Five of the <i>1985
Bowman Act</i> - unlawful confinement and experimentation upon living beings
afforded sentient or near-sentient status on the Keller scale; that cat
probably <b>hates</b> you, by the way - God knows how many violations of 18
U.S.C. &#167; 2257 &ndash; <i>the Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act of 1988</i>,
and <i><u>all related multiple felony charges that causes me to invoke 2257</u></i>...
and last but not least &ndash; conspiracy to violate <i>Titles One</i> and <i>Ten</i>
of the <i>USA PATRIOT Act</i>. You might end up losing this entire facility &ndash;
those federal asset forfeiture statutes are a bitch."<br>
<br>
As Julia spoke, she undid the plastic restraints William wore &ndash; and as the
Legionnaires watched with approval, William grunted as the redhead pressed him
into a wall and snapped a pair of handcuffs on him. "A girl should always have
a real set of charm bracelets on hand &ndash; oh, almost forgot," she continued,
"there's also conspiracy to attempted murder, conspiracy to multiple attempts
of kidnapping, and <i>Title Eight</i> of the <i>USA PATRIOT Ac</i>t. <b>That's</b>
for listening in on my friends, and trying to bag them."<br>
<br>
William grunted as Julia turned him back around to face her. "That's better.
You're going away for all time. Ultra &ndash; do me a favor."<br>
<br>
Tom's voice came through to her loud and clear. <i>"I'm listening."</i><br>
<br>
"Get on the line to FBI Headquarters in D.C. and ask to speak to the Director,"
she said. "Pull rank and have the Colonel do it, if you have to. Tell the
Director what's happened, where we are &ndash;that they need to send a PELT-certified
Special Agent along with him &ndash; and that they need to keep their trip in quiet.
I know that's a joke, but still..."<br>
<br>
William laughed in her face. "Stupid bitch! I'll never see the inside of a jail
cell - <i>Ooooof!"</i><br>
<br>
He grunted with pain as Julia kicked his feet out from beneath him, making him
drop on his bottom. "I'm sorry - my foot slipped," Julia replied smoothly.
"Tiffany, would you and Stacy take him back to his quarters, and wait with him
there for the FBI? I'll be back up in a bit."<br>
<br>
"Not even a night!" William laughed. "I'm going to hold a huge press conference,
and oh, I'm going to scream to the entire world about-"<br>
<br>
Quinn jabbed William in the neck with her left index and middle fingers, and
the man squealed, jerking and wetting himself as a tiny arc of electricity
enveloped him. "What?" she said, looking up at the other Legionnaires. "He just
kept going, and going, and going..."<br>
<br>
The Leader of the Legion focused her attention on Fran, who (she had just
noticed) had returned to normal size; apparently not wanting to be noticed by
Appleton, she had shrunken down and hid. "Chameleon," she said; Charles turned
to her. <i>"Take Fran back to the Tower. </i>Have Sergeant Nemec stay with her;
I suddenly have a bad feeling."<br>
<br>
Stacy hefted Appleton over her shoulder and followed Tiffany down the corridor,
with Charles and Fran following a good distance behind; Daria had already
dismissed the unconscious man from her mind as she returned her attention to
the imprisoned animals.<br>
<br>
"We got him, Daria," Jane spoke out, as she walked over to her best friend.
"Don't pay attention to what that jackass said. For everything that he did to
Fran alone and the videos that he made of it &ndash; he's going away, and not to a
country club prison."<br>
<br>
"That doesn't help any of these guys... does it, Jane?" Daria moved down to
another holding cell - this one containing a Tufted Capuchin monkey who was
keeping himself occupied by projecting broadcast-quality holographs of various
places &ndash; lightly wooded enclosures, pools of water, a home with a
thirty-something man in a wheelchair...<br>
<br>
As they watched, Daria and Jane noted the way the monkey seemed sad as he
stared at the image of the man; the monkey created solid-light versions of
objects that, six seconds after creation, became real &ndash; an orange, a urinal, a
flyswatter &ndash; but every time he offered it to the man, the projected illusion
shattered, and the offered item also disappeared. <br>
<br>
"Now that's a handy trick," Jane said. <br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<br>
The elevator doors opened to admit Stacy, Tiffany and William to his quarters &ndash;
and the Legionnaires chose not to even bother asking about the unconscious,
bound form of Elijah Russell on the opposite side of the desk, or why he looked
as if he'd been trampled by a herd of buffalo. <br>
<br>
"I've been going through the files, and roughly two years ago, they had a major
security breach here, just as Appleton said earlier," Jodie continued, nodding
to her teammates as they sat William back on the couch and placed the black bag
over his head again. "Some activists apparently got in here and released
hundreds of animals, including the skunk that got you. They ended up getting
killed for their trouble. "<br>
<br>
Jane's voice came through clearly. <i>"These bastards killed them?"</i><br>
<br>
Jodie's response sent shudders through the Legionnaires. "They didn't get the
chance. The activists had just begun letting the bigger animals go when they
caused a lockdown, about thirty minutes in &ndash; the security they had back then
was pathetic, if they could go a full half-hour without being noticed. They got
locked in, and, well... it's not pretty."<br>
<br>
Stacy, coming up to the desk where Jodie was working, saw a glimpse of the
autopsy photos of a young woman &ndash; almost a third of her body had been eaten -
and turned away. Quickly. <br>
<br>
Jodie glanced up at her teammate's reaction, shrugged, and continued on with
her report to the others. "Apparently, the animals that didn't make it out were
more in step with the realities of nature then the animal activists were - and
didn't share their uninformed feelings about the rights of all creatures, great
and small, to 'live and let live'."<br>
<br>
She clicked over to a photo of a Lawndale State University student ID, several
pinpricks of blood still visible on the young woman's photo. "Apparently, they
never saw the cautionary tale for animal activists that is the film <i>Grizzly
Man."</i><br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<br>
Mack let a whistle escape his lips. "Damn, Jodie, that's cold." <i>Guess it's a
good thing we broke up &ndash; I'd have frozen 'Air Jordan' off if I'd have taken a
dip in there. She's definitely her mother's daughter, especially after she got
her powers.</i><br>
<br>
Daria's eyes went wide as she caught Mack's thought, but brushed it off as
Jodie continued to speak. <i>"I'm looking at the autopsy reports. They didn't
die well &ndash; and what was left of them is stored over in 'Lawrence' &ndash; the <u>human
experiment</u> wing."</i><br>
<br>
Jodie's words caused the Legionnaires to snap into focus. "The <i><u>what</u></i>?"
Daria asked.<br>
<br>
<i>"Subject Containment Area Alpha,"</i> Jodie's voice rang out. "Head out the
main door, and turn to your right. They store the remains there, and keep the
others in cryo-suspension. Hmm - they've managed to work out the
crystallization issues. I'll have to download those files for later-"<br>
<br>
<i>"JODIE!"</i> Jane's voice was an explosion that actually rattled Jodie.
"They have people locked up in there &ndash; like this &ndash; <i>any reason you're NOW
just mentioning it to us?"</i><br>
<br>
<i>"Because they have a number of bodies in cold storage, six people in
cryo-stasis &ndash; and because people seem to have a stronger sense of moral outrage
when they see other animals in torment than their fellow humans,"</i> Jodie
replied. <i>"No one there is in dire need of anything. These creatures,
however, need immediate help."</i><br>
<br>
Mack spoke up. "Speaking of which &ndash; Ultra, that backup I asked about-"<br>
<br>
As if on cue, Danielle Todds &ndash; the Ringbearer that the Legionnaires had fought
days earlier &ndash; appeared in a disappearing flash of light. <br>
<br>
"Hello &ndash; <i>Master Ringbearer,"</i> Mack said &ndash; instantly noticing that the
Ringbearer's eyes were now a brilliant, ocean blue, that her skin was pale, her
hair was a homey-brown shade - she was also a good four inches taller. <i>She's
using a 'glamour' &ndash; so Quinn won't connect her with her counterpart here.</i>
"Are we good?"<br>
<br>
Danielle turned in a slow, complete circle, taking in the area, before
directing her attention back to Mack. "We're good for now," she said, her <i>Defender
Ring</i> leaping from Mack's hand and coming to rest on her right ring finger.
"<u>Another</u> <i>Appleton Industries</i> lab, eh? Talk about 'the fruit of
the poisoned tree'."<br>
<br>
The entire area was awash with a blue light that flowed from the Ring. "This
company is starting to become a real pain everywhere we turn," she thought
aloud. "They're not at the level of <i>Weyland-Yutani, Aztechnology</i> or God
forbid, those bastards at <i>Roxxon</i> &ndash; at least <u>not yet</u> - but still..."<br>
<br>
The blue light faded, and Mack walked up to the Ringbearer. "Find something?"<br>
<br>
Danielle nodded gravely. "Yes - I did. Do you remember Canberra &ndash; just after
the <i>Great Zack Walkabout</i> began?"<br>
<br>
Mack visibly shuddered as the Ringbearer pointed to a holding cell on the upper
level, near the far end of the corridor, where a blue glow illuminated the
interior. "These people are <b>very</b> lucky," she continued. <i>"Up there."</i><br>
<br>
The Ringbearer started to walk towards the holding cell; the Legionnaires began
to walk after her, but Mack held his hand out to stop them. "If you don't have
a very strong stomach &ndash; you don't want to see this," he told his teammates.
"You guys don't &ndash; you shouldn't have to see this."<br>
<br>
Mack looked Jane dead in the eye. "This is what Tom had to deal with, Jane.
This is what he had to see on a daily basis."<br>
<br>
Jane didn't back down. <i>"Then I need to see it, too."</i><br>
<br>
Jane walked past Mack, and Quinn started after her. <i>"<u>My team</u>,"</i>
she said, before Mack had a chance to protest. "Daria &ndash; take the others and go
see the other wing ... the one with the people."<br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Ninety minutes later, heavily armed federal officers, along with an army of
others wearing the iconic blue windbreakers with 'FBI' in large, bright yellow
letters, were swarming all throughout the Appleton Industries facility.<br>
<br>
Supervisory Special Agent Tobias C. Fornell stood in the center of the <i>Badlands</i>,
Julia at his side. "Pretty big score for an agent &ndash; let alone a probationary
agent who's technically still in college and isn't even old enough to drink
legally," Fornell said, watching as a line of researchers and security
personnel were led outside, where several prisoner transports were waiting.
"You sure that you don't want the credit for the bust?"<br>
<br>
Julia shook her head. "Sets a bad precedent &ndash; and there would be entirely too
much publicity focused on me and the Legion."<br>
<br>
Fornell looked her over. "Yeah &ndash; I kind of figured you'd want to be low-key
after I heard that we needed to bring someone PELT-certified to this hole in
the wall. After I heard you were involved, I figured that something bad had
gone down."<br>
<br>
Another line of prisoners was led past the Legionnaire and the Special Agent;
Julia noted that members of the famed <i>FBI Hostage Rescue Team</i> escorted
them. "That's why you brought the Wild Bunch up, hmm?"<br>
<br>
"Don't get smart, kid," Fornell shot back. "Some of them have calluses older than
you are. So &ndash; you're a meta-active, right? Kind of figured that, too, after I
heard that you'd been picked for that Legion Liaison spot. Yeah &ndash; news travels
fast."<br>
<br>
Julia was silent as she digested that news. "We'll keep your name out of it &ndash;
but the right people will know what happened, and it'll go in your jacket &ndash; in
the <i>Confidential</i> section. Also &ndash; remind your little buddies that in the
future, they don't have any authority to bust heads like this, only you do. If
they want to pull this kind of stunt again, it might help if they got some sort
of legal status. Only the fact that you've got a badge gives you &ndash; oh, hell."<br>
<br>
Fornell rolled his eyes and let off a particularly vile swear as he watched a
group of seven men, all wearing immaculate suits and trench coats, as they made
their way through the people working in the area... directly towards him and
Julia. <i>"George Williams.</i> That malignant prick doesn't ever stay dead."<br>
<br>
Julia looked the nondescript man over as he approached. "You know him."<br>
<br>
"Perennial attendee at the 'absolute bastards' World Cup," Fornell growled.
"Evening, George."<br>
<br>
The man known as 'George Williams' gave Julia an appreciative once-over before
turning to Fornell. "Not bad, Tobias &ndash; but don't you think that you should get
them off the <i>Puppy Chow</i> before you put them in the field?"<br>
<br>
"He's just baiting you, Carlyle," Fornell said, cutting off Julia's response.
"What are you doing here, George?"<br>
<br>
'George' pulled out an envelope, and handed it to him with what &ndash; in any other
circumstance &ndash; would have been a perfect, charming smile. "An amended
directive," he said, passing the envelope to the Supervisory Special
Agent-in-Charge. "You get everything else, and full credit for it &ndash; <i>but
Appleton comes with <u>us</u>. Homeland Security has <u>dibs</u>."</i><br>
<br>
Fornell's expression didn't change as he read the letter he'd drawn from the
envelope. "Homeland Security's your dodge now, right? I'd call you an
ankle-biting, head-bobbing son-of-a-bitch - but that would insult every dog in
existence," he replied, folding the letter back into the envelope and handing
it to him &ndash; an action which seemed to surprise Williams' entourage, who had
been expecting a less pleasant response. "He's in his personal quarters on the
top floor. Take him and <u>go</u>."<br>
<br>
The entourage began to move off; George nodded gracefully as he put the
envelope away. "As always, Tobias &ndash; a pleasure," he said. "Oh, and Agent
Carlyle &ndash; when next you see your Legion Advisor, say hello to him from me. It's
been a while."<br>
<br>
"Where are your Legion buddies, anyway?" Fornell asked, ignoring the smirks on
William's people as they left. "I'd like to talk to them."<br>
<br>
"Most of them left already for the Tower," Julia replied. "They were getting a
lot of static from your people-"<br>
<br>
<i>"<u>Our</u> people,'"</i> Fornell corrected her sharply. "From what I
understand, this is just a new way for you to get some additional field
experience before you graduate next May. You need to remember who you're
working for."<br>
<br>
Julia nodded. "Yes, sir."<br>
<br>
Fornell's expression lightened a bit. "It's not your fault, really," he told
her. "I've got experience handling federal personnel who've been, well, <i>influenced
by working with former Marines.</i> They get a bit of the 'cowboy' in them when
it comes to working the system."<br>
<br>
Looking around the area, Fornell let his eyes rest on Julia &ndash; not in an
untoward manner, but as if he were studying her. "Do you like this area in
general, Carlyle?"<br>
<br>
Julia shrugged. "It's not bad."<br>
<br>
"Well, depending on how the rest of your time with the Legion goes &ndash; perhaps we
can keep you in the area for a while," he told her. "I don't have a problem
poaching talent, and starting your career at Headquarters in D.C. is a nice way
to move up the ranks quickly &ndash;especially with contacts like your Legion
friends. Think on it."<br>
<br>
"Sir?"<br>
<br>
Fornell had started away, but Julia's voice turned him back. "What is it,
Carlyle?"<br>
<br>
"They're going to cut him a deal, aren't they?"<br>
<br>
The senior agent's silence, and the look of quiet disgust spoke worlds. "Sir &ndash;
he's got a collection of recordings he's made up there," Julia said, managing
to control her rising anger and own sense of disgust in a cool manner that
Fornell quietly approved of, seeing how angry she was. "He's molested and
physically abused God knows how many underage girls over the years!"<br>
<br>
Julia felt the eyes of several people on her, but kept going. "I personally
know one of the girls that he's been sleeping with since she was fourteen, not
to mention that he's been using a unregistered drug on her for the past two or
so years, and I just found out tonight that on least one occasion, he beat her
so badly that she nearly died-"<br>
<br>
Fornell and Julia both went silent as 'George', William (still in handcuffs)
and the other 'agents' entered the area. "And now you see why Justice is blind,"
the older agent spoke, "because sometimes, you have to bear witness to things
that you'll never un-see."<br>
<br>
William took great pleasure in undressing the redhead as he passed Julia &ndash; and
suddenly whimpered in pain as 'George' slapped him directly in the mouth. "Have
some respect for women, you prick," the man said, not breaking stride as two of
the 'agents' had to catch William before he fell.<br>
<br>
"Yeah &ndash; that's why I've never followed through on my initial instinct to shoot
him every time he pops up in the open," Fornell said. "If it's any consolation,
Carlyle, you've probably saved a lot of lives by helping to bag that jackass
and tapping this place."<br>
<br>
"Yeah," Julia responded, a sudden pang of curiosity arising as she wondered
what Danielle Todds and Mack had done to the hundreds of research animals.
"Thank you, sir."<br>
<br>
<i>If the government had gotten a hold of them, nothing would have changed for
them,</i> she thought, as she watched a pair of agents call out to Fornell, and
him start over to join them. <i>Obviously, none of those animals can be
released in the wild, and I can't see Mack allowing someone to euthanize them
out of hand, let alone wanting to do it himself. I saw how he was looking at
those puppies; that's a dog person, through and through.</i><br>
<br>
Julia brushed her hair back, not exactly noticing an agent who had walked over
to her as her thoughts turned to the subjects below. <i>What <u>did</u> Daria
and the others do with those animals? What's going to happen to the people in
cryo-storage?</i><br>
<br>
<i>"Carlyle!"</i><br>
<br>
Fornell's shout turned Julia to face him. "What did your people just do with
the 'popsicles'?"<br>
<br>
Julia's face showed her confusion. "Sir?"<br>
<br>
The senior FBI agent went to her. "Agent Sharp says that less than a moment
ago, all six of the subjects frozen down in cryo-storage just up and <u>vanished</u>!
They disappeared right in front of my agents &ndash; containers and all! Did your
Legion buddies get them?"<br>
<br>
"Nobody in the Legion has that ability, sir," Julia said, "and why would the
Legion sneak them away?"<br>
<br>
"Yeah, well, you tell your people that we're going to need to speak to them."
Fornell growled <br>
<br>
"Well, I guess he's pissed," Julia thought aloud, as she watched him walk away.
"Great. Just great."<br>
<br>

Danielle's Todds' DRADIS and Heads-Up Display were visible to the Ringbearer
(and her Legionnaire companions inside her force-field as they stood (hidden by
Danielle's invisibility 'glamour') atop a hill covered with prairie grass, and
watched the badger they had freed several minutes earlier find a meal by the
light of a full moon.<br>

<br>
The pain was all gone.<br>
<br>
<br>
Nibbles (the name given to the badger by the research staff) enjoyed his first
taste of real food in several months as he sat at the edge of what was a vast
field of maize growing wild on both sides of a large river, and happily munched
away on a fresh ear. <br>
<br>
As he ate, he noticed the appearance of several other badgers out of a burrow,
who worked together to bring down a stalk, but dismissed them as he continued
to eat.<br>
<br>
He was drunk on the scents and the feel of the outdoors &ndash; and for the first
time in a long while, his small form was free of the unending sensations of
continually burning himself.<br>
<br>
The self-combustion ability he had developed, due to the formula the Appleton
Industries scientists injected him with, was flawed in that Nibbles never
developed any means of controlling the power, or resistance to flame &ndash; but
instead, a fast-acting healing factor that didn't cancel out the pain he
suffered from being continually being burned alive.<br>
<br>
He finished his ear and noticed a badger, slightly smaller than him, trying to
bring down another stalk of maize; Nibbles meandered over, and helped to bring
the stalk to a level where the other badgers were able to take the ears off.<br>
<br>
Nibbles began to peel away at the husk, comfortable in the presence of his new,
adopted family. <br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
"This Earth is almost identical to most Earths - with the exception that when
the dinosaurs went under, humans never developed here," Danielle observed, her
Ring's linguistic endowment allowing her to speak to Daria, Jane and Mack
through their flight rings' telepathic link. "No form of humanity at all. The
Corps of Ringbearers found it a century ago, and it's a 'protected world' &ndash; no
human colonization allowed."<br>
<br>
"But it's all right to bring animals here?" Daria asked. "Animals from other
worlds?"<br>
<br>
The Ringbearer counted to seven before she spoke, and Mack nudged Jane,
motioning for her to keep Daria quiet. "The Corps has a standing arrangement
with another organization-"<br>
<br>
<i>"The Agency</i> &ndash; I know about them, too," Daria interjected, sending a wave
of shock through Danielle, a wave that smashed into Mack when she continued. "I
know about the <i>Nova Valdris Accords</i>, too &ndash; <b>Oh.</b> Ringbearers use
this world for animals in the way that <i>Agency</i> people recruit people who
were going to die in their own dimensions."<br>
<br>
Danielle's mouth dropped wide open as Daria continued. "You use the
decontamination thing your <i>Ring</i> does to clean out any traces of the formula
the researchers used on the animals, and it also takes away their powers to
make it just a normal animal again."<br>
<br>
Jane and Mack looked at Daria in astonishment, and Danielle was so caught
off-guard that the 'glamour' she had raised to render herself and the
Legionnaires invisible had dropped. "By altering their memories, you allow the
animals to live out normal lives here, without any thoughts about the horrible
things done to them, or about humans in general," Daria continued. <br>
<br>
"And still, she has no idea on how to talk to a boy without falling over her
boots," Jane deadpanned. <br>
<br>
"I don't know &ndash; with photos like hers, she doesn't need to speak," Mack said,
earning a cross look from Daria. <br>
<br>
For her part, Danielle savagely repressed the sensations that she felt rise up
whenever she though about having seen the images of Daria's <i><u>Val</u>
Magazine</i> photo spread &ndash; <i>it's Quinn's <u>sister</u>, you idiot! <u>Get a
grip</u>!</i> &ndash; as she quickly raised her 'glamour' once again.<br>
<br>
Daria growled at Jane. "Why are you even here, art girl?"<br>
<br>
Jane smirked in Daria's general direction. "Because everybody else has gotten
to travel all over time, space and different dimensions &ndash; and not only is it my
turn, but I wanted my first trip to be something nice, instead of a monster
stompfest."<br>
<br>
Danielle laughed softly. <i>On almost every world, those two are so close that
they're practically sisters.</i><br>
<br>
"All of the animals who can't be returned to their owners, or don't have any,
will come here," she told the Legionnaires. "I need to take you guys back home
&ndash; but we need to make one stop first. There's still the matter of why I was
sent to visit you in the first place."<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
John Dynell stood in front of the open door of an airplane hangar, checking his
watch as he looked towards the road that led to the Lawndale Regional Airport
from town.<br>
<br>
Inside the hangar, three young women and two twenty-something men paced back
and forth in front of a Gulfstream 550 business jet; Dynell felt a slight sense
of relief as he looked the ultra-long range aircraft over.<br>
<br>
At least this runway in a cornfield has some advantages, such as expedited
border pre-clearance. It allows this to be swept under the rug quickly.<br>
<br>
<i>William, William, William. You let your ego and your alleged manhood
override your common sense &ndash; and <u>my directions</u> &ndash; and now, I can't even
clean up your mess, because the Legion's effectively ruined your worth for us
as a legitimate operation. </i><br>
<br>
<i>For the foreseeable future, you're of no use to us &ndash; but having you killed
deprives us of a valuable asset. I have no other choice in the matter, do I? I
have to help you disappear quickly and quietly... because it serves my interests
as well. </i><br>
<br>
A small caravan of three vehicles appeared in the distance; three minutes
later, the trio of SUV-class vehicles came to a stop in front of the hangar,
and Dynell watched 'George Williams', one of his men, and William emerge from
the middle vehicle.<br>
<br>
"Mister Dynell &ndash; I have that package you requested," the man said, gesturing
towards William. "That 'finders' fee' we discussed-?"<br>
<br>
Dynell turned towards the limousine at the side of the hanger. "Dina."<br>
<br>
A leggy Black woman stepped out of the limo; as Williams went to her, she
opened the hard-shell case she carried with her to reveal seven gold ingots,
nestled snugly inside. "Thank you," George said, nodding to his man, who took
possession of the case and started back to the truck as Dina returned to the
limo. "I need to run along now &ndash; oh, and Mr. Appleton-"<br>
<br>
William accepted the outstretched hand &ndash; and grasped it tight as 'George' lashed
out with a hideous left hook. "I have a fourteen-year-old daughter. John &ndash; a
pleasure," he said, hefting an unsteady William back to his full height. "See
you at the Christmas party in Santiago?"<br>
<br>
"Only if you have the missus bake an extra cinnamon-raisin rum cake just for
me," Dynell told him. "You'd think that grown men and women would act their age
&ndash; fine. Tell Cheryl that if she makes one just for me, I'll send her a bottle
of 'Black Day' rum."<br>
<br>
George released William's hand, his face covered with surprise. "Then it's
true? You actually have five gallons of Royal Navy rum from 1970?"<br>
<br>
<i>"Fifteen,"</i> Dynell said, "and no, you <i>can't</i> trade back an ingot
for a gallon. Have Cheryl call this weekend."<br>
<br>
Rubbing his jaw as the other men talked, Appleton turned his attention to the
three young women next to the plane - all dressed in fashionable clothes,
seeming to be between fourteen and sixteen years of age. <br>
<br>
One of the young women &ndash; a trim, athletic beauty with jet-black hair that fell
to her waist and black, liquid eyes, looked terrified as she saw his eyes fall
upon her. The other two &ndash; a luminous Vietnamese girl, and a busty, bespectacled
girl with masses of shaggy, golden-blonde hair that fell over her shoulders
like a cape - didn't take their eyes off the airplane carpet.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who are they, John?&quot; William asked, as Dynell joined him inside the
hangar. <br>
<br>
Dynell gave him a cool glare. &quot;They're going to be your companions while
you take your 'vacation'...and let me assure you, William... <i>they don't like
it one bit.&quot;</i> <br>
<br>
Appleton smiled. He could afford to wait, after all. He would have to send
Dynell a card for such a wonderful housewarming present.<br>
<br>
<i>The three of them are just to keep you occupied</i>, Dynell thought. <i>This
way, you'll be too busy to try anything stupid as you head off on exile. I
already have enough to clean up on your account.</i> <br>
<br>
"One more thing, William." Dynell took what looked like a simple, black digital
watch from his coat pocket. <i>"Put this on."</i><br>
<br>
The cold steel in Dynell's voice helped William to slip the watch on quickly.
"That's part of your punishment, William. You've caused a great deal of trouble
for us &ndash; and the only reason you're still here is that Morgendorffer has no
idea about how to work a 'trip box'."<br>
<br>
As William put the Mark 50 'suppression band' on, Dynell thought nasty thoughts
about the last problem his people had come across in relation to the mental
traps known as 'trip boxes'. <i>Damn Cassandra's boy. I had plans for Sloane,
too. I can't even get back at Farrington for flipping the game &ndash; I'd be dead
inside of a day.</i><br>
<br>
Dynell drew a small metallic case from his coat pocket, and William looked at
it in what &ndash; especially for him &ndash; was perfect awe. "Is that-?"<br>
<br>
<i>"It's time for you to become one of us,"</i> Dynell replied. "Take it. Now."<br>
<br>
William took the pill, swallowed it, and washed it down with a drink from the
offered flask &ndash; which, to his delight, he found full of his favorite single
malt Scotch. "Keep it &ndash; and get on the plane," Dynell said. "For the
foreseeable future, you're no longer of any use to us here in North America.
You're being taken to a place where you may find yourself being of use &ndash; and in
any event, you'll be able to keep yourself occupied."<br>
<br>
William's tone as he spoke led John to turn back as he left for his limousine.
"John &ndash; what kind of power will I generate?"<br>
<br>
The look William received was totally devoid of concern. "It really doesn't
matter. You're Elite now. Your main consideration now is to regain any
semblance of faith that I once had in you."<br>
<br>
Dynell walked away without a backwards glance; after watching the limo leave,
William turned and walked towards the plane, already planning on what he would
do with the raven-haired girl...<br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
"The call you were expecting, sir," Dina said, waiting until Dynell had
fastened his seat belt and the car was in motion, before handing him a cell
phone.<br>
<br>
"Thank you," he replied, taking the phone. "You retrieved them all, yes?
Excellent. For now, keep them at the Edmonton base, and let them remain in
cryo-storage. No research - only monitoring. Thank you, Alejandro. Your
generosity is appreciated." <br>
<br>
Dynell passed the phone back to his assistant. "Dina &ndash; take us back to New
York."<br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<br>
The countryside was suddenly lit up with bright orange light as a shining
orange portal, some five meters across, formed in the air in front of the
limousine<br>
<br>
The vehicle passed through the portal &ndash; and then, the area was dark and silent
once more. <br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<br>
In the maximum-security vault, seventy feet below the surface of Legion Tower,
Colonel Armalin (dressed in his Marine combat uniform) along with Daria, Quinn,
Jane, Tom and Mack watched as Danielle opened up an inter-dimensional portal.
"They understand &ndash; now - that you want to keep the Crystal under your
guardianship," the Ringbearer said, as a massive block of golden-hued metal
came through the portal. "This is to help neutralize the threat that the
Crystal possesses."<br>
<br>
"Why &ndash; why is that block vibrating like that?" Tom asked, noticing how the
metallic cube vibrated wildly as it hovered in the air. "What kind of metal is
that &ndash; is that <i>Salazarium?"</i><br>
<br>
All of the other Legionnaires glanced quickly at their rings before returning
their attention to the giant metal block. "Because it'll solve all of our
problems &ndash; yours and ours," Danielle agreed, nodding in Tom's direction as the
portal dissipated, but the block kept flickering &ndash; no, vibrating quickly, as if
it were out of sync with reality. <br>
<br>
"What does that block being of the same metal as our Rings have to do with
anything?" Quinn asked. "I don't think that we need that much of the metal
around, unless you want to make rings for all the kids in the country who are
in the Legion &ndash; do you?"<br>
<br>
"Well, if you'd studied more things at the Academy besides the boys in running
shorts," Daria cracked, "you might have a clue."<br>
<br>
"At least I didn't study the tonsils of every mind-reader I came across from
the inside," Quinn snapped back.<br>
<br>
"Sloane &ndash; why don't you share with the class?' Armalin said, shaking his head
as Jane kept Daria from slapping her sister in the back of the head.<br>
<br>
"Salazarium has several specific qualities that make it really useful," Tom
told the others, "especially in dealing with things like the <i>Soul Crystal</i>
&ndash; something we know is a magical artifact of some form. In large amounts &ndash; like
this &ndash; it resists inter-dimensional movement, including teleportation. It's
resistant to the effects of direct contact with anti-matter &ndash; but the big ones
for us &ndash; for thirty-six hours after it's synthesized, you can form it into any
shape you want... and it has innate anti-mystical properties. Even a little bit
of Salazarium disrupts magical effects &ndash; and with a block that size-"<br>
<br>
"We can stick the <i>Crystal</i> inside it!" Quinn blurted out. "We stick the <i>Crystal</i>
inside it, and when it goes completely solid, nobody can get it out &ndash; but
better, it can't be detected or do anything itself because the magical energy's
all scrambled up by the metal, and nobody can sneak in and try to get it out &ndash;
especially anybody like Black Majesty, whose powers are all magical!"<br>
<br>
Quinn turned to she sister. "'Never studied' &ndash; next!"<br>
<br>
Jane turned away so Daria couldn't see her smile. "Well &ndash; let's get this over
with." she said, tapping in a set of numbers on one of the large safes on the
back wall. "There it is. Let's seal this thing off <i>forever."</i><br>
<br>
Using her telekinetic power, Danielle removed the Soul Crystal; extending her
force-field to envelop the artifact as the Crystal, sensing its impending fate,
began to lash out at random with electrical discharges. "It's having a
tantrum," she said, smiling as she used her TK power to push the Crystal firmly
into the resonating block of metal. "There. And now that this is taken care
of..."<br>
<br>
The block of Salazarium was enveloped in a purplish field, and the vibrations
seemed to increase to a speed that made the block all but blur out for ten
seconds &ndash; and then, stop moving entirely. <i>"It's done,"</i> Danielle said,
with a tone of finality in her voice as the energy field disappeared and the
block dropped to the floor. "That thing will never cause anyone any harm, ever
again."<br>
<br>
Letting out a deep breath, the Ringbearer turned to the Legionnaires. "I've
already apologized to Mack, but I just wanted to say to the rest of you that I
am sorry for the way I carried myself.," she told them. "I know that it's
perhaps the lamest excuse ever used, but I really am just doing my job."<br>
<br>
"Oh, I wouldn't say that it's such a lame excuse - if you actually believe in
what you're doing and you're not trying to convince yourself of it," the
Colonel said, causing everyone to look at him.<br>
<br>
"Oh, you're so sweet," she said. "I could almost see going out with you, but I
just don't date younger men. They're, well, they're just not experienced
enough."<br>
<br>
The colonel gave her a smirk, and they both broke out laughing. "No hard
feelings, Master Ringbearer?" the Colonel asked, extending his hand.<br>
<br>
"None at all, Colonel," Danielle replied, taking his hand in hers. "I have to
leave now &ndash; but I was authorized by the bosses to compensate the Legion for
your trouble." <br>
<br>
"Come on, greedy girl," Daria said, putting her hand over Jane's mouth as she
pulled her towards the exit. "We need to order a lot of pizza to help cheer
Fran up. Ringbearer &ndash; we'll just say that you owe us, and leave it there."<br>
<br>
As the Ringbearer vanished, Mack looked in Daria's direction. "Pizza to cheer
Fran up? After the guy who did all of those horrible things to her - and God
knows how many other girls &ndash; got to walk away scot-free? Daria, do you think
that's-"<br>
<br>
Everyone in the room shuddered at the look of divine retribution that appeared
on Daria's face. "The pizza's just for eating. The news I have will cheer her
up <i>perfectly"</i><br>
<br>
Daria remembered the day that Charles joined the Legion &ndash; what she had told him
in his very first meeting there &ndash; and her traditional thin-lipped, 'Mona Lisa'
smile began to form on her face, causing even Jane to step away from her with a
touch of fear:<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><i><span style='color:blue'>&gt;-:: Just remember, Upchuck. I have mental
powers. And I was always immune to your greasy charm. If I find that you've
been taking advantage of anyone &ndash; girl or boy, woman or man &ndash; using your
changing skills, I'm going to mentally program you with permanent erectile
dysfunction and complete loss of bowel control. And if you peek on any of
us...well, what I do to your mind is going to make a Lemarchand box look like a
Fisher-Price Toy Camera....!::-&lt;</span></i></b><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
"I think that she'll be quite happy with my news..."<br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<br>
He had never felt so humiliated in his entire life. <br>
<br>
William Appleton took another shower, letting the steaming water flow over him
as he scrubbed himself clean. <br>
<br>
<i>What the hell is happening to me-? What's going on?</i><br>
<br>
It had begun a half hour ago. The other girls - Nhung Lam (the fifteen-year-old
Vietnamese girl, who possessed the power to alter her mass, becoming ghostlike
or superhumanly dense and strong) and Tia (the dark-haired fourteen-year old,
whose power allowed her to transmute small amounts of material into any element
she wished, as well as control the material she transmuted) were getting ready
to go to sleep in the front of the plane.<br>
<br>
William took Christine (the busty fifteen-year old blonde with glasses) with
him into the back of the plane. It had been converted into a comfortable
bedroom, complete with shower and a personal toilet (there was another bathroom
for everyone else in the forward section of the plane &ndash; the Elite had the
best).<br>
<br>
He ordered Christine to disrobe; as she did, William thought over the nature of
her power. <i>Hyper-breath; she can create hurricane-force winds with her
breath or create vacuums in enclosed areas, causing them to implode &ndash; not to
mention blowing hot or cold; she can freeze a pond or a small lake, or set a
mansion on fire...</i><br>
<br>
<i>Yeah. I'll bet that she gives a blow job that could suck the blue from a
clear, mid-morning sky in the middle of July &ndash; and look at just how firm those
big tits of hers are-</i><br>
<br>
The former CFO of Appleton Industries leered unashamedly as he watched
Christine's surprisingly chaste brassiere fall to the floor; tears began to
fall from the girl's eyes, but she didn't speak or even make a sound as she
continued to disrobe-<br>
<br>
A horrid sound seemed to ooze from William's abdomen, a vile, roiling, fleshy
sound that seemed to mushroom out from the man and fill the cabin-<br>
<br>
It was then that his bowels fully released. <br>
<br>
Christine shrieked, not even stopping for her blouse or brassiere as the
bedroom compartment filled with the hideous scent of a fresh bowel movement;
William himself started to stammer between exhortations of disgust and curses
of absolute fury as he simply couldn't control himself, soiling himself
completely and all but ruining the carpeting as he rushed to the personal
toilet.<br>
<br>
After an hour of total humiliation, in which he kept continually having bowel
movements (and constantly going between the toilet and the shower), William,
wearing only a bathrobe and totally drained of energy, managed to crawl into
bed. (He had stopped having bowel movements only because he simply had nothing
left to excrete.) </p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:162.3pt;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:
0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:162.3pt;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:
0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Tia had used her power to clean the entire area; she
had transmuted the stool (even the molecules of stool in the air) into gold
dust, and then, fused it all together into a small shower of cold coins.<br>
<br>
William was thankful that she had removed the stink from the air; he was far
too drained, however, to demand the gold for himself. <br>
<br>
About an hour later, William was feeling strong enough to call for the co-pilot
to come back and help with his power. The co-pilot, recently brought onto
Dynell's personal staff as one of his 'on-call' pilots, possessed the unique
ability to control time around one person at a time. One of the things he could
use it for was to restore a person's endurance, by speeding up time for them,
as if they had rested for several hours, or even up to a full day.<br>
<br>
Christine was ordered to his bed ten minutes later. She removed her clothing
and went into the bed with William...<br>
<br>
Nothing happened. <br>
<br>
Nothing. <br>
<br>
Over the next hour, William discovered (as did all three girls) that he was
totally incapable of performing sexually &ndash; complete and total erectile
dysfunction, occurring within fifteen seconds after he felt himself becoming
aroused. He would feel himself becoming aroused, he felt his manhood becoming
erect &ndash; and then, it was as if a switch was flipped, and he became flaccid
again, with no amount of encouragement could change that he simply could not
perform in bed. <br>
<br>
That flight was the longest flight of William Appleton's life. <br>
<br>
Daria couldn't perform the mental horrors upon William that she had promised
Charles Ruttheimer because of the mental protection the 'trip box' provided &ndash;
but as for the rest...<br>
<br>
Fran Lawrence &ndash; and many, many other young women around the world &ndash; had only
just begun to have their revenge on the man that had used them.<br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<br>
"Hey, Daria &ndash; what are you doing out here?" <br>
<br>
Daria, sitting alone on a bench in the Legion's 'pocket park', glanced over to
one side as she saw Jane and Quinn walking towards her. "The lady of the hour &ndash;
sitting out here all alone, even though everyone wants to kiss up to you for
how you got that bastard!" Jane continued, having called out to Daria earlier. <br>
<br>
"Come on, Daria," Quinn urged, sitting down on Daria's left as Jane took the
spot to Daria's right. "You're the 'badass of the hour'! You should hear
Tiffany and Sandi in there, trying to come up with ways they would have topped
what you did to Appleton if they had had your powers!"<br>
<br>
"Never happen," Jane shot off. "To have mental powers, you have to have a mind.
Tiffany doesn't count."<br>
<br>
"This time last year, I'd have said the same thing about Sandi," Quinn joined
in. "The thing is &ndash; she's changing. I mean, she's still sneaky and conniving &ndash;
but not as much as she used to be, and she's... she's not as mean about it as she
used to be. She's not as 'end-all, be-all' competitive &ndash; remember how all of us
in the Fashion Club got into defensive driving? That was Sandi's doing. Now,
she's all into her own training, her own stuff, and she hasn't even said a word
about wanting to get into explosives?"<br>
<br>
Daria glanced over at her sister. "You're really going to do that?"<br>
<br>
"I'm leaving in two days for Utah," Quinn told them. "I'm going to drive out
there, and stop at the Academy to take care of a few things &ndash; like asking about
that class that teaches them to fight us &ndash; and basically put my car to the
test."<br>
<br>
Daria and Jane both remained silent; Quinn finally broke. "Okay &ndash;I'll tell you!
I'm driving with Upchuck &ndash; I mean, with <i>Charles</i>!"<br>
<br>
&quot;What sort of bet did you lose where you suffer by spending a couple of
days in a car alone with the former faux lounge lizard?&quot; Jane asked<br>
<br>
"Funny," Quinn said. "He has to go out to Utah, too &ndash; they're going to start
him off training to fly the <i>Gridrunner</i>, and after he's learned, they're
going to let us have one here in Lawndale!"<br>
<br>
"Yeah, that's going to be something to see," Daria mused. "Upchuck &ndash; <i>Charles</i>
&ndash; with flight wings. The girls are going to be all over him."<br>
<br>
"That's another reason I said 'yes' when he asked to ride along," Quinn said.
"When he joined up, you couldn't have paid me to sit within ten feet of him,
because he'd have been trying to paw on me; now, he's got girls all over trying
to get him alone-"<br>
<br>
"You heard Jodie's 'booty call count', too, eh?" Jane remarked.<br>
<br>
"-and he hasn't taken advantage of a single girl. Not one &ndash; and you know that
with him being in the Legion, if he'd had tried something, everybody in the
world would have known," Quinn finished. "I'm not saying that he's a nice guy,
or that I really like him &ndash; but I think that he's earned a little bit of
trust."<br>
<br>
Daria looked at her sister with a touch of pride, and Quinn, rarely seeing that
look on her sister's face directed at her, basked in its warmth. "Damn. Someone
else has matured around here."<br>
<br>
"And guess who's turn it is to act mature now, <i>amiga</i>?"<br>
<br>
Her eyes moving to look at Jane first, then Quinn and back to Jane, Daria moved
back a bit on the bench. "What are you two planning?"<br>
<br>
"Well, Daria &ndash; I was thinking that I'd like to do some other stuff, like making
things go 'boom', and well, I don't know, 'dating," Quinn said. "There's all of
these cute celebrity boys out there, as well as all the normal ones who want to
take me places and buy me dinner and gifts &ndash; well, the Legion Constitution says
I can't take the gifts, or I have to donate the gift's worth in cash to the
National Legion if I want to keep it-"<br>
<br>
"Well, normally no, but we will make a deal," Jane said. "It's actually why we
came out here to talk to you."<br>
<br>
"What I was saying earlier, about wanting to do other things, Daria?" Quinn
lifted her head from Daria's shoulder. "Well, I was thinking... I've been Legion
Leader for almost a year. Jane did it first, and maybe &ndash; just maybe &ndash; we should
all have a shot at it before anyone else does it."<br>
<br>
Daria sat up straight. "What &ndash; me be Leader?"<br>
<br>
"We'll be your campaign managers!" Jane said. "All the guys will vote for you &ndash;
Charles because he knows you can lead, Tom because the bastard owes us, and if
Mack's on the fence &ndash; you can always make a 'personal appeal' to his better
nature. Wear something clingy, too."<br>
<br>
Daria looked Jane directly in the eye. "Jane, I will find a time-traveler, go
back in time, get that taffeta dress Ms. Li was trying to sell, bring it back
to the present, and bury you in it."<br>
<br>
Jane's response was equally full of snark. "Yes, yes, Morgendorffer. You and
your power of bending horny men and women to your will. Now, about that idea of
running for Leader..."<br>
<br>
"Hey &ndash; hey, guys &ndash; did you see that?"<br>
<br>
Daria and Jane looked up to where Quinn was pointing; a spot just on the tree
line, near the edge of the quarry where the Tower sat. "I saw
something...sparking!" she said. "I saw something small, and I saw a little-"<br>
<br>
Quinn squeaked in excitement as another spark &ndash; this time, Daria and Jane could
also see it, even in the twilight before dawn; no one had slept this night, and
the celebrating had gone on and on &ndash; and leaped to her feet. "I FELT it that
time! I did!"<br>
<br>
Before either Jane or Daria could say a word, Quinn sprinted off towards the
spark that she had seen &ndash; and her fellow Legionnaires shot off across the
quarry after her.<br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<br>
Cuddles was tired. <br>
<br>
The skunk &ndash; aged prematurely by the research treatments he had endured &ndash; was
physically past the age than any skunk usually survived to in the wild. <br>
<br>
Through weakened eyes, his joints causing him pain whenever he moved, Cuddles
foraged for something to eat, to take the edge off the hunger he'd had for
several days, after finding nothing to sustain him. <br>
<br>
His nose twitched; even though it caused him pain, Cuddles was glad, and he
trundled through an open patch of grass, allowing his nose to guide him to a
patch of wild berries.<br>
<br>
Each bite the skunk took was both wonderful and painful; somehow, Cuddles knew
that this was his last meal, and he kept eating...<br>
<br>
A strange sensation traveled through Cuddles; a sensation that, in a human,
would have been <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.</i> The sensation was so strong that it turned him
around, away from the berries, even though his empty stomach squealed for more
and he hurt so much as he turned...<br>
<br>
There were three of them. It was strange; Cuddles felt a connection with the
three figures &ndash; the creatures, the ones so much like the ones that had hurt
him, so very long ago. <br>
<br>
He wasn't afraid. He just stood, looking at them, watching as the light in the
morning sky became brighter oh, so slowly, and the figures moved towards him,
coming closer and closer.<br>
<br>
<i>They were the ones,</i> something in his little mind decided. Most of the
creatures &ndash; and he had seen many - always ran away from him, but these had been
different, He had been looking for food, behind a bush, and he could see them
coming closer, and closer, as if they weren't like the others and not afraid-<br>
<br>
Just like before &ndash; the world exploded in light, and the figures disappeared. <br>
<br>
For a moment, before the light, Cuddles felt a... <i>connection,</i> a kinship
with the figures, especially the one closest to him; his nose twitched, and he
wanted his nose rubbed... maybe that creature could rub it for him.<br>
<br>
<i>Maybe that creature could rub my tummy, and keep me warm...</i><br>
<br>
The light grew brighter, but it didn't hurt Cuddles' eyes; he felt as if he
were moving, and yet, his joints didn't hurt... he didn't feel any pain at all....<br>
<br>
He could see only one figure now. Even though the Light was moving around him,
going faster and faster, moving as no light should until he realized that it
was <i>lightning</i> that engulfed him, moving as no lightning could...<br>
<br>
Cuddles felt no pain, and he wasn't afraid as the figure stopped in front of
him.<br>
<br>
He felt himself being picked up by strong hands, hands that radiated light and
warmth that filled him with life, and strength, and a sudden, wonderful
happiness that filled him and made him feel as if he were so young and strong
again...<br>
<br>
A sound reverberated in the skunk's mind, and he could understand the sounds
clearly as they resolved into understanding: <br>
<br>
<br>
<i>"Hello, Cuddles. Welcome home."</i><br>
<br>
<br>
Cuddles, feeling full, warm and happy as if he were once again a tiny kit
snuggled against his mother, closed his tiny eyes for the last time and
surrendered.<br>
<br>
<br>
