<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The noise levels in the small
classroom dropped as Rafael 'Roman' Vargas &ndash; (also known as 'Fortune' &ndash; the
team leader of the Alliance) stood up in front of the wall-mounted computer
screen. "The way it seems, the Legionnaires will run a VR team combat
simulation within the next forty-eight hours. They'll probably ask for
volunteers, so, let's beat them to the punch."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Oh, they'll be going up
against us," said Julia Carlyle ('Star Angel' &ndash; the Alliance's deputy leader),
leaning back in her chair and brushing a heavy lock of dark scarlet hair from
her face. "I was down in Zero Area to see what that little bitch Morgendorffer
could do. Nobody else around here is ready to go up against them as a team like
we are."</p>

you?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The classically beautiful
young woman turned, her huge jade eyes locking on the smirking face of E.
Jeffrey Brace (also known as 'Windburn' - the team's resident speedster). "Shut
up, Jeffrey."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"What happened &ndash; the Duchess
can't handle another Queen Bee showing up on her turf? Oh, and by the way... <i>move

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Julia tossed him a dismissive
glance as she turned back, and instead of shrinking her full, silken wings back
into her body, folded them so that they were flat against her back. "Roman,
whenever you're ready."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The handsome Latino cadet
picked up a remote control, and then pointed at the screen. "Okay, everyone &ndash;
threat- and power levels on the Legionnaires. Alpha to Delta threats&ndash; Alpha's
the highest; Class One to Five &ndash; anything Three or higher is classified as a
tactical asset."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>A photo of Tiffany appeared on
the screen, with the caption underneath reading 'Department of Extranormal
Affairs (DEXA) Archive File Legion-00005/Blum-Deckler, T.' "Blum-Deckler,
Tiffany. Sixteen years old, Chinese background, adopted."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>An attractive Black girl in a

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Class Three<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Great," sighed Carolyn Field
(code-named 'Shocklash'), shifting in her seat. "Looks like you've got your
first target, David Allen. No one else will be able to touch her."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"It's worse than that," Roman
told her. "Because of her psych profile, she's been - Zoey, you'd better listen
before one of the preps zeroes you down."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Psych profile?" David Allen
Farrington asked, and everyone turned to the Black cadet seated in the middle
of the room. "We've got their psych profiles? How?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"DEXA approved an information
exchange with the Legion training cadre," Roman said. "We've got access to
their files, and the government gave them access to the Academy for specialized
research and testing procedures. If they wanted to read up on us while they're
in-house, they've got clearance."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"But they won't." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Roman looked back at the lanky
young woman in the back of the room he had directed his earlier comment
towards. "You don't know that, Zoey. Colonel Armalin's been teaching them, and
Sergeant Nemec is his lead NCO. He'll have them prepped."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Zoey Robertson (also known as
'Victory'- the team's aquatic specialist) yawned, stretching long, pale-brown
arms into the air before she turned her large, wet, sea-green eyes towards the
others. "You're taking this far too seriously, Roman. The Legionnaires are
jokes. If they could actually do something worthwhile with their powers, then
they'd be here."<br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>
<![if !supportLineBreakNewLine]><br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>
<![endif]></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Don't be so sure &ndash; they'll
probably be counting on the fact that we're supposed to think of them as
beneath us, and use that to jam right into our faces," said the slender
Japanese student sitting next to Jeffrey. "I'm not getting embarrassed by these
guys &ndash; you know that they managed to survive that 'Black Majesty' guy, not to
mention a few other attacks by Class Threes and higher. They're not the jokes
people want to think they are."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Roger that, Ian," Jeffrey
echoed, and the short cadet with the frame of a weightlifter 'high-fived'
Fabian Nogura (code-named 'Typhoon' for his weather-control powers). "We have
to do these guys hard and fast. No personal stuff, no showboating &ndash; just
business. You saw what Quinn Morgendorffer did &ndash; <i>do not</i> let that Heather
draw down on you."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>A cough from Carolyn drew
everyone's attention to the front of the room. "Oh. Yeah. Well, you handle the
carrot-top, and that Lane chick, too."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Carolyn, wearing the
night-black uniform of a <i>Phantom Eagle </i>&ndash; but with a Canadian flag on her
right arm instead of the U.S. flag most of the others wore, or the Japanese
flag on Fabian's arm - held no emotion on her face as she spoke. "I'll take
care of them both."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"As I was saying &ndash; David
Allen, it might be a good idea for you to psi-blast Blum-Deckler right away.
Her psych profile shows she's got very little problem against using force &ndash;
even lethal force &ndash;that's why DEXA has her tagged as a Beta. First chance
anyone gets - put her down."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>A photo of Brittany appeared.
"Taylor, Brittany. Class Two on powers &ndash; Invisibility. <u>Do not</u> let looks
deceive, people; she has fighting skills equal to anyone here &ndash; even you, Zoey,
or you, Carolyn &ndash; and no compunction about using them. In the Legion action
report dealing with her recruitment, it's noted that she nearly took out half
their actives before they broke the hypnotic control over her. <i>Alpha-level
threat</i>. In the first strike, take her down - if we don't, we're going to
lose people."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>A murmur of agreement went
through the room as Brittany's face disappeared and was replaced by Quinn's
face. "The only Alpha-level threat the Legion has in terms of power levels,"
Roman told the gathered members of <i>The Alliance</i>. "Quinn Morgendorffer.
Carolyn, you're a Class Three &ndash; she's a <i>Class Five</i>."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Maryann Lyter (also known as
'Tempest') leaned forward. "Wait a minute, Roman &ndash; I read the briefs on them
before you and me went with the Admiral to Legion Tower! She's a Three &ndash; a
solid Class Three, but still -!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Blame that on Sherrie," Zoey
said, causing everyone in the room to groan. "Apparently, she felt sorry for
the nitwit, so she figured that she'd give her a little help. You know how she
is about runty animals."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Oh, that's just great,"
Jeffrey said, rolling his eyes. "She won't boost anyone else's powers around
here, no matter how much people beg, plead or promise her great sex anytime she
wants it and for as long as she can stand it, but the prom queen shows up and
Sherrie turns her into the Lithium version of the Energizer Bunny! Jeez! What
does she want &ndash; to get into the girl's pants, <i>Passion Cove</i>-style?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The room went graveyard quiet;
wincing, Jeffrey turned to see the skinny, blonde-haired young woman who was
sitting off to the side of Zoey, her face mixing sadness and resignation.
"Kelly &ndash; I'm sorry. I wasn't talking about <u>you</u>-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The resident 'tank' of the
Alliance, Kelly Springer (code-named 'Monolith'), refused to even turn her
forest-green eyes in his direction. "You always apologize &ndash; and then, you make
slimy comments like that all over again." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"You're an ass," Carolyn
snarled; even after all their years together and knowing each other's secrets &ndash;
like Kelly's sexual orientation and the fact that she could only stay in the
military by staying 'in the closet' &ndash; Jeffrey still hadn't learned how to be
tactful around her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The young woman shifted in her
seat. "I have to put up with comments like that all the time just so I get the
government to train me how to fly planes &ndash; so I wish you'd stop with the
lesbian jokes, at least around me."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"She should throw you all the
way to the moon &ndash; and you know that she could," Julia laughed. "If I was as
strong as she was, I'd have tossed you up in the air and hit for distance long
ago."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"C'mon, Duchess &ndash; be honest,"
Jeffrey smirked, tossing a very quick glance at David Allen before focusing on
Julia. "Ever since we turned thirteen, everybody knows that you want to use my
Johnson as a perch."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"If you touch him, you give me
a thousand," Roman barked, catching Julia in mid-fling as she rocketed out of
her chair and lunged for Jeffrey's face. "Sit down and act your age, Carlyle.
Jeffrey &ndash; shut up. You don't get to talk anymore today."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

as they sat back in their chairs, and Roman shook his head before continuing.

back up on her nose before raising her head to reveal her 'girl-next-door' good

her thick, shaggy masses of butter-blonde hair, set in a stylish manner that
perfectly enhanced her features. "But people like the look &ndash; did you see the
