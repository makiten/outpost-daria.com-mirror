<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Cadet Second Class Molly
Castronova brushed a thick, shaggy lock of her long, raven-black hair away from
her forehead, and stepped from the doorway into the enclosed observation lounge
on the roof of Swedlund Hall. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"The Marines said that you
were up here."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Daria Morgendorffer turned to
see the young woman who she had been assigned to as a roommate for her stay at
the U.S. Academy of Extranormal Affairs. "Hard to sleep, or getting your head
clear after being around a lot of people all day long?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The auburn-haired girl turned
around, surprise on her face as she looked at the girl in the USAES sweat suit.
"Are you a telepath?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"No, but my cadre was filled
with them." Molly motioned towards a seat. "May I?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Daria nodded; Molly sat down.
"They usually put between six to ten kids in a cadre; I was the only non-psi in
a group of nine kids. You got any brothers?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"No &ndash; it's just me and my
sister."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Oh, yeah &ndash; the little redhead
that's turning heads all over the campus."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>A surprised eyebrow rose high.
"Really?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"People put a high value on
what they don't see every day. You guys are normal girls and boys with powers &ndash;
emphasis on 'normal' &ndash; and just the way you guys walk sets you apart. Your
sister is like a butterfly; the way she moves is just so carefree, and she
catches their attention. I've heard that you've caught some attention, too."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Daria rolled her eyes. "Oh.
That. I haven't even seen the stupid magazine yet-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"You're kidding."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"I've seen the pictures,
though &ndash; people blast the images to me whenever I walk by. They can't help it,
and I can't help picking them up. A lot of the other telepaths saw the magazine,
too, so I have gotten a very good look at the pictures."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Molly crossed her legs as she
sat back. "I used to get that a lot when I arrived. I came from Laguna Beach &ndash;
oh, I've heard a lot of jokes, especially with the way I look and no, I'm not
being stuck-up &ndash; and I'd just walk through the images they'd project out at me.
God, the things boys stuck in the Midwest think when they meet a girl raised on
the beach in California... I developed early and I spent a lot of time playing
beach volleyball and swimming, so when I got here, tongues were really hanging
out."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i>I can imagine,</i> Daria
thought. <i>Damn, you have to work to find an average-looking girl around here
&ndash; an average-looking cadet around here!</i> "You said, 'blast images'. What do
you mean?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Molly smiled. "It's better if
I show you. What's your favorite food?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Barely had the word 'Pizza'
escaped from her mouth when a 'Garbage' pizza appeared on the table next to
Daria. "How did you &ndash; did you read my mind?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"No, I can't do that &ndash; well,
not technically. I can pull the image of anything in your surface thoughts &ndash;
anything you're actively thinking of, nothing from your memories or
subconscious &ndash; and project either flat-screen images or holograms, with perfect
sound, image and color, or just see them in my own head. I can also project my
own surface thoughts like that, too. <u>That</u> caused more than a few
embarrassing moments in my first year, because I had a bad habit of projecting
either my daydreams or regular dreams onto walls when I drifted off or went to
sleep."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i>Not to mention after I got
to your room this afternoon,</i> Daria thought, thinking of how she had been
very quiet and not awakened Molly when she entered the cadet's room &ndash; and of
how she blushed all the way down to her toenails when she came out of the
bathroom and saw the hologram of what had to be Molly's California home, with
Molly and another girl (who actually seemed somewhat familiar, come to think
about it) kissing passionately... <i>How do you tell someone that you
accidentally peeked in on a sex dream they had?<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"I've also got a 'combat
sense' that warns me of danger a good thirty seconds ahead of time, and a Class
Three psychometric power, so I can go into an area, or touch an object that
belongs to someone, and project holograms of what happened in that area, or
what the person was doing when they had the object. I can go back about one
year; it's kind of cool, really."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Daria sat up, and her hand
passed through the hologram of the pizza. "Hmn. How long have you been here?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Six years. I was fourteen,
and came in as a Cadet Fourth Year &ndash; most of the cadets actually come in as
Third or Fourth Years, because a lot of people manifest around puberty. All
those hormones, teen angst, dreams and desires, doing all sorts of things
because you don't really know any better... the metagene all but jump-starts on
its own. You ever think about why so many people with powers here at the
Academy tend to lean towards being 'flying bricks', having mental powers, or
just some sort of flight power? Think of the way most kids feel during their
teen years, and especially around their first two years in high school. They
actually started calling it the '90210 Syndrome' in Metagenetics classes."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Daria blinked. "Flying brick?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"A standard grouping of
superhuman abilities for a LOT of cadets - flight, super-strength, super-speed
and some level of invulnerability. You wouldn't believe how many flying bricks
are enrolled here &ndash; and as for telepaths, well, I understand that you met the
big guns when you got here, as well as the Class Three psionics with sensory
powers<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&ndash; all thirty or so of them. The
rest of them either decided to stay slightly clear of you or used their Mark 30
augmenters to totally suppress their powers when you arrived; you're so
powerful that you could burn a lot of them out."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"How many psychics are here?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Telepaths, or people with
psychic-based powers?" Molly laughed. "Just over fifteen percent of the Corps
of Cadets &ndash; and a solid five percent are telepaths. Let's just say that you
have a lot of people who are interested in you. Anyway, about my cadre &ndash; they
started treating me like the only sister in a family with lots of boys. I know
so much about psychic training that it's not even funny, and after four years
with them, I'm very sensitive to how and what psychics do. I figured that you'd
find somewhere to be alone for a while."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Daria shifted in her seat.
"I'm not trying to be stand-offish-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Molly gave her an
understanding smile. "Like I said before, 'I know.' I just came up to keep you
company, in case a couple of the boy puppies around here shows up. 'Boys will
be boys', and all of that."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>They were both quiet for
several minutes. "Where are your friends? Are they all still here?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>A strange look went across
Molly's face. "Some of them."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>They both sat in awkward
silence. "Hey &ndash; let's see what kind of taste you have in pizza."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>She reached over, and took a
slice of the pizza, biting in as Daria watched in amazement. "Oh &ndash; my power got
a little stronger with practice, and as I got older; I can actually make some
of my holograms real. Nothing over my actual weight &ndash; I can make any kind of
clothes I need, or foods &ndash; small things. No cars, which sucks, because I miss
having my own car around."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Living things?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Yes, but they only stay for
about an hour, at the most. I'm still working on that." Molly glanced over at
Daria, her face inquisitive. "Oh. I was projecting when you came in this
afternoon, wasn't I?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Daria hesitated, and then
nodded; Molly took on a sheepish expression. "Oops. I guess the little hand
says it's time to be embarrassed. I took a weekend liberty last weekend and
went back home to visit my parents. They had taken a spot-of-the-moment trip
down to Baja and I messed them, but I found out that a &ndash; a friend of mine from
high school &ndash; was back in town from shooting movies up in Vancouver. We, ah,
spent a bit of time getting re-acquainted with each other."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Can I ask you something?"
Daria spoke up, jumping away from that subject very quickly. "Are all people
with psychic powers so &ndash; I mean &ndash; <i><u>open</u></i> with everything about
themselves?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Occupational hazard," Molly
said. "You haven't spent much time around other psis, have you? The openness is
a side effect; that's part of why a lot of the cadets just went dark when you
arrived. You haven't had anyone just popping into your mind like sticking their
head through the open door of someone's room, and from what I've heard, you
don't have much in the way of active defenses, but you could probably just burn
some of the low-powered cadets down just by throwing your full power at them
and shouting mentally. God help them if you develop some form of mental blast."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Molly all but devoured the
first slice, and reached for another. "God, this is a great pizza, I can see
why it's your favorite. I'm sorry for embarrassing you about earlier; I'll take
some 'flush' before I go to sleep tonight. That way, you won't wake up in the
Veritas Movie House." She shrugged. "My grandpa would tell stories about being
in the Navy and stationed at Great Lakes, and about this movie house in Central
Illinois that him and his friends would drive down to because it showed X-rated
films. I've always remembered that."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"You're going into the Navy?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"<u>Are you kidding</u>?
Department of Homeland Security, as a special investigator &ndash; and after I
fulfill my Federal Service obligation, I get to go out as a private security
contractor for <u>at least</u> twenty or thirty times the pay! Why do I want to
go into the military? The pay sucks, the UCMJ is just too strict on anything
fun you want to do, and even though I wear them now, uniforms are not my idea
of what I want to wear to work every morning."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Daria shrugged, and reached
over for a slice of the pizza. "Can you think of something to drink?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Molly smiled; in an instant,
two huge mugs of fruit punch appeared on the table besides the pizza. "You know
&ndash; you're not what most of us expected."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When Daria's eyes flicked up, she shrugged. "Rumor had it that you were
some sort of stuck-up teen super-bitch, and when you got hooked up with that
Legion thing..." Her voice trailed off. "You don't seem like that."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"What do I seem like to you?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Well, honestly &ndash; you seem
just like everyone else," Molly told her. "You seem almost normal, compared to
the folks around this petting zoo."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The door of the lounge opened,
and the two young women looked up to see a female Marine in fatigues standing
there. "Cadet Castronova &ndash; lights out in thirty."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Thank you, Gunny," Molly
said, and motioned towards Daria. "Gunny Swisten, this is Daria-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Morgendorffer," the Marine
finished the sentence. "I've got three sons. I definitely know who <u>you</u>

convoy she had been riding in had come under attack and she started busting
caps on insurgents &ndash; but was an excellent baker. Lee's fellow Marines had

bag filled with cookies; he knew that those were just for him, while he shared
the others with his troopmates. "The Gunny did herself proud with this batch,
