<i><u>The Little Drummer Girl</u><br>
<br>
<br>
A <u>Legion of Lawndale Heroes</u> 'Mini', by Brother Grimace</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Legion of Lawndale Heroes created by James Bowman</b><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>(<u>Continuity note</u>: This Mini takes place during the events of LLH 13:5
and 13:6.)</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>"Why should we be in such desperate haste to succeed and in such desperate
enterprises? If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is
because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears,
however measured or far away..."<br>
<br>
<br>
-Henry David Thoreau, <u>Walden</u>, 1854</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Maybe it was meant to be like this all along.<br>
<br>
From what I understand, Mr. Stark didn't want the Colonel to make us into
soldiers &ndash; he just wanted us to get some help in learning to protect ourselves
&ndash; especially after everything that happened. That freaky <u>Cypher</u> guy with
the crystal in his chest, those three that caught almost everybody, if it
hadn't been for Upchuck, that <u>Black Majesty</u> guy, and when Sandi got
stabbed in the bottom...<br>
<br>
Let anybody try that on her now. <br>
<br>
Let anybody try that on <u>me</u> now.<br>
<br>
They said that they couldn't help me learn like the others at <u>Legion Tower</u>,
so when Julia was offered a spot with the Legion, they offered me a chance to
go to the Academy.<br>
<br>
Maybe I <u>could</u> do better there. <br>
<br>
Maybe I could be a <u>soldier</u>. </i><br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>I've been here at the Academy for just over five months. I went back to
Lawndale with the others, and came back a week later. <br>
<br>
The teaching group at the Tower couldn't help me, but here - I'm getting
better. My grades are a bit better, and they're always asking what you're
reading &ndash; not assignments, but just... stuff. Around here, they like reading &ndash; I
mean, they like it, like I like going shopping.<br>
<br>
One of the nice things is that they don't push you hard &ndash; just enough to get
you moving &ndash; and I think that they do that so that I won't quit. I won't quit,
no matter how hard they push. I have to prove that I can make it here. <br>
<br>
In the meanwhile, it's nice here in the fall. It's the middle of October now,
and it's starting to cool off here, but nobody's had to start wearing coats or
stuff. I found a stone garden that somebody built just off the main path
through the Academy forest; it's peaceful here. I like coming out here when I
need to study, or just when I want to be alone for a while-</i><br>
<br>
"Dawgs on a snack run!"<br>
<br>
Tiffany looked up from her copy of <i>China: Its Most Scenic Places</i> as a
large energy bubble appeared on the path in front of her. "Let's jet, T!"<br>
<br>
<i>When you start off here, they put you in what they call a 'cadre' &ndash; a group
of between six to ten kids &ndash; and you all go through the First Academy together.
I asked one of the instructors why we had to do it, and she said, "Because your
cadre is the best thing about the Academy &ndash; it's a group of boys and girls who
are just like your brothers and sisters!"<br>
<br>
I caught her by surprise when I said, "But then, what's the worst thing about
the Academy? Is it <u>being forced</u> to constantly be with a bunch of other
boys and girls who are just like my brothers and sisters? Who says that is a
good thing? Have you <u>met</u> my brothers and sisters?"<br>
<br>
I don't have any brothers or sisters, but still.<br>
<br>
The woman sat and looked at me for a good minute &ndash; and then, just got up and
walked away. <br>
<br>
Now I know how Quinn's sister feels when she talks to most people who think
that they're in charge &ndash; and how both she and Quinn must have felt when
somebody threw the other up in their face. <br>
<br>
Sometimes &ndash; you just have to go with it.</i><br>
<br>
Tiffany simply sighed, not even bothering to move as the bubble expanded out to
engulf her &ndash; and then, simply disappeared. <br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<br>
Ten minutes later, the energy bubble re-appeared; Tiffany, a Styrofoam
container in her hands, found herself standing behind the stone bench. "Oh,
stop stressing, T!"<br>
<br>
Her eyes momentarily narrowed as Eileen Reynolds ruffled her hair, and then,
Tiffany relaxed. "See? You only <i>thought</i> about dragging me down into the
ground and letting go! You are lightening up!" <br>
<br>
The superbly-fit, athletic girl whose pale complexion, short-cropped red hair
(a brighter shade of red than Quinn Morgendorffer's carrot-top, but nowhere
near the brilliant scarlet of Julia Carlyle's mane) and Boston accent screamed
out her Irish heritage punched the Asian girl lightly in the shoulder. "Keep
this up, and we'll have to see about letting you loose on the townies again...
not to mention that I know a really cute geology major up at Notre Dame, and he
has lots of friends just as good-looking as he is."<br>
<br>
<i>That could be fun. Hanging out with the others is fun, even if Kaliq's the
only one interested in fashion... and the thing is - he's <u>not</u> gay. Oh,
God, is he not gay. He's faster than Skyler Feldman ever dreamed of being &ndash; the
guys we Fashion Club girls dated before everything happened were <u>never</u>
as smooth as he is &ndash; and the wardrobe he has back at home in Dearborn...</i><br>
<br>
Eileen &ndash; a Cadet Second Year, just like Tiffany and the others - sat down on
the stone bench, unwrapping her five-cheese and lettuce sub sandwich as three
more cadets &ndash; a tall, very handsome boy of Arabic descent and a girl with dark
blonde hair (unlike most USAES cadets, she wore her hair in a shower over her
shoulders), both slightly younger than her, and a very tall, slender boy with
whitish-blond hair &ndash; stepped out of the energy bubble.<br>
<br>
Kaliq Murat held out the drumstick-sized piece of blue-green crystal he held in
his left hand, and the energy bubble flowed back into it with a distinctive
CRACK! "And that - is that," the Arab-American cadet mused, speaking to no one
in particular in an accent-free voice as the crystal in his hand faded away.
"Another successful escape from the boredom of campus life &ndash; courtesy of
'Crystal Ventures, Incorporated'."<br>
<br>
"Even if I wasn't a telepath, I could tell that all you're thinking about is
how much money you'll make with your <i>'Gateway To Adventure'</i> ideas," the
blond-haired boy scoffed, his cultured English accent capturing Tiffany's
attention. "Remember, Kal &ndash; you own six to ten years of servitude to your
friendly <u>Uncle Samuel</u> before you're allowed to make money transporting
bored, wealthy persons all over the world for 'extreme vacations'..."<br>
<br>
Tiffany yawned; after five months with her cadre, she knew that even though
Kaliq and Zachary Butler &ndash; the blond-haired boy - both had psychic powers, each
was slightly jealous of the other's unusual twists on their abilities &ndash; and
both were just a little bit too competitive. <i>Kal can generate all sorts of
other powers &ndash; even ones that aren't psychic &ndash; with his crystals, and Zachary
is just more of a 'real psychic', because he doesn't have to send his powers
through something to use them.</i><br>
<br>
Kaliq stepped around Tiffany to stand over Zachary Butler. "Perhaps, Zachary &ndash;
but I won't be working <i>'outside the government &ndash; beyond the police'...!"</i><br>
<br>
The handsome young British telepath cocked his head back to look up at his
teammate, and blew a wayward lock of whitish-blonde hair out of his eyes. "True
- but in order to do so, you had to give up your <i>lifelong dream</i> of
flying for a country that operates its Air Force out of a <u>carpet shop</u>."<br>
<br>
"Put your telepathic probes back in your pants and save it for later, both of
you," Eileen said, her voice holding the no-nonsense tone that Tiffany learned
early on meant 'stop playing around &ndash; NOW'. "Your food's getting cold. That's
why we snuck out, right &ndash; to get some non-Academy-approved chow?"<br>
<br>
The two male cadets followed Eileen's pointed finger to a spot on the grass,
and as they sat down, Tiffany looked down at the container in her hands. "Come
on, T &ndash; dig in!" Eileen urged, before biting into her sandwich. "It's kosher &ndash;
Jeffrey Brace and all of the Jewish cadets love that hotel in New Orleans! Not
only do they have <i>The Club</i> - and you can get <u>anything</u> to eat
there - but you can see all sorts of celebrities hanging out on the Fourth
Floor!"<br>
<br>
"Wow, look at that sky," Katherine McKay said, walking past the others with eyes
scanning the swirling clouds building overhead. "If I were back at home, I'd be
worried about snow &ndash; but this is October and Indiana..." <br>
<br>
The blonde-haired girl looked into the sky; she took a waver-thin digital
camera from the left-breast pocket of her uniform shirt, and snapped several
photos. "This is weird."<br>
<br>
Tiffany felt a slight shudder pass through her; she had seen how Katharine's
power to bring to life <i>anything</i> she wanted, from any source (television,
film, magazines, photographs, sidewalk graffiti, sketchings, digital
billboards; even cave drawings and &ndash; on one memorable occasion, a 'Lite-Brite'
toy) &ndash; and with all the abilities, and just as powerful, as the originals.
"You're... not... going... to... make... it... rain... inside... again...are... you...?"<br>
<br>
Katherine looked back at Tiffany, and smiled a coy smile. "I hope that doesn't
still bother you, T. The weather-warpers &ndash; most of them - they're almost as
stuck up as, well, some other types I could mention around these parts."<br>
<br>
In perfect unison, Kaliq and Zachary looked over to give the blonde identical
looks of annoyance, and Katherine winked at Tiffany. "In any event - I won't
have to cue up a Weather Channel tape of Hurricane Katrina anytime soon around
here. Oh, yeah &ndash; boys? Just remember; when you're thinking about me naked &ndash; and
I know that you do - <i><u>Bro Code</u> Rule 34</i> <u>still</u> applies. "<br>
<br>
As identical looks of undiluted disgust marred the faces of the two telepaths,
Tiffany sat down besides Eileen, and looked over the hot beef sandwich bought
for her with what Eileen called 'their road trip fund'. <i>A little collection
of cash they put together for emergencies, quick trips, or for 'things that
might suddenly come up'. They've got something like thirty thousand dollars in
that stuffed owl, and they didn't mind telling me about it...<br>
<br>
I'm <b><u>one of them</u></b>. Eileen helps me with my studies. It helps that
we're roommates, and that she's very, very smart. She's smart like Charles, and
that Sherrie girl that Jane's brother has been dating all summer. I wonder what
Quinn's sister will say when she finds out about that &ndash; or even if she cares,
from the way she would look at Tom every now and then. Still &ndash; Sherrie's cute,
but not as pretty as Quinn's sister &ndash; as pretty as <u>Daria</u> could be if
she'd stop hiding it, like when they put her photos in <u>VAL</u> Magazine.<br>
<br>
The boy cadets still ask if I can set them up with Daria &ndash; all the time. Funny;
they don't ask as much about getting fixed up with Quinn anymore. I wonder
why...?</i><br>
<br>
A trio of male cadets ran past on the trail, and Eileen nudged Tiffany to make
sure she saw how the three were each looking Tiffany over... <br>
<br>
Tiffany nodded and focused back on her food, but kept looking up to gaze at the
members of her cadre.<br>
<br>
<i>Zachary takes extra time to work with me &ndash; on the target range and with
hand-to-hand practice &ndash; and he doesn't even try to cop a feel, even though he's
has all sorts of chances. Kaliq always tries to help me with extra computer
lessons and whatever else I need &ndash; and he goes out of his way to step on anyone
who tries to make fun of me. The 8x10s that Katherine's shot of me are good
enough to use for my portfolio when I try out for modeling, and with her
powers, I can have anything I've ever seen anywhere to wear on a date. Clothes,
shoes, jewelry...and if I ever told her about some of the... other things I've
gotten to do because of Katherine's powers, Sandi would <u>faint</u>!</i> <br>
<br>
<i>They don't make fun of me &ndash; well, any more than they would anyone else. They
don't get mad when I take too long to figure out something, and they don't get
mad when I- when I get someone in VR training. </i><br>
<br>
<i>They like it. They say it's sneaky &ndash; and that it's a good thing.<br>
<br>
They like me for who I am.</i><br>
<br>
The members of <i>Training Cadre 3872</i> made themselves comfortable in the
shaded area &ndash; and Tiffany growled as one of the thick slices from her hot beef
sandwich began to slowly move on its own towards the edge of the container...<br>
<br>
"Leave... my... stuff... alooonnneee..."<br>
<br>
Eileen glanced off to her left as she saw the beef slice stop moving; she took
a bite off the end of her crusty bread, tilted her head towards Zachary - and a
sharp 'OW!' rang out through the woods as the blond-haired boy flew backwards a
good three feet.<br>
<br>
"Oh, come on, Eileen!" Zachary hissed, wincing as he rubbed the spot where
Eileen had spat the chunk of bread with her super-breath. "It's just a little
piece of meat-<u>HEY</u>! I wasn't bringing up <u>that song</u>! <i>I wasn't
making fun of <u>you</u>!"</i> <br>
<br>
The blond-haired telepath's eyes went wide as he scrambled back further;
Eileen's eyes glowed red for several seconds as she glared at him, but then,
returned to normal. "My word!" Zachary screeched, ignoring Kaliq's laughter as
he scrambled to his feet. "You spend all this time trying to keep 'T' from
ghosting everything and everyone that <u>she</u> believes crossed her, but then
<u>you</u> nearly give me the bloody 'evil eye' and roast me like an ill-tended
brisket!" <br>
<br>
Zachary quickly turned to Katherine, who snickered between bites of her fish
and chips. "Oh, and your corn-fed Saskatchewan humor is very tiresome,
Katherine," he said, sitting back up. "Thoughts like that are annoying &ndash; and by
the way, entirely inaccurate."<br>
<br>
"I'm from Manitoba &ndash; and that's 'wheat-fed', thank you very much," Katherine
snorted. "You must spend a lot of time in the TIDE-pools, then, because from
what I've seen-"<br>
<br>
Zachary straightened his uniform slacks. "Really? Well, <i>have you <u>seen</u>-</i>"<br>
<br>
"You don't have to prove it!" <br>
<br>
Zachary grimaced at the combined shouts from everyone &ndash; even Tiffany &ndash; as his
hand drifted towards the zipper of his slacks. "Just kidding," he said, wincing
as Eileen's glare weighed down on him. "I wasn't going to &ndash; I'm eating,
already."<br>
<br>
Eileen winked at Tiffany. "See? That's one of the best things about being a
'flying brick', T. Your powers might be simple and far from glamorous &ndash;
strength, speed, flight and invulnerability of a sort - but smart-ass
Englishmen know enough to behave when you tell them to. Right, boys?"<br>
<br>
The two male voices spoke as one. "Right, <i><u>Boss</u>."</i><br>
<br>
Tiffany smiled as Eileen's gaze stayed on Zachary and Kaliq, even after the
former sat down next to his fellow telepath, and they began sprinkling lots of
black pepper over their large orders of biscuits and sausage gravy. <i>Yeah.
That's one benefit of having a 'flying brick' as your roommate &ndash; if you two get
along, nobody meddles with you much,</i> she thought, as Eileen nudged her and
smiled. <i>She's got the same powers as Tom and Maryann Lyter &ndash; except they're
just a little weaker, but all of her powers are on. She can still throw <u>supertankers</u>
at people &ndash; weird, how that's the way the big guns measure things.</i><br>
<br>
She noticed how the boys got very quiet, concentrating on their food. <i>What
is it with all the telepaths around here, that they act as if that's the best
food in the world?</i> she wondered. <i>I wonder if Daria's started eating
that, now that she's spent some time around here.</i><br>
<br>
She took a bite of her sandwich, surprised at how good it was. <i>My parents
aren't worried about being observant, and even though I'm not, either, it's
nice that people are concerned about me.<br>
<br>
People besides the <u>Fashion Club</u>, or the Legionnaires</i>. <br>
<br>
<i>Tiffany swallowed, took another, larger bite &ndash; and watched the others as
they ate and made small talk, surprised by how- comfortable &ndash; she felt around
them. <br>
<br>
Kal's got cute brown eyes &ndash; even cuter than Zachary's blue ones, although you
can't tell Zachary anything, not with his swollen head... just because he looks
like a male supermodel, has that cool British accent and that perfect hair that
you want to run your fingers through...<br>
<br>
UGH! Look at the way he's smiling &ndash; you <u>know</u> that he just heard what I
was thinking! Jerk! Well, guess what &ndash; Eileen told me how to find out if you're
'listening in' on us...</i><br>
<br>
"That's <i><u>disgusting</u>!&quot;</i> Zachary bellowed, almost choking on a
drink of ice water as he set his container down and started to pace, trying to
both clear his throat and shake clear the images he had seen in Tiffany's
surface thoughts &ndash; <i>Thank God he has to make an effort to probe anyone's
deeper thoughts</i>, she said, letting another barrage of debauchery cross her
mind, <i>and can only pick what you're directly thinking of.</i> "How can &ndash;
where did you <u>see</u> &ndash; I will <u>not</u> be able to eat fresh pineapple for
months!"<br>
<br>
"Serves you right, you Union Jack-ass," Eileen laughed, her Boston accent
flavoring her speech. "That's right &ndash; I'm Irish, and I went there! Hey, Kal?
You want to throw down a spike, so we can all eat in peace and quiet?"<br>
<br>
The Arabic cadet held his right hand out; a pencil-sized length of purple
crystal formed in his palm and he slammed it into the ground next to where he
sat, where it began to grow until it reached a meter in height and the
thickness of a soda can. "Now, Zachary &ndash; you and your probing mind-fingers will
behave themselves for the next hour or so &ndash; or until I remove that crystal," he
said, humor in his voice. "Let her tell you what's on her mind. Most Western
women can't wait to do that."<br>
<br>
"Oh, stop it," Katherine sniped in. "While you're playing with your <i>jewels</i>
&ndash; why don't you show another episode of Tiffany and her friends in action?"<br>
<br>
Tiffany's head snapped up. <i>Quinn and the others thought it was cool when
that Martin guy who liked Qui- <u>Daria</u> &ndash; fixed the TV so we could see
stuff about us that never really happened to us, but to the other ones that
like us &ndash; that are us, but not us &ndash; It makes my head hurt to think about it. I
don't like it. I don't like that Kal can do it. I don't want to know any more
about the Legion Gold Team, or the other me and the rest of them in the Legion
Blue Team &ndash; even though the Jonas Brothers do the music at the beginning and
the show me talking to three cute Marines when the alarm goes off and we have
to go. Why do people care about all of the other 'thems' out there &ndash; wherever -
and not just pay attention to just themselves? If bad things happen to them,
then you worry if it could happen to you, and then you're not thinking about
the bad things that could happen to you and not them, and then, the bad things
happen to you, and then &ndash; what if there's another you that's watching you like
we were watching them, and they're watching to see if bad things are going to
happen to you co they can know if they can make sure that they won't happen to
them-</i><br>
<br>
"Later for that, Kat," Eileen said, noticing the look of extreme stress on
Tiffany's face &ndash; something she had learned to recognize after a very difficult
summer. "T's not into that."<br>
<br>
Katherine glanced at Tiffany with an apologetic expression. "Sorry, T."<br>
<br>
Tiffany smiled back at her. "That's... <i>okay</i>." <br>
<br>
Eileen could almost feel the relief flow from Tiffany. "In case all of you were
wondering why I said 'okay' to spending our free afternoon out here just
hanging out &ndash; it's because I've got some news..."<br>
<br>
Tiffany tensed just a bit, but relaxed as Zachary spun around to look directly
into Eileen's eyes &ndash; and let exasperation pour from him. "Oh, <u>sticks</u>!"
he spat out. "This is just... ugh!"<br>
<br>
Kaliq and Katherine began laughing as the English teen directed his glare from
Eileen to the crystal spike. "You brought it upon yourself," Kaliq commented.
"What news?"<br>
<br>
<i>If there's one thing that bothers me about Eileen, it's that she likes
making people wait for good news. It balances out &ndash; because if there's bad
news, she just tells you outright. I guess that's part of how we all woke up
one morning and started following her lead.</i><br>
<br>
Eileen set her sandwich &ndash; what was left of it &ndash; aside. <i>God, can she <u>eat</u>!</i>
Tiffany thought, her gaze traveling from the sandwich to Eileen. <i>Where does
it all go-?</i><br>
<br>
"Well, you know how we were scheduled to run a Level Five VR sequence on Friday
&ndash; one of the short-duration, basic-acclimation scenarios?"<br>
<br>
<i>Kaliq smiled that smile we all learned to fear &ndash; the one that usually ends
up with a visit the next day to the dorms by Cadet Commander Vargas (He really
is cute, and makes those uniforms work), Cadet Major Reynolds (she's still just
as pretty as she was when we were here in the spring &ndash; she's in charge of the
students who work with machines), or one of the other seniors &ndash; I mean, Cadets
First Year.<br>
<br>
Usually, they just send Farrington.<br>
<br>
I'm</i> <b><u>still</u></b> <i>going to get him.</i> <br>
<br>
<i>He peeked into our heads to find out stuff about us. Kal and Zachary can do
that &ndash; but they always ask. Even when Zachary does it &ndash; that sur-face stuff &ndash;
by accident, he isn't trying to be mean. <br>
<br>
<u>He</u> did it to get us.<br>
<br>
He told that Zoey girl stuff so she could hurt me &ndash; and Sandi.<br>
<br>
He tried to hurt Stacy.<br>
<br>
He <u>hurt</u> Quinn.<br>
<br>
He made me <u>FAT</u>.<br>
<br>
I'm...going... to... <u>GET</u>... him. </i><br>
<br>
"I'm going to pretend that you didn't write another SPECTRE program, Kal,"
Eileen said, shaking her head. "Of course, we all know that you probably did,
and hacked your way into the VR systems through an Iphone... Looks like Jackie's
got a case of measles and passed it around to everyone in her cadre &ndash; not to
mention half of Cocking Hall."<br>
<br>
A quick chorus of snorts and giggles made a frown appear on the redhead's face.
"Grow up," Eileen snapped. "Anyway, they're going to be out of it until at
least next week, so I jumped in and got their time added to ours. That gives us
a full hour in VR, if we want it &ndash; and if we have an hour, we can-"<br>
<br>
"Combat training," Zachary cut in, his eyes shining. "Oh, yes. Who do we get to
go up against?"<br>
<br>
Tiffany felt anticipation begin building inside her as Eileen glanced at her
before speaking to the others. "We get a choice," she told them. "We can take
either Blond Ambition and their translator-"<br>
<br>
The Asian girl rolled her eyes at the mention of 'Blonde Ambition' &ndash; the
nickname that had been foisted upon <i>Training Cadre 3000</i>. <i>All of those
REALLY attractive blondes, and Sherrie Klein,</i> Tiffany thought, <i>and she's
probably smarter and more dangerous than all of them put together. She also has
the hottest guys chasing after her, even though she's dating Trent &ndash; <u>HEY</u>!</i><br>
<br>
Tiffany and Eileen shrieked in unison as a pretty girl with very light brown
skin, huge brown eyes hidden behind a generic pair of glasses, and a mass of
shaggy brown hair appeared just over their heads, and walked down a series of
small, glowing disks to the ground before. <br>
<br>
<i>Oh, look,</i> Tiffany said, her eyes going narrow as the girl - dressed in a
uniform skirt instead of slacks like the others - did a textbook-proper
courtesy, and all but skipped over to Katherine, who had a Styrofoam container
waiting for her. <i>It's today's meeting of the 'We love David Allen Farrington
Society.'</i><br>
<br>
Tiffany watched as the very tall Susanna Featherstone - who towered over even
Zachary, she recalled with a slight touch of jealousy - ignored the way that
Zachary glanced over at her long legs as she sat down next to Katherine, dug
into a huge meat loaf sandwich, and made girlish squeals of delight as
Katherine took her digital camera out to show her photos of David Allen working
out with free weights.<br>
<br>
<i>EWWWWWWW. Those two have got it <u>bad</u> for the jerk &ndash; ask either of
them, and they can go on and on about the things he's done, where he went to
school, how many awards he has, the planes he flew, his family's company...Ew. I
bet they think that just because Julia and me have traded places, that <u>they</u>
have a shot at him. <u>As if!</u><br>
<br>
I don't see what a girl that looks like Julia would want with a guy like him
anyway. After all, <u>both</u> Julia's and David Allen's families have <b>lots
and lots</b> of money...</i><br>
<br>
Glancing over at Zachary, Susanna turned back to give Katherine a smirk as she
snapped her fingers - and Zachary yelped as a fluffy white rabbit appeared in
his lap! He brushed the animal off, and glared at Susanna as the rabbit scampered
off into the woods. "Stop that!"<br>
<br>
<i>Oh, yeah. She's REALLY big into magic &ndash; illusions and stuff - and her powers
make her good at it. She does shows for the kids at the hospitals &ndash; and the way
she made that cargo plane disappear at the Agency talent show back at the
beginning of the year...</i><br>
<br>
"Hello, Susanna," Eileen said, still annoyed by her appearance. "Glad you could
finally pull yourself out of a hat and join us."<br>
<br>
Tiffany marveled at just how much Susanna reminded her of Quinn Morgendorffer
as the girl smiled, shrugged, and continued to eat her sandwich. "As I was
saying," Eileen continued, "We can either be the Red Team against <i>Training
Cadre 3000</i>-"<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, I'm looking forward to <u>that</u>," Katherine said. "Playing
punching dummies for the beach warriors. I'd rather spend an entire summer-"<br>
<br>
The girl's twisted with disgust as she seemed to recall a particularly hideous
memory. <i>"Detasseling corn. <u>Pass</u>."</i><br>
<br>
As the others echoed Katherine's sentiments, Eileen's smile grew wider as she
turned to face Tiffany. "The other option we have is to play 'capture the flag'
- against <i>Training Cadre 2996</i>."<br>
<br>
Tiffany felt herself blush as the others turned to her with huge smiles on
their faces. "If we do this, what'll it be &ndash; fourteen straight wins in a row?"
Zachary laughed, sitting up. "Even though they're all better trained than up &ndash;
so far &ndash; all we have to do is hold them up long enough for T to slip right
through and take it from them!"<br>
<br>
<i>I wonder...</i> "Are we allowed to use weapons?" Tiffany asked; the moment the
question cleared her lips, the others started to laugh. <br>
<br>
"That's our girl!" Katherine said, giving her a 'thumbs-up' as stuck her other
hand out and started collecting dollar bills from the other cadets. <br>
<br>
Tiffany saw Eileen pull a dollar from her pocket and pass it over to the
Canadian girl. "What's so funny?" she asked. <br>
<br>
"Thinking about the looks on their faces if we let you take that &ndash; <u>thing</u>
into VR with us!" Eileen snorted &ndash; an unusual sound coming from her, Tiffany
thought. "People around here will <i><u>forever</u></i> rue the day that you
saw that meteor hammer in <i>Kill Bill, Part One</i> and found out that you
could learn how to use something like it!"<br>
<br>
"Especially since you can," Zachary rang in, remembering just how fast Tiffany
had taken to the <i>Manriki-gusari</i> &ndash; especially in terms of learning how to
channel her power through it. <i>Just how many people has she brained, lassoed
or just <u>yanked screaming</u> through a wall, tree or down through the ground
with that thing in VR or live-fire &ndash; my word, I've stopped counting.</i> <br>
<br>
<i>She's a walking PFT, that one &ndash; no, she's something straight out of one of
those horror films from the Eighties . Thank God she's on <u>our</u> side. She
damn well <u>terrifies</u> most of the other people that might have to go up
against her.</i><br>
<br>
"Remember how ticked off those two <i>Phantom Eagles</i> were when she got them
through the toilet stall back in August &ndash; hmm?" Katharine began to speak, but
was cut off by the sound of beeping; all of the cadets pulled their
Academy-issue cell-phones out to see that a text message had come across on
every phone:<br>
<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Training Cadre 3872 &ndash; <b>report to <u>Cocking Hall</u></b></i><br>
<br>
<i>I wonder what that's all about</i>?<br>
<br>
"Picnic's over," Eileen said, rising to her feet. <br>
<br>
"Before it even began," Zachary groused, as he also rose. "I haven't even had a
chance to make out with anyone &ndash; what about you, T? Care to take a moment and
help the Empire rise again?"<br>
<br>
Faster than Zachary expected, Tiffany reached out and raked his body from chin
to crotch in one violent movement; even Eileen nodded with approval as the
young telepath's clothing &ndash; except for his boxer shorts - fell away from him
like water, placed in momentary phase by her power. "Keep your mouth closed and
put your clothes on," the redhead said. "Nice work, T. You're really improved
on selective phasing &ndash; and leaving him his shorts was a nice touch.<br>
<br>
<i>It always feels good when Eileen gives me a compliment. She's honest, and
tells you when you're doing it right.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<br>
<i><u>Ugh</u>. What does <u>he</u> want-?</i><br>
<br>
Tiffany and the other members of her cadre stopped in unison as they saw Cadet
First Class David Allen Farrington &ndash; the <i>Deputy Cadet Commander of Corps</i>,
and the current ranking cadet telepath &ndash; as he sat in the spacious lounge area
of <u>Cocking Hall</u>. <br>
<br>
Several young telepathic cadets &ndash; Sixth and Fifth Class, from their insignia
and the copper Greek letter 'Psi' on their lapels, Tiffany noticed, sat on the
couches across from David Allen, their eyes wide (and irises glowing electric
blue, as were his) as they all spoke telepathically. <br>
<br>
Zachary began smoothing out his hair and uniform, quickly checking his
reflection, but stopped when Tiffany stared at him.<br>
<br>
<i>David Allen Farrington is <u>not</u> that special, Zachary,</i> Tiffany
thought, scowling as she turned to see Kaliq checking to see if his uniform was
in proper order. <i>He's &ndash; <u>okay</u> to look at, if you don't have anybody
else that's really good-looking around. <u>All</u> of the other boys in <u>The
Alliance</u> are <b>MUCH</b> better looking than him &ndash; I don't see why a girl
like Julia Carlyle - or any reasonably good-looking girl would crush on him, or
want to do anything with him. I see how Julia looks at him whenever she comes
back here and they all do stuff together.</i> <br>
<br>
<i>I don't get why Julia wants to be bothered with him &ndash; she's got her own
money &ndash; lots of it - and even if she didn't, money isn't THAT important. After
all, if you're going to date someone, the important thing is that it's someone
that you can be seen out in public with. </i><br>
<br>
<i>He doesn't even dress nice, even when he <u>doesn't</u> have to wear a
uniform &ndash; I remember when his brother came to visit on Bowman Day and I knew it
had to be his twin, because HE looks good, and has real clothes, and knows how
you're supposed to treat a girl. </i><br>
<br>
Tiffany looked back at Zachary, and just shook her head. <br>
<br>
<i>If I ever said this out loud, it would make your head swell up bigger than
it is now,</i> she thought very loudly, <i>but I don't see what <u>any</u> of
you think is so special about him &ndash; and especially <u>you</u>, Zachary, because
not only are you super-hot, but you're, like, British royalty or something-</i><br>
<br>
Tiffany almost jumped out of her shoes as Zachary's psi-voice rang out clearly
in her mind:<br>
<br>
<b>*Show a little respect for the Prime, T. He took down <u>Daria Morgendorffer</u>
&ndash; and from what I heard, there's probably only three or four telepaths here who
could stand up to her. Amorette could do it &ndash; if they were linked, Jeanette and
Jacquelyn could stand up to her - and as long as he could keep himself awake,
Jefferson could block her powers out. In a head-to-head, though, he'd be lucky
if all she did was ghost him-*</b><br>
<br>
Her eyes became angry slits as a second, equally familiar voice also
reverberated in her mind. <br>
<br>
<b>[She has leave to think whatever she wants about me, Zachary &ndash; and stop
thinking about Combat Psi for the moment. You're <u>at least</u> a full year
away from being ready for that &ndash; and you need to work on building up your
telekinesis. Even with that, with your Martial Supremacy ability...]</b><br>
<br>
Tiffany turned to see David Allen walking towards them. <b>[In the meantime &ndash;
you rats need to go and get your next dose of 'flush' before your afternoon
sessions. Heather, all of us had to take the pills &ndash; it's only been seven
weeks, you'll get used to it, and you're not supposed to scan people without a
reason, you know that. You know that too, Zachary &ndash; even surface thoughts.
Dean, Leo &ndash; stop skipping doses so you can astral project over to the EA dorms.
Christine, Amorette, Jacquelyn and Jeanette are all going to be on the lookout
for you &ndash; and if Amorette catches you snooping... Evaporate, small people!]</b><br>
<br>
As the young cadets scattered, Tiffany noticed the different colors of the Psi
symbol on their uniforms-<br>
<br>
<b>*The copper is for 'newbies' &ndash; the young sprouts who don't have full control
yet, T*,</b> Zachary thought-cast to her. <b>*Lads like me sport bronze &ndash; old
enough to have control, but not trained yet. You get silver when you get your
Mark 30 and start serious brain-training, gold after you get at least one Level
One certification &ndash; and platinum for the combat-actives like Prime-*<br>
<br>
[Zachary.]<br>
<br>
Sorry, Prime &ndash; David Allen. Force of habit. That's what everyone else calls
you-*<br>
<br>
[You are not 'everyone else', Zachary. You are a telepath. Never forget that.
You should remember that as well, Kaliq.]</b><br>
<br>
Tiffany almost jumped as Kaliq's voice suddenly flowed through her mind like a
cool, refreshing drink of water. <b>===Yes, sir &ndash; and thank you, T. That was a
beautiful comparison.===</b><br>
<br>
<b>[I need to speak to Tiffany &ndash; actually speak to her. I figured that one of
you would have her in tow. You're dismissed-]</b><br>
<br>
David Allen spoke aloud. "Cadre - you are dismissed. Cadet Reynolds &ndash; Get in
touch with Cadet Field. She'll go over the details of the VR session with you.
Cadet Blum-Deckler &ndash; a moment, please?"<br>
<br>
The other cadets left &ndash; Katherine and Susanna giggling as they kept throwing
glances back at David Allen, who shook his head as they left - but only going
as far as the lounge, where they sat and watched Tiffany and David Allen
without even trying to hide it. "I spoke to Morgendorffer about ten minutes
ago," he said without preamble. "They've got some things going on back at
Legion Tower, and I thought that you might want to go back and lend your
friends in the Legion a hand."<br>
<br>
"When... do... we... go...?"<br>
<br>
"Cadet Reynolds will be here in a few minutes," was the reply. "People who
aren't used to teleporting with me... well, it's not pleasant. We'll wait for her
to take you along. It's just as fast." <br>
<br>
They both stood silently, not looking at each other, until David Allen turned
to her. "Look, Tiffany &ndash; it's been five months since the whole VR thing," he
blurted out. "I've said that I'm sorry constantly, you've got the letter of
apology I wrote-"<br>
<br>
<i>Framed,</i> she thought very loudly, not even bothering to look at him. <br>
<br>
"Isn't it time that we made peace?"<br>
<br>
David didn't flinch as Tiffany looked him directly in the eye. <br>
<br>
"I'm... going... to... get... you... <u>back</u>," she said, her voice almost a hiss.<br>
<br>
The Deputy Cadet Commander of Corps took a deep breath, held it several seconds
and then, spoke up. "Look &ndash; you got to see me wearing a compliance band for
weeks on end. You got to see me walking around in constant pain. Isn't that
enough?"<br>
<br>
Tiffany didn't flinch as she held his gaze. "Nooooo..."<br>
<br>
David Allen nodded. "Tiffany, we're both on the same side. From what we've
discovered, <i>The Alliance</i> and the <i>Legion</i> are both parts of the
same plan &ndash; shouldn't we be working together, learning to deal with what's out
there instead of trying to 'get back' at one another?"<br>
<br>
The Legionnaire gave him a look that passed contempt by a wide margin. "I... <u>owe</u>...
youuuuu."<br>
<br>
Over in the lounge, Zachary chuckled sadly and Kaliq shook his head in
disbelief; the sound of footsteps caused Tiffany to look around and see at
least forty young cadets &ndash; all telepaths, it looked like &ndash; moving quickly for
the exits. "Then let me put it a different way,&quot; David Allen said, his
voice becoming cold. &quot;I'm not about to spend my last year at the Academy
living in fear, or dodging shadows. I'm not going to get into a pissing contest
with the Legionnaires because you have anger-control issues, and I'm not about
to tank my military career because you don't have any idea about the meaning of
the phrase 'let it go.'"<br>
<br>
Tiffany actually felt a sharp twinge of fear as he looked her directly in the
eye. "I'm putting you on notice. You screw with me - or anyone else because
you've suddenly developed a grudge that you don't have the common sense to
'walk it off', or just get even and let things go &ndash; and I'll have you brought
up on charges. I'll go to the Disciplinary Board and have them table a full
cadet tribunal &ndash; or if you really screw it up, I'll speak to the Commandant and
ask to bring you before a Board of Review for possible violations of the <i>Bowman
Acts</i>."<br>
<br>
The Legionnaire let her response out as a laugh. "So?"<br>
<br>
"So &ndash; that means you'll be tossed out of here &ndash; if you're lucky," David Allen
continued. "That means that you're not considered a government asset. What that
means, Miss Blum-Deckler, is that if you continue on with the attitude of not
letting go, you'll still come after me &ndash; and when you do..."<br>
<br>
David Allen's pupils seemed to ignite with electric-blue fire as he stood
before her as if he were guarding the Gates of Heaven themselves. &quot;When
the day comes that you decide to pull pin and throw on me, <u>Legionnaire</u>,
you'd best be prepared to make a choice; walk away and <i><u>set</u></i> an
example - or step up, and <i><u>become</u></i> one. <u>It's entirely up to you</u>.&quot;<br>
<br>
In the lounge, Eileen &ndash; who had been listening in on their conversation with
her super-hearing &ndash; rose to her feet and started over, but was stopped by
Zachary and Kaliq.<br>
<br>
David Allen glanced over to Tiffany's cadre, locking eyes with Eileen, and then,
looked back to the Legionnaire. "You have people who like you for what you are.
You've got <u>friends</u>. Don't make them sad."<br>
<br>
<b>#David Allen.#<br>
<br>
[I'm just getting my point across, Amorette.]<br>
<br>
#And scaring almost all of the sprouts on campus. I'm good at this kind of
intimidation but when you try it, people for miles around think the place is
about to become Ground Zero.#</b><br>
<br>
Tiffany saw Tainn Reynolds (the sultry Native American cadet that had been
Stacy Rowe's roommate) &ndash; and a slender French-Canadian beauty in the uniform of
the <i>Phantom Eagles</i> - as they came into the foyer. <b>#If it's too much
trouble for you to give her a lift to Maryland, I can drop her off. Of course,
that means that you probably won't get to see Julia until that Halloween
costume ball they're having-#</b><br>
<br>
David Allen's eyes narrowed. <b>[You know, I haven't talked to Blake yet about
not being scared of you, and asking you out because you're a <u>spinner</u>
from Quebec-]</b><br>
<br>
Amorette Molyneux walked up to David Allen, ignoring Tiffany as she focused on
her fellow Cadet First Class. <b>#Anyone else would be angry about that word,
David Allen. You know that I like it.#</b><br>
<br>
The two cadets stared at one another, neither backing down; finally, David
Allen smiled. <b>[Yes, you do.]<br>
<br>
Amorette ran her eyes over her fellow telepath in a suggestive manner, knowing
how much her doing that annoyed him. #Anyway, take her home &ndash; well, play
pathfinder, and tell him that I do like <i>poutine</i>. I don't care if it's a
stereotype, I like it &ndash; and that I can take him anywhere he wants for a first
date. The South Pacific has some nice islands, and the Mediterranean's always
good &ndash; has he ever been to Corsica? Sailing the Aegean's is so much fun-!#<br>
<br>
*If you're looking for a good date, the Highlands are very nice &ndash; and there are
beautiful forests all over the Isles. Besides, why would you want to date the
walking zoo-*<br>
<br>
#Call me when you turn eighteen in April, Zachary. I do not date <i>little boys</i>.#<br>
<br>
[I'm out of here.]</b><br>
<br>
David Allen disappeared in a flash of light as Amorette looked up to Tiffany.
"You know, there are better ways of getting even with a man, especially if you
feel that he has wounded you," the tall French-Canadian said (at five-nine, she
almost towered over Tiffany) as she gave the Asian girl a once-over with a
smile. "If you ever choose to get <u>real</u> payback &ndash; the kind that will not
get you in trouble, but will strike the young man <u>exactly</u> where he lives
&ndash; <i><u>call me</u>."</i><br>
<br>
Every guy in the area watched, slightly punch-drunk, as the uncomfortably
lovely telepath walked slowly out of the foyer, absolutely aware that every eye
in the place was on her. <br>
<br>
<i>She is so much like Quinn that it's not funny,</i> Tiffany thought. <i>I bet
Sandi would hate her &ndash; Oh! I should take Sandi a little present-</i><br>
<br>
Tiffany felt something smooth and cool pressed into her hands, and she looked
down to see Kaliq standing there. "She's your friend &ndash; I think that she'll like
this," he said. "We'll see you when you return." <br>
<br>
Tainn's cell phone rang as Tiffany gazed at the beautiful crystal form of a
cheetah; the figurine was incredibly lifelike, with the animal crouched as is
prepared to spring after its unseen prey, perfect in every detail-<br>
<br>
"Thank... you."<br>
<br>
"Hurry back," Eileen said, as Tainn tapped Tiffany on the shoulder and then
grasped her upper arm. "If you need us &ndash; call, okay?"<br>
<br>
Tiffany smiled as she looked at her friends. "I'll... be... back..."<br>
<br>
Tainn and Tiffany disappeared into thin air, and Zachary looked at the other
members of the cadre. "Told you before," he said with a smile. "Our resident
bird of prey's developing a sense of humor."<br>
