<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Standing on Dega Street, Mack
Mackenzie turned away from his flame-red 1969 Corvette with curiosity on his
face as the two Lawndale P.D. officers approached him. "Is there a problem,
officers?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Whose car is that?" The
younger of the two officers &ndash; barely older than him, Mack noticed &ndash; had his
hand just barely touching his sidearm as he moved close to the Legionnaire,
approaching as if her were closing in on a lion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Mack felt the same cold lump
in his stomach form that he felt every time a police officer approached him
from out of the blue &ndash; <i>here we go again</i>, he thought. <i>Be cool, bro.
This guy's on pins and needles. Just do what they say.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"It's my car," Mack said, his
voice as calm as he could make it. "I got it less than a day ago. I'm Mack &ndash;
Michael Jordan Mackenzie. I'm with the Legion."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"The rich kids out at the
Tower?" The second officer, who appeared to be a bit older, moved away from his
partner to face Mack from a forty-five degree angle. "Not likely &ndash; they don't
have any black kids."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"I have my National Legion ID
in my wallet, along with my Chapter One ID and my CCHS ID," Mack said, keeping
his hands &ndash; which he only now realized were raised into the air &ndash; from moving
towards his pockets. <i>These guys are too jumpy. Don't give them a reason.</i>
"I'm first-string on the football team. Before Lawndale High blew up &ndash; I was
captain of the football team there."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Okay &ndash; put your hands on top
of the car, and spread your legs." The officers acted s if they hadn't heard a
word Mack had spoken. "Do it <u>slowly</u>."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Mack didn't resist as the
younger officer searched him, took his wallet and passed it back to his
partner, and winced with pain as the officer snapped the cuffs on him before
walking him over to the curb.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"You're wearing an outfit like
that, shoes like that, and you expect us to believe that you're with the
Legion?" the younger officer said, towering over Mack with a self-satisfied
demeanor than Mack had seen before &ndash; <i>Thank God, not as much as my cousins in
New York have, </i>he thought, keeping his face impassive. <i>The stories they
tell...<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Damn &ndash; these are some <i>nice</i>
fakes..." the second officer said, looking at the shining-new Legion ID/access
card Mack had been issued less than three weeks earlier &ndash; it had been waiting
for him in his newly-assigned room in Legion Tower after the Legionnaires and
their counterparts in <i>The Alliance </i>has returned for pizza and tours of
the Tower. "Between these and this car &ndash; what the hell you selling, Mack
Daddy?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>It was the first time in
months that anyone had called him that. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The last time had been just
before Carter County High's first game against Polk High that Mack had played
in. Kevin Thompson, wearing a Penguin uniform (and lowering his opinion of the
boy even more) yelled out across the field <i>"<u>HEY! WHAT'S UP, MACK DADDY</u>?"</i>
as soon as he had seen Mack.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The way Mack had gone silent
had scared Mack's new teammates, and the absolute brutality with which he had
flattened his former teammate (Kevin was out cold for over ten minutes) had
ensured that NO ONE ever attempted to call him by that name at CCHS. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Don't call me that."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The combination of righteous
anger and absolute delight in the younger officer's voice immediately signaled
to Mack that he had just flipped a switch. <i>Oh, damn.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"What did you say &ndash; 'Mack
Daddy?' You telling <u>me</u> what to do, 'Mack Daddy?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>His hand lingered on the grip
of his holstered taser; had he been paying attention to his surroundings, he
would have noticed the faint but unmistakable rise in temperature that affected
the entire street.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>On the wall outside Dega
'Dreds and Do's (a combination barbershop/hair care salon that catered to the
small group of minorities in the cities throughout Carter and Lawndale
Counties), a giant outdoor thermometer instantly marked a seven-degree
increase. "I'm sorry," Mack said, glancing away from the officer; he knew, from
past experience, that eye contact would be seen as a sign of aggression or
defiance. "I didn't mean &ndash; a guy I knew always called me that."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"You see this badges we have
right here &ndash; 'Mack Daddy'?" Instead of rough and commanding, the officer's
voice was silken and uncomfortably pleasant &ndash; a sure sign that things were
about to get very unpleasant. "These badges say we can call you anything we
damn well please-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Is there a problem here,
officers?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>A familiar voice made Mack's
head jerk to the right; the two officers looked up to see Kyle Armalin, his ID
card and badge visible as he held the ID case in the air as he stood in the
street about twenty feet away from the scene. "Who the hell are you, mister?"
the older officer called out. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Colonel Armalin," he replied,
holding the ID out further. "I'm with the Department of Homeland Security.
Officers &ndash; I'm here to keep you from making even more very serious mistakes...
mistakes that I'm sure your superiors are going to speak to in grueling detail
about when you return to your precinct."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Don't move any further," the
older officer said, leaving his partner to guard Mack as he walked forward and
looked over the Marine's ID. "'Supervisory Agent - GLG-30'. What kind of rank
is that?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Why don't you call it in and
confirm that it's genuine?" Kyle said, the extraordinarily calm tone in his
voice setting off all sorts of alarm in the officers' heads &ndash; especially the
older, who was looking at both Kyle's and Mack's ID's... and a very bad feeling
began to grow in his stomach. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Yes," the Marine continued,
seeing the way the color began to drain from the man's face. "Today is going to
be a day that, I imagine, you will remember for the rest of your career. What's
left of it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"What &ndash; what's he talking
about?" The younger officer, his hand now grasping his taser but not drawing it
from its holster, kept looking from his partner to Kyle and back; his
expression, and the way his head moved, both would have been comical to Mack
(he thought, watching the officer) if these had been any other circumstances.
"What's he talking about, Troy?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Officer Troy Finneton turned
away, swallowing hard as he felt the eyes of the military man &ndash; <i>he has to be
ex-military, he looks just like special-ops those guys I saw when I served over
in Iraq and when they had that look, they were off to wipe places out</i> &ndash;
follow him back to the car. <i>We are so screwed. We are <u>so</u> screwed.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Officer James Gallister &ndash; the
younger officer, on the force for nineteen months (and just finishing his
probationary period only four weeks earlier) had just enough on the ball to
take his hand away from his weapons. "You can put your hands down, sir," he
spoke up, managing not to wince as Armalin's gaze fell upon him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Kyle complied, and Mack
watched as Gallister walked back to the LPD patrol car that Mack only then
noticed, parked two car lengths behind his Corvette.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Mack saw the younger cop go
absolutely pale as the other talked to him for a couple of minutes; pointing
back to Armalin several times, holding the ID in Gallister's face and pointing
out things on the ID as he did so. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>He watched as Gallister,
downcast and defeated, fell in behind Finneton as the latter walked a
death-march back to the Marine with partner in tow. "Here's your ID, Colonel
Armalin," he said, an unreadable look on his face as he handed Armalin's
credentials to him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Thank you, Officer," the
Marine said, his eyes fixed upon the younger policeman. "Now - could you please
take a moment, and explain why it appeared as if your partner was about to use
unnecessary force upon a restrained prisoner?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Finneton stepped forward,
about to protest &ndash; but any comments he was about to make died on his tongue as
Kyle looked at him for a moment before locking back on Gallister. "You were
saying, Officer Gallister?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"We &ndash; we observed the suspect
as he was approaching this car, and judging by his manner of dress, we were
curious if he were the actual owner of the vehicle," he said, speaking as if he
were reciting from a learned script. "According to standard procedure, we
secured the subject and were about to search the vehicle for contraband-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Did he identify himself as a
member of the Legion, Officer?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The two officers passed a look
before Gallister continued. "Yes, he did, but-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"You didn't believe him
because he said that he was a member of the Legion, and you said that he
couldn't be a member of the Legion because he's Black, and they don't have any
black members," Armalin said, his tone going arctic. "Because of his race and
his clothing, you disregarded his ID and his claims, instead choosing to leap
to the worst case scenario. You addressed him in a derogatory manner without
provocation. Granted, you had no way of knowing that he has a bad history with
that particular term, but instead of comporting yourselves in a professional
manner, you were about to abuse your authority. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Armalin's lethal gaze swiveled
to fall upon the ranking officer. "Tell me, Officer Finneton &ndash; and trust me
when I say <i><u>that I hold you responsible for this man's actions </u></i>-
had I come around that corner one minute later, how many times do you think you
would have been able to use your taser on Mister Mackenzie?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Before the young officer could
speak, Kyle pointed towards the sidewalk &ndash; and the two officers only then saw
that a traffic camera was pointed directly at them. 'The entire incident's on
videotape &ndash; the traffic cam, as well as the camera in your car."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The two officers were silent.
"Officers &ndash; here's what will happen now. To paraphrase a character from a show
I enjoyed very much, 'There will be no lawyers involved.'"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>He glanced down at Mack;
moments later, the young Legionnaire was on his feet, rubbing his wrists as
Finneton had helped him up, unlocked his handcuffs and returned his wallet. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>As Finneton stepped back, not
meeting the simmering look of anger in Mack's eyes, Kyle continued to speak.
"There will be no mass media coverage of this incident that will draw reporters
and camera trucks here to Lawndale the same way flies are drawn to manure.
There will be no very public, multi-million dollar civil lawsuits that would
ruin the both of you and cripple the financial health of the city &ndash; because we
would <u>undoubtedly</u> win &ndash; and there will be no ongoing discussion in the
media of racial discrimination that would forever mark the two of you as
racists, Mister Mackenzie as a victim, and give far more time to individuals on
both sides of the issue who don't deserve to be in front of a camera for a family
photograph, let alone discussions of an issue this important or this sensitive.
There will be no constant linkage of the Lawndale Police Department or the
Legion to racial problems, and Lawndale will not have protesters waving slogans
and chanting all over the area."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Armalin gave both of the
officers a very long, icy glare, and then held up his badge. "Two further
points, officers. One. Do you see this? <i><u>This</u></i> is a 'if I believe
that you're in any way assisting with terrorist activity, I can raid your
homes, imprison your families without trial, seize all of your assets,
interrogate you for months on end and <b><i><u>you'll never see the fucking
light of day again</u></i></b><i> unless I so choose</i>' badge. <u>Everyone</u>
has someone over them, officers &ndash; someone who can change their life in an
instant. I would remember that, if I were you."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Mack suddenly realized that he
was holding his breath; his gaze flickered over from Armalin to the two
officers, who were so pale that Mack thought Finneton was going to faint on the
spot. "Two," the Marine continued. "I believe you two owe Mister Mackenzie an
apology. Keys."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The two cops were still, and
Mack realized that Armalin was speaking to him. "Your keys, Mackenzie. I'll
drive."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Wordlessly handing him the
keys to the Corvette, Mack watched the Marine get into the sleek sports car,
and turned to the two officers &ndash; both now looking at him as if he were a cross
and they were vampires. "I apologize for the way my partner and I treated you
tonight, Mr. Mackenzie," Gallister said; to his credit, he looked Mack in the
eye as he spoke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Mack nodded. "I'm sorry,"
Finneton said, quickly turning away to the safety of his patrol car.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Let's go, Mackenzie,"
Armalin's voice rang out from inside the Corvette. "The show's over."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Mack opened the passenger-side
door and entered the car as the police vehicle sped away, a tad faster than
necessary. "I wanted to mention something to you before you get back to the
Tower," the Marine continued. "You handled yourself well &ndash; that slip-up of
yours was a natural response, don't think you did anything wrong &ndash; and you
didn't use your powers on them. You kept them, for all practical purposes,
firmly under control."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Mack was silent for well over
a minute. "I wasn't going to hurt them."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"I know that," was the
response. "If it means anything, you did far, far better than I did when I was
in a situation very much like this one. <b><i>Trust me on that.</i></b> Also, I
had advance notice that you wouldn't harm the officers &ndash; who probably deserved
a couple of scorch marks, all things considered."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Advance notice?" Mack's
eyebrows raised, even moreso as Armalin removed a familiar envelope from his
jacket and passed it over. "That's <u>twice</u>. You know, you and your fellow
Legionnaires really should take a trip to New York City and become reacquainted
with your former schoolmate. It appears that she would most likely be a
valuable asset to your organization."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The Marine sighed as several
images of Andrea Hecuba-Thorne flashed through Mack's surface memories. "Not
what I meant, Mackenzie. Glad to see that you're not a eunich, though."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Mack drew back as he realized
what had just happened. "Did you &ndash; you just &ndash; I thought only Daria-"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>'And now, you know something
else about me, Mackenzie." Armalin put the car into gear, and the Corvette
pulled away from the curb. "Let's get a burger. You can talk, or not. Either
one is all right."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The blocks went by. "It's
always going to be there, isn't it?" Mack said. "Racists. There's always going
to be around." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"You already know the answer
to that, Mackenzie," Armalin replied. "Racism, bigotry, discrimination,
prejudice &ndash; it's always been with us, and it always will be. It's the nature of
Man. Racism, sexism, homophobia, even political correctness &ndash; it crosses all
lines and all boundaries, and can be reversed very easily."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Man, that sounds like
something out of an Afterschool Special."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Armalin smiled. "Yeah &ndash; it
did, didn't it? Okay &ndash; now that we've got the 'deep thinking' out of the way...
they're always going to be out there. Those cops &ndash; you have to give them a
little leeway, because they do have a dangerous job, and there's no telling
whom they'll have to come up against in the blink of an eye. The problem with
them is that they were being racist; as soon as you identified yourself as a
Legionnaire &ndash; as long as they didn't have any reasonable suspicion that you
were doing anything wrong, and having a nice car doesn't qualify &ndash; they should
have simply questioned you if they felt something was amiss. They were in the
wrong from the beginning &ndash; but don't start thinking that all cops are that
way."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>He turned the Corvette through
the infamous 'seven-way' intersection, and looked back at Mack. "Don't believe
that most of them won't suspect that you aren't up to something if they simply
lay eyes on you, either. Things have been the way they are for far too long to
think otherwise."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>He stopped at a red light.
"It's like an eclipse. Most of the time, you live your life and not think about
that, because you're just living your life and the sun always shines &ndash; but every
now and then, the darkness shows up. It's right there &ndash; casting its shadow,
visible for everyone to see, even though the sun is still shining. Things have
gotten better, but it will always be there."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"How do you deal, Colonel?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"I'm honest with myself,
Mackenzie," he replied. "I recognize that it's out there &ndash; I recognize that
it's in <u>myself</u> &ndash; but that we can learn to cut as much out of ourselves
as we can, deal with the subject when it comes up and we have to, and train the
people coming up after us to see past things like gender and race. We get past
who's sleeping with who, and we do all of it by focusing on two things, and two
things only: 'Can they do the job?' and 'Is this a person I want to know in my
life?' All of the rest is crap you deal with later."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Mack looked down at the welt
coming up on his left wrist. "Is this what you were warning me about, back at
the Academy?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"In a way," was the reply.
"You've had to deal with this your entire life, being in Lawndale, and you
don't come across as if you have any problems there. In fact..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The Marine barely suppressed a
laugh. "It seems to me as if you could have been in Tom Sloane's shoes, as
things with a couple of your fellow Legionnaires go &ndash; but I've a feeling that
circumstances would have been a bit more...amenable... for all concerned."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The Legionnaire looked at him.
"What's that supposed to mean?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The light turned green, and he
Corvette pulled off. "Mackenzie &ndash; do you really think you're the first guy
who's messed around with several women that knew each other, and somehow
managed to keep all of them smiling and friendly with each other afterwards?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Armalin turned and smiled at
him. "That's quite a gift you have there. Even Morgendorffer's had her thoughts
drift towards you on occasion. I believe that happened the day you all went to
the Academy..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Mack leaned back, and Armalin
chuckled. "Would you like a beer with your burger, Mackenzie?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The Legionnaire turned to look
