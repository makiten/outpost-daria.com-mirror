<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i>Oh, and the social
conservatives did <u>howl</u>! In the days of the 2008 American Presidential
election campaign, almost every candidate tried to get face time (at least)
with the Legionnaires &ndash; but the Legion wisely didn't campaign for anyone.
However &ndash; people are people, and individual Legionnaires did make their
preferences known. <o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i>Even when the Legion tried
to officially remain unaffiliated, there were those who still tried to use them
&ndash; and their pasts &ndash; as political fodder, especially after the way the Legion
went public - and <u>still</u> refused to get involved with politics. The
attitude that several groups took was 'if you're not with us, you're against
us' &ndash; and considering how the Legion dominated the news (almost eclipsing the
historic campaign and election itself), they decided to try and strike back
hard.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i>To be honest, there were
many people who &ndash; to put it mildly &ndash; had a problem with the Legion. More to the
point, they had a problem with young people 'not having anyone to look after
them', 'someone to watch out for them' or 'to keep them from getting into
trouble'. These were individuals and groups that were quite vocally opposed to
a group of kids who were (at the time of joining, for the majority) too young
to even sign contracts without parental approval or purchase a drink, yet had
unmonitored access to 'bleeding-edge' technologies, effectively unlimited
finances, the means to travel anywhere on Earth at will (or even off-world,
which caused a minor furor when first done), and superhuman powers which made
them the equal of a small army.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:233.25pt'>These voices of dissent
almost exclusively took on the soft, politically correct mantle of
paternalistic concern with a solid core of authoritarian need to 'guide and
give advice' (laced thoroughly with the desire to have control of the Legion,
or at least a sound check on their activities). After the revelation of Chapter
Number One's status as not just the flagship chapter, but the <u>only</u>
Legion chapter (at that time) to feature members with metahuman powers, those
voices rose to a fever pitch &ndash; especially when Kyle Armalin stepped away from
Legion Advisor status. For many, <u>that</u> was the last straw.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The surprise was the
reaction of some of those who the naysayers decided to strike at for their
perceived 'pro-Legion stances'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&ndash; and
the way those accosted chose to respond. One response in particular was so
unexpected that news of it not only made global headlines, but also made the
Legion itself feel obligated to respond publicly...</p>

sounded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"The representatives from the
Society are here," the voice spoke up. "Shall I take them to the conference
room?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>A woman's voice responded.
"Yes &ndash; and make sure that they are comfortable."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Fifteen minutes later, the
woman known only as <i>Val</i> &ndash; dressed surprisingly business-like in a matching
herringbone jacket and skirt (one that went a respectable length below the
knees &ndash; these people are pains in the ass about that kind of thing! she growled
inwardly), walked into the main conference room in the New York headquarters of
<i><u>Val</u></i> magazine. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i>Oh, great,</i> she thought,
seeing who was waiting for her and not even flattered that the three men in the
group of five stood up as she entered the room. <i>The heads of the Prick
Cavalcade are here, for my viewing pleasure.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The older of the two men, a
fifty-something gentleman who radiated charm, sincerity and an aura of
friendliness &ndash; none of which touched his eyes, Val noted; she had dealings with
persons like him all too often in her professional lifetime &ndash; came around the
table to shake her hand. "Good afternoon, madam. Doctor <span
class=article-body-big>Aethan James Brantly. I'm the President of the </span>Human
Achievement and Traditions Society."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Val let a touch of uncertainty
appear in her eyes as she shook the man's hand (noting that he pronounced his
name as 'Ethan' &ndash; <i><u>definitely</u> of Mormon background,</i> she thought,
recalled her reading about him), and made certain that her handshake was overly
strong. <i>Contradicting symbols, to make me look uncertain and potentially
weak. Let's set the honey trap and make it sweet, so they'll play their hand
strong and try to overwhelm me with their perceived power and 'the fact that
they have the high ground'. </i>"Yes. Good afternoon - to all of you. I have to
say, I'm honored that an organization with representatives such as you, Senator
Washingtine, would bother to come and speak to someone like me. After all &ndash; I
only run a magazine for teens."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Washingtine was an incredibly
well dressed Black man in his early forties &ndash; he was a founding member of the
American Spiritual Society, and a big draw on the church-and-values
circuit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Val would have pegged him as a
'metrosexual', except that her 'gaydar' had never been wrong.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The Black senator cleared his
throat as he followed Doctor Brantly around the table. <i>Yeah. You're not
fooling anyone with your 'playah of the year' style or 'culture warrior'
attitude, Senator. I bet I know some of the guys <u>you've</u> bedded.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Which is exactly why the
Human Achievement and Traditions Society wanted to have this meeting," Anton
Washingtine spoke up, also to shake Val's hand. "Now, I'm not a member of the
Society &ndash; but I do share many of their beliefs, and I've only come along today
to extend my support of the Society's goals."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Val suppressed a groan.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Human Achievement and Traditions Society
&ndash; the "HATS" as they called themselves &ndash; would generally show up wearing
Stetsons at their press functions, pressing the name for all it was worth,
denouncing whatever was deemed worthy of denouncing.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>They felt like they were cowboys cleaning up the town, and Val
knew that there wasn't a camera that Washington wouldn't hurl himself in front
of; no podium that he wouldn't climb.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Of course, Senator," Val
agreed &ndash; <i>a little too quickly,</i> the two men thought, suppressing their
smiles as the exchanged a quick glance before sitting down. <i>This should be
easier than we thought.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i>The hell it will, you
pricks,</i> Val thought, her face revealing nothing as she took her seat. She
had seen <u>that</u> shared glance before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"I'm certain that you're aware
of what our organization does," Aethan said, opening his attach&eacute; case and
drawing several copies of <i>Val</i> magazine from within. "These are troubling
times for out country &ndash; as a proud citizen of New York City, you know this
better than anyone."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Val simply nodded, and Aethan
continued. "Our country faces danger from all corners, both great and small,
from forces and threats both foreign <u>and</u> domestic, madam. It is not
enough that they strike at the symbols of American pride and accomplishment,
but they also seek to strike us in ways we dare not think of but that we must &ndash;
because they strike at our future, at the most vulnerable and most precious of
all our resources &ndash; <i>our children</i>."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i>Time to bait the hook,</i>
Val thought. "Again &ndash; what does this have to do with me? I run a magazine
dedicated to the best of American teenagers &ndash; good, wholesome, decent girls
who'll grow up to be proper women and honorable American citizens!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The woman directly across the
conference table from Val &ndash; a tall, leggy, neutron-blonde in her late twenties
with huge aviator glasses and a snug, belted white sweater dress (an outfit
that displayed her impressive charms) - snorted off a loud, derisive laugh that
sounded more like a sneer. "That's a <i><u>laugh</u></i>."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Rene &ndash; please," Aethan said,
his disapproving tone playing false to Val's ears. "We came to speak as
friends."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Val almost broke out laughing
&ndash; and covered it up by taking a sip of the excellent coffee that one of her
nameless, faceless interns (until I need to remember &ndash; then it all comes back
like lightning, she thought) had placed on the table beside her. <i>You guys
came up here to shake me down for blood-money donations and the chance to start
pushing your 'purity for teens as WE see it' dogma through my magazine &ndash; and
'good cop, bad cop' is the best shtick you could come up with? It's no wonder that
the cable news shows roast both of your organizations on a weekly basis!<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i>Rene Raeder-Harde,</i> Val
thought, watching as several male employees took their time passing down the
hallway &ndash; and the glass wall of the conference room &ndash; so they could get a good
look at Rene's incredible legs... and the quite remarkable 'rest of her'. <i>You're
a bona-fide professional 'blonde Republican sex kitten', and hardcore attack
dog for the conservatives. Oh, yes &ndash; a 'True Believer in The Cause'. You'll be
the easiest to manipulate, Ms. 'Ride-Her-Hard' I know all about you, too.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Aethan continued.
"Unfortunately, Val &ndash; may I call you 'Val'? &ndash; Mrs. Raeder-Harde does have a
reason to be upset. Your magazine has always had many good points in advising
the young women of our society on being demure, feminine and conservative in
their dress &ndash; well, conservative for our society; your summer style issue for
last year promoted more modest swimwear and made a solid argument against
string bikinis and thongs, which we felt was a courageous step."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The leader of the Society
pushed several copies of Val across the table towards their namesake. "In the
past year, you've run several issues with articles and photo essays that we

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Rene drew a manila folder from
her own attach&eacute; case, and slid it across the table. "'Twenty Tips for the
Perfect Pre-Teen Summer Sleepover'," the woman said, an acid edge on her voice.
"Your article is practically a guide for young girls on how to engage in &ndash; <i>tawdry
behavior</i> &ndash; after the parents have gone to sleep."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Val looked at the woman as if

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Rene's voice held the low,
focused timbre of the true fanatic, reciting their manifesto, as she locked her
huge, sparkling blue eyes on Val and began to speak. "Your article all but
tells your readers how to engage in <i>fondling, petting behavior</i> and &ndash; <i>other
activities</i> &ndash; that could lead to <i>sexual</i> <i>experimentation</i> of a
sort that <i>invites demon-spirits in</i> and allows them to manifest, driving
these innocent young girls to the most immoral of activities... sexual contact
that could never be sanctified in a marriage bed &ndash; <i>the godless twisting of
two women, possessed by demon-spirits to seek sexual congress together."</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Val sat back in her chair. <i>If
it's true that you should never sleep with anyone crazier than you are, then <u>every

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Rene's upper lip twitched, and
Aethan's eyebrows rose as Val took on an air of being totally oblivious to
everything just said. "So, you don't like 'mani pettis?' Don't tell me that you
didn't like the double-devil's food and peanut butter cake balls &ndash; we had over
a million hits on our website for that recipe <u>and</u> the printable coupon

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Aethan held up his hand, and

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Your magazine has published
several &ndash; questionable items &ndash; but this issue is the reason why the Society
felt that we had no choice but to take action," he said, pushing a very
familiar issue across the table. "You see, there's this impression among our
supporters that Val Magazine is a purveyor in borderline pornography.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now I don't know where this impression
comes from, but it exists.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So the
question that we have &ndash; and the question that our supporters have &ndash; is that we

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Val picked the issue up &ndash; the
January 2007 issue; the only issue in the history of <i>Val</i> magazine to
have only a single subject featured on the cover &ndash; a photo of Daria Morgendorffer,
one of the three mounding members of the kids' organization known as <i>the
Legion</i> - and a tagline promising exclusive photos of the Legionnaires in
Alaska. <i>The single best selling issue in our history &ndash; we actually sold out,
copies are on 'eBay' for up to three hundred dollars, and that full-length
pull-out of Daria Morgendorffer was the <u>second</u> biggest download off the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>She idly flipped through
pages, seemingly unaware of Anton reaching out to calm Rene down.<i> The
download of Ruttheimer's photo with that blonde in the bikini was <u>number
seven</u>. Our servers crashed <u>four</u> times, the Legion's Grace Island
photo essay is the single most requested reprint in the magazine's history &ndash;
and that young Marine whose mother got the girl to sign the fold-out poster of
her got a firm <u>one million dollar</u> offer for the issue. So did his two
brothers.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Val let her thoughts drift
back to almost two years ago. The winner of the <i>'Win a Day With <u>Val</u>!'</i>
contest winner was Daria &ndash; but after a background check (after the <i>'Welcome
the 21<sup>st</sup> Century In With <u>Val</u>!'</i> debacle, they put all
winners through a background check before they were contacted <u>or</u>
announced to the public) which revealed that Daria's parents had arranged to
admit her to the Shady Acres facility for observation and the possibility of
schizophrenia, another winner was chosen. <i><u>Quickly</u>.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Of course &ndash; when the Legion
appeared on the scene, Daria's essay immediately came to mind, but that was
small potatoes... <i>filler</i>. Val wanted something more &ndash; and when she got
word that the Legionnaires were going to be heading up to Alaska for some sort
of survival training, she got that stringer Stewart up there <i>fast.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Val closed the issue, and
then, let her fingers run across the magazine cover. <i>I've always used
Stewart when I need the good stuff, and he always delivers &ndash; but never more
than he did on that trip. Once I saw that full-length shot of Daria in the
soaked clothing, it was <u>nothing</u> to offer him a million and a half for
the photos on the spot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Oh, they mocked
me in Vanity Fair for paying Michael Jackson money, but that shot was a

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>She realized that Aethan was

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>He spat out the words as if
they were poison; Val noticed that the Senator sat up a touch straighter at the
mention of Charles Ruttheimer's shirtless photos. "-With him half-dressed and
her in a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>- <i>string bikini</i> &ndash; as if
they were stripping each other naked and are about to start fornicating like <u>animals</u>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>He reached over the table, and
flung the magazine open to pull out the four-page foldout poster of the
full-length photo of Daria. "She might as well be &ndash; <i>naked</i>!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The room was silent for a full
minute as Aethan gathered himself; Val calmly folded the poster back into the
magazine and closed it. "The Society has begun an effort to reach to those
media outlets which we feel are providing our children with improper messages.
We feel that good, upstanding Americans with strong morals would be ready and
willing to help us in this effort, and to send out a proper message to our
youth. As a respected individual who is instrumental in shaping the minds and
beliefs of young women in our country, you obviously understand how important
it is to give them proper guidance."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Val raised an eyebrow. <i>Time

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Aethan went on. "Your magazine
is quite popular &ndash; but you must admit, popularity is a fleeting thing. As you
mention in several issues, 'The wrong step at the wrong time can exile you to
social Siberia'. Also, we feel that there's a sizeable audience of young women
whose needs are not being met by your publication &ndash; and many more who do read
it who could, perhaps, benefit from a, shall we say, <i>more defined focus</i>
on how they should carry themselves and what they should be involved with."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Rene had managed to rein
herself in; the fervor in her eyes had been damped down but she still spoke
with a noticeable conviction. "Your magazine needs to stop showcasing the many
liberal actors and personalities from the Left Coast who give a voice to the
more... distasteful... behaviors out there &ndash; and we understand that you're thinking
about doing a follow-up issue on the Legion."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Val looked the woman directly
in the eye, and coldly decided on the spot that before the day was out, she would
find the bottom-feeding bitch or bastard who was leaking company info to this
blonde harpy &ndash; and put on a good pair of gloves before bitch-slapping that
traitorous person all across the lobby and out the door. "We've been thinking
about it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>"Billions," Anton interjected;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Val cut into her diatribe.
"Pardon &ndash; but I was under the impression that the Legionnaires &ndash; the Lawndale

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>The revulsion that rose from
Aethan was almost physical in the way his face tightened at the mention of the
Legion's advisor. "Armalin," the man spoke, somehow managing to keep the venom
from his voice. "<u>Colonel</u> Kyleton Armalin. He's part of the problem."</p>

as if that particular one flips your switches on, but good, </i>Val thought;
she wanted to laugh out loud at the way Anton also shifted in his seat at the
mention of the Marine officer. <i>Flips more than a few switches on, eh,
Senator? Now I see why you're so pro-military.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'>Rene continued to speak.
"Surely, you can see that good, upstanding people need to make sure that these

outstanding students - <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i>grade-A model
