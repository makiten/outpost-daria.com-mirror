<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:233.25pt'><i><u>The Vetting Process</u><br>
<br>
<br>
A <u>Legion of Lawndale Heroes</u> 'Mini'<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Legion of Lawndale Heroes created by James Bowman</b></i><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
"Here we go again."<br>
<br>
Ben Rotaluger (dressed in the uniform of a PSI Cop &ndash; everybody in the L<i>egion
Tower</i> security staff was wearing one for the Halloween Costume Charity
Ball) glanced over to where Brenda Nemec was pointing. <br>
<br>
"Who's that the Colonel's scooping out?" the reed-thin Marine Reservist said,
his eyes all but popping out as he stared at the woman Colonel Kyle Armalin
talked with. "I like the 'evil Bond Girl' outfit. I like it a lot." <br>
<br>
<br>
Nemec (the head of the Legion Tower security force) also admired the red-purple
crocodile-skin bodysuit and matching facemask, complete with dual bullwhips
wrapped around her in the most seductive of ways, worn by Armalin's guest. <i>Nice,</i>
Brenda mused. <i>Pity he saw her <u>first</u>...</i><br>
<br>
"She looks like she's a Latina &ndash; so I'd say that she's the <u>new</u>
soon-to-be <i>ex</i>-Mrs. Armalin," Nemec said, smirking as he saw how Colonel
Kyle Armalin was standing very close to the woman in the skin-tight outfit, and
she wasn't backing away one bit. "Number three... remember that Gunny from 1st
Scout Sniper that we worked with in '90 and '91 &ndash; the one who went into naval
investigations? He was the same way &ndash; just change out 'Latina' with 'redhead'.
If he were around here and thirty or years younger, he'd be in Heaven!"<br>
<br>
Ben looked in Armalin's direction. "Well, looks like the Colonel's not doing
bad himself."<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Kyle smiled at the beautiful woman (who was the same height as he &ndash; putting her
at a solid six-foot-three) as he spoke. <br>
<br>
"The .40 Smith and Wesson," the woman said. "More accurate than the .45 and
less recoil, and more powerful than the 9 millimeter."<br>
<br>
The Marine chuckled. "Favorite color."<br>
<br>
The woman let her smile widen a touch more than before. "Powder-blue when I
want to be subtle, and white when I'm not."<br>
<br>
"Favorite breakfast." He asked.<br>
<br>
"Biscuits and gravy," she countered. <br>
<br>
Kyle allowed himself a smile. "Favorite vegetable."<br>
<br>
The woman brushed her long, shaggy hair back as she responded. "I'm torn
between red onions and potatoes."<br>
<br>
"Favorite quote from <i>The West Wing</i>?"<br>
<br>
Her large, dark eyes never left his. <i>"Then shut it down."</i><br>
<br>
Kyle allowed himself to look over the outfit she wore; the woman only smirked
as he did so. "Nice outfit," he said finally. "Who are you supposed to be?"<br>
<br>
"Didn't you ever read comics growing up?" the woman spoke, her every word a
lure to draw him in closer. "I'm <i>Tyrian Crocodile</i> &ndash; arch-enemy of the <i>Grey
Ghost</i>."<br>
<br>
"Either this Ghost character has some series issues," Kyle said, "Or you're a <i>very
bad girl."</i><br>
<br>
The woman ran her fingertips around the end of one of her bullwhip handles,
slow and deliberate, as she spoke; her eyes flickered upwards in mid-sentence.
"I can be &ndash; under the right circumstances. Lauriel de la Ribas."<br>
<br>
"Kyle Armalin," he answered. "Would you like to get something to eat? I kind of
know the kids who own the place &ndash; they won't mind if we raid the fridge."<br>
<br>
"Why don't I just fix you something?" she replied. "Oh, and don't think I'm going
all 'domestic' and 'nesty' on you; I do it for a living. <i>Cook.</i> I'm a
chef."<br>
<br>
Kyle looked her over. "I think that's a nice idea."<br>
<br>
Lauriel moved closer to Kyle. "We'll start with breakfast tomorrow."<br>
<br>
Without missing a beat, the Marine snapped his fingers; Nemec was at his side
almost immediately. "Sergeant &ndash; you're in charge of the detail tonight."<br>
<br>
The way Nemec kept a straight face and her voice free of any telling emotion as
she spoke was impressive. "Very good, sir. You are relieved."<br>
<br>
