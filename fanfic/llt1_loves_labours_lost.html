<p class=MsoNormal>Well, it's finally happened, the thing I have been dreading
from my first week here at Raft.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>James, my only friend here at school, asked me out on a date today, and
I don't know what to do about it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I've been hoping this question wouldn't come up, that he wouldn't act
like every other member of his hormone-crazed gender and leave our budding
friendship as just that, but it looks like he finally succumbed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now he's left me holding the bag,
forcing me to choose whether or not to risk the most promising thing I've found
yet at this place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After all, it's
not like my track record in male relationships is stellar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was Trent, first of all.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>God, that's embarrassing to think about now -- all that
obsession and self-doubt, over what was just a stupid schoolgirl crush.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I move to a new town, convinced that
life is going to go on just as miserably as before, and on my second day at
Moron High I meet my first real friend, the first person who's ever understood
me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And, to top it all off, she's
got an older brother, a man who meets almost every definition I have of the
word "cool" -- he's an outsider, a musician who doesn't bend to society's rules,
who pursues his own dreams without worrying if they're practical or even
achievable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And, I hate to admit
it, he wasn't incredibly bad-looking either.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I fall head-over-heels, so taken that I find it hard to even
verbalize in his presence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So
taken, in fact, that I don't even notice that his talent is less than
overwhelming, and that his laziness far outweighs his ambition.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Or, maybe, I just didn't want to
notice, but rather let just this one aspect of my life be ruled by romantic
dreams rather than hard reality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Of course, when those dreams collided with a part of reality that really
mattered to me -- my education -- they crumbled, and I could see what I had been
denying the whole time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any idea
of Trent and I being together was hopeless delusion.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It hurt, and the only reason that I was able to be around
him after that is because I knew that he had been oblivious the whole time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then there was Ted DeWitt-Clinton, my first dating
experience and my first actual potential boyfriend.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane was right, he was a kook, but not in any bad way.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He was intelligent and incredibly
well-read, two must-haves on my list of dating requirements, and his complete
lack of worldly corruption was a welcome respite from my own cynicism.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Looking back on it now, we really might
have had the beginnings of something worthwhile.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Then we went on our first "date", so to speak, and he blew
it all to hell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Again, looking
back on it, I might have overreacted; what he did wasn't a result of maliciousness,
just naivete, combined with his natural earnestness.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And I was pissed off not only at what he did, but who he was
doing it with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was a betrayal,
consorting with the enemy, and at that time there was no greater crime in my
world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And so I tossed my first
potential boyfriend to the wayside, leaving him to tread the paths of
popularity while I walked my lonely road with Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And, finally, there was Tom.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Oh, brother, what a disaster that was, from beginning to
end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I should have known from the
beginning that that wouldn't work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There were too many differences between us, too many aspects of his
personality and situation that I knew would press my buttons, not to mention
the extremely unfortunate manner in which we originally got together, but I
went ahead with it anyway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Why?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Was I just being
blind, sincerely believing that he and I could be a viable couple, despite the
fact that I loathed every aspect of his world except him?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Was I caught up in the moment, swept
away by the tide of events, and by Tom's own confidence in himself and our
relationship?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Or was it all just a
grand experiment, a relationship just to see if I could have a relationship, to
see if I could sustain such a fragile and precious state?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If that last one was the case, than I
would have to say that the experiment was a miserable failure, a series of
arguments and misunderstandings punctuated with a few brief moments of actual
happiness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that I haven't
spoken to Tom since our break-up, despite our promise to remain friends, speaks
volumes to that effect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Strike
three.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And now, there's James, ready to start the whole cycle over
again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I should have seen this
moment coming from the very first day we met, on the second day of Freshman
Chemistry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Actually, I'm pretty
certain he noticed me on the first day, when the professor, after reviewing the
syllabus, asked if there were any problems, and I responded "Just with the
universe in general".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I heard a
chuckle behind me, but since the professor proceeded on without so much as a
pause, I didn't give it a second thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then, the next day, James sat down next to me, with only a single empty
chair between us; I didn't notice, since I hadn't paid any attention to who had
been sitting in that desk the day before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But then he started making little sardonic remarks under his breath,
addressed to no one in particular but obviously pitched just so that I could
overhear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Against my will, he
actually pulled a slight smile out of me, and I started to respond in
kind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And so we passed the next
few days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After the first week of classes, he introduced himself.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"James McCarthy," he said, sticking out
his hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I took it warily, and
just as warily gave him my own name, worried even as I said it that I was
making a mistake.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Never before I
had sought out attention, especially male attention, at school, and the
stereotypical reputation of "college boys" only increased my fears.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Still, his friendliness seemed genuine,
free of ulterior motives, and I knew he wouldn't even be at this school if he
wasn't above-average in intelligence -- this may not be Bromwell, but none of
the usual Lawndale cretins would stand a chance here -- and the whole purpose of
college (or so I am told) is to expand your horizons.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>So I accepted his invitation to accompany him to lunch.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The absence of Jane in my life, for the
first time in three years, was another factor, no doubt.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was no longer accustomed to eating alone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so it began, first with lunch every day, then with
studying together on the weekends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We weren't inseparable, but we could be found together more often than
not, and he never acted as anything more than just a friend to me, which is
exactly what I wanted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Looking
back on it now, there might have been a few warning signs -- he never seemed
particularly comfortable when I mentioned Tom or Trent, for example -- but
nothing that couldn't be explained away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We made a few jokes about other people assuming we were dating, but they
were off-the-cuff and never given a second thought.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I was as happy with our friendship as someone like me could
reasonably be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then, after lunch today, he pulled the rug out from under
the whole thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Voice trembling,
knees almost knocking together, he asked me out, asking if I wanted to go have
dinner this weekend, and see a play afterwards.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I responded that he should be careful, that I might think he
was asking me out on a date with a request like that; his face red, he
stammered out that that was exactly what he was doing.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I, the writer, the girl who always has
a snappy comeback for everything, was speechless; at the time, it seemed so out
of the blue, so unlike anything I was looking for from him, that I couldn't
think of how to respond.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally,
still unsure of what to say, or even what I wanted, I told him I would think
about it, and beat a hasty retreat to the safety of my dormroom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Which is where I find myself now, two hours later and no
closer to an answer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My first
reaction is to flat-out refuse, to cut and run and avoid any future contact
with him, to forever despise him for taking a perfectly acceptable, simple
friendship and making something disturbingly complex out of it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Or was it ever really a friendship at
all?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Did he plan this from the
beginning, cleverly slipping under my radar until I trusted him enough to even
be considering it?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I should have
asked him that, but my brain was too shocked at the time to formulate even such
a basic suspicion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Am I that easy
of a dupe?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Or am I being too hard
on him, too black-and-white with the situation?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Asking out a girl you like is hardly a crime, and he knows
me well enough so that I can be sure he's not just out for a quick lay.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And a friendship with an element of
attraction is still a friendship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He's not Upchuck, after all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>(I think I would still be pretty safe if he was -- Upchuck couldn't even
drum up the courage to hold on to a fake boob; how could he ever bring himself
to grab a real one?)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And his
nervousness is reassuring -- it shows that he's as inexperienced in this whole
thing as I am, if not more so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He's hardly a smooth operator.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I suppose the really important question is: do I want to go
out with him?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Can I even afford to
go out with him?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I have
schoolwork, after all, and that has to come first.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>No boy is going to come between me and a diploma, between me
and my chosen profession.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't
have the time . . .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Oh, who am I kidding?!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Raft's a tough school, but if the average student here can do well while
still having a life outside of their work -- and I know most of them do -- than
I'm certain that I can.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The real
question is not whether or not my grades can survive a relationship, but
whether or not my heart can.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He's
an interesting person, and I enjoy being around him, but I have not had a
single relationship with a male that has not caused me considerable pain (well,
except maybe for my father, but that's only because I keep my expectations
low); why should I subject myself to that again?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I can handle losing a casual friendship, but I can't take
dating so casually; failure there hurts too much.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And it doesn't help that I see so much of my past
relationships in James -- there's Trent's dedication and passion, Ted's
earnestness, and Tom's intelligence and sense of humor.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All good qualities, but they can all
cause problems too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If there was
nothing at stake, I think I would go for it, but can I endure failure again?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I wish Jane were here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I could use her advice, her wit, her perspective on the whole
matter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I couldn't object when
her father asked her to travel with him, to paint the sunset or photograph
Celtic rock formations or something like that.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I suppose the news that his youngest child was going to be
off to college very soon, and a fine arts college at that, stirred some dormant
paternal feelings in the man.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Or
maybe he just needed an extra pair of arms to hold his photography
equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Either way, Jane's
incommunicado until the start of the next semester, and I'm left to face this
one on my own.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But if I'm honest with myself, I know what her advice would
be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane's always encouraged me to
pursue every possible romance that has come my way, even -- after the initial
storm had blown over -- with Tom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She's never been less than supportive on those rare occasions when I've
reached out beyond just the two of us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If she was here, she'd tell me to go for it, maybe offer to lend me her
lipstick.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Go for it and have fun,
and if it shatters and falls to the ground, take the next opportunity with just
as much enthusiasm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She certainly
did -- Evan, Tom, Nathan, even the bigheaded boy at Brittany's party -- none of
those setbacks ever discouraged her from trying again.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As long as she always had me to come
back to, she was never afraid to see where the newest romantic adventure would
take her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I'm not Jane, I'm
Daria, and Daria has never been one to set off on adventures.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Am I content with that?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Am I happy with that?</p>
