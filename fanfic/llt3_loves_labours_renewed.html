<p class=MsoNormal>I walked into Chemistry Tuesday morning with a mission.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My weekend had been torture; all I had
been able to think about was the hurt on James's face as he had turned and
walked away from me at the theater.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I had done little studying and even less sleeping; a guilty conscience
is a more effective stimulant than anything you can buy on a street
corner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If I was ever to sleep
well again, or at least for the rest of the semester while we shared the same
class, I had to do something to patch things up with James.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The problem was, I had no idea how to
start.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had little experience
with reconciliation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The only
serious fight Jane and I had ever had took a whole summer to clear up, and I
was not willing to wait that long again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I had even tried to get some motherly advice, but I was only ever able
to get as far as Marianne.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Left to
my own devices, the only thing I could think of to do was to get him to sit
down and talk with me, and hope that the two of us together could work this
out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His usual seat was empty, confirming my worst fears.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He wasn't planning on seeing me any
time soon, and so it was probably not going to be easy to get him to agree to
my proposal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Still, I couldn't
give up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Giving up on people had
for too long been a habit with me, as I was just now starting to fully realize,
and I was determined not to let that habit sabotage this effort.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The lecture room was large, and the
class was filling up; but with James's colorful hair, he wasn't too hard to
spot, seated about halfway up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
saw me, too, I'm sure, but to his credit he didn't move as I walked up to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He looked horrible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>His face was pale, which was only emphasized by the fiery brilliance of
his hair, which was quite disheveled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There were huge dark circles under his eyes; the eyes themselves were
tinged with red.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On the whole, he
looked about ten times worse than I felt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>His gaze on me, as I walked over beside his desk, was accusing,
unforgiving.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I wanted to sink into
the floor, but I stood my ground.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"James," I said simply, needing to get straight to the point
before he had a chance to leave or attack me, "I think we need to talk."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He turned and looked towards the front
of the classroom, his face now a total blank.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I really don't think that would be a very good idea," he
said in reply, his voice flat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"James, please," I reiterated, trying my best to sound
conciliatory and not whiny.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I
want to work this out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You have to
at least give me a chance to apologize, to explain."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, I don't," he replied, words clipped.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I hadn't anticipated that it would be
this hard; he'd never before been anything less than reasonable about anything.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Class is starting soon.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>You'd better get to your seat before it's taken."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was a blatant lie -- no one ever took
my seat -- but as an effective a dismissal as I had ever heard.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After his initial glare, he hadn't
looked my away the whole time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unfortunately, I did have to take a seat soon, and since
sitting near James would probably do more harm than good, I headed back down to
my wonted place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I barely noticed the lecture; fortunately, my note-taking
hand was on autopilot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I spent the
entire class time trying to conceive some notion of how I could get around
James's new-found spite, how I could slip pass those defenses and convince him
to give me another chance, give us another chance.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>After all, I was not the only one at fault here.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Never in my life have I wished that I
was Quinn, but I had to admit, this was one time I envied her abilities.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Would I have been willing to suffer
bouncy hair if it would convince James to listen to me?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ninety minutes crept by, each one stretched to an
eternity, and yet when the professor dismissed the class, it was still too soon
for me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Which is why it was so
much of a shock when I stood up and turned to leave, only to find James
standing there, waiting for me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Fine, we can talk over lunch," he said, then turned and
walked away without another word.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I took a few quick steps to get a pace behind him, then matched his
speed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I didn't feel quite
comfortable walking where we could make eye contact.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A few minutes later, we sat down at a table in the dining
hall, neither of us with any food on our trays, neither of us feeling any real
desire to eat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The air around us
was filled with voices, but it was as though we were surrounded by a bubble of
oppressive silence, neither of us sure how to break it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>James just sat there across from me,
trying to look in every direction but my own; it soon became obvious that he
wasn't going to end the silence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And it wasn't his responsibility, anyway; I had asked him here, I had
demanded that we talk, so it was my role to break the ice.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But now that the moment had come, I
felt a strong reluctance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I felt so
much weight on my words that I feared to utter one, afraid that the wrong
opening could condemn my effort before it had even started.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But as the silence stretched longer, I
knew that if I didn't say something soon, everything would come crashing down on
my head anyway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had to start
simple, so I started with what seemed to me to be the heart of the matter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm sorry . . . " I started, and then didn't know what else
to say.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Everything that followed
would depend on his reaction to those words.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>At first, there was no reaction, except that he began to
look straight at me instead of everywhere else.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>After a few seconds, he raised his eyebrows, but kept
silent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, he spoke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Sorry . . . sorry for what, exactly?"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His voice was hard, demanding.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was a shock to hear it like that;
until today, I had never heard him so much as raise his voice in annoyance, and
now it was hard with anger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At first, I thought he was mocking me; surely he knew what I
had to feel guilty about.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But then
I realized that he wanted more than a vague apology; he wanted specific
confession.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Get every little gory
detail out in the open.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And as
painful as the thought was, I realized that he was right.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We could only deal with our problem if
we were able to talk about it, no matter how much it hurt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'm sorry that I overreacted, sorry that I shut you
out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sorry I didn't give you a
chance to redeem yourself."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Those
were the easy admissions; I knew my faults here, and I had been berating myself
with them for days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was used to
saying the words by now, if only in my own head.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And I thought that I knew James well enough to know that
eventually I would be forgiven all these failings.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It was the last that truly scared me, since I didn't know
how he would react to it, whether he would be capable of forgiveness for
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I'm sorry that I can't be
what you want me to be."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I see," he replied, eyes now fixed on the table before us,
the hard edge of his voice partly eroded away by a hoarse swallow.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He rested his hands on the table, and
wrung them together so hard that their edges turned white, but he didn't say
anything more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>James had never
been taciturn, and his silence now was more punishing to me than any words
could have been.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, I tried
to prompt him to a response.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Do you accept my apology?" I prompted, thankful that I had
so much practice at keeping my voice rational and nearly monotone.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I didn't want to sound as desperate as
I was beginning to feel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I
promise you; I truly am very sorry for all the pain I've caused you."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, I have no doubt of that," he replied, still not looking
me in the eye.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I know you don't
lie, Daria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I believe you when you
say that you are sorry for all those things."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Now he looked up, and I could see that though his voice may
have calmed, the anger was still there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"I believe your apology, Daria, but I don't accept it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not yet.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I need to hear something else first."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This worried me.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was willing to apologize, willing to
accept what blame I felt was my due, but no more than that.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I would not be humiliated, I would not
take all the blame, and I would not be made to beg.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Of course, at any other time, I would not have thought James
capable of such a demand, but then again, I had never before seen him in such a
state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"What?" I asked, warily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I need to know why," he said, and to my surprise, he didn't
sound like an angry man making a demand, but like a hungry man asking for
bread.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"If you couldn't be what I
wanted you to be, if you aren't interested in me, then why did you go out with
me in the first place?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This was the question I had dreaded most.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The whole time this weekend when I was
anticipating this very conversation, I had hoped that, somehow, this one issue
would not come up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
ridiculous to think that, I knew as much, but I could think of no way to answer
this question honestly without hurting him, no matter how much time I spent
trying to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was briefly tempted
to lie, to try to think of some pleasant deception that could defuse this whole
matter, but that kind of dishonesty was not in me.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I could only offer the truth, and hope that it didn't
destroy the entire effort right then.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I needed to see if I could."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His reaction was about what I had feared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"What the hell does that mean?!" he exploded, catching the ears
of several of the surrounding diners, who turned to look briefly in our
direction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"What was I to you,
some experiment?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I know you can be
distant and reserved at times, but I never before thought you were cruel.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>God, Daria, I'm a person, my feelings
are real, not some laboratory for your amusement!"<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He jumped out of his seat, face aflame, and looked ready to
run out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"James, <i>please</i><span style='font-style:normal'>," I
said, my voice surprisingly loud, and my arm instantly shot out to take hold of
his.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>OK, apparently I wasn't above
a little begging after all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I
had no time at that moment to be disgusted with myself; that would have to wait
until later.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Please, sit down."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thankfully, the second time my voice
and manner were something approaching my norm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Why should I?" he asked, and I knew that this was no
rhetorical question.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He needed a
real answer, or I was going to lose him then and there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I did not mean it the way that you think," I said, and then
had to clarify, "at least not only the way that you think.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I wanted to like you in that way; I
wanted it to work out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I thought
that since we got along so well as friends, that if I tried, we could be more,
in time."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Several tense moments passed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"And I didn't give you that time, did I?" he said, the anger
draining from his voice, replaced by realization and despair.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His shoulders slumped, the tension left
his body, and he collapsed back into his chair.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"You weren't ready, and I pushed it, and I blew it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I even knew it then, but sometime over
the past few days I passed the blame from me to you.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I guess I couldn't handle having the heat on myself like
that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All the more credit to you;
you were willing to admit it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm
sorry, Daria."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I think that there is more than enough blame for both of us
to share," I said, relieved that he had given me the chance to explain myself,
and that he was willing to acknowledge his own role in this affair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Yeah, but you weren't the one who started the whole thing,"
he responded, then shook his head and laughed ruefully.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"And after all the effort I took to
make sure that everything went well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I even called my mother to ask her advice on what to do while on a
date."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You called your mother?" I asked, surprised.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Of course, there were times when I had
gone to my mother for help as well, but it was usually only when all other
avenues were closed to me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When I
could get in contact with her, that is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I wanted the female perspective," James said, rather
defensively.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I'd never actually
been on a date before -- my life in high school just didn't work out that way --
and I was scared.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I didn't want to
screw things up."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bitterly, he
added, "How ironic."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"What did she say?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, the usual things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Be polite and respectful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Show interest in her; don't just talk about yourself.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Treat her like a lady and act like a
gentleman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dress well.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All the expected things a mother tells
her son in those kinds of situations."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Dress well</i><span style='font-style:normal'>, I
thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><i>That's one

have known that it wasn't necessary.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Don't blame my mother, though," James continued.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"The handholding idea was mine
alone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I told you, I'd never been
on a date before; I was just doing what I thought one did on dates."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"So you didn't actually want to hold my hand?"<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I didn't know what to make of this news.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite everything, it seemed almost
insulting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Was I not worthy of
even the desire?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Oh, no," he said fervently.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"I definitely wanted to.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I can understand how you could have accepted just to see if
it <i>might</i><span style='font-style:normal'> work out, but I </span><i>knew</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> that I liked you.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>You were all I could think about, all I could talk
about.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My own parents got tired of
hearing about you."</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I had no idea."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I felt like such a fool.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I'm not exactly skilled in the ways of Eros, but if he was truly that
smitten with me, how could I have missed it?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I didn't intend for you to, not at first.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It took me forever to get up the
courage to ask you out; I was terrified you would say no.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You seemed so above it all, so far
above me, that I was afraid you would just laugh at me, or be insulted, if I
tried.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've seen your scorn; I
didn't want to be on the receiving end of it."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Insulted?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>No.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Scared out of my
wits?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That's a little closer to
the truth.</i><span style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>James had bared his soul to me, shown me his throat and had
trusted me not to tear it out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Which
I had, gruesomely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And yet, here
he was, doing it again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Whatever
his faults, I knew James was not a fool; he knew what he was doing.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I didn't feel worthy of such
trust.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The only way I could think
of to even everything out and start to make this better was to bare my soul to
him as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I could only hope
that I would survive it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"James, it's just as well that things didn't work out
between us," I started, leading in to the matter slowly, trying to give myself
time to adjust to the idea of what I was about to do.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I was going to breach the wall around my heart, which I had
allowed only Jane to see through.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But that was the problem, wasn't it?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>All my little self-defense mechanisms, designed to keep
people at bay, to keep me from being hurt, were the very things that had led me
into this pain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They were the
things that were hurting me, and those around me.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>If James was to be the final victim of my hedge of thorns, I
had to start tearing it down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No matter how much
blood I might draw from myself in doing so.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"I'm not ready to be in a relationship.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You've heard me talk about Trent and
Tom . . . "</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Are you still in love with one of them?" James said, almost
jumping at the thought.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No!" I responded, a little too emphatically, annoyed at
being interrupted and surprised at the idea.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"I don't think I ever was in love with either of them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I doubt I even know what that kind of
love is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The very idea is
frightening to me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But, you see,
that's part of the problem . . . "</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And, slowly, with much difficulty, I told him
everything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I told him about
growing up in a household where my little sister was always looked upon with
more approval than myself, because she was cute and my parents understood her
better than me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I told him about
the problems I had had in school when I was young, where the other children
bored me and there was no one I could talk to.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I told him how, unconsciously, I had withdrawn behind
self-righteous walls, looking upon the world with scorn, allowing no one near
who did not measure up to my standards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Walling myself off from disillusion, rejection, and pain.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And then I told him how this had
hampered every attempt I had made at both friendship and romance, how it took
only the smallest error on the part of the other person for me to back
away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>About how Jane had been the
only person to make it all the way past this wall, because she had been the
first person I had met who understood the way I felt about the world and all
the idiots I saw in it; and by the time I realized that even she could fall
short, I needed her -- loved her -- too much to let her go.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then I told him of Trent, Ted, and Tom,
how in each case they had failed me, and how in each case I had left them for
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I told him that the only
reason that Tom and I had been together long enough for our relationship to die
a natural death was because he was the only person I had met, besides Jane, who
was not willing to take my "no" for an answer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"It's the circle of my life, James," I concluded.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"You just happened to be unfortunate
enough to be caught up in the latest iteration.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And until I can learn to break this cycle, no relationship I
have is going to last.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I just wish
I knew how to do it."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I felt
utterly drained, on the brink of tears that I never thought I would shed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And yet, it was almost, very nearly, a
pleasant feeling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Like after the
few times I went running with Jane, when I would lie nearly immobile, every
muscle exerted to its fullest and then recovering, the dull ache that was
almost like pleasure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I can be persistent, too," James said desperately,
earnestly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"If that's what it
takes, I'll never stop chasing you . . . "</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, James," I said, touched and yet panicked by the
thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"In the end, Tom and I
weren't right for each other, but at the beginning, I did feel an
attraction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>More than I should
have, actually.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With you, that's
just not there."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>James closed his
eyes, and gently lowered his head to the table, face down.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His body quivered silently.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A passerby might have thought he was
laughing, but I knew better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
didn't know what I could do to help him, so I just sat there quietly, observing
the consequences of my indiscretions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, he raised his head, and though his cheeks were wet,
no more tears flowed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He swallowed
a few times, and then, in a croaking voice, asked, "So, what is there left for
us?"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I still want us to be friends," I said.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"We were before, we can be again."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But James shook his head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, we can't," he said, sinking my own heart, "not yet, not
for a long time, maybe not ever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
don't see the same thing when I look at you now.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't see a friend; I only see my own pain.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the future, possibly, that might not
be the case, but I can't imagine the future right now.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All that is real to me is the present,
and in this present, being around you puts me in agony."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"You hate me," I said, my voice sounding hollow to my own
ears.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I didn't think I had ever
been hated before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ignored.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mocked.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Criticized.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Misunderstood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All of
these, yes, but never hated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not even
by Jane at our lowest point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
felt like a speck.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"No, I don't hate you," he said, shaking his head sadly,
eyes downcast, and despite the dismal circumstances I felt my spirits rise a
little, spared an even worse fate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"That's the problem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If I
hated you, I wouldn't have had any qualms about rubbing your nose in my misery,
giving you the finger, and then walking off without a second thought.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If I hated you, than this wouldn't hurt
so much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I don't hate you; I
still like you, a lot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I may even
be feeling some small twinge of what could possibly one day become love for
you."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He raised his eyes to look
into mine, and it was like a physical blow.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"I can't allow myself to fall in love with you if you don't
return it; I can't live much more of my life the way I have lived the past few
days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And if we keep seeing each
other, even just as friends, I'm afraid that's exactly what will happen."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He stood up, and stepped back from the
table, his gaze never leaving my own.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"So I really think I should go now."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"James, wait . . . " I said, jumping up from my own seat,
but I had nothing more to say.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
didn't want to see him go, but what could I say to him to convince him to
remain?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There was nothing more
that I could honestly offer him than what I already had, and he had already
turned it down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So my voice
trailed off into a whisper of muttered sounds, my lungs and vocal cords taking
a few seconds to shut down after my brain had already ceased its message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We stood there silently.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It felt like an eternity, but it was probably just a few
seconds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But in those seconds, the
face of every person I had ever walked away from flashed through my mind.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Trent at Pizza King, after our failed
collaboration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ted at the video
arcade.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Tom.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And, in another way, Quinn, when she
was a baby, perpetually cute and stealing the attention and approval of my
parents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My parents themselves,
when they had started comparing me to Quinn, refusing to accept me for being
myself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had turned my back and
walked away from most of my world, rejecting them before they could further
reject and disappoint me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
the only way I had known to defend myself; erect a wall and let no one pass who
was not worthy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And now the same
thing was being done to me, not from spite or hatred, but from simple
self-preservation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Was this cosmic
justice, karmic revenge?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If so, it
felt magnified a thousand fold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Did I really deserve this retribution?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I'll really miss you, Daria," James said, and for a moment,
he smiled, and there was joy in it as well as sadness.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"You may not believe me, but I'll never
regret the time that we spent together, and I hope that one day we can pick up
where we left off."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I hope so," I responded, and even though I had doubts that
it would ever happen -- after all, doesn't everyone say things like that in
situations like this? And how many actually go through with it? -- I sincerely
believed it, nonetheless.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I'll be
waiting to be your friend again, when you're ready.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>You still have to meet Jane, after all."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He had often expressed a great deal of
interest in meeting my oft-mentioned but never-present best friend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>James chuckled, then suddenly became serious.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Hesitantly, he took a step towards me,
but then abruptly stopped and looked down at the floor between us.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He took a couple of deep breaths, then
asked simply, "May I?", and raised his hand slightly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a moment, I was confused, unsure of what I was being
asked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, somehow, maybe by
instinct alone, I knew what he wanted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I felt a surge of panic, not wanting to stir this pot again, but this
time, the rational part of my brain prevailed.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><i>I can give him this.</i><span style='font-style:normal'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I nodded once, and closed my eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A moment later, I felt his hand upon my cheek, and his lips
pressing lightly against mine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
kiss was brief, but I did not go unaffected by it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It did not stir me to passion, but it made me wish that it
had.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It made me wish that I could
give him what he wanted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But then
it was over, and the situation had not changed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I opened my eyes to see James had already backed away from
me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He was shaking, and his chest
rose and fell heavily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Goodbye, Daria," he said, his voice unsteady.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He turned and walked out of the dining
hall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He walked out of my life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I don't yet have all the answers, but at least now I know
the questions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's still a couple
of months before Jane joins me here in Boston, and until then, I'll have a lot
of solitary time to think over all the issues that have brought to my
attention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I think that's a good
thing; I think I need that solitude.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If the proper study of mankind is man, than the proper study of Daria is
Daria, and I'll spend the time that I have in that pursuit.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's time to break the pattern of a
lifetime, to finally opt out of the cycle.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>If I don't, I may eventually lose everyone, even Jane.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She'll understand that; she'll help
me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And maybe, eventually, James
will be there to lend a hand as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For now, I walk alone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But, hopefully, this is the last time.</p>

style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've been an avid Daria fan for years,
and an amateur writer for much longer, but this was my first attempt at
fanfic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Telling a story from
Daria's perspective has been one of the most difficult and rewarding challenges
I have ever undertaken as a writer, and it's given me new respect for the
writers of the series, who managed to bring her to such vivid life over the
course of five seasons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't
have any plans right now to write more stories, but if inspiration strikes I'll
be glad to go at it again; I don't know that I would keep the first-person
perspective, though.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Update:</b><span style='font-weight:normal'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I might be back to Daria fanfic earlier
than I originally thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've
got what I think is a pretty good plot concept for a crossover between Daria
and the American movie version of The Ring (meaning I have the beginning, the
end, and an idea of what goes on in the middle).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It's still in the "percolating in my head" stage, and I'll
probably wait until The Ring 2 comes out in March before I finalize the story
line, but I'm pretty excited about it.</span></p>
