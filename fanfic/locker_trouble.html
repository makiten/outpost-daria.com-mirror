locker trouble<br>
<br>
disclamer: i dont own daria or any of the afiliated characters so stop whining and work on the dvds mtv<br>
<br>
summary: our two cynics both have a secret little do they know they both share it. only short but it is my first give me a chance<br>
<br>
scene: lawndale high lots of lockers and lots of pink posters with valentines day messages on. daria trying to open locker<br>
<br>
(jane walks up absentminded)<br>
jane: hey<br>
daria: hey (opens locker two cards and a present falls out)<br>
jane: you to huh? whos the other one from cuz im sure one was from upchuck... i think every girl around got one from him.<br>
(daria opens the cards one was indeed from upchuck she immediately throws this away the other is a copy of "through the looking glass" ) dunno it doesnt say it seems like they realy knew me though iv wanted this for a while now. (daria gives her mona lisa smirk)<br>
<br>
jane(v/o):she liked it im so glad it took me ages to find it i just hope she doesnt figure out i snuck in here early to put the card and book in her locker.<br>
jane: you have a stalker too huh?<br>
<br>
daria: well did your stalkers decide there was a need to get anything for you?<br>
<br>
jane: yeh i got a card that read "to my sweet heart i only hope these may allow you to make more beautiful art in the future although none can compare to you" with no name a box of what seems to be high end artist tools and some noise cancelling earmuffs. <br>
looks confused) its weird well i geuss it cant be that hard to figure out? only reason someone would get me the earmuffs is if they knew trent had gotten himself a new amp for christmas. what i realy want to know though is how they got the set past the metal detectors <br>
<br>
daria(v/o):she liked them now i just need to figure out who gave me this book and hope i dont blush and give myself away.<br>
daria:well those metal detectors only worked for about a week then they got turned off too much drain and the bill nearly gave Miss Li a heart attack apparently. lets go we have an hour of our collective hell with Mr O'neill then we can leave.<br>
<br>
scene: Mr O'neills class typical be happy posters on wall.<br>
<br>
 (mr O'neill is giddyer than usual)<br>
M o'neill: well class seeing as today is the most wonderful of days, valentines day we will be disscussing love in the play "twelth night" a romantic and tear jerkingly beautiful play would anyone care to give me an example hmmmm (you know whats coming) yes you daria?<br>
<br>
daria:(sighs) well one kind is unrequited love which is where one person doesnt love the other for example "cesario" and "olivia". because "cesario" doesnt love "olivia" (deadpans) well the wedding night would have been quite the surprise if they had ever hit it off.<br>
<br>
jane (v/o) huh was she hinting something?<br>
kevin: wow this cesario guy sounds pretty cool. do you think he played football?<br>
daria:(deadpans) yes im sure he would have been a very welcomed and popular part of the team<br>
(jane, upchuck, jodie and mack all burst out laughing at this(and even Mr O'neill chuckles slightly)(theyre the only ones to pay any attention to the story)the rest of the class just wonders why the brains are laughing )<br>
<br>
kevin: cool!<br>
<br>
miss li: (off screen) would all staff come to the teachers lounge for the annual valentines day budget meeting all classes are dissmissed for the remainder of the day.<br>
<br>
cut to teachers lounge: party in pink and red with lots of hearts and wine all around.<br>
cut back to class<br>
mr O'neill: ah well class off you go we will pick this up later hurry along now i dont want to be late for the par...i mean budget meeting.<br>
<br>
(daria and jane get up and leave then head to their lockers take out their presents and go through the doors.)<br>
<br>

<br>
jane: so wanna come over watch sick sad world for a while? maybe i can test these bad boys out while im at it (motions hand towards the art set in her hands)<br>
daria: sure i cant go home till late today anyway the great evil overlords have paid me to stay out today<br>

<br>
jane: so what did you wanna say? she had the chilli at lunch shes gonna be a while<br>
trent:(looks around) well are you planning on asking daria out im pretty sure you like her (jane blushes)<br>
