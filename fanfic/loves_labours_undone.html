Labours Undone'</b></font><p></div>
<div>Rated: TV-PG for mild profanity.<p><b>Short summary:</b><p>The school
puts on a Shakespeare play, and Quinn and Sandi vie for the lead role.  Jane
paints scenery, and Daria gets involved despite her better
judgment.<p>Chronology: This story marks the fourth episode in my version of
Daria's senior year, falling between <i>Is It Fall Yet?</i> at the end of the
fourth season and the beginning of the fifth.  The individual stories have a
sequence, and events in one depend on the previous stories, but each story
stands alone and can be read individually.  The sequence is:<p>Temple of Gloom
- 1 - Daria and Jane explore a tomb under Lawndale High.  Very loosely connected
to the others, and my first Daria story. Contains some foreshadowing of Stacy's
rebellion.<p>Breaking Strain - 2 - Daria gets a job. Stacy stands up to Sandi. 
Jodie hangs out with Daria and Jane.  The first of (presently) three stories
focused on the Fashion Club.<p>Strange Bedfellows - 3 - A school trip to a ski
lodge results in farce, and a better understanding of Sandi. A Romantic
Comedy.<p>Love's Labours Undone - 4 - The school puts on a play.  Quinn and
Sandi compete. Daria gets involved, despite herself.<p>Daria (and associated
characters and locations) is copyright &copy; 1997-2001 MTV Networks<p>This

"Love's Labours Undone"':</b></p>
			<p><b>ACT I</b>
			<p><b>Establishing shot: Exterior.
Morgendorffer House - Sunday Night.</b><p><b>Interior. Living
Room.</b><p><b>Daria sits on the sectional sofa, facing the television (we
can't see the screen).  Helen, with an open briefcase before her, sits on the
section of the sofa to her right, reading some papers.</b><p><b>MALE
ANNOUNCER:</b> (from television, off screen) ...and the hawk strikes, lifting
another small rodent to its doom...<p><i>Daria picks up the remote, and hits a
button.</i><p><b>WOMANS VOICE:</b> (from television, off screen) ...up next:
shark attacks caught on camera, on Bloody Home Videos, after we return from
this...<p><i>She hits the button again.</i><p><b>YOUNG MANS VOICE:</b> (from
television, off screen) ...when the aliens returned us to my pickup, they gave
us a full tank of gas so we could...<p><i>She presses another button, and the
television is silent.  She continues to stare at it
intently.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> (monotone) There's nothing interesting on
tonight.<p>
<i>Helen looks at Daria with an expression of
concern.</i><p>
<b>HELEN:</b> Are you feeling okay, sweetie?<p>
<b>DARIA:</b>
I'm fine, Mom, I'm just bored.<p>
<b>HELEN:</b> You usually find these shows
interesting.  What's bothering you?<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> (quietly)
Nothing.<p>
<b>HELEN:</b> Well, I can't make you tell me, but don't expect me to
believe that.<p>
<i>Daria sighs, and looks over at her
mother.</i><p>
<b>DARIA:</b> It's Jane.  She wasn't in school Thursday or
Friday, and I haven't been able to reach anyone at her house.  I went over there
yesterday, but nobody was home.  I'm worried.<p>
<i>Helen seems surprised by
Daria's admission of concern.</i><p>
<b>HELEN:</b> That does sound odd, but
maybe she went somewhere with one of her parents.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Her mother's
in Central America; Penny found some interesting clay last month, and she went
down to see for herself.  She isn't due back until after Thanksgiving.  Her
father landed a contract to illustrate a coffee-table history book.  He's on a
walking tour somewhere in Central Europe, retracing Napoleon's route from Paris
to Moscow with his camera.<p><b>HELEN:</b> He's walking to Moscow?  In the
winter?<p><b>DARIA:</b> He's a sucker for accuracy.  If Napoleon did it, he
will too.  Besides, it's cheaper and he apparently didn't get a big
advance.<p><b>HELEN:</b> He's crazy.  Napoleon lost most of his army trying
that.<p><b>DARIA:</b> (brief smile) He's a Lane.  Saying he's crazy is
redundant.<p><b>HELEN:</b> That's not a nice thing to say about your friend's
family.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Jane would say the same thing, or she would if she
hadn't vanished into thin air.<p><b>HELEN:</b> Well, where could Trent
be?<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> Asleep?  I didn't break in and look to see if he was there.
I'm hoping the band got a sudden gig, and Jane went along to be road manager. 
But she's usually good about not missing school.<p>
<b>HELEN:</b> (surprised)
Jane?<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> When your parents aren't in the same country, and your
only guardian is an unemployed musician, you don't do anything to draw the
attention of social services.<p>
<i>The telephone rings.  Daria gets up, and
walks into the kitchen.  The view remains on Helen, who goes back to
reading.</i><p>
<b>DARIA:</b> (off screen) Lawndale mortuary: you plug 'em, we
plant 'em.<p>
<i>Helen winces.</i><p>
<b>DARIA:</b> (off screen) Jane?  Where
the hell have you been all weekend? (short pause)  You're kidding! How did you
get there?  Are you okay? (longer pause)  Yeah, I can wait for the details.  Are
they going to let you out?<p>
<i>Helen looks up, with
concern.</i><p>
<b>DARIA:</b> (off screen) Uh, huh.  I can bust you out.
(loudly, to Helen) Mom, I need to borrow the car!<p>
<i>Helen
frowns.</i><p><b>HELEN:</b> Daria, it's ten PM on a Sunday.  You have school
tomorrow.  What do you need the car for?  If Jane needs a lawyer, I can
recommend one.<p><b>DARIA:</b> (off screen) She doesn't need a lawyer; she
needs a ride home from the hospital. (quieter voice) No, I don't know why
she thinks you need a lawyer.  I stopped expecting my parents to make sense
years ago.<p><b>HELEN:</b> Tell her we'll be right there.<p><b>DARIA:</b> (off
screen) We?<p><b>Interior. Helen's SUV - Night.</b><p><b>Daria and Jane are
seated in the back, Helen is driving.  Jane has a bandage on her head, and a
pair of crutches stands next to her.</b><p>
<b>HELEN:</b> Jane, how did you
break your leg? Daria said you wouldn't tell her.<p>
<b>JANE:</b> That's because
it's so embarrassing.<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> You call that an excuse? 
Give!<p>
<b>JANE:</b> Well, Wednesday night the band was practicing, but they
couldn't agree on what to practice, so they decided to watch movies in the
living room instead.  They fell asleep, and left the TV on, and the test pattern
tones woke me up.  I don't remember the rest of it because of the concussion,
but Trent managed to reconstruct events later.<p>
<b>HELEN:</b> Concussion?  You
have a concussion?<p>
<b>JANE:</b> Had a concussion.  Now all I have is a
tendency to vomit if I turn quickly.<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> Remind me not to make any
sudden moves near you.<p>
<b>JANE:</b> Usually a good idea in any case.  Anyway,
apparently Max left a pair of his drumsticks on the stairs where he'd been
sitting.  I came down in the dark, stepped on them, and landed at the bottom of
the stairs after taking the scenic route down.  You wouldn't believe where I
have bruises.<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> (shudders) I don't think I want to
know.<p>
<b>HELEN:</b> Did it hurt?<p>
<b>JANE:</b> Not then. It did when I woke
up in the hospital later.  Between the concussion and the painkillers they had
me on, I wasn't really aware of my surroundings until yesterday.  Trent stayed
in the waiting room for two days, until I was coherent.  I don't think he slept
at all.<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> Where is Trent, anyway?<p><b>JANE:</b> He went home to
sleep yesterday evening.  He's probably still catching up on the sleep he
missed.<p>
<b>HELEN:</b> Jane, how are you going to get to school on
crutches?<p>
<b>JANE:</b> I'll get Trent to drive me.  This is his friend's
fault; he owes me.<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> Uh, huh.  And how will you explain to Ms. Li
that arriving at 2 PM is Trent's idea of punctuality?<p>
<b>JANE:</b> That would
be a problem, wouldn't it?<p>
<b>HELEN:</b> We have a guestroom.  You're welcome
to stay until your leg heals, or one of your parents returns.  Jake can drive
the two of you to school in the morning, and pick you up after work, if you can
find something to do until after five.<p>
<b>JANE:</b> Thanks, Mrs. M.  That
sounds like a good idea.  I can always paint.  Ms. Defoe lets me have free run
of the art room after school.<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> And I have a key to the computer
lab, so I can do my homework or write.<p>
<b>HELEN:</b> How did you get a key? 
I thought Ms. Li was very concerned about security, and she doesn't exactly like
you.<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> Yeah, but she's also cheap, and Mr. O'Neill manages the
lab.  This was a bribe for helping him to set it up.<p>
<b>Interior.  Cafeteria
- Day.</b><p>
<b>Quinn, Stacy and Tiffany sit at a table, eating
lunch.</b><p>
<b>QUINN:</b> So, Joey says "No, the ice in his soda isn't
crushed, take mine" and then Jeffy threw his in Joey's face and they started
fighting.  (sighs)  Aren't they wonderful?<p>
<b>STACY:</b> (mischievous voice)
What, only two of them?  What happened to Jerome?<p>
<i>Quinn looks puzzled,
Tiffany looks faintly annoyed.</i><p>
<b>QUINN:</b> I don't know, I
haven't seen him recently.<p>
<b>TIFFANY:</b> Who's Jerome?  Do you mean
Jamie?<p>
<b>QUINN:</b> Yeah, him.<p><b>STACY:</b> (looking pointedly at
Tiffany) I think he's had something else on his mind lately, or someone
else.<p><b>QUINN:</b> Huh?<p><i>Sandi walks up and sits down with a
tray.</i><p><b>TIFFANY:</b> (quickly) Hi Sandi, where have you
been?<p><b>SANDI:</b> Talking to Mr. O'Neill.<p><i>The other three
grimace.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> (faux concern) Why, Sandi, is he upset about your
grade on the last paper we did?<p><b>SANDI:</b> (haughty) Why, no, Quinn, as it
happens I received a B+ on that paper thanks to Chuck's tutoring.<p><i>Quinn
looks like she just ate something unpleasant.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> (faux
concern) Is there something wrong with your salad?  Maybe you should have
checked with your guardian angel before you tried that dressing?<p><i>Quinn
glares at Sandi, without speaking.</i><p><b>STACY:</b> If it wasn't about the
paper, why were you talking to him?  He's weird.<p><b>SANDI:</b> (smug) He's
also producing the school play, in which I am going to star.<p><b>STACY:</b>
You are?  Don't you have to try out for that?<p><b>SANDI:</b> Of course, but he
needs a strong woman to play the lead, and who else is he going to
find?<p><i>Quinn looks briefly surprised, then a calculating look crosses her
face.</i><p><b>TIFFANY:</b> What play is it?<p><b>SANDI:</b> Something by
Shakespeare about an animal trainer.<p><b>STACY:</b> Huh?<p><b>QUINN:</b> It's
The Taming of the Shrew, and it's not about an animal trainer, it's about a guy
trying to get his two daughters married to rich merchants.  I'm trying out for
it also.<p><b>SANDI:</b> That's great, Quinn, you can be the younger daughter. 
He was wondering who he was going to find for that role.<p><b>QUINN:</b>
Actually, I was planning to audition for the role of Kate, the older daughter. 
She's a much more interesting character.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> How do you
know?<p><b>QUINN:</b> I saw the movie on late-night TV a few weeks ago, with
Elizabeth Taylor as Kate.<p><b>STACY:</b> But, isn't she like, really old?  Are
you going to have to wear lots of makeup? That could clog your
pores!<p><b>QUINN:</b> It's an old movie, she was younger
then.<p><b>SANDI:</b> (mildly annoyed) And Quinn doesn't have the role yet; I'm
auditioning for Kate also.<p><b>STACY:</b> Does he need other people?  Maybe we
could all be in it.<p><b>SANDI:</b> Yes, but other than the two sisters, the
women's roles are pretty small.  Most of the speaking roles are for
men.<p><b>STACY:</b> That's fine, I don't want to have to learn dialog anyway. 
So, who's auditioning for the men?  Is Chuck going to try out?<p><b>SANDI:</b>
No, Chuck likes to work the stage lights and stuff.  Mr. O'Neill doesn't know
how he's going to get enough guys who are interested to fill out the
play.<p><b>STACY:</b> We should get Quinn's fan club to do it, there's plenty
of them.<p><b>QUINN:</b> They aren't my fan club, and there's only three of
them, or two if Jeremiah doesn't show up.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> (irate) His name is
Jamie!  Not Jerome!  Not Jeremiah!  How can you be so dense?<p><i>Quinn is
taken aback by Tiffany's vehemence, and looks at her in
surprise.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> What does his name matter?  He's just the third
guy with a soda.  And why do you care so much, anyway?<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> (still
irate) 'cause he's my damn boyfriend, that's why!<p><i>Sandi and Quinn look at
Tiffany in shock, while Stacy smiles, and Tiffany appears relived to have told
the others.</i><p><b>STACY:</b> Which would explain why he's stopped chasing
Quinn since the school trip.  Just where were the two of you when the
electricity went out, anyway?<p><i>Tiffany smiles, but doesn't reply. 
Quinn is still looking stunned.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> So, you're like, dating
him?<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> That is what one does with a boyfriend,
Quinn.<p><i>Sandi smiles, not quite a pleasant smile.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> Yes,
Quinn, you'd know that if you had a real boyfriend, instead of just a fan club. 
Chuck is taking me to an Indian restaurant downtown this Friday.<p><i>Quinn
glares at Sandi, Sandi glares back, and Stacy looks nervously from one to the
other.</i><p><b>STACY:</b> Guys, will you quit it already!  Besides, we're
going to be late for class.  We barely have time to fix our makeup.<p><i>The
other three look up at the clock, and quickly rise and leave the
table.</i><p><b>Interior. Mr. O'Neill's English Class.</b><p><b>Mr. O'Neill
stands at the front of the room, behind him the chalkboard bears the names of
several of Shakespeare's plays, including "The Taming of the
Shrew".</b><p><i>The bell rings, and the students stand and hurry out of the
room.  Daria is seated at her desk, putting Jane's and her books into her
pack.</i><p><b>ONEILL:</b> Daria, could I speak to you for a
moment?<p><b>JANE:</b> (quietly, to Daria) What did you do
now?<p><b>DARIA:</b> (quietly, to Jane) I don't know.<p><i>Daria stands,
picking up her pack, and walks over to Mr. O'Neill.  Behind her, Jane is
standing up as well, only more slowly, fumbling with her
crutches.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> What do you want to talk about, Mr.
O'Neill?<p><b>ONEILL:</b> (dithering) Well, I don't know how to say
this...<p><b>DARIA:</b> Try English, it's what we're here for, after
all.<p><b>ONEILL:</b> (more assured) Yes.  Come right out and say it, with no
fuss.  The direct approach.  That's probably best.  You do have a way of getting
right to the heart of the matter.<p><i>He stops talking, and looks at Daria. 
She looks back.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> So...?<p><b>ONEILL:</b> So?  Oh, yes!  You
know that I'm producing the school play?<p><b>DARIA:</b> You announced it in
class.  I only look like I'm asleep.<p><b>ONEILL:</b> Yes, well, I was
wondering if you were going to audition for one of the roles.  I'm sure you'd do
very well.<p><i>Daria looks at him in complete disbelief.  Jane hobbles up,
overhearing the last.</i><p><b>JANE:</b> "Daria Morgendorffer, star of stage
and screen."  It does have a certain ring to it, doesn't it?<p><b>ONEILL:</b>
(enthused) Yes!<p><b>DARIA:</b> Whatever you two have been smoking, it's
probably illegal.<p><b>ONEILL:</b> (nervous) What?  If you smell smoke on my
clothes, it's only incense!  I use it to relax, that's all!<p><b>DARIA:</b>
We've been to your apartment.  We know that.  Relax.  I was joking.  As, I
presume, you were when you suggested I take up acting.<p><b>ONEILL:</b>
(relieved) Whew.  But I was serious.  Please?  I really need some good actors,
and I know you can read lines in public from your appearance at the
coffeehouse.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Reading my own work, and acting in someone else's
play, isn't exactly the same thing.  Besides, that's why the school has a
Drama Club.<p><b>ONEILL:</b> (distraught) All the girls in the Drama Club quit
when they heard we were going to put on The Taming of the
Shrew.<p><b>DARIA:</b> I don't blame them.  It's appallingly sexist, and not
one of the Bard's better works.  Why not do a different play?<p><b>ONEILL:</b>
I can't.  Ms. Li picked up the scripts and advertising posters cheap on an
online auction.<p><b>JANE:</b> Oh, why am I not surprised she's behind
this?<p><b>DARIA:</b> (turning to Jane) It is rather predictable.  (to O'Neill)
So, here's your chance for historical accuracy.  Put the play on the way
Shakespeare would have.<p><b>ONEILL:</b> I don't understand.<p><b>DARIA:</b>
Have the boys do the female roles in drag, just like they did in Shakespeare's
day, when women were prohibited from being actors.<p><b>ONEILL:</b> Oh!  But
there never were any boys in the Drama Club.<p><b>DARIA:</b> So, you're putting
on a play with no actors.  This should be good.  You better hope nobody shows up
to watch.<p><b>ONEILL:</b> Ms. Li sold over fifty tickets at the PTA meeting
last week.  She's going to kill me!  Please, Daria?  It will count towards your
grade!<p><b>DARIA:</b> I already have an A in your class, remember?  I don't
expect the quality of my work to go down between now and the end of the
year.<p><b>ONEILL:</b> Oh.  Yes.  Jane, what about you?<p><b>JANE:</b> Me? 
I'm an artist, not an actor.  Besides, I like my B average.  It's comforting not
to have any expectations to live up to.<p><b>DARIA:</b> So, what you need are
some students who need the grades, and don't know enough to be offended by the
subject matter.<p><b>ONEILL:</b> Daria, that's terribly cynical of you. 
Besides, Sandra Griffin is going to audition, and she said some of her friends
were interested too.<p><b>DARIA:</b> I rest my case.  C'mon Jane, we'll be late
to Science.<p><b>Exterior. School Lawn - Day.</b><p><i>Tiffany and Jamie are
walking on the sidewalk alongside the grassy area behind the school.  Other
students sit on the lawn, or mill about in the distance.</i><p><b>JAMIE:</b>
You want to sit down Tiff?<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Ugh, and get grass stains on my
legs?  No, thanks, lets just walk around.  I need the exercise after sitting all
morning anyway.<p><b>JAMIE:</b> Okay.  Hey, you want to catch a movie
tonight?<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Sure.  Seven o'clock show?<p><b>JAMIE:</b> Yeah. 
Pick you up at six-fifteen?<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> That should be fine.  You might
need to wait a few minutes if we haven't finished dinner.<p><b>JAMIE:</b> No
problem.<p><i>Tiffany takes Jamie's arm and leans against him as they
walk.</i><p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Jamie, have you heard about the play Mr. O'Neill is
putting on?<p><b>JAMIE:</b> Yeah, some Shakespeare thing, isn't
it?<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Uh, huh.  Quinn and Sandi are trying out for the lead,
and Stacy and I will probably be extras, but Mr. O'Neill needs more boys for the
male roles.<p><b>JAMIE:</b> Fat chance.  Who's he going to find to get up on
stage and make a fool of himself?  Everybody in those plays wears funny clothes
with ruffles, even the guys.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Well...   I was thinking you'd
look pretty good in a laced-up shirt.  They're really sexy.<p><i>Jamie stops
abruptly, and turns to face Tiffany.</i><p><b>JAMIE:</b> They
are?<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Well, sure.  It's just like the shirts pirates
wore.<p><i>Jamie thinks about this statement briefly, and seems to consider the
idea appealing.</i><p><b>JAMIE:</b> Are there pirates in this
play?<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> I don't think so; Quinn said it's about some merchants
trying to marry someone's daughters.<p><b>JAMIE:</b> Oh.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> But
the shirts are still the same.  Do you think you could get Joey and Jeffy to try
out too?  They could play the guys trying to marry Quinn.<p><b>JAMIE:</b> Hah! 
They'd go for that.  Especially after I tell them about the
shirts.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Great.  Thanks, Jamie.<p><i>She leans her head
against his shoulder, and Jamie hugs her while looking at her with an
affectionate grin.</i><p><b>Interior. Computer Lab.</b><p><b>The lab is an
ordinary classroom, with the desks replaced with tables.  About a dozen
computers sit on the tables.  Daria is seated at one in the back,
typing.</b><p><i>The door opens, and Jane hobbles in on her crutches.  Daria
stops typing and looks up.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> Hi, Jane, what brings you down
here?  Run out of canvases to deface?<p><b>JANE:</b> Ha!  I have a bigger
canvas than ever.  First we take Lawndale, then the world!<p><i>Daria cocks an
eyebrow at Jane.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> Have you been painting with the windows
closed again?<p><b>JANE:</b> (smirking) Nope.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Well, world
domination sounds like fun, but it would take too much effort, so I think I'll
stay here and write.  Call me when you conquer Rome, and I'll come visit; I
always wanted to see the colosseum, although it's probably not as interesting
without the lions.<p><b>JANE:</b> You're no fun.<p><b>DARIA:</b> And you're
not very observant if you're only realizing that now.<p><b>JANE:</b> Ms. Defoe
asked me to paint the scenery for the school play.  The whole town will see my
work!<p><b>DARIA:</b> Scenery?  Like, brick walls and fake trees?  What am I
missing?  This doesn't sound like art to me.<p><b>JANE:</b> Well, I wouldn't
hang it in a gallery, but I've been wanting to try my hand at some life-size
trompe-l'oeil, and I really like the idea of having the whole town see my work. 
I'd even get a credit in the program.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Well, good then, but
you're going to ride home with me in an hour.  Even news this exciting could
wait that long.  What are you not telling me?<p><b>JANE:</b> You know me too
well, dammit.  I need your help.<p><i>Daria looks annoyed.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b>
Jane, we've been through this before, with your hair.  Paint and I do not have a
good working relationship.<p><b>JANE:</b> No, I don't need help painting.  But
with this leg I can't move as fast as usual.  I need someone to help me spread
drop cloths, and stir paint and bring it to me when I'm up on a ladder, and
stuff, or I'll never finish in two weeks.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Ah, mindless labor. 
And you thought of me.  How flattering.<p><i>Jane looks
uncertain.</i><p><b>JANE:</b> Um, I didn't mean it like that.  But I need
someone I can trust with my paint.  Most of these idiots wouldn't realize that
it's important to stir it the right amount, or would hand me the wrong shade of
blue.  You may not be able to paint, but you've watched me enough to know what
matters.<p><i>A grin flicks across Daria's face.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> (pleased)
Flatterer.  Okay, I'll help.  But I'm not picking up a brush. 
Deal?<p><b>JANE:</b> Deal.<p><b>Interior. School Auditorium
Stage.</b><p><b>The stage is empty, except for a small table with a chair,
where Mr. O'Neill is sitting.  About a dozen students are seated in the front
row of the auditorium, including Mack and Jodie as well as Quinn, Sandy, Stacy
and Tiffany.  Other students, including Joey and Jeffy, are hanging out further
back in the auditorium, apparently watching the auditions.</b><p><i>The camera
follows Sandi and Quinn as they walk up onto the stage then pans and zooms to a
close-up of Mack and Jodie in the audience; Joey and Jeffy can be seen two rows
behind them.</i><p><b>ONEILL:</b> (off screen) Okay, Sandi, just read the lines
for Kate starting at the top of the page, and Quinn, you read
Bianca.<p><b>MACK:</b> (whispering to Jodie) Oh, this will be
painful.<p><b>JODIE:</b> (whispering) Mack!  Give them a
chance.<p><b>MACK:</b> (whispering) Sandi and Quinn?  The queen and princess of
the superficial?  I doubt they can pronounce half the words in the script, much
less understand them.<p><b>JODIE:</b> (whispering) There are words I don't know
in the play.  Shakespearian English isn't exactly what they teach in class.  Now
hush, I want to listen.<p><b>QUINN:</b> (off screen, as Bianca) Good sister,
wrong me not, nor wrong yourself, to make a bondmaid and a slave of me.  That I
disdain.  But for these other gauds - unbind my hands, I'll pull them off
myself, yea, all my raincoat...<p><i>Jodie snorts, and quickly covers her mouth
with her hand; Mack appears to be suppressing laughter as
well.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> (off screen) Damn!  I mean "raiment".  What the hell
is "raiment" anyway?<p><i>Jodie is biting her knuckles, and shaking with
suppressed laughter.</i><p><b>ONEILL:</b> (off screen) It's another word for
clothing, Quinn.  Don't worry about what the words mean.  Just say them.  Start
again with that line.<p><b>QUINN:</b> (off screen, as Bianca) I'll pull them
off myself, yea, all my RAIMENT, to my petticoat, or what you will command me
will I do, so well I know my duty to my elders.<p><i>Jodie seems to have
herself under control, and sits back up, watching intently.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b>
(off screen, as Kate) Of all thy suitors here I charge thee tell whom thou
lovest best.  See thou disassemble not.<p><i>Jodie snorts, and once again
covers her face with her hands.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> (off screen) That's
"dissemble".  Uh. (as Bianca) Believe me, sister, of all the men alive I never
yet beheld that special face which I could fancy more than any
other.<p><b>JOEY:</b> (from behind Jodie, plaintive) But what about my
face?<p><b>JEFFY:</b> (to Joey) Why should she care about your face?  It's
ugly.<p><i>Mack turns to the two behind them.</i><p><b>MACK:</b> (strong
whisper) Will you two SHUT UP!<p><b>Cut to:</b> a view of the stage, showing
O'Neill and the two girls.<p><i>Quinn and Sandi face each other, reading
intently from their scripts.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> (as Kate) Minion, the list. 
It's not Hortensio?<p><i>Quinn looks up from her script.</i><p><b>ONEILL:</b>
Uh, Sandi, that wasn't the line.  Look closer.<p><b>SANDI:</b> (as Kate,
slower) Minion, thou liest! Is't not Hortensio? (normal voice) What the hell
does that mean?<p><b>ONEILL:</b> (resigned voice) Never mind; Quinn, read the
next line.<p><b>QUINN:</b> (as Bianca) If you affect him, sister, here I swear
I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have him.<p><b>SANDI:</b> (as Kate)
Oh, then you fancy Rich more?  You will have Gremio to keep you
fair.<p><i>Quinn looks up from her script at Sandi.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> That
wasn't right.<p><i>Sandi looks up at Quinn, annoyed.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> Like
you're doing any better, miss raincoat.<p><b>ONEILL:</b> Girls!  Please, don't
argue.  But, uh, Sandi, Quinn's right.  Can you read the line
again?<p><b>SANDI:</b> Oh, very well. (as Kate, slower) Oh then, belike, you
fancy riches more: You will have Gremio to keep you fair.<p><b>QUINN:</b> (as
Bianca) Is it for him you do envy me so?  Nay then, you jest, and now I well
perceive you have but jested with me all this while.  I prithee, sister Kate,
untie my hands.<p><b>SANDI:</b> (as Kate) If that be jest, then all the rest
was so. (normal voice) It says "Strikes her".  Am I supposed to actually hit
Quinn?<p><i>She looks up at Quinn, who takes a step back.</i><p><b>ONEILL:</b>
Not now, we're just reading the lines.  That was, uh, very good, girls.  Quinn,
you did better at the long sections, so we'll make you Kate in the play; that
character has more lines.  Sandi, you did well except for a couple of mistakes,
so you can be Bianca.<p><i>Quinn smiles, and looks at Sandi, who glares back at
her, then seems to think of something, and turns to Mr.
O'Neill.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> Mr. O'Neill, how many lines does Kate
have?<p><b>ONEILL:</b> Oh, lots and lots.  She's talking in nearly every scene,
and some of them are quite complex and have to be presented properly, or it
changes the whole meaning.  I'm sorry you can't both have the role, it's quite a
challenge.<p><i>Sandi smiles, as Quinn looks suddenly
uncertain.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> Oh, no, that's fine.  I'm sure Quinn will prove
to us all just how good an actress she really is.  Won't you,
Quinn?<p><b>QUINN:</b> Uh, yeah, of course, Sandi. (laughs unconvincingly) I
love a challenge.<p><b>Cut to:</b> Mack and Jodie.<p><b>JODIE:</b>
(whispering, to Mack) Okay, I was wrong.  That was painful.<p><b>MACK:</b>
(whispering) Not half as painful as it's going to be for me playing Petruchio
opposite Quinn.  Oh, God, why did I let you talk me into
auditioning?<p><b>JODIE:</b> (whispering) Two words: college applications.  You
need some non-Jock extracurricular activities if you want to be considered well
rounded.<p>
<b>MACK:</b> (whispering) That only works if I'm not in jail for
murder by the end of the month.<p>
<i>Quinn walks up.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> Hey,
guys, what are you two whispering about, anyway?<p>
<i>Mack and Jodie sit bolt
upright in their seats, with guilty looks.</i><p>
<b>BOTH:</b>
Nothing!<p>
<b>JODIE:</b> Congratulations on getting the part, Quinn.  Kate has
the best dialog of any character in the play.  (she turns to Mack) Although
Petruchio is nearly as good.<p>
<b>QUINN:</b> (hesitant) Uh, yeah, thanks.  I
didn't realize how much dialog I had to learn.<p>
<b>JODIE:</b> Oh, it's not
that hard to learn dialog, you just need to learn it in chunks and have one
chunk remind you of the next, it's like learning a speech.<p>
<i>Quinn looks at
Jodie, who suddenly realizes what she's setting herself up for, and tries to
redirect Quinn's attention.</i><p>
<b>JODIE:</b> (quickly) Your sister's done
some public readings, I'm sure she could show you how to do it.<p>
<b>QUINN:</b>
(reluctant) Yeah, Daria's good with words.  I guess I could ask
her.<p>

Night.</b><p><b>The family, plus Jane, is seated around the table eating
dinner.  From the containers on the counter, it appears to be Chinese
take-out.</b><p><b>DARIA:</b> (to Jane) They must really like you; we
haven't had microwave lasagna yet this week.<p><b>HELEN:</b> Daria!  We
do not eat lasagna that often.<p><b>QUINN:</b> Mo-om!  We had it three times
last week, and twice the week before.  It's what you always make when you get
busy at work.<p><i>Helen is caught off-guard, and looks
uncertain.</i><p><b>HELEN:</b> Jake, say something!<p><b>JAKE:</b> I think
your lasagna is great, dear.<p><b>HELEN:</b> Ohhh!<p>
<b>QUINN:</b> Daria,
could you do me a favor?<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> No.<p><b>QUINN:</b> But I haven't
even said what I want yet.<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> Quinn, you live your life and I'll
live mine, and we'll both be much happier.<p>
<b>HELEN:</b> Daria, that's not a
very supportive attitude.<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> I was trying for "patronizing", not
"supportive".  Quinn's got lots of friends she can ask for favors, she doesn't
need to waste my time.<p><b>QUINN:</b> But I need someone
literate.<p><b>JANE:</b> Well, that rules out your friends.<p><i>Quinn and
Helen both glare at Jane.</i><p><b>JANE:</b> What?  It's true!  The lot of them
would have trouble with anything more complex than Green Eggs and
Ham.<p><b>DARIA:</b> I will not help you, Quinn I am; I will not eat green eggs
and ham.<p><b>QUINN:</b> See, that's why I need your help!<p><b>DARIA:</b> You
want me to recite children's stories?  That's an odd favor.<p><b>QUINN:</b> No,
I need your memory.<p><b>DARIA:</b> I'm using it, thanks.  And I don't think
it's removable.<p><b>QUINN:</b> (frustrated) Dammit, Daria, could you just be
serious for once in your damn life!<p><b>HELEN:</b> Quinn! 
Language!<p><i>Quinn looks slightly abashed.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> Sorry,
Mom.<p><b>HELEN:</b> Daria, you could at least hear her out before you say
no.<p><b>DARIA:</b> If it will shut her up, sure.  Go ahead Quinn, what does my
memory have to do with helping you?<p><b>QUINN:</b> I need to learn my lines
for the play.<p><i>Daria looks at Quinn, waiting for more.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b>
And?<p><b>QUINN:</b> And you have a very good memory for words.  I need you to
show me how to memorize all my dialog.  There's an awful lot of
it.<p><b>DARIA:</b> What part did you get?<p><b>QUINN:</b>
Kate.<p><b>DARIA:</b> (incredulous) Kate?  O'Neill cast you as Kate?  You're
doomed.<p><b>QUINN:</b> (downcast) I know.  (looks up at Daria) Please? 
Sandi's going to be insufferable if I screw up after beating her out for the
part.<p><b>DARIA:</b> What's in it for me?<p><b>QUINN:</b> Chores for a week?
(Daria just looks at her) Two?  Three?<p><b>DARIA:</b> One
month.<p><b>QUINN:</b> A month!<p><b>DARIA:</b> Or...<p><b>QUINN:</b>
(suspicious) Or?<p><b>DARIA:</b> Two weeks, plus you pay for me to take Tom to
Chez Pierre.<p><b>QUINN:</b> You're not supposed to take guys out, they're
supposed to take you out.  And isn't Tom rich?  It's not like he can't afford
it.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Quinn, if you ever dated a guy more than once, you'd know
that having them pay for everything gets old, fast.<p><i>Quinn throws her hands
up.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> Not you too!  What is this, a conspiracy?  If I wanted
a steady boyfriend, I'd have one.  I like dating someone different each time. 
It adds variety.<p><b>JANE:</b> This is really more than I need to
know.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Me too.  So, a month, or two weeks plus a meal, your
choice.<p><b>QUINN:</b> (resigned) A month.  I can't afford a meal at Chez
Pierre.<p><b>HELEN:</b> How about two weeks, and I'll cover the
meal.<p><b>QUINN and DARIA:</b> You would?<p><i>Helen
smiles.</i><p><b>HELEN:</b> Daria, I think you wanting to take Tom out for once
is a great idea.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Hmm.  Must be something wrong with it
then.<p><i>Helen looks hurt; Daria looks contrite.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> Joke,
Mom.  Yeah, I'll take that deal.<p><b>QUINN:</b> Great, so when can we
start?<p><b>DARIA:</b> Well, Tom and I were going to help Jane paint scenery
for the play after school tomorrow.  You come too, and we can work on your lines
while Jane spatters the walls.<p><b>JANE:</b> Those aren't spatters. Every drop
is planned.  Or, at least, inspired.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Right.  And if you believe
that, I've got some swampland for sale, cheap.<p><b>Interior.  School
Auditorium Stage.</b><p><b>The curtain is up and scenery flats constructed of
cardboard and light wood stand about, in no particular order.  Most are
unpainted; the ones that have been painted are in dark, gloomy, colors, and have
the appearance of stone walls.</b><p><i>Jane enters, on crutches, followed by
Daria and Tom carrying cans of paint, and Quinn trails the group, carrying a
daypack.</i><p><b>JANE:</b> Okay, paint goes over there (gestures) and I'm
going to be working on this wall (gestures to partially painted scenery wall),
so we need to put the drop cloth in front of it.<p><i>Tom and Daria set down
the paint, pick up some painters drop cloths, and spread them in front of the
wall.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> How's that?<p><b>JANE:</b> Looks good.  Tom, can you
roll that scaffolding over here?<p><b>TOM:</b> Sure.<p><i>Tom goes off screen,
and returns pulling a small platform about five feet high, set on small wheels,
with a steel frame and railing.</i><p>
<b>JANE:</b> Leave it over by the
doorway, I need to finish some trim first, then I'm going to need it.  Where'd
you put the can labeled "shadows"?<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> Right here, Jane, do you
want me to open it?<p>
<b>JANE:</b> Nah, you and Quinn go study, my hands work
fine; it's the leg that's broken.<p>
<i>Jane hobbles over and sets down the
crutches, then opens a paint can and begins to stir.  Daria and Quinn turn to
go, and Jane looks up.</i><p>
<b>JANE:</b> Tom, can you stay here?  I'll need a
hand with the scaffolding in a bit.<p>
<i>Tom looks at Daria, who
nods.</i><p>
<b>TOM:</b> Sure.  I brought a book; I'll be over here reading,
yell when you need a hand.  Or a leg.<p>
<i>Daria and Quinn exit, Tom sits on a
chair at the edge of the stage, and Jane hobbles over to the scenery and begins
to paint shadows on the already painted stones, adding a three-dimensional look
to the wall.</i><p>
<b>Interior. Classroom.</b><p>
<i>Quinn and Daria enter and
turn a couple of desks to face each other.  Quinn pulls out two copies of the
script on loose pages clipped together, and hands one to
Daria.</i><p>
<b>QUINN:</b> Daria, is it okay to leave them together?  Didn't
they have a big fight when they broke up?<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> How did you hear
about that?<p>
<b>QUINN:</b> Oh, Joey's older brother has a friend who dated
Tom's sister.<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> That's quite the intelligence network you
have.<p>
<b>QUINN:</b> Being popular is more work than you might think.  I have
to know what people at other schools are doing before anyone else here does. 
But you didn't answer my question.<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> They got along fine on the
school trip, and Tom can outrun Jane now so I'm not worried.<p><b>QUINN:</b> If
they're getting along, aren't you worried they'd get back together?<p><i>Daria
looks surprised, as if the idea hadn't crossed her mind before
now.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> Uh, no. I trust them both; they wouldn't do that to
me.<p><b>QUINN:</b> You and Tom did it to Jane.<p><b>DARIA:</b> That was
different.  Jane and Tom broke up.<p><b>QUINN:</b> I heard they broke up after
you told Jane at school that you kissed Tom.<p><i>Daria really looks worried
now.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> Quinn, I'm not going to worry about that.  I trust
them.  Now, do you want to learn these lines or not?<p><b>QUINN:</b> Not. 
(grins) But I'd better do it anyway, or I'm going to look pretty foolish on
stage next week.<p><b>DARIA:</b> You're going to look foolish
anyway.<p><b>QUINN:</b> Gee, thanks.<p><b>DARIA: </b>Hey, what are sisters
for?<p><b>QUINN:</b> (smiling) Target practice?<p><i>Daria smiles, and bends
over the script.</i><p><b>Fade out and back in.</b><p><b>Quinn and Daria are
both standing, holding scripts.  Daria looks at hers, while Quinn reads from
memory.</b><p><b>DARIA:</b> (as Petruchio) Now, by Saint George, I am too young
for you.<p><b>QUINN:</b> (as Kate) Yet you are withered.<p><b>DARIA:</b> (as
Petruchio) 'Tis with cares.<p><b>QUINN:</b> (as Kate) I care
not.<p><b>DARIA:</b> (as Petruchio) Nay, hear you, Kate.  In sooth you scape
not so.<p><b>QUINN:</b> (as Kate) I chafe you if I tarry.  Let me
go.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Very good, Quinn.  You didn't miss one word.<p><i>Quinn
smiles, a very tired smile.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> It's about time.  How much more
of this is there?<p><b>DARIA:</b> Lots.  Ready to change your name and move to
another country yet?<p><b>QUINN:</b> You wish.<p><i>A smile flits briefly
across Daria's face.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> Every day.<p><b>QUINN:</b> Daria,
what is this play about, anyway?  These two seem to hate each other, but by the
end they're all lovey-dovey, and the other daughter starts out meek, but then at
the end she's telling Lucentio where to get off.<p><b>DARIA:</b> It's about how
people sometimes act differently from their real natures.<p><b>QUINN:</b> That
part I understood, but why do they change?<p><b>DARIA:</b> I'm no Shakespeare
scholar, but you could say it's because love transforms people.  Or you could
say the Bard had a cynical streak even deeper than mine, and it's just about
women trying to trap men into marriage, and men treating women as property. 
It's either very sexist, or it's forcing people to confront their own
sexism.<p><b>QUINN:</b> But people don't really act like that.<p><b>DARIA:</b>
Look in the mirror.<p><b>QUINN:</b> What?<p><b>DARIA:</b> You act like an
airhead around your friends so you'll be popular.  Is that really any different?
And what about those three guys you've been leading on for the last two
years?<p><b>QUINN:</b> But that's not the same!  I told them the first week I
met them I wasn't going to go steady with any of them.<p><b>DARIA:</b> And they
keep hoping they can change your mind, while you exploit them to fetch food and
drinks like a pack of hunting dogs.  Quinn, that's no different than pretending
to be meek until someone marries you.  Either way you're basically saying that
the other person doesn't really matter to you, that what's important is
what you want, and that lying to them to get it is okay.  That's degrading, and
sexist.<p><b>QUINN:</b> I am not sexist!  That's something guys
do!<p><b>DARIA:</b> Sexism is treating someone as an object, not an individual,
because of their gender.  Guys may be better at doing that, but they don't have
an exclusive title. It's one of your least attractive features.<p><b>QUINN:</b>
Oh.<p><b>DARIA:</b> C'mon, let's go get something to drink, and then we can
start the next part.<p><i>The two set down their scripts, and walk out of the
room.</i><p><b>Interior. Stage.</b><p><b>Jane has painted shadows on all of
the stones along the lower part of the wall.</b><p><b>JANE:</b> Tom, I'm going
to change paints, then I'll need you to help me with the scaffold.<p><i>Tom
sets his book down and walks over, taking the paint can from
Jane.</i><p><b>TOM:</b> Here, let me take that.  Which can do you
need?<p><i>Tom goes over to the collection of paint cans on the
floor.</i><p><b>JANE:</b> The one labeled "stone", but I need to stir it
first.<p><b>TOM:</b> I know that, Jane, did you think I'd forgotten everything
you taught me about paint?<p><i>Jane looks thoughtful, as Tom opens the can,
and stirs it.</i><p><b>JANE:</b> (quietly) I don't know, you forgot about us
awfully easily.<p><i>Tom looks up from the paint.</i><p><b>TOM:</b> I didn't
forget about "us", Jane.  We just drifted apart.<p><i>He picks up the paint and
walks over.</i><p><b>TOM:</b> Here.<p><b>JANE:</b> Okay, put it on the
platform, and pull it over there (points to the doorway on the scenery), then
you'll need to help me up onto it. (she doesn't appear happy)<p><i>Tom moves
the platform into position, and sets down the paint can.  Then he turns to
Jane.</i><p><b>TOM:</b> Ready?<p><b>JANE:</b> (reluctantly) Guess so; pick me
up.<p><i>Tom picks up Jane, and carefully lifts her onto the platform, where
Jane rolls to a sitting position.</i><p><b>TOM:</b> There, that wasn't so bad,
was it?<p><b>JANE:</b> (serious) I'll survive.<p><b>TOM:</b> Do you really
hate me that much?  I may deserve it, but I didn't think you
did.<p><b>JANE:</b> I don't hate you; it's just that being held brings back
some memories I'd been trying to forget.<p><b>TOM: </b>Oh.<p><i>Jane picks up
her brush, but doesn't start to paint.  She's looking at the wall intently,
unmoving.</i><p><b>JANE:</b> I don't hate you, Tom, and I was as responsible
for our breakup as you were.  But you really did betray me by kissing Daria
before we broke up, and that hurt. It hurt alot.<p><i>Tom, with a sad look,
leans on the side of the platform.</i><p><b>TOM:</b> Yeah, I did.  And I know
that saying I'm sorry doesn't change anything, but I really am sorry I handled
it the way I did.  (looks up at Jane)  We were a couple for six months, and I
really enjoyed it.  I didn't mean to hurt you.<p><b>JANE:</b> But you did
anyway.<p><b>TOM:</b> I know.  Do you think we'll ever be able to be friends? 
You're still important to me, and as long as Daria and I are a couple, we're
going to keep meeting each other.  It would be easier if we didn't have to watch
our every word.<p><b>JANE:</b> We should try. I did enjoy spending time with
you.  You're a pretty decent person when you're not a jerk.<p><b>TOM:</b>
(slight smile) Thanks, I think.<p><b>JANE:</b> (serious) But, one thing: Daria
isn't as strong as me.  If you hurt her the way you hurt me, she isn't
going to bounce back in a couple of months.  If that happens, you'll answer to
me, and I promise you it won't be pleasant.<p><b>TOM:</b> (equally serious) I
promise; I have no intention of hurting Daria, and I think I've learned how not
to break up.  (pause) You realize, you were my first real girlfriend?  I'd dated
other women, but you were the first person with whom I had a relationship of any
real depth.  I didn't know how to end it when it was over.<p><b>JANE:</b>
Really?  You never told me.<p><b>TOM:</b> Well, it just sort of happened.  I
don't think I realized it myself until the end.  We packed a lot of good times
into those six months.<p><b>JANE:</b> (nostalgic) Yeah.  Remember the
webcam?<p><b>TOM: </b>(mock irate) How can I forget?  Playing air guitar to
millions.  I'm going to be traumatized for life by that.  I'll never be able to
play a guitar again!<p><b>JANE:</b> (laughing) You never could play
guitar.<p><b>TOM:</b> (laughing) And it's all your fault.<p><i>Daria and Quinn
enter.  Daria looks surprised.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> Well, I see I don't
need to have worried about bloodshed.<p><i>Tom and Jane stop laughing, and look
at Daria with vaguely guilty looks.</i><p><b>TOM:</b> We were just reminiscing
about last spring.  Remember the air guitar incident?<p><b>DARIA:</b> How could
I forget?  But I didn't think you found it funny.<p><b>TOM:</b> I didn't, then,
but in hindsight it was.<p><b>JANE:</b> Are you two done studying already? I'm
just getting started here.<p><b>QUINN:</b> It's been over an hour, Jane.  We
were going to go get some soda from the machines; do you want
anything?<p><b>JANE:</b> Sure, get me a cola.  If one of you will push me up to
the wall, I'll get started on the next part.<p><i>Daria and Tom push the
scaffolding up near the wall, and Jane stands up and begins to paint.  The other
three walk off.</i><p><b>Interior. Cafeteria - Day.</b><p><i>Quinn, Stacy,
Tiffany, and Sandi are eating lunch.  Sandi has a copy of the script open next
to her, and appears to be reading it in between bites of
salad.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> So we've spent every afternoon and evening last week
rehearsing dialog.  I still don't know all of it, but I'm over halfway done.  I
think my head is going to explode before Friday gets here.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b>
Eww!  Quinn, that's gross.<p><b>STACY:</b> Yeah.  Make sure you do it when
we're not around, huh?  I just bought this blouse.<p><b>QUINN:</b> Funny.  You
can laugh, you don't have any dialog to memorize.<p><b>STACY:</b> That's 'cause
I was smart enough not to try for a lead role like you two.<p><b>TIFFANY:</b>
So, how's your dialog coming, Sandi?<p><b>SANDI:</b> I don't know what Quinn's
complaining about, it's not that hard to learn lines.<p><b>QUINN:</b> Well,
Sandi, you have a lot fewer lines than I do, and if it's that easy, why are you
studying your dialog during lunch?<p><b>SANDI:</b> (superior tone) Because,
Quinn, I have a life outside of school, and I'm not going to waste my evening
studying if I can do it here.<p><b>QUINN:</b> Okay, okay.  But Daria's taught
me some tricks for memorizing stuff that really work.  I'd be happy to teach
them to you, if you'd like.<p><b>SANDI:</b> Thanks, Quinn, but I'm doing fine
on my own.<p><b>Exterior.  High Hills Park - Day.</b><p><b>The park appears
deserted, and the barren trees lend a desolate air.  Leaves blow along the path
in a light wind.</b><p><i>Sandi and Upchuck are walking through the park,
apparently on their way home from school.  Sandi has a pack slung over one
shoulder.  Both are wearing light jackets.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> Oh, Chuck, she's
so infuriating!  (imitates Quinn's voice) I'd be happy to teach you how to
memorize stuff, Sandi, 'cause you're too stupid to do it on your own like me. 
(returning to her own voice) That conceited little bitch!<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> I
know you don't like her, but she can't be that bad, can she?<p><i>Sandi
sighs.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> No.  She probably even meant it seriously, it's just
the way she said it that got to me.  And it's not that I dislike her.  I like
Quinn, but when we're together we're like that stuff you mix that
fizzes.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> Vinegar and baking soda.<p><b>SANDI:</b> Yeah, that.
Put us in the same room, and we rip each other up.  Anyway, she was saying that
her sister taught her some tricks for memorizing dialog.  You know anything like
that?<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> Not really.  I've never acted in a play or anything. 
The closest I've come is MC'ing for a dance, or a game, but you don't need to
memorize stuff for those, just write it down.<p><i>Sandi slumps,
disappointed.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> Oh.  Well, I'm not going to give her the
satisfaction of asking for her help.  Can you spend some time drilling me on my
dialog?  I know we were going to see a movie, but I haven't been able to
learn as much of it as I need to, and I really don't want to look like an idiot
Friday.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> Sure.  We can see the movie this weekend, after the
play.  If we spend the rest of the week working on your lines, you should learn
them in time.<p><b>SANDI:</b> Thanks, Chuck.  You're a
lifesaver.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> I could make something very suggestive out of that
remark.<p><i>Sandi pulls away with an outraged look.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b>
Chuck!<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> Grr.  Fiesty!<p><i>Sandi laughs.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b>
Tease.  Sometimes I still have trouble believing you've changed, (she leans
against him) but I'm really glad you have.<p><b>Interior.  Tom's Car -
Night.</b><p><i>Tom and Daria are sitting in the car, parked in front of the
Morgendorffer house.</i><p><b>TOM:</b> There you go, door-to-door
service.<p><b>DARIA:</b> That's what "give me a lift home" usually
means.<p><b>TOM:</b> Aww, and I wanted you to think it was something
special.<p><i>Daria responds in a more serious tone, but Tom appears not to
notice and continues in a lighthearted manner.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> Well, it
can't be that special, you gave Jane a lift to her house
yesterday.<p><b>TOM:</b> But that was so she could get some of her painting
supplies.  It's not the same thing as spending time with you.<p><b>DARIA:</b>
Are you sure?  You've been spending a lot of time helping her with the painting,
too.<p><i>Tom seems to realize she's not joking.</i><p><b>TOM:</b> Huh?  Of
course it's not the same, you're my girlfriend, even if you don't like
that word, and you asked me to spend time with her, so you could tutor Quinn. 
Remember?<p><b>DARIA:</b> Yeah, I know.<p><b>TOM:</b> Daria, are you accusing
me of something, and if so what?  And why?<p><i>Daria looks down,
scowling.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> No, I'm not accusing you of anything.  You just
seem to be awfully friendly with Jane all of a sudden, and I'm surprised.  I
keep expecting you two to do the "pistols at dawn" routine, and you
don't.<p><b>TOM:</b> Well, it's nice to know I'm not predictable, but it sounds
like you're jealous.<p><b>DARIA:</b> (with some heat) I am not
jealous!<p><i>Tom holds up his hands, placating.</i><p><b>TOM:</b> Okay, okay,
I retract the suggestion.  So, why are you bothered by us being friends again? 
It's not like we're getting all sentimental, we're just acting civilly to each
other.  We actually managed to do that a little on the school trip, and you
weren't bothered then.<p><i>Daria mumbles something indistinct, looking
down.</i><p><b>TOM:</b> What?<p><b>DARIA:</b> I said I was bothered, I just
didn't show it.  I don't know, maybe I am jealous.  That's pretty stupid, huh? 
I steal Jane's boyfriend, and then get jealous of her relationship with him. 
Damn.<p><b>TOM:</b> Whoa, there.  You didn't "steal Jane's boyfriend".  I
made my own decision.  It's not like you seduced me away from her.  That
relationship was over, we just hadn't admitted it.  And we don't have a
"relationship" now to be jealous of, we're just friends.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Are
you saying I'm not attractive enough to seduce you away from
Jane?<p><b>TOM:</b> Of course not!  That's not what I said at
all!<p><b>DARIA:</b> Well, it sure sounded like it to me!<p><i>Daria opens the
door and climbs out.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> I'll see you later!<p><b>TOM:</b>
Daria, wait!  Let's talk about this...<p><i>Daria slams the door and walks
away.</i><p><b>TOM:</b> ...don't leave it like this!  Damn.<p><i>Tom watches
her walk to the house, without looking back.  After the door closes, he puts the
car in gear and drives away.</i><p><b>Interlude II (a video montage with

			<p><b>ACT III</b><p><b>Interior. 
Morgendorffer Living Room - Night.</b><p><i>Daria and Quinn are sitting on the
sectional sofa, holding scripts.  Quinn looks tired, with her hair hanging
limply. Daria is reading her script intently, while Quinn rests the hand holding
hers on the sofa next to her.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> (tired) Oh, God, aren't we at
the end yet?<p><b>DARIA:</b> (distractedly) Almost there, just the closing
speech by Kate left.<p><i>Daria flips the page, and continues reading.  As she
reads, her face begins to take on an annoyed look.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> (quietly
angry) I should have known!<p><b>QUINN:</b> (tired, but interested) What?  Is
there something wrong with the script?<p><b>DARIA:</b> (irritated) Someone
rewrote the ending.  Probably Mr. O'Neill couldn't handle it.<p><b>QUINN:</b>
(more alert, interested) Why not, and what did he change?<p><b>DARIA:</b> In
Shakespeare's play, Kate gives a long speech explaining how she was wrong to
question her husband, in this travesty she's yammering about 'building a
partnership based on shared goals'.<p><b>QUINN:</b> But, Daria, why would you
like the original?  That's a terrible thing for her to be
saying.<p><b>DARIA:</b> That's the point.  If she's serious, then Petruchio has
broken her spirit with his mind games.  That forces the audience to think about
their own behavior.  It's not pleasant, but at least it's honest.  But there is
another way to present it, using the same words.  A good actress can show Kate
conforming to society's prejudices in the interest of harmony, while remaining
the independently-minded woman she's been all along.  The only change is that
now she's in love, and has a reason to play the game.  Pretending to be someone
other than you really are to get along in life is still a universal situation,
even today.<p><b>QUINN:</b> But you were accusing me of doing just that the
other day!<p><b>DARIA:</b> Quinn, just because people expect you to play games
like that to make them feel good isn't sufficient reason to do it.  Even the
'pleasant' version of the play still has an unpleasant message: society expects
conformity, and penalizes people who go their own way.  In case you hadn't
noticed, I'm no conformist, and I happen to think enough of you to believe you
could get along just fine if you didn't try to live that way
either.<p><b>QUINN:</b> Oh.<p><i>Quinn looks at her sister, who's still
scowling at the script.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> I think that's probably the nicest
thing you've ever said to me.<p><b>DARIA:</b> (smirks) Yeah, well there's no
witnesses, so I'll deny it if you ever tell anyone.<p><b>QUINN: </b>Who'd
believe me?  (smiles)  So, what do we do?<p><b>DARIA:</b> You'll have to do the
script the way it's written.  There's no way to get the other actors to learn
the real lines in time.  (looks at Quinn)  And, to be honest, you're not a very
good actress, so I don't think you could pull off a convincing independent yet
meek Kate.<p><b>QUINN:</b> Gee, thanks.  I see you're back to your usual
self.<p><b>DARIA:</b> (smiling) Yep.  Just a momentary lapse.<p><b>Interior. 
School Hallway.</b><p><i>Quinn, walking down the hallway, sees Upchuck at his
locker, and walks up to him.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> Uh, Up... I mean, Chuck, can I
talk to you?<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> Sure, Quinn, what's up?<p><b>QUINN:</b> Is
Sandi okay?  She hasn't really said much to me since the audition.  I'm really
having a hard time learning dialog, so I figure she must be too, but she won't
let me help her.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> She's doing okay, she's just mad that you
got the part she wanted.  She'll get over it eventually.  Why do you care,
anyway?  I thought you didn't like her.<p><b>QUINN:</b> (urgent) No!  Did she
say that?  (quieter) I like Sandi.  I guess I don't show it very well, but I do.
I hate it when we fight.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> Well, you wouldn't fight as much if
you weren't always trying to be better at everything than she is.  And, for that
matter, if she wasn't doing the same thing to you.  If you want to be friends,
you both need to work at it more.<p><b>QUINN:</b> Yeah, I suppose.  Anyway,
thanks for letting me know she's okay.<p><b>UPCHUCK:</b> Sure,
anytime.<p><b>Interior.  Pizza Place - Night.</b><p><i>Jodie and Daria are in
a booth, eating pizza by themselves.</i><p><b>JODIE:</b> So, where's Jane
tonight?<p><b>DARIA:</b> Painting madly, trying to finish up before the play
tomorrow night.<p><b>JODIE:</b> I thought you were helping her with the
painting?<p><b>DARIA:</b> I was, but there's only so much I can take of paint
fumes before I need a break.<p><b>JODIE:</b> I can see that.  So, when are the
three of us going to get together for another movie night?<p><b>DARIA:</b> I
dunno.  Jane and I haven't been talking much outside of painting.  Things are a
little strained right now.<p><b>JODIE:</b> Are you two fighting again?  What
about?<p><b>DARIA:</b> No, not us.  Tom and I had a fight, and I'm avoiding
Jane because of it.<p><b>JODIE:</b> Daria, that makes absolutely no
sense.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Yeah, I know.  But the fight was about Tom and Jane
being friends again, and I don't want to fight with Jane, so I've got to
straighten this mess out myself before I talk to her, or I'll probably say
something stupid.<p><b>JODIE:</b> You're jealous?  C'mon, Daria, Tom left Jane
for you.  How can you be jealous?<p><b>DARIA:</b> I know it doesn't make any
sense.  I'm just being insecure. I know Tom likes me.  I'm just afraid it's too
good to be true.<p><b>JODIE:</b> Yeah, I know that feeling.<p><b>DARIA:</b>
You?  But you and Mack have been together longer than I've known
you.<p><b>JODIE:</b> Uh, huh.  And he's the Captain of the football team, and
there's always some cute cheerleader batting her damn plucked eyebrows at him at
practice.  I know he loves me.  And I know he knows they just want him for the
status.  But emotions don't have anything to do with
knowledge.<p><b>DARIA:</b> So, how do you deal with it?<p><b>JODIE:</b> I tell
Mack how I feel, and he makes sure I know there's nothing going on.  We even get
a chuckle out of some of the dumber ones who just never learn.<p><b>DARIA:</b>
So, I should talk to Tom?<p><b>JODIE:</b> Yes, and Jane too.  They both need to
know you're worried.  They're your friends.  If there's really nothing
happening, they'll make sure you know that.<p><b>DARIA:</b> And if there is
something going on?<p><b>JODIE:</b> Then at least you'll know.  But really, Tom
left Jane for you, I don't think it's very likely he wants to go back.  You and
he are much more compatible.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Yeah, but like you said, knowing
it and feeling it isn't the same.  I'll see them both at the play, I guess I can
talk to them then.<p><b>Interior. Backstage.</b><p><b>The backstage area is
ready for the play, with scenery flats for a street scene standing up front. The
viewpoint is from near the curtain, looking back at the scenery. The flat has a
decorative balcony on the second storey, and several open doorways on the first.
Other scenery is back against the rear wall, waiting for later scenes.  The
curtain is down, and various students, not yet in costume, wander around. 
</b><p><i>Sandi is walking about the stage with a copy of the script,
rehearsing her lines.  Quinn is standing, talking to Stacy, near the curtain. 
Joey and Jeffy are throwing a Frisbee through the windows of the scenery, with
poor accuracy (Joey is behind the scenery, Jeffy is out
front).</i><p><b>STACY:</b> (to Quinn) I'm so nervous!  How can you be so
calm?<p><b>QUINN:</b> (to Stacy) Calm?  Who's calm?  I'm just too terrified to
panic.<p><i>Stacy laughs, and Sandi looks their way with a hostile glance.  The
Frisbee bounces off the scenery, and lands on the balcony.</i><p><b>JEFFY:</b>
(to Joey) Damn, it's stuck on the balcony.<p><b>JOEY:</b> (distant) I'll get
it.<p><b>QUINN:</b> (to Stacy) I wish Sandi wasn't still mad at me for getting
the part.<p><b>STACY:</b> (to Quinn) What did you expect?  Trying out for the
play was her idea, after all.  You weren't thinking about it until she brought
it up.<p><b>QUINN:</b> (to Stacy) Yeah, but I couldn't let her try out alone.
She'd be even more insufferable if I'd ignored it.  (affects a "Sandi" voice)
Gee, Quinn, don't have what it takes to act in a play, huh?  (normal voice) I'm
damned either way.<p><i>In the background, Joey is leaning through one of the
scenery windows from a stepladder behind the flat.  Sandi is walking in and out
of doors in the flat, avoiding the end where he's climbing on the ladder, but
otherwise focused on her script.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> (to Stacy) What is that
idiot doing up there?<p><i>Joey carefully steps out onto the balcony, reaching
for the Frisbee.</i><p><b>STACY:</b> (to Quinn) He's trying to pick up that
Frisbee they've been throwing around.<p><b>QUINN:</b> (to Stacy) Well, he's
going to break the scenery.  It's just some light wood, it isn't meant to hold
someone.<p><i>Joey picks up the Frisbee, and throws it down to Jeffy.  When he
does, the balcony drops noticeably, and begins to peel away from the wall it's
attached to.  Oblivious, Sandi walks out of a doorway at the far end, standing
under the balcony.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> (yells) Sandi, look out!  The balcony's
falling!<p><i>She points up, but Sandi just turns her back and concentrates on
the script.  Quinn runs towards her, as the balcony gives a lurch, and more of
it tears free from the wall with a ripping sound.  Surprised, Sandi turns to
look at Quinn, but continues to stand under the balcony.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b>
(yelling) Don't stand there, move!  It's going to fall on you!<p><i>Sandi looks
up, finally realizing her danger, but seems to be too surprised to react. 
Quinn, still running, tackles her, pushing her back through the doorway as the
balcony pulls free along it's full length, and falls where she was just
standing.</i><p><b>Cut to:</b> Jeffy.<p><i>Jeffy helps Joey up from the
wreckage of the balcony; in the background other students can be seen running
towards the disaster.  Quinn and Sandi are nowhere to be seen.</i><p><b>Cut
to:</b> Behind the scenery.<p><i>Sandi lies on the floor.  As she sits up, the
camera pans to reveal what she sees: Quinn, lying half under the fallen balcony
in the doorway of the scenery flat.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> Quinn!  Oh no, Quinn,
are you okay?<p><i>Quinn looks up, her face tightly drawn with
pain.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> (weakly, gasping between words) No.  Get.  This. 
Off.  Me.<p><i>Other students run up, and argue about what to do.  Mack joins
them, and begins to organize them to lift the wrecked balcony off of
Quinn.</i><p><b>MACK:</b> Now, lift it carefully, and don't move Quinn.  Watch
out for nails, and splinters. (turning to her) Quinn, stay put until the
paramedics arrive, you don't know what could be broken.<p><b>QUINN:</b>
(weakly) Yeah.<p><b>SANDI:</b> (visibly upset) Oh, Quinn, I'm so sorry.  Why
did you do that?<p><b>QUINN:</b> (weakly) You were. Too busy. Ignoring me. To
move.<p><b>SANDI:</b> Yeah, but why didn't you just let it fall on me?  Why'd
you let yourself get hurt?<p><i>Quinn manages a weak
smile.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> (weakly) Wasn't...  Planning...  To get... 
Hurt.<p><i>Sandi manages a halfhearted chuckle, and Quinn joins her, then
gasps.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> (weakly)  Ohh.  No laughing...  Ribs... 
Hurt.<p><i>Daria runs up, and kneels down beside Quinn.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b>
Quinn!  Oh, God.  What happened?<p><b>SANDI:</b> She saved my life.  That thing
would have landed right on me.<p><b>QUINN:</b> (weakly) Hey, Daria.  It's... 
Just a...  Bruise.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Right, and why are you gasping like a
beached fish, then?<p><b>QUINN:</b> (weakly) Okay.  Big...  Bruise.<p><i>Mr.
O'Neill hurries up; meanwhile the students have lifted the balcony away.  Quinn
remains lying down.</i><p><b>ONEILL:</b> Quinn!  Are you okay?  Can you stand
up?  Let me help you.<p><i>Daria stands up and steps between Mr. O'Neill and
Quinn, aggressively.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> (irate) Are you nuts!  She's not
moving until the ambulance gets here!<p><i>Mr. O'Neill steps back, dithering,
and wringing his hands.</i><p><b>ONEILL:</b> But, the play!  We need her!  Oh,
this is terrible!<p><i>Other students have gathered around the fallen Quinn,
looking concerned, but not knowing what to do.  Jane limps up on her
crutches.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> I think my sister's health is considerably more
important than your play.  Get her understudy to cover the role.  She's going to
the hospital, and I don't think they're going to let her out anytime
soon.<p><b>ONEILL:</b> Understudy?  We had enough trouble finding one set of
actors.  There is no understudy!<p><b>QUINN:</b> (weakly)  Daria...  Knows... 
My...  Lines.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Huh?<p><b>QUINN:</b> (weakly) You learned
them... With me...  You can...  Take my place.<p><b>MACK:</b> Quinn, it's
probably not a good idea for you to be talking.  Is she right, Daria, do you
know the lines for Kate?<p><b>DARIA:</b> Knowing the words doesn't mean I can
act.  Or that I'd want to.<p><b>QUINN:</b> (weakly) Not leaving...  Until... 
You...  Agree.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Quinn, Mack's right, you shouldn't be talking. 
You could have internal injuries and you'll just make them worse by moving more
than you have to.  As for leaving, what makes you think you have any say in the
matter?<p><b>ONEILL:</b> (nearly crying) Daria, please?  We've got hundreds of
people coming in less than an hour.  We can't just send them
home!<p><b>DARIA:</b> (unmoved) Why not?<p><b>JANE:</b> Well, for one thing,
if you do they'll never see my scenery.  What's left of it,
anyway.<p><b>MACK:</b> Please, Daria, we've all worked very hard on this play. 
It would be terrible if all that work was for nothing.<p><i>Two paramedics run
up, pulling a stretcher, and move the crowd away from
Quinn.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> Quinn, I'll call Mom and Dad and have them meet you
at the hospital.<p><b>QUINN:</b> (weakly) Please...  Do it...  For
me.<p><b>PARAMEDIC:</b> No talking, Miss.<p><i>Daria looks torn, and
worried.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> Okay, Quinn.  But you'd better believe you're
going to owe me for this.<p><i>Quinn smiles weakly.  It turns into a grimace as
the paramedics lift her onto the stretcher, and carefully strap her
in.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> (weakly) Fine.  Owe.  You.<p><i>The paramedics roll
Quinn away, and Daria turns to Mr. O'Neill.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> So, how were
you planning to stuff me into Quinn's costume?  I'm a bit larger than she
is.<p><b>ONEILL:</b> Oh dear.  I hadn't thought of that.  I'm sure we can do
something.  Come with me and we'll talk to Ms. Defoe.<p><b>DARIA: </b>You go
ahead.  I need to phone my parents first.<p><i>Mr. O'Neill walks off, and the
paramedics wheel Quinn away as well.  Daria turns to Mack.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b>
Mack, we need to talk about the play.  Could you come with me while I make my
phone call?<p><b>MACK:</b> Sure.<p><b>Cut to:</b> A small office, apparently
near the stage.<p><b>The room has a desk, and several faded posters from
previous school plays, as well as some storage cabinets and a stack of folding
chairs in the corner.  </b><p><i>Daria is seated behind the desk, hanging up
the phone.  Mack stands nearby.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> That's done.  Okay, about
the play.  You know the script we have has been modified from Shakespeare's
original?<p><b>MACK:</b> Yeah, Jodie thought it was done to tone down the
Kate/Petruchio conflict.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Probably.  There's plenty of precedent
for such interpretations.  But I don't like it, especially the way the whole
ending has been replaced with this saccharine "we're all friends" travesty.  It
removes all of the honest fire from their relationship.<p><b>MACK:</b> Daria,
I've read the real play.  You can't seriously want to present Kate as a meek and
subservient woman with all independent thought crushed out of her by her
husband.  Can you?<p><b>DARIA:</b> What do you think?<p><b>MACK:</b> (laughs)
Okay, so what are you really suggesting?<p><b>DARIA:</b> It's possible to
perform the original play, and make it clear than both Kate and Petruchio are
paying lip service to convention, while actually forging a more equal
partnership.  It's not easy, and I'm not sure I can do it, but I'd rather try to
present the play Shakespeare wrote than a censored version.  Done correctly, it
challenges the audience to think about their own behavior.  But to do that, you
need to present Petruchio as a sympathetic character from the beginning.  I
don't know how you were planning to perform the role, but here's what I think
you need to do...<p><b>Interior. Auditorium.</b><p><b>The play is in progress
on the stage, with a scene set in a street.  The backdrop is the wall that
formerly had a balcony, still showing the scars of its removal.  Onstage are
Daria (as Katherina), Jamie (as her father, Baptista), Sandi (as Bianca), Jeffy
(as Gremio) and Jamie (as Hortensio), as well as two other students (as Lucentio
and Tranio).</b><p><i>Daria is speaking, and with rather more emotion than she
usually shows.  She appears to be caught up in the role. The boys are more
wooden in their delivery, and appear to be reading cue cards from off-stage,
pausing occasionally in their speech.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> (as Katherina, to
Jamie) I pray you, sir, is it your will to make a stale of me among these
mates?<p><b>JAMIE:</b> (as Hortensio) 'Mates', maid? How mean you that? (pause)
No mates for you unless you were of gentler, milder mould.<p><b>DARIA:</b> (as
Katherina) I'faith, sir, you shall never need to fear.  Iwis it is not halfway
to her heart - but if it were, doubt not her care should be to comb your noddle
with a three-legged stool and paint your face, and use you like a
fool.<p><b>JAMIE:</b> (as Hortensio) From all such devils, good Lord deliver
us!<p><i>Jeffy pauses, looking off-stage.</i><p><b>JEFFY:</b> (as Gremio) And
me too, good Lord!<p><i>The camera pans to show Jane and Tom in the audience,
sitting with Jodie.</i><p><b>JODIE:</b> She's good.  Where did she learn to
act?  I've never seen her show so much emotion.<p><b>JANE:</b> Oh, she does,
just not in public.<p><b>TOM:</b> Yeah, she usually controls herself when there
are other people around, but she's not doing that now.  I think she's enjoying
herself.<p><b>JANE:</b> And O'Neill's videotaping this, too.  I'm going to have
to arrange a "bad movie night", and substitute the tape.<p><i>Jodie looks
sternly at Jane, but her words belie her appearance.</i><p><b>JODIE:</b> That's
cruel.  Invite me, please.<p><b>TOM:</b> I think I'll duck the event, she's mad
enough at me already.<p><b>JANE:</b> Huh, what are you two arguing about
now?<p><b>TOM:</b> I'm not really sure, but I think it's you.<p><b>JANE:</b>
Ah, recent events begin to make sense.<p><b>JODIE:</b> What
does?<p><b>JANE:</b> She kept ducking out of helping me with the painting, even
after she promised to help.  It's not like her to go back on her word.  But if
she's feeling jealous of Tom's and my friendship, that's exactly how she'd act;
avoiding me to avoid conflict.<p><b>TOM:</b> Can you find some way to reassure
her there's nothing to be jealous of?  She isn't listening to me, and it's
driving me crazy.<p><b>JANE:</b> I don't know, she and I need to talk before
that can happen.<p><b>JODIE:</b> Well, you're right about the cause, and she
was planning to talk to you tonight.  She spoke to me yesterday.<p><b>JANE:</b>
Then I just need to make sure I'm alone with her for a short time.  The drive
home should work.<p><b>TOM:</b> I hope so.<p><b>Fade out and Back In on the
stage.</b><p><b>Daria, Mack, Jamie (as Hortensio) and two other students (as
Lucentio and Vincentio) are foremost on the stage, with several others,
including Sandi (as Bianca) and Stacy (as the Widow) standing further back,
observing.</b><p><i>Daria is in mid-speech, delivering her lines with an ironic
tone that undercuts their apparent meaning.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> (as Katherina)
But now I see our lances are but straws, our strength as weak, our weakness past
compare, that seeming to be most which we indeed least are.  Then vail your
stomachs, for it is no boot, and place your hands beneath your husbands foot. 
In token of which duty, if he please, my hand is ready, may it do him
ease.<p><i>As she finishes, the look she turns on Petruchio is challenging, not
subservient.  Mack's response is humorous, as he sees past her words and accepts
that Kate isn't going to bend to his will except as necessary for social
convention.</i><p><b>MACK:</b> (as Petruchio) Why, there's a wench!  Come on
and kiss me, Kate.<p><i>Daria and Mack embrace, although they don't actually
kiss.</i><p><b>STUDENT1:</b> (as Lucentio) Well, go thy ways, old lad, for thou
shall have it.<p><b>STUDENT2:</b> (as Vincentio) 'Tis a good hearing when
children are toward.<p><b>STUDENT1:</b> (as Lucentio) But a harsh hearing when
women are froward.<p><b>MACK:</b> (as Petruchio) Come Kate, we'll to bed.  We
three are married, but you two are sped. (to Lucentio) 'Twas I won the wager,
though you hit the white, and being a winner, God give you good
night.<p><i>Mack and Daria walk off stage.</i><p><b>JAMIE:</b> (as Hortensio)
Now, go thy ways... (pause) thou has tamed a cursed shrew.<p><b>STUDENT1:</b>
(as Lucentio) 'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.<p><i>When he
stops speaking, there is total silence in the auditorium for a long moment, and
then someone begins to clap.  More join, and the camera pans over the audience,
showing faces, many with shocked and disbelieving looks.  More of them begin to
clap, and to stand, until the entire audience is on their feet, clapping
madly.</i><p><b>Cut to:</b> Stage wings, with Mr. O'Neill, Daria and
Mack.<p><i>Mr. O'Neill has his face buried in his hands.  Daria and Mack look
out at the audience, as the sound of applause swells.</i><p><b>ONEILL:</b>
(muffled wailing) Oh God, I'm dead.  The school board is going to fire me. Why
did I ever let Ms. Li talk me into this?<p><b>DARIA:</b> (to Mack) Hey, I think
we pulled it off.<p><i>Mack smiles, broadly, as he looks out at the
audience.</i><p><b>MACK:</b> No, you pulled it off.  They look like they don't
know what hit them, but apparently they liked it.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Or they're so
embarrassed that they have to act like that to avoid acknowledging
it.<p><b>MACK:</b> Either way, a success.<p><i>Mr. O'Neill looks up, tears
streaking his face.</i><p><b>ONEILL:</b> (incredulous) They liked
it?<p><b>DARIA:</b> Yep.  Looks like your job is safe, at least this
week.<p><i>Mr. O'Neill breaks into a broad grin, and embraces Daria, who
recoils.</i><p><b>ONEILL:</b> I knew you could do it!  I knew
it!<p><b>DARIA:</b> (urgent) Mr. O'Neill! Control yourself!<p><i>He quickly
lets her go, and steps back.</i><p><b>ONEILL:</b> (apologetic) Sorry!  I'm just
so overwhelmed.  I never thought this could work, and when you departed from the
script I thought it was all over.<p><b>DARIA:</b> You want me to perform
Shakespeare, you get Shakespeare.  You've known me for over two years; didn't
you see this coming?<p><b>ONEILL:</b> I knew you'd do it well, but I wasn't
expecting you to do it this way.<p><i>The camera pans to the audience, which is
still standing, and applauding.</i><p><b>ONEILL:</b> What are you two waiting
for?  Get back out on stage and take a bow!<p><i>Daria and Mack look at each
other, shrug, and head out onto the stage.</i><p><b>Interior.
Backstage.</b><p><b>Daria, still in costume, is sitting on a folding chair. 
Other students, some in costume and some not, mill around or sit on other
chairs.</b><p><i>Jodie walks up with Mack in tow.</i><p><b>JODIE:</b> Daria! 
That was incredible.  You make an excellent Kate.  I didn't know you could
act.<p><b>DARIA:</b> I didn't either, but it wasn't as hard as I thought.  I'd
been living that dialog for two weeks coaching Quinn, and I guess it made an
impression.<p><i>Jodie looks more serious.</i><p><b>JODIE:</b> How is she? 
Any word?<p><b>DARIA:</b> Mom and Dad stopped on their way to the hospital and
left me Dad's car, but they didn't have any news then, except that it didn't
seem too serious.<p><b>JODIE:</b> Well, that's good news.  It could have been
much worse.  Is anyone going to do anything to Joey and Jeffy?<p><b>MACK:</b>
Ms. Li said there'd be a disciplinary hearing next week.  They'll get suspended
for a couple of weeks, but unless Daria's parents want to press charges that's
probably the end of it, after all they didn't intended to hurt anyone, and Quinn
threw herself under the balcony.<p><b>JODIE:</b> Yeah.  Um, no offense Daria,
but who'd have thought Quinn would do something that selfless.<p><b>DARIA:</b>
None taken.  She surprised me, too.  I guess even though she and Sandi fight all
the time, she actually cares about her.  Either that, or the tackle was some new
form of aerobic workout.<p><i>Jane hobbles up on her crutches, followed by
Tom.</i><p><b>JANE:</b> Hey, discussing the pink linebacker?<p>
<b>JODIE:</b>
Jane!<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> (smiling) Yep, we think she's going out for football next
year.<p>
<b>MACK:</b> Hey, she'd probably be a better quarterback than
Kevin.<p>
<b>JANE:</b> There are things in my refrigerator that could call
better plays than Kevin.  Anyway, I wanted to tell you, your Mother called
during the play.  Quinn's fine, two broken ribs but apparently nothing else
wrong.  They're going to keep her overnight, and your parents will be home
late, but they said to tell you it was okay if we took your father's car out for
pizza or something.<p>
<b>DARIA:</b> (to Jodie) Want to join
us?<p>
<b>JODIE:</b> Sorry, Mack and I have dinner plans.  I'm taking him to
Chez Pierre to celebrate.<p>
<b>MACK:</b> (surprised) You are?<p>
<b>JODIE:</b>
(smiling) Oh, did I forget to tell you?<p>
<i>Jodie and Mack walk off, leaving
Daria, Jane, and Tom together.</i><p>
<b>DARIA:</b> So, I guess it's just
us.<p>
<b>TOM:</b> Looks like it.  Why don't I go ahead and get a table, and you
two catch up after you change into normal clothes.<p>
<b>JANE:</b> Sounds like a
plan, see you there.<p>
<i>Tom gives Daria a kiss.</i><p>
<b>TOM:</b> By the
way, you were incredible onstage.<p><i>Daria blushes, and looks
down.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> (mumbling) Thanks.<p><b>TOM:</b> Hey, none of that. 
You were good.  Accept it.<p><b>JANE:</b> He's right, you know.  I'd never have
believed you could act in such an emotional role, but you really made Kate come
alive.  Of course, maybe it's not acting.  Crusty exterior, soft center, sounds
like someone I know.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Jane!  I'm not like that! (quieter) Am
I?<p><b>TOM:</b> No, you aren't nearly as unpleasant as Kate on the outside. 
The part about a soft center's right, though.<p><i>Daria blushes again, as Tom
hugs her.</i><p><b>JANE:</b> Hey, you two can do that later.  Right now, I'm
hungry.<p><i>Tom and Daria disengage, and Tom starts to
leave.</i><p><b>TOM:</b> Okay, I'm going.  Hurry up yourselves.<p><i>As Tom
walks away, Sandi, Stacy, and Tiffany come over to Daria.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b>
Uh, Daria, have you heard anything about Quinn?<p><b>DARIA:</b> She's fine. 
Two broken ribs, but they're going to let her come home
tomorrow.<p><b>STACY:</b> Oh, thank God!<p><b>TIFFANY:</b> Yeah.  Are they
going to let her have visitors tomorrow morning?<p><b>DARIA:</b> I don't know,
but if you call the hospital they should be able to tell you.<p><b>SANDI:</b>
Great, thanks.<p><i>The three wander away, talking
animatedly.</i><p><b>JANE:</b> Weird.  I thought they killed and ate their
wounded.<p><b>DARIA:</b> They're getting mellow in their old
age.<p><b>Interior. Jake's Car - Night.</b><p><i>Daria is driving, with Jane
in the passenger seat.  The car pulls into the parking lot of the strip mall
containing the pizza place, and Daria shuts the motor off.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b>
Jane, before we go in, there's something I want to talk to you about.<p><i>Jane
looks over at the serious expression on her friends face, and tilts her head
slightly.</i><p><b>JANE:</b> Gee, let me guess, Tom?<p><i>Daria's eyes widen,
and she looks at Jane, who's grinning, then down at the steering
wheel.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> Uh, yeah.  Um, I've been a real idiot all week, and
I wanted to apologize for not helping you with the scenery as much as I'd
promised I would.<p><b>JANE:</b> So amiga, what were you being an idiot about,
hmm?<p><i>Daria turns to Jane, and takes a breath.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b>
(rushed) I was afraid of losing Tom to you.  Back to you.  (slower) So I ended
up pushing the two of you together.<p><b>JANE:</b> Thought so. (pauses briefly
for thought) Look, Daria, Tom's a nice guy, and I enjoy his company.  More than
I would have expected I would.  But what the two of us had last spring is over. 
I've got some good memories, and some painful ones, from then, but they're
memories.<p><b>DARIA:</b> I still feel like an idiot for being
jealous.<p><b>JANE:</b> And so you should, my friend, so you
should.<p><i>Daria looks over at Jane with a hint of her usual
humor.</i><p><b>DARIA:</b> You don't need to be smug about it, "gimpy", just
because we're friends doesn't mean I won't leave you to hobble
home.<p><b>JANE:</b> Heh, after this week, I figure you owe
me.<p><b>DARIA:</b> I'll buy the pizza.  Deal?<p><b>JANE:</b> Two.  I'm
starving.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Works for me, being on stage takes a lot out of
you.<p><b>JANE:</b> Oh, but you and Mack make such a nice couple.  Jodie should
be jealous.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Please.  Once was enough.  Mack's a great guy, but
I'm never going to get a in a car alone with him.<p><b>JANE:</b> And speaking
of young Thomas, is that him I see inside?<p><b>DARIA:</b> Looks like
it.<p><b>JANE:</b> And it looks like he's bought the pizza, so you'll have to
owe me.<p><b>DARIA:</b> Okay, okay.  Can we go inside now, or would you like to
gloat some more?<p><i>Jane opens the car door, reaching into the back seat for
her crutches.</i><p><b>JANE:</b> Let's eat.<p><b>Interior. Hospital Room -
Day.</b><p><i>Quinn is sitting up in bed, leaning on a large pillow, reading an
issue of Waif.  The door opens, and Sandi sticks her head in, but doesn't
enter.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> (diffident) Hey, Quinn, can I come in?<p><i>Quinn
sets down the magazine, and looks in Sandi's direction with a
smile.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> (excited) Sandi!  Come on in, I'm just re-reading
last month's issue.<p><i>Sandi enters, carrying a large Cashman's bag.  Quinn
looks at the bag with a small frown.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> (disappointed) Did I
miss a sale today?  I don't remember there being one this
weekend.<p><b>SANDI:</b> This?  No, I just brought you some stuff.<p><i>She
sets the bag down on the edge of the bed, and pulls out some folded clothing
(jeans and a pink top), several magazines, and a video
tape.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> I went by your house, and your mother gave me some
clothes for you.  She said they were going to let you out this afternoon, and
she thought you might want to get dressed before your folks came to pick you
up.<p><b>QUINN:</b> Yeah, thanks, I'm just waiting for the doctor to come in
and look at the results from the CAT scan they did last night, but the
technician said it was fine: no injuries other than the two broken
ribs.<p><b>SANDI:</b> So, why does the doctor need to look at the
results?<p><b>QUINN:</b> Probably so he can bill the insurance company for
doing it. What's the other stuff there?<p><b>SANDI:</b> Well, I brought the new
issue of Waif, and a couple of other magazines.  I figured you'd have read
everything they had here already, and if they weren't letting you out until
later you'd be bored stiff.<p><b>QUINN:</b> Yeah. I think I've memorized the
color-matching tips in this issue.  What's the tape, a movie?<p><b>SANDI:</b>
No. Mr. O'Neill taped the play last night.  I thought you might like a copy. 
Your sister did pretty well, but you should see the way Joey kept messing up his
lines.  It's hilarious.<p><i>Sandi laughs, and Quinn laughs too, but her heart
doesn't seem to be in it.  Sandi notices, and abruptly stops
laughing.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> (concerned) Are your ribs still hurting?  I'm
sorry, I should have realized laughter wasn't something you'd be doing
yet.<p><i>Quinn looks down at the closed magazine in her hands, resting on the
bed.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> (quieter) No.  I'm just disappointed I missed
it.<p><i>Quinn looks at Sandi.  Takes a deep breath.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> I'm
also sorry I took the part away from you.  If I hadn't, you could have done it
last night, instead of Daria.  I feel really bad about that.<p><b>SANDI:</b>
Don't.  I hadn't realized how much dialog Kate had.  I could never have learned
it all in time.  You kept me from making a fool of myself, as well as saving me
from that balcony.  You've got nothing to apologize for.  I should apologize to
you for being such a bitch about it.<p><b>QUINN:</b> Yeah, but I didn't do it
to help you.  I did it to beat you.<p><b>SANDI:</b> So?  We've been competing
for everything since you moved to town.  Why should this be any
different?<p><i>Quinn is visibly shocked.</i><p><b>QUINN: </b>But don't you
mind?<p><i>Sandi looks at Quinn, organizing her thoughts before
speaking.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> I mind losing, but winning wouldn't be any fun if
it was easy.  Until you came along I only had Stacy and Tiffany to compete with,
and they give up too easy.  You're the only one who can challenge me.  I knew
that the first day I met you; why do you think I made you the vice president of
the Fashion Club?<p><b>QUINN:</b> I thought you did it to keep me from trying
for the presidency.<p><i>Sandi smiles.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> That
too.<p><i>Quinn chuckles, a real, deep, laugh, and winces, putting one hand on
her ribs.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> Oww.  No laughing today.  But Sandi, I want to be
your friend.  I don't want to fight all the time.<p><b>SANDI:</b> You are my
friend.  You've been a better friend to me than I've ever been to you.  Not just
last night, but also when I quit the Fashion Club; Stacy told me you were the
one who convinced her and Tiffany to hang out with me on the hike. 
<p><b>QUINN:</b> Yeah, but we keep fighting, and I'm just as much to blame as
you.<p><b>SANDI:</b> Maybe we'll always fight.  Neither of us is going to
accept being second best.  My Mom taught me that I had to be number one or be
nothing, and that how I made it didn't matter as long as I won.  Even though I
think she was wrong, I still act like that when I don't stop to think.  And
anyway, trying to be number one isn't wrong, what matters is not hurting other
people while you try.<p><b>QUINN:</b> But we can't both be number
one.<p><b>SANDI:</b> No, we can't.  But that doesn't mean we have to be
enemies.  Sometimes you'll win, and sometimes I will, but as long as we remember
we're friends, we should be able to lose without taking it too personally. I
need to remember that, and do a better job of being your
friend.<p><b>QUINN:</b> Think so?  I'd like that.  But is that friendship?  I
thought friends were people who liked each other so much they didn't
fight.<p><b>SANDI:</b> Well, I don't think so, but how would I know?  I don't
have any real friends other than you.  Stacy is kind of like a friend, but I
have to be careful how I behave around her, or she freaks out.  You're the only
person I can be myself with, other than Chuck.<p><b>QUINN:</b> Eww, Sandi, what
can you possibly see in him?  He's not popular, he dresses terribly even with
your influence, and he's still the same guy who installed a video camera in the
girls' locker room.  He's not just a geek, he's an unpleasant
geek.<p><b>SANDI:</b> I know you don't like him, Quinn, but he's not that bad. 
He's really kind of shy underneath; I think he just acted like that to keep
people from getting too close.  And he's really changed since we started
dating.<p><b>QUINN:</b> Even so, he's still a geek.  What's to
like?<p><b>SANDI:</b> He actually listens to me when I talk.  He asks my
opinion about things.  Nobody I'd ever dated before cared if I had a mind or
not.  I'm not book-smart like you, but I still have a brain, and opinions, and
it hurts when someone treats me like part of the scenery.<p><b>QUINN:</b> But
we've always cared about your opinions.  Why do you need him, too?  Boys are
just for taking you out and buying stuff.<p><b>SANDI:</b> You'll understand
when you get a steady boyfriend.<p><b>QUINN:</b> Maybe.  But I like having guys
fight over me.  Who needs one, when I can have a bunch?<p><b>SANDI:</b> Trust
me, one's better.  Look at Tiffany and Jamie.<p><b>QUINN:</b> You remember his
name?<p><b>SANDI:</b> Of course I do.  If you thought about him as a person,
instead of a mobile cup holder, you'd remember his name too.  But you don't, and
that's why you lost him to Tiffany.<p><b>QUINN:</b> Funny, Daria said almost
the same thing the other day.  I hope Tiffany's happy with him; I always liked
him best out of the three, even if I couldn't remember his name.  He doesn't
have Joey's mean streak, and he's smarter than Jeffy.<p><b>SANDI:</b> Brittany
is smarter than Jeffy. All three of them are losers.  If they weren't, they'd
have caught on years ago that you'd never date any of them.  You can do a lot
better.  So can Tiffany, but she seems to be enjoying herself for now, and I
guess that's what matters.<p><b>QUINN:</b> Yeah.  Have you seen Stacy or
Tiffany today?  I was hoping they'd come to visit.<p><b>SANDI:</b> They'll be
over later.  I told them I wanted to talk to you alone first.<p><i>Sandi
pauses, looking thoughtful.</i><p><b>QUINN:</b> What is it,
Sandi?<p><b>SANDI:</b> Well.  I've been thinking.  How would you feel about
putting the club back together?<p><b>QUINN:</b> Fine by me, but Stacy and
Tiffany were the ones who quit.  They're the ones you need to
convince.<p><b>SANDI:</b> They said okay, on three conditions.<p><b>QUINN:</b>
Oh.  What conditions?<p><i>Sandi ticks off the three points on her
fingers.</i><p><b>SANDI:</b> One, you have to agree; two, we need to admit
Brooke and any others who want to join; and three, we need to hold an election
for club officers after we admit the new members.<p><b>QUINN:</b> But we won't
be exclusive if we let just anyone in.  And what if people who don't know
anything about fashion want to join?<p><b>SANDI:</b> I think that's their
point.  Besides, those of us who've been doing this for years will have an
advantage.  We can give seminars on color coordination, or makeup, and show the
new members how to be fashionable.  If we prove we know our stuff, we can
probably get our old jobs back even with an election.<p><b>QUINN:</b> What do
you mean, our OLD jobs?  I'm going to be president this time!<p><b>SANDI:</b>
(smiling) Over my dead body.<p><b>QUINN:</b> (smiling) If that's what it
takes.<p><b>The camera freezes on the two of them smiling, and the credits
roll.</b>
			<hr>
			<p><b>Authors Notes:</b><p>The title - There are some scholars
who think <i>Love's Labors Won</i> was an alternate title for <i>The Taming of
the Shrew</i> (both that and <i>Love's Labors Lost</i> appear in a contemporary
list of the Bard's early plays, but The Shrew does not, and no such play exists
today).  The "Undone" part is a reference to the Daria/Jane/Tom subplot, and the
theme of Quinn and her dates, as well as Daria's restoration of the plays
original ending.<p>My source for the following information is an edition of the
play from the Cambridge University Press, <i>The New Cambridge Shakespeare: The
Taming of the Shrew</i>, which has extensive historical and analytical notes
(edited by Ann Thompson, ISBN 0-521-29388-x in paperback).  I like Shakespeare,
but I'm no academic, I just enjoy the plays, so all of this was new to
me.<p>The Taming of the Shrew - This is one of Shakespeare's earliest plays,
perhaps even his first. It lacks the polish of his later works and was
apparently written before 1592 (Shakespeare is believed to have started writing
plays around 1590, although some have proposed dates in the 1580's).  The
primary plot (Katherina and Petruchio) derives from folktales common at the time
he wrote it and/or other sources.  The subplot, with Bianca and Lucentio,
derives from the play <i>Supposes</i>, by George Gascoigne, which in turn
derives from Ariosto's <i>I Suppositi</i>, written in 1509, and there are
further antecedents back to Roman times. The play is something of an anomaly
among Shakespeare's works, in it's seemingly hostile approach to women.  This
has caused its presentation to be modified at various times, with dialog
intended to balance the two sexes, or by presenting it wholly as farce.  Typical
recent changes include having Katherina obviously fall in love with Petruchio at
first sight, to soften the later taming, and the modification of her closing
speech.  There is, apparently, much that a skilled actress can do to make the
role of Kate less negative, while still remaining true to the source material,
especially when paired with an actor who can present Petruchio as sensitive and
caring.  But the play remains, fundamentally, negative and even disturbing in
it's central theme.<p>So, why did I pick this play?  Well, at first it was
because I misremembered it (I think I was confusing it with <i>Much Ado About
Nothing</i>).  When I actually read it, I nearly switched to another play.  But
the idea of a play that nobody wanted to produce, and that Daria was trapped
into participating in, was too tempting to let pass.  That also helped to
explain how the former Fashion Club wound up acting in it rather than the Drama
Club we know (from the list of clubs in the Daria Database, Pocket Books, 1998)
that Lawndale High has.  Finally, it provided a basis for Daria to comment on
Quinn's treatment of her fan club via the parallel with Bianca, and to act
against literary revisionism by presenting the real ending.<p>Daria as a
skilled actress may seem like a reach, but I don't think it is.  Much of acting
comes down to understanding a role, and she clearly loves literature and is the
sort of person who would look past the surface to understand the motivations of
the characters.  The technical skill of presenting the characters words and
emotions is more problematic, but she has had experience speaking onstage in
public, and the critical part required irony, a form of speech with which she is
very familiar.<p>This tale started out as the story of Quinn and Sandi's
relationship, with Daria/Jane/Tom and the play as subplots.  The play, and
Daria's involvement in it, came to dominate the story as I wrote it.<p>Random
notes:<p>Maybe you should have checked with your guardian angel before you
tried that dressing? - This is a reference to <i>Groped By An Angel</i>, where
Sandi gets an upset stomach from bad salad dressing, after telling Quinn her
guardian angel told her to eat it for her complexion.<p>Just where were the two
of you when the electricity went out, anyway? - Tiffany and Jamie's relationship
started in <i>Strange Bedfellows</i>, during a power failure.<p>We've been to
your apartment - Daria and Jane saw Mr. O'Neill's apartment, complete with
incense, in <i>The F Word</i>.<p>Daria's " appearance at the coffeehouse"
occurred in <i>Cafe Disaffecto</i>, where she read one of her Melody Powers
short stories, and incited an anti-communist riot.<p>trompe-l'oeil - Literally
"deceives the eye", a style of painting intended to provide an illusion of
reality.  Sometimes used in buildings to make them look larger than they are
with illusory corridors or windows.<p>The webcam - Jane's webcam, and the air
guitar incident, appeared in <i>Psycho Therapy</i>.  But there weren't
"millions" of viewers.  There were, in fact, less than ten hits the entire time
it was set up.<p>Joey's mean streak - A reference to the events on the bridge
in <i>Strange Bedfellows</i>.<p>Quinn and Kate - Quinn finding the older and
less popular sister "more interesting" is a trifle ironic.  However, in the play
the younger daughter, Bianca, is pretty much a non-entity.  Kate gets all the
interesting lines and action, so it's not unreasonable.  I'm sure the irony of
the situation didn't escape Daria, but Quinn appears to have been
oblivious.<p>Where do we go from here?  Well, I'm not planning any more stories
in this series at present.  When I wrote <i>Breaking Strain</i>, I knew I wanted
to explore Sandi's character (which I did in <i>Strange Bedfellows</i>, and
further here) and her relationship with Quinn.  But this story concludes what
I'd planned back then.  I suppose I could do something with Tiffany, or Quinn's
inability to commit to a steady boyfriend, but neither really appeals to me at
the moment.  I'll certainly write more Daria stories, but not necessarily the
further adventures of the Fashion Club.<p><b>THE END</b><p></div>
