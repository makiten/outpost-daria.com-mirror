<B>Lawndale
and Sandi Griffin&rsquo;s Genie</B><br>
<B>Prologue</B><br>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Lawndale,
Pennsylvania, United States of America</B><br>
<B>Wednesday,
February 17 1999</B><br>
It
was a bright sunny day in Lawndale, a not-so-typical American
town-suburb. Almost no-one knew what was going to happen that
afternoon. Those that did know had been preparing for the upcoming
events for the last three months. It was an event that would set off
a chain of events that bring about massive changes to the town (or
suburb, though Lawndale was certainly separate from the nearby
settlements, many of which also considered themselves towns).<br>
<br><br>
Only
a minority of people knew what was about to happen that afternoon,
after school had finished for the day.<br>
<br><br>
Lawndale
High School was the domain of Angela Li, a dictator of a Principal,
who tended to put security above other concerns, like the budget for
the maintenance of the school&rsquo;s buildings. However, even she
was not aware of the secret meeting that was taking place beneath the
school during the last period of the school day.
<br>
<br><br>
The
attendees of the meeting were students, who had been excused from
class for a variety of reasons, and two or three teachers who didn&rsquo;t
have a class for that period...
<br><br>
&ldquo;Now,
does everyone understand what you need to do?&rdquo; the convenor of
the meeting, who stood in a shadow that the meagre lights of the room
did not reach, asked.
<br><br>
&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
the teachers, and most of the students, said enthusiastically.
<br><br>
&ldquo;Yes,
Of course I do. There was no need for the repetition,&rdquo; the
remaining student said. As she had been sitting separately from
everyone else, she quickly exited the room.
<br><br>
&ldquo;Excellent!
Meeting is adjourned,&rdquo; the convenor said.
<br><br><br>
The
students who attended the meeting then returned to their classes via
various secret passageways beneath the school buildings, re-emerging
into the corridors, or the basement, where Li&rsquo;s cameras had
blind spots.
<br><br><br>
The
last of the students whom had attended the secret meeting had
returned to their classes 20 minutes before school finished for the
day.
<br><br>
Sandi Griffin, sophomore and President of the school&rsquo;s Fashion Club
(and who had not attended the secret meeting), did not know as she
exited the school&rsquo;s front entrance what role she would play in
the history making events over the next few weeks.
<br><br>
&ldquo;Quinn,
where were you?&rdquo; Sandi turned to the source of the question. It
was two of the other members of the Fashion Club, Quinn Morgendorffer
and Stacy Rowe.
<br><br>
&ldquo;I was in the bathroom, Stacy,&rdquo; Quinn said.
<br><br>
&ldquo;For
half an hour? That is a very long time, even for you, Quinn,&rdquo;
Stacy said.
<br><br>
Sandi <I>had</I> to interrupt.
<br><br>
&ldquo;Maybe,
Qui-inn, like, you were somewhere else?&rdquo; she said. Quinn
blushed.
<br><br>
&ldquo;Ok,
Ok, I was in Study Hall,&rdquo; Quinn said, not entirely
convincingly. &ldquo;I miss-read my timetable,&rdquo; she said.
<br><br>
Sandi
could tell that her Vice-President rival was lying, but she saw that
Stacy believed her. To accuse Quinn now could cause problems within
the Fashion Club for the rest of the month, Sandi reasoned.
&ldquo;I
suppose so, even though the time table change <I>was</I>
3 weeks ago,&rdquo; Sandi said.
<br><br>
&ldquo;Thank
you, Sandi,&rdquo; Quinn said.
<br><br>
&ldquo;Besides,
I have misread my timetable many times,&rdquo; Stacy said, in support
of Quinn.
<br><br>
Sandi talked to Quinn, Stacy and the fourth Fashion Club member, Tiffany Blum-Deckler, for about ten minutes before heading home. Her thoughts
full of plans for the months ahead, regarding school, and the Fashion Club. &lsquo;I hope that Quinn&rsquo;s weird sister will not
interfere,&rsquo; she thought as she turned into her street. Little did she know that all her plans would come to naught.
<br><br>
After an hour of looking at fashion websites (such as they were in &lsquo;99)
Sandi went out to her backyard. After a minute of observing her two
brothers playing she noticed a glint in the grass. She went over and
picked it up. It was an emerald. &ldquo;How did we not notice this
before?&rdquo; she asked herself. She took it to her bedroom.
<br><br>
When she had placed the emerald on her bedside table, her phone rang. She quickly forgot about the Emerald, as she talked to Tiffany about her
choices of clothes for a party on Friday night.
<br><br>
Sandi did not give the emerald another thought until the next morning.
