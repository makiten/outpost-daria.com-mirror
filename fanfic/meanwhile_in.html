a <I>Daria</I> Fanfic
<P>
by Wyvern337
<P>
<B>....The Great Cavern...</B>
<P>
Vincent Lane peered intently through the viewfinder of his camera
as he focused on the complex stalactite formation.  They were
unlike anything he'd ever seen before, and he wanted this shot
to be <I>perfect</I>.
<P>
There were already several spotlights focused on it, but in order
to get the depth of field he wanted he'd had to stop down to an
<I>f </I>8 aperture, and even with the tripod he was using that
was going to mean additional light -- at least if he wanted to
keep the exposure reasonably short.  To that end, he'd brought
in the most powerful flashgun he'd had with him...<I>that</I>
should be enough to chase the shadows away.
<P>
Vincent finished setting up his shot, took a step back from his
rig and looked up at the rock formation as he took up the cable
release and began to depress the shutter.  For the first time
his guide at Great Cavern State Park noticed just how <I>serious</I>
the lighting equipment he was looking at was, and began to voice
some misgivings.
<P>
&quot;Uh, Mr. Lane,&quot; he began, &quot;there are a number of
unusual and even unique life forms in these caves.  A sudden,
really bright flash of light might--&quot;
<P>
&quot;Eh, what's that?&quot; Vincent asked, even as he tripped
the shutter release.  The bank of xenon flash tubes were tripped
at the same instant and, for a few hundredths of a second, something
very much like full daylight came to the vault of the Great Caverns
where the two men were standing.
<P>
Hundreds -- maybe even thousands -- of bats that had been resting
in crevices near the ceiling of the chamber came boiling out of
their hiding places, spooked by the sudden, unnatural flood of
light.  Faced with something unknown, they instinctively headed
for the cave's exit.  Vincent watched, fascinated, as the bats
swarmed towards him.
<P>
&quot;Get <I>down</I>, you fool!&quot; shouted his guide, and
pulled him down towards the floor of the cave, just ahead of the
leading edge of the cloud of bats.  Rather than literally filling
the cavern, the bats stayed near the roof of the cave, flying
over the heads of Vincent and his guide as the two of them crouched
near floor-level.  In little more than a minute, the bats had
cleared out of the cavern.
<P>
&quot;Don't you know any better than to stand in the path of a
swarm of panicked cave bats?&quot; asked the guide.
<P>
&quot;They seemed pretty harmless to me,&quot; retorted Vincent.
<P>
&quot;Sure, the ones that weren't rabid,&quot; came the reply.
 &quot;Or were you hoping to get bitten by one of those?&quot;
<P>
Ignoring his guide's carping, Vincent looked back up at the nest
of stalactites he'd just photographed.  He found himself grinning
crazily.  It'd taken <I>hours</I> to set up that shot -- the shot
of a lifetime, at least for most photographers -- and by God,
<I>he'd gotten it!</I>
<P>

<P>
<B>...The Sweet Mud new Age Spa and Crafts Colony...</B>
<P>
Amanda Lane curled her toes as she settled back in the mud bath,
feeling the warm mud squish between them.  This week-long clay
intensive had been <I>such </I>a good idea.  She hadn't felt this
creative and generally rejuvenated in...well, she couldn't remember
<I>how </I>long.  She leaned her head back on the folded towel
at the edge of the mud bath, closed her eyes and sighed contentedly
as she thought about her stay there at the spa.
<P>
After a few moments, Amanda's brow furrowed slightly as she realized
something wasn't quite right, that despite everything something
was, well, was <I>bothering</I> her.  Something she couldn't quite
put her finger on.  What could it be? Everything here was perfect,
including the pottery she'd been working on.  Why, that urn she'd
been working on was <I>amazing</I>....she could hardly wait to
show it to her family.  When they saw how ornate and intricate
it was, Vincent and the children would...
<P>
Suddenly Amanda realized what the problem was.  
<P>
It was obvious.
<P>
Had been staring her in the face the whole time.
<P>
And as soon as she got up out of this mudbath and showered-off,
Amanda knew what she was going to <I>have </I>to do about it.
<P>
Obviously, her work had become <I>too</I> intricate and involved.
 As soon as she was finished with the urn -- maybe she'd even
get started before then -- she was going to really get back to
basics...no potter's wheel for her next work, she was going to
fabricate it out of joined pinchpots, maybe with a coil-formed
neck.  Yes, <I>that</I> was the ticket, really starting over from
simplest forms....
<P>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
<B>...The Pine Top Motel....</B>
<P>
&quot;Look, it's perfectly simple,&quot; said Summer Lane to the
desk clerk, failing to keep her voice at normal conversational
volume but not really trying very hard to.  &quot;I'm looking
for two children, a boy, dark hair, about this tall,&quot; she
held out a hand, palm down, at about the height the top of Adrian's
head would be above the floor, &quot;and a girl, blonde hair,
about...&quot;
<P>
Abruptly, Summer stopped talking, and leaned against the cheap
veneer paneling of the motel lobby.  Leaned and then sagged. 
She was so <I>tired</I> of this! <I>Why</I> did her kids keep
running away? How many more times was she going to have to go
through all this relentless chasing? Summer felt her throat tighten,
and her eyes began to burn.  With a sudden stab of embarrassed
anger, she realized the burning sensation was because she was
starting to tear-up.
<P>
<I>No, </I>she told herself, <I>I am <B>not</B> going to break
down here <B>not </B>going to lose it I have <B>got </B>to keep
it <B>together...</B></I>
<P>
&quot;Uh, ma'am?&quot; came a concerned voice.  Summer snapped
out of her reverie and opened her eyes, focused on the polite
older woman there behind the counter, looking back at her with...sympathy?..<I>pity?!</I>
<P>
<I>Well, maybe I don't <B>want</B> your pity!</I> thought Summer
venomously.  <I>Maybe the dysfunctional freak who has to chase
her children all over the country on a regular basis doesn't <B>want</B>
you to feel sorry for her! Maybe...</I>
<P>
<I>....I should get a damn grip.</I>
<P>
&quot;Yes?&quot; Summer replied, managing to keep her voice level.
<P>
&quot;I think I remember seeing your children,&quot; said the
clerk.  &quot;They were through here about a week ago.  I'm sorry
but I'm not exactly sure where they went...though come to think
of it they <I>did</I> keep talking about deserts, and how they'd
be the place to be this time of year.  I think I heard the boy
say something about Arizona....but I'm afraid that's as much as
I can remember.  I'm sorry...&quot;
<P>
&quot;No, no, that's okay,&quot; said Summer.  &quot;You've helped
me out a lot.&quot;
<P>
Well, maybe 'a lot' was an exaggeration, but at least now she
had a lead -- a commodity she'd been <I>out</I> of just moments
before.  Summer turned, walked out the door to the Pine Top Motel's
lobby and into the parking lot.  As she started to get into her
car, she paused to take stock of her surroundings.  It was cold,
and she didn't like the look of those clouds.  It felt like it
was going to snow.  
<P>
<I>Good reason to keep moving,</I> she thought as she closed the
car door and started the engine.
<P>

<P>
<B>...The Hitch Hutch Wedding Chapel (&quot;where 'I do' is drive-thru&quot;)....</B>
<P>
&quot;I can't <I>believe</I> we're doing this!&quot; said Sheila
from the passenger seat.  &quot;We've only known each other for,
what, now?...&quot;
<P>
&quot;It doesn't matter,&quot; said Wind Lane, gazing adoringly
over at his bride-to-be.  &quot;It already feels like a thousand
lifetimes.&quot;
<P>
Sheila giggled.  Wind was so <I>cute</I> when he said things like
that -- and it seemed like he was <I>always </I>saying things
like that.  She guessed that was why she liked him so much.
<P>
The car at the Hitch Hutch's drive-thru window pulled away.  Only
two cars ahead of them now.  Wind managed to tear his eyes away
from Sheila long enough to pull forward another car length.  It
wouldn't do to have a fender-bender now, on the happiest evening
of his life.  Wind remembered how elated he'd been earlier in
the day, when he'd found out the guy who'd married he and Katie
wasn't who he said he was, so that 'marriage' <I>probably</I>
hadn't been legal, or legally binding, or whatever.  But if he
thought he'd been happy then, he'd learned what happiness <I>truly</I>
was when, on the spur of the moment, he'd proposed to Sheila,
and <I><B>she'd said yes!</B></I>  Of course there'd been only
one thing for it at that point -- to buy an...affordable....set
of wedding bands at a local pawnshop and head over to the Hitch
Hutch.  And on this day of all others! So much to be thankful
for...
<P>
The line at the window moved again.  Only one car ahead of them
now.  Sheila suddenly leaned over and kissed Wind, smearing her
plum-colored lipstick a little in the process.  As they broke
the kiss, Wind gazed into Sheila's sparkling blue eyes, reached
over and stroked her short, black hair and thought about how different
she was from anyone he'd ever known before...and yet somehow it
seemed as if they'd known each other their whole lives.  Certainly
Sheila wasn't like any of the women Wind had been married to before
-- take that red-haired firebrand Katie, for instance.  Or, before
Katie, bossy, blonde Claudia...
<P>
The last car ahead of them pulled away.  It was their turn.  Heart
pounding, Wind put the car in gear.  He steered with one hand
as Sheila reached over and took hold of his other, giving it a
squeeze.  They pulled up to the Hitch Hutch's drive-through window.
<P>
&quot;Hello, lovebirds,&quot; said the minister....
<P>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
<B>...Somewhere near the Nicaragua-Honduras border....</B>
<P>
The bus hit a pothole in the road -- if you could even <I>call</I>
it a road -- and the resulting lurch shook Penny Lane awake. 
Daylight again already, and they still weren't there.  Not that
she was surprised, of course:  she'd long since gotten used to
the pace of transportation in the remoter parts of Central America.
 She was just anxious to get herself reestablished and set up
her crafts stand again.
<P>
A raucous squawking from the other end of the bus drew Penny's
attention.  Chiquito was having a disagreement with a cageful
of chickens.  After a few choice comments the parrot decided arguing
with caged birds was beneath his dignity and flew back up towards
the front to perch on Penny's shoulder.
<P>
Penny looked out the window at the passing scenery.  The Nicaraguan
job market had been a disappointment, but she knew Honduras would
be better.  Soon she'd have her native crafts stand set up again,
and this time she knew just what would sell...hand-crafted gecko
skin coin purses! Things had been going less well than they should've,
but they were going to turn around now, she was sure of it...
<P>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
<B>....The Petrified Forest, the Arizona Desert...</B>
<P>
&quot;Courtney, it's <I>my </I>turn to wear the gloves!&quot;
complained Adrian.  Coming to the desert for the winter had seemed
like a good idea back when they'd thought of it.  It hadn't taken
them long, though, to find out just how cold it got around here
-- and they hadn't thought to bring along much in the way of cold-weather
clothing. 
<P>
&quot;Tough,&quot; replied his sister.  &quot;I  think I'll just
keep wearing them for now, unless you want to take them from me.&quot;
<P>
Instead of fighting Courtney for the gloves, Adrian tucked his
hands under his arms and scowled.  &quot;Okay,&quot; he said after
a moment, &quot;but that means <I>you</I> get to be the one to
break off the chips this time.&quot;
<P>
Courtney didn't say anything in reply.  Instead the two of them
kept trudging farther into the field of fossilized trees.  Adrian
wondered whether it would be a better idea, now that they had
this job breaking bits off of the petrified trees for the souvenir
stand, to spend any money they managed to get saved-up on more
winter clothes or on a pair of bus tickets the hell <I>out</I>
of there.  Of course, the second of those two options might prove
more difficult now that they had--
<P>
&quot;Hey Courtney, where's the dog?&quot; asked Adrian, looking
around.
<P>
&quot;I dunno,&quot; replied Courtney, also scanning for the stray
they'd recently adopted.  After a few moments Adrian whistled
and the mutt promptly bounded out from behind a petrified tree
trunk and ran over to the two children, wanting to play.
<P>
A quick check of the ground revealed a stick that was actually
<I>wood</I>.  Adrian picked it up as Courtney located the petrified
tree that'd been supplying them with souvenir-stand chips and
started banging away.
<P>
&quot;Wanna fetch the stick, boy?&quot; Adrian asked the dog,
showing the stick to the animal, which barked enthusiastically
in response.  Adrian flung the stick away and the dog bounded
off after it.
<P>
&quot;Next trip out here, we switch places,&quot; said Courtney,
pausing to look up from the hammer blows she was raining on the
chunk of petrified wood.
<P>
Adrian shrugged in reply.  That suited him well enough.  When
you thought about it, things weren't really all that bad.  In
fact, they even had some things to be thankful for...
<P>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
<B>....a Roadside, Somewhere in Carter County...</B>
<P>
&quot;I thought the Tank was supposed to be indestructible,&quot;
said Trent, searching-around under the hood for something he recognized.
<P>
&quot;It <I>is</I>,&quot; insisted Max, &quot;it's just not <I>running</I>
right now, that's all.  It's not <I>destroyed </I>or anything<I>.</I>&quot;
<P>
Trent tucked his hands under his arms and looked up from he and
Max's work. 
<P>
<I>It's a good thing we brought jackets,</I> he thought as he
watched the fat, fluffy flakes of snow from the front that was
blowing through beginning to fall.  The Tank had failed them,
as it occasionally did, on their way to Mystic Spiral's latest
gig.  They'd get it running again soon, they always did, but still...
<P>
&quot;Hey, you guys, <I>snow!</I>&quot; called Nick, demonstrating
his usual flawless grasp of the obvious.
<P>
&quot;Cool,&quot; said Jesse.
<P>
&quot;Look, you guys -- a snow angel!&quot; said Nick, and threw
himself backwards onto the still-mostly-bare ground with a resounding
<I>thud.</I>
<P>
&quot;I think it'd work better if you waited 'til there was more
snow on the ground,&quot; said Trent.
<P>
&quot;Ow! I think I might've gave myself a concussion or something,&quot;
complained Nick.
<P>
&quot;Cool,&quot; said Jesse.
<P>
Trent looked along the road, towards where the Spiral had been
headed when the Tank broke down.  This wasn't so bad, but he'd
much rather be on stage performing.  There or...
<P>
Trent turned and looked back the way they'd come, back toward...
<P>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
<B>....Lawndale.</B>
<P>
&quot;Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Check.  Well, a kiln's close
enough to an oven, anyway, I guess, and it should be close enough
to that temperature by now.  Peel back foil over dessert portion.
 Now how'm I supposed to tell which one's the dessert without
peeling it <I>all</I> off?&quot;thought Jane aloud.
<P>
She looked up from what she was doing, out the kitchen window.
 She could see the snowflakes falling outside, as they had been
since right around sunset.  The faint, ghostly outline of the
gazebo was just visible in the backyard, highlit here and there
with brighter patches of white where the snow had begun to stick.
 Jane changed her focus to the pale image of a dark-haired young
woman in the glass of the kitchen window.  One end of her mouth
turned upwards in a smirk.
<P>
&quot;Hey Janey,&quot; she asked her reflection, &quot;didn't
somebody say something once about being careful what you wish
for?&quot;
<P>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
&quot;The more debased they [the holidays] become, the less reason
there is to celebrate them.  That means the less reason for my
family to get together until <I>presto</I> I'm finally alone on
Thanksgiving with a TV dinner.&quot;  -- Jane Lane, &quot;Depth
