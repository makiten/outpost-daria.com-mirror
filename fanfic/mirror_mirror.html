<p>"Captain, my sensors are picking up a strange disturbance," Mr. Sulu said.

<p>"What is it, Sulu?" asked Kirk.

<p>"Sir, I believe we're approaching a crossover field."

<p>"All, right, Mr. Sulu. Go to half impulse. Chekhov, power phasers and raise shields. Spock, I want

a complete analysis. Lieutenant Uhura, take us to Yellow Alert." Kirk punched

the comm button. "Attention, all hands, we are approaching a crossover. Brace yourselves. Kirk out."

<p>Okay, now you've been warned. It's a crossover, of a kind, but there's also a plot of some sort in

this fic, too. I've really tried to avoid making it completely incomprehensible by making only general

refs. In other words, it's not vital that you see the original Star Trek ep, "Mirror, Mirror," that

inspired this, uh, work, but it sure would make some of the jokes a little funnier. Thumbnail sketch:

Kirk et. al. are accidentally switched with the evil Kirk et. al. in their respective universes.

It's all about our evil/violent/vengeful nature, and how we deal with it in everyday life.

There'll be more info in the Notes.

<p>You can also be assured that although this is my first crossover, it will also be my last. This little

ep has given me no end of headaches. From here on out, they'll all deal with conventional plotlines.

I promise. Really. I mean it.

<p>Yes, it's in a modified teleplay format again. The "Cut to" lines are not properly positioned, but

that's a minor annoyance, considering the pain it would be to code that in HTML. It's not perfect,

but if anyone actually ever wants to actually produce this, then I promise that I'll fix it for them. (Yeah,

right. I'll take my chances of getting hit by a meteorite -- they're better than the chances of anyone

ever actually wanting me to fix this up for them to produce it.)

<p>WS of the FRONT of the SCHOOL, POV HEAD-ON. A bell rings, and a locker door slams.



<p>INT. LAWNDALE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY LOCKERS - DAY - 1 SECOND LATER.



<p>WS of the LOCKERS, POV ACROSS THE
HALL. DARIA is standing in front of her open locker, putting away her
books for the day, and grabbing a few for the evening. <p>CUT TO CU of DARIA SAME POV
INSIDE OF LOCKER. (SHOT only of Head &amp; Shoulders.) UPCHUCK walks
through the frame with an especially reptilian grin on his face. As he
walks past DARIA, she jumps, yells, drops her books, and whirls around,
all at the same time. UPCHUCK is nowhere to be seen.
<p>CUT TO MS of DARIA, POV ACROSS THE HALL. DARIA starts picking up her books, and she looks furious.



<p>JANE walks up to DARIA.

<blockquote> Guess. </blockquote>



<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>

<blockquote> Hm, well, let's see, your
books are scattered all over the floor and you look ready to kill. So,
either you've finally had it with reading and you've decided to join
the fashion stazi, or Upchuck struck again. </blockquote>



<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<blockquote> That makes it the third time today. I'll have to think of something special to get even with him. </blockquote>



<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>

<blockquote> We could always hire some goons to stuff him in his locker. </blockquote>



<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<center><p> (Considers it.) </center>

<blockquote> Hm. (Beat.) No, too cliché. Besides,
I want something a little more lingering, and I don't know if stuffing
him in his locker is suitably horrible enough. </blockquote>



<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>

<blockquote> The trouble with Upchuck is that he's the sort of person who loves attention. Any kind of attention. </blockquote>



<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<blockquote> That may be true, but I'm the sort of person who likes to take revenge on his sort of person. </blockquote>



<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>

<blockquote> Maybe we can come up with some exotic ideas Friday Night. </blockquote>



<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<blockquote> Oh, yeah, is the Star Trek marathon still on? </blockquote>



<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>

<p>INT. LAWNDALE HIGH - STUDY HALL - NEXT DAY.



<p>MS of DARIA, POV SIDE, sitting in
at her desk, reading a book. SHOT is from above the waist. UPCHUCK
walks by DARIA'S desk, and suddenly falls forward.
<center><p><b> UPCHUCK </b></center><br>

<blockquote> Whooaaaaugh! </blockquote>



<p>DARIA looks up from her book, titled "Revenge Made Easy," smiles to herself, then goes back to reading.



<p>UPCHUCK groans.



<p>DISSOLVE TO:



<p>INT. LAWNDALE HIGH - CAFETERIA - DAY.



<p>MS of UPCHUCK sitting at a table by
himself POV HEAD ON. DARIA walks by with a tray of food from left to
right. She "trips" and dumps steaming hot clam chowdah all over
Upchuck.
<center><p><b> UPCHUCK </b></center><br>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<blockquote> Civilization 2, cretins nothing. </blockquote>

<center><p> (Out Loud. At first, contrite, but slowly getting madder, until she grinds her teeth on the last words.) </center>

<blockquote> Whoops! I'm sorry, Upchuck, I guess
I really should pay more attention to where I put my hands. You know,
everyone should really pay more attention to what they may try to grab.
They just might wind up regretting it. (Beat.) For a lifetime. </blockquote>



<p>INT. JANE'S ROOM - NIGHT.



<p>MS of JANE'S ROOM, POV TV. DARIA and JANE are seated on the bed, watching TV.



<center><p><b> REDSHIRT </b></center><br>

<center><p> (OS from TV.) </center> <blockquote> Look out, Captain! It's coming right at you! </blockquote>



<p>The sound of an old-fashioned 1960's era Star
Trek phaser being fired is heard. REDSHIRT screams as something
suitably gruesome happens to him.
<center><p><b> DR. McCOY </b></center><br>

<center><p>(OS from TV.)</center><blockquote> My God, Jim, look at him! </blockquote>



<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>

<blockquote> Would that be gruesome enough for Upchuck? </blockquote>



<p>JANE points at the TV with the remote and hits the MUTE button.



<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<center><p> (Considers it.) </center>

<blockquote> No, it was over with too quickly.
Besides, where would I find a big rubber monster to suffocate him with?
I want to make sure he doesn't forget this lesson. </blockquote>



<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>

<center><p> (A little surprised.) </center>

<blockquote> Jeez, Daria, don't you think you've already made your point with Upchuck? I mean, you <i>did</i> dump hot clam chowder all over him. I don't think he'll forget <i>that</i> anytime soon. </blockquote>



<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<blockquote> I don't know. I guess I'm
still mad about the whole thing. Life's bad enough as it is without
creeps like Upchuck making it any worse. I want to make sure that the
lesson sticks, because I don't want to have to go through all of this
again in a month, right after he gets his creep suit dry cleaned. </blockquote>



<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>

<blockquote> Tell you what. Why don't we wait and if he tries it again, <i>I'll</i> buy the clam chowder. It'll be my treat. Till then, let's not waste any more time plotting revenge on that loser. </blockquote>



<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<blockquote> Okay, but I still get to dump it on his head. </blockquote>



<p>CUT TO CU of the DOOR. Someone knocks at the door.



<p>CUT TO MS POV DOOR.



<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>

<blockquote> C'mon in. </blockquote>



<p>CUT BACK TO CU of DOOR. The door opens, revealing TRENT, holding a pizza box, with a 6-pack of soda on top.



<center><p><b> TRENT </b></center><br>

<blockquote> Your pizza's here. </blockquote>



<p>CUT TO MS of JANE'S ROOM, POV SIDE WALL. TRENT walks over to the bed and hands the pizza box and sodas to JANE.



<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>

<blockquote> Cool. Thanks for bringing it up. </blockquote>



<center><p><b> TRENT </b></center><br>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<center><p><b> TRENT </b></center><br>

<blockquote> So, what are you two up to? </blockquote>



<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>

<blockquote> It's a "Star Trek" marathon. You know, the old "Star Trek." We figured we'd catch it while we still can. </blockquote>



<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<blockquote> Yeah, it's inspiring to see
Shatner's toupee in its natural habitat. And who can forget their
creative use of Vaseline as a lens filter? </blockquote>



<center><p><b> TRENT </b></center><br>

<center><p> (Chuckles.) </center>

<blockquote> True, but "Star Trek" always left me cold. I guess I just couldn't get into it. But don't let me stop you from your fun. </blockquote>



<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>

<blockquote> Okay, see you later. </blockquote>



<p>TRENT walks out of the room and closes the door behind him.



<p>CUT TO CU of JANE as she opens the pizza box.



<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>

<p>CUT TO CU of JANE and DARIA, POV BACK WALL.



<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<blockquote> What do you mean? </blockquote>



<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>

<blockquote> Whenever I used to order
pizza, it was impossible to get it past Trent before he'd eat half of
it. For such a skinny guy, I swear he eats like a pig. </blockquote> <center><p> (Grins.) </center> <blockquote> Anyway, I finally discovered a topping combination that he won't touch. </blockquote>



<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<center><p>(Suspiciously.)</center> <blockquote> And just what <i>is</i> your secret combination? </blockquote>



<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>

<center><p> (Grins.) </center> <blockquote> Pineapples, jalapeno peppers, anchovies, capers, onions, garlic cloves, and mandarin oranges. </blockquote>



<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<center><p> (Repulsed.) </center>

<blockquote> Yuck. Now I understand why he won't touch it. (Beat.) Let me guess-- vampire problems again, or is it wolfmen this time? </blockquote>



<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>

<blockquote> No, it's actually not too bad. (Grimaces.) Although I have to admit that it took me awhile to get used to it. </blockquote>



<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<blockquote> Uh-huh. And what did you get to drink with this lovely collection of trash can pickings? </blockquote>



<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>

<blockquote> Ah, this is the best part! </blockquote> <center><p> (JANE holds up the 6-pack.) (Smiles.) </center> <blockquote> I got root beer. </blockquote>



<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<blockquote> Root Beer? With <i>that</i>? </blockquote>



<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>

<blockquote> Daria, if there's one person I know really well, it's my brother. He hates the stuff. </blockquote> <center><p> (JANE pulls two cans from the 6-pack.) </center> <blockquote> Sometimes you just have to learn to enjoy life wherever you can, and work around the tough parts. </blockquote>



<p>JANE hands DARIA a can. DARIA takes the can from JANE.



<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<center><p> (Sighs.) </center>

<p>CUT TO MS POV TV.

<blockquote> Can I get back to you on that one? </blockquote>



<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>

<p>DISSOLVE TO:



<p>INT. JANE'S ROOM - SAME DAY - LATE NIGHT - A FEW HOURS LATER.



<p>SAME MS. JANE and DARIA are now
sprawled on the bed, surrounded by empty cans and an empty pizza box.
Each has a hand on her stomach.
<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<center><p> (Groans.) </center> <blockquote> Ugh, now I know why Trent won't touch that stuff. Or why starving coyotes won't touch that stuff, either. </blockquote>



<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>

<center><p> (Groans.) </center> <blockquote> Funny, it's never been this bad before. It must've been that third root beer that made it worse. </blockquote>



<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<center><p> (Sits up.) </center> <blockquote> Well, Bones, do you have anything for a bad stomach? </blockquote>



<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>

<center><p> (Sits up.) </center> <blockquote> Sure, let me grab the ol' reliable. </blockquote>



<p>JANE grabs a bottle of antacid tablets from
the bedside table, takes one, chews on it, sighs in relief, and hands
the bottle to DARIA, who takes the bottle from JANE, takes a tablet and
chews it.
<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<center><p> (Relieved.) </center> <blockquote> Mmmm. Much better. </blockquote>



<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>

<blockquote> <i>Now</i> I remember why I keep that bottle of antacids close to the bed. </blockquote>

<blockquote> You mean you have to do this every time? </blockquote>



<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>

<center><p> (Shrugs.) </center>

<blockquote> Yeah, but it means more pizza for me. Come on, let's get to bed. I'm so sleepy I can barely keep my eyes open. </blockquote>



<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<blockquote> Sounds like a plan to me. </blockquote>



<p>INT. JANE'S ROOM - NIGHT - A FEW MINUTES LATER.



<p>WS of JANE'S ROOM, POV
HALL-DOOR-SIDE LEFT CORNER-45 DEGREE ANGLE. JANE is sitting up in bed,
while DARIA is crawling into her sleeping bag, sans glasses.
<p>CUT TO CU JANE.



<center><p><b> JANE </b></center><br>

<blockquote> Ready for Morpheus? </blockquote>



<p>CUT TO CU DARIA.

<p>DISSOLVE TO:



<p>INT. DARIA'S ROOM - MORNING.



<p>CU of DARIA, POV SIDE, as she wakes up. She reaches for her glasses on the nightstand and puts them on. She looks surprised.



<p>ZOOM OUT TO WS of DARIA'S ROOM. It
has changed. Instead of the padded cell walls, the walls are now normal
white walls, but covered with all sorts of nasty-looking sharp weapons.
The rug has been replaced with a bear-skin rug, and there is a large
weight lifting apparatus in the corner.
<p>CUT TO XCU DARIA.



<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<center><p> (Surprised. Eyes get big.) </center> <blockquote> What happened to my room? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> QUINN </b></center><br>

<center><p> (OS. Timidly.) </center> <blockquote> Daria, can I come in? </blockquote>



<p>CUT TO MS of DARIA, now seated upright in bed
POV DOOR. She looks down, and realizes that she's wearing her usual
orange t-shirt under some sort of green sleeveless leather vest with a
device over the left breast. The device is a badge of some sort-- it
consists of an image of two crossed lightning bolts, covered by the
planet Earth. Over the right breast of the vest is a series of randomly
placed medals of some sort. She's also wearing a wide silver cloth belt
(a sash sort of thing). To say that DARIA is surprised is a gross
understatement. She pulls off the cover to reveal a pair of black pants
and big boots (old "Star Trek" style, natch -- no laces, almost
knee-high, over-the-pants style).
<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<center><p> (Surprised.) </center>

<blockquote> What the hell? </blockquote>



<p>QUINN knocks at the door again.



<center><p><b> QUINN </b></center><br>

<center><p> (A little distracted by the changes in her surroundings.) </center>

<blockquote> Huh? What? Yeah, sure, Quinn, come on in. I could use some answers. </blockquote>



<p>CUT TO WS of DARIA'S ROOM. The door flings
open, and a bedraggled, bespectacled QUINN rushes into the room and
hastily genuflects before DARIA on the bear-skin rug. QUINN'S hair is
disheveled (kind of a wad of hair just plopped on and pulled back in a
ragged bun), she is wearing a drab gray coverall-- with a v-neck and a
black shirt underneath (old "Star Trek" style, of course), no makeup,
and a pair of thick-rimmed coke-bottle glasses.
<center><p><b> QUINN </b></center><br>

<center><p> (Beseeching.) </center> <blockquote> Please accept my apologies for disturbing your rest, but Dad wants a word with you before he leaves for work. </blockquote>

<blockquote> Quinn, what's wrong with you? Get up. Did you redecorate my bedroom in the "Lothar of the Hill People" style? </blockquote> <center><p> (Beat. QUINN doesn't respond.) </center> <blockquote> Quinn? </blockquote>



<p>QUINN looks up.



<center><p><b> QUINN </b></center><br>

<center><p> (Confused and concerned.) </center> <blockquote> I'm sorry, but I don't know anything about this Lothar person of which you speak. </blockquote>



<p>DARIA closes her eyes, trying to be patient.



<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<center><p> (Sighs.) </center> <blockquote> Why am I in this ridiculous outfit? </blockquote>



<center><p><b> QUINN </b></center><br>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<blockquote> Uniform? Quinn, what are you talking about? And what's going on here? Is this your idea of a stupid joke? </blockquote>



<center><p><b> QUINN </b></center><br>

<center><p> (Still confused.) </center>

<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<center><p> (Sighs in frustration. Puts a hand to her forehead.) </center>

<blockquote> Never mind. Let's just go and see what Dad wants. I'm already getting a headache. Might as well make it worse. </blockquote>



<p>DARIA gets up from the bed and starts to head towards the door.



<center><p><b> QUINN </b></center><br>

<blockquote> Wait! You almost forgot your Agonizer&#8482;! </blockquote>



<p>QUINN points to a small golden rod on the nightstand.



<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<blockquote> My what? </blockquote>



<center><p><b> QUINN </b></center><br>

<blockquote> Your Agonizer&#8482;. Dad would kill us if you forgot it! </blockquote>



<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<blockquote> Quinn, what are you talking about? </blockquote>



<center><p><b> QUINN </b></center><br>

<blockquote> Daria, how could you forget?
Whenever you're outside the house, you've got to have your Agonizer&#8482;
with you. You can't ever forget Dad's position, and how his rivals
would love to make an example of his eldest daughter who had forgotten
such a basic security rule. </blockquote>

<p>INT. MORGENDORFFER KITCHEN - MORNING - A FEW MINUTES LATER.



<p>WS of KITCHEN POV BACK WALL (BEHIND
TABLE.) JAKE is obscured by a newspaper that he is reading. HELEN is
wearing a 50's-period house dress, apron, pearls, a Jackie-O hair style
(or 50's Mary Tyler Moore), and a vacant stare. She is frying something
in a skillet. DARIA, followed by QUINN, enters from the LIVING ROOM.
DARIA now has her Agonizer&#8482; on her right hip.
<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<p>CUT TO CU of JAKE (still behind newspaper).
JAKE lowers the newspaper. He is wearing a black leather vest, similar
to DARIA'S, with gold trim, a gold belt, and a similar decal over the
left breast. (The lightning bolt/planet thing.) He also has quite a few
medals scattered over his right breast at odd angles. JAKE now has a
short Fu-Manchu-type beard (think Spock in "Mirror, Mirror"), and a
weird look in his eyes ... almost resembling intelligence. But not
quite.
<center><p><b> JAKE </b></center><br>

this particular JAKE.
<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<center><p><b> JAKE </b></center><br>

<center><p> (Still cheerful.) </center>

<blockquote> Well, I hope it won't interfere with

its weekly maintenance! We can't let our enemies get a foothold! And
don't forget to recharge the guns! Especially the big ones! </blockquote>

<p>DARIA moves to sit down at her usual seat.
QUINN intercepts her and pulls out her chair for DARIA, and holds it as
DARIA sits down, still unnerved. QUINN then stands behind DARIA'S chair
attentively.
<p>HELEN swirls around and presents DARIA with a covered plate with a flourish.



<p>CUT TO XCU PLATE. With another
flourish, HELEN removes the lid, revealing a breakfast consisting of
actual breakfast foods-- namely two eggs, sunny-side up and a bacon
smile.

coffee, Helen! You serve us all well. And as you serve us, you serve

<p>JAKE kisses HELEN in a Ward Cleaver
sort of way and heads out the side door. HELEN heads over to the sink
and starts hand-washing a dish.

and a long saw-edged dagger would be just perfect with that outfit. </blockquote>

back on a battle, unless you would have an enemy plunge a knife into
it." "Maybe you can, maybe you can't. It's all a question of how much
you desire to get that next promotion." And, "If you love something,
kill it before it makes you weak, or turn it into a weapon to use
against your enemies." On the board are some notes from COACH O'NEILL'S
classes, saying things like, "Direct thrust upward, under the ribs,
right to the heart," "Groin kick followed by blow behind the head,"
"Quick kill = Safe kill," and "Battle Strategies-- whom to kill first?
Your enemies in battle, or your rivals in your own unit? Never overlook
an opportunity for glory, but also never overlook an opportunity for a

<center><p><b> BRITTANY </b></center><br>

<blockquote> I do have an understanding of
all of the basic relevant theories. The current theory is that by
focusing a large amount of ionic energy into a properly-designed
matrix, a local disruption in space-time can be forged. With proper
adjustments to the energy field, one could conceivably manipulate
space-time enough to leave their universe of origin and enter one of
many parallel universes. </blockquote>

<blockquote> Okay, but how would you know how to get back to your proper universe of origin? </blockquote>



<center><p><b> BRITTANY </b></center><br>

<blockquote> Oh, it's simple. You just set
the device to match the resonance frequencies of the strings that
comprise your subatomic particles with the resonance frequencies of the
universe you need to get to. Since each universe has its own unique
resonance frequencies, you just have to match 'em up! </blockquote>

<blockquote> And what would happen if your strings didn't resonate at the right frequency? </blockquote>



<center><p><b> BRITTANY </b></center><br>

<blockquote> Well, that's tough to
predict. It all depends on how great the dissonance is. I would guess
that after a while, your strings would eventually match the strings of
the universe you're in, but until then, I'd bet that you'd feel pretty
lousy. </blockquote>



<center><p><b> DARIA </b></center><br>

<blockquote> That at least explains that. </blockquote>

<blockquote> Yeah, but Brittany, what happens when your strings match the dominant resonance frequency? </blockquote>

<center><p><b> BRITTANY </b></center><br>

<center><p> (Lost in thought. Twirls her hair around her little finger.) </center> <blockquote>
Hm. (Beat.) I'd guess about 3 days. But maybe less if the person were
to eat the food in the other universe. As the body takes in new
nutrients, it'd incorporate the new strings as well. So that person'd
better not eat. </blockquote>

<p>FADE OUT.



<p>ROLL CREDITS to the music of "Twilight Zone" by Golden Earring. (What else did you expect for this ep.?)

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>


<p> Okay, here are the notes. If you have further questions, or just want to yell at me for using a

dream as a basis for a crossover (okay, so it's a little weak as a premise),

 <a href="mailto:rich@paperpusher.simplenet.com">email</a> me. And, hey, if you liked it, definitely email

 me. I hope these notes clear up any questions you may have. (And, yes, I still promise to never

 do a crossover again.)



<p>The font I used in the titles is a font called "Trek," that I picked up somewhere

a while ago-- I always wanted to use it. The font for the little Paperpusher Dude is Trebuchet. All of

the graphics were either created in Illustrator, Photoshop, or NetObjects Fusion. The planet thingy

with the lightning bolts is the same one you'd see all over the place if the ep ever aired. (Yes,

I know that in the "Star Trek" ep they used a big dagger/sword instead of lightning bolts. Only a true

Trek Geek would point that out. I'd already done the design before I saw the ep for the first time

in about 10 years-- all I could remember was the planet and something thrusting through it, so I used

lightning bolts.)



<p>Nares: The external openings of the nostrils. Ha, made you learn something.



<p>Curly Joe Derita: My favorite Stooge. He was the best of the Curlies, IMO.



<p>Redshirts: You know, the guys who always bite the dust in the "Star Trek" eps.



<p>Vaseline Filters: In the old "Star Trek," they used that technique a lot to make everyone look a little

younger. Cheaper than having ILM do it, I guess.



<p>Pizza toppings: I had planned to just use pineapples &amp; jalapenos, as that combo alone grosses me

out (a friend of mine used it in high school &amp; college so that no one would eat her pizza-- it

worked), but everyone told me I had to make it grosser. So I did.



<p>Clamato: A disgusting drink consisting of tomatoes, other veggies, and clam juice. Yuk.



<p>"I'm so sleepy I can barely keep my eyes open." Alright, MSTies, which MST3K ep does that line come

from? (Hint: it's from one of the Comedy Central eps.) Geek check!



<p>Uniforms: The uniforms that everyone wears in the alternate universe in the ep, well, they're

all variations of what Kirk wore

while he was aboard the Imperial Starship Enterprise, except with undershirts added for modesty's

sake. The lower-level students wear nondescript coveralls, again, just like in the old "Star Trek"

series.



<p>Lothar of the Hill People: An old SNL sketch starring Mike Myers as Lothar, a barbarian from the

time before history. Pretty funny stuff, actually.



<p>Agonizer&#8482;: Directly from the "Star Trek" ep. It does pretty much what it says. You may have

also heard it used on an old MST3K ep, as well. I'm not the first person to have fun with this

"Star Trek" ep, and I doubt I'll be the last.



<p>Fu-Manuchu Fu (As Joe Bob would call it): In the original ep, the way to tell the good Spock

 from the evil spock was that the evil Spock had a Fu-Manchu beard. So I gave them to Jake and

 Upchuck as an <i>hommage</i>.



<p>What did you do to Helen? Well, I have to admit that I was slightly influenced by the caricature

that they ran in the Season Two credits.



<p>Dilithium&#8482;: Again, from the ep. Both Kirks were sent to a planet in order to negotiate a

dilithium&#8482; mining agreement. I made Jake the administrator.



<p>The speech that Other Daria gives to Quinn at the end of Act I is also a play on the line the evil

 Kirk uses on the good Spock when the good Spock has the evil Kirk locked up right away when the

 evil Kirk accidentally beams aboard the Enterprise. The same fate is in store for the Other Daria.



<p>I smell Fire: Wonder why Jane called herself "Fire?" Well, I was in a parking lot, and I got

inspired. I'll admit that I probably should've buried that Creative Impulse, but,

hey, life's short, and I couldn't think of any other way to get a character in

there called "Fire Lane."



<p>Combat Skills Sign: A riff on the sign on the door in "Esteemsters." Remember, in a violent

universe, you're only as good as your butt-kickin' skills are.



<p>Pain Amplifier&#8482;: Okay, that came straight out of <i>Dune</i>. It works like an Agonizer&#8482;,

only it's big enough to spend the rest of your life in. (The Guild warned the Emperor that he'd

spend the rest of his life in one if he messed up Spice production.) Geek check!



<p>Maybe You Can: A riff on the "Yes I Can" poster in Mr. O'Neill's classroom.



<p>"Allowed to carry weapons:" Well, people without rank aren't allowed to carry weapons. My

Universe (sort of), My Rules.



<p>DeMartino &amp; Ms. Li? They don't change at all. The other Mr. O'Neill finally gave in to the

demons that tormented him as an unpopular youth, and by redirecting those feelings through violence,

he managed to achieve great things in the evil universe. Unlike the real Mr. O'Neill, who is

desperately trying to keep all of his demons bottled up through denial, while they slowly eat

away his soul.



<p>Junk Science: I took great liberties with the science (hey, "Star Trek" does it, why can't I?).

The "ionic interference" came straight from the "Star Trek" ep -- it's what caused the original flip-flop.

I took the idea of String Theory and butchered it pretty well to suit my own purposes. From what

I remember about it from a lecture a few years ago when I was half-asleep,

according to String Theory, all subatomic particles are eventually composed of 3 different kinds

 of "strings," as they're called. Each string "vibrates"

at a different frequency, and therefore has different properties. As strings are combined, they form

different subatomic particles. Of course, the Big Flaw in the theory is that strings are so small

that they defy detection. (<i>See</i> Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.) The whole thing about

resonance frequencies, well, I made it up.



<p>Brittany &amp; Kevin: C'mon, you can't say that you didn't see that coming.



<p>"Blah, blah, blah ...": So I ran short on ideas. Everyone hits a dry spell.



<p>Weapon Collection: In a brutal world, it's kinda like showing someone your "etchings." If

you still don't know what I mean, ask someone about 10 years older.



<p>"Woooow!": Brittany says it the same way she said it at the flower display in "I Don't."



<p>Gratuitous Trent: I love to tweak the TEB/anti-TEB crowd, and it

actually might lead to something down the road. But don't even ask me what, cause I won't tell you.

(Needless to say, it will be a surprise-- you won't expect it, so don't even <i>try</i> to predict

where this might wind up. Translation: I have NO idea of what I'm gonna do with it yet.)



<p>As for the pudding ref, that actually came from an old saying we had in band, "There's always room

for Jell-O!" It usually referred to the little Jell-O shooters that helped to ease the pain of losing

college football games by huge, lopsided scores. We sat there in an almost empty stadium, in the

rain a few times, and watched a certain major college FB team go 1-10, while we wore tacky polyester

uniforms. I'd rather watch surgery. I just decided to riff on the Jell-O ref.



<p>Poor Upchuck: Okay, I'll admit that I beat up on Upchuck a lot in this ep, but I tried to make him

deserve it as much as possible. The ep was trying to express the idea that while revenge may be fun,

it does debase you somewhat by bringing you down to the other person's level. It's one of those

Important Lessons, but I didn't intend to beat everyone over the head with it.



<p>All a Dream!?! That's Weak!: No, it isn't. I set it up that way from the beginning. If you were

paying attention, I spelled it all out in big letters. Take a "Star Trek" marathon, an evil pizza,

recent frustrations from a certain creep, add 'em all up, and you get a weird-ass dream. That's all

this is, just a weird-ass dream that lets Daria think a little about maybe not wasting so much

energy on revenge.



<p>Updates: 11.1.98-- Fixed a bunch of misspellings.
