"Mole? Somebody get me a dermatologist!"<br>
by Belle Book<br>
<br>
Chapter 4<br>
<br>
Scene One -- Albertville, France<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): Previously on Teen Mole -- Raul had to predict whether the other seven contestants would complete or fail a skiing challenge in Les Deux Alpes. (We see Raul being given his assignment, then we see Mark skiing down the slope.) Keith's attitude toward Daria causes people to get really mad at him. (We see Violet calling Keith on his comment after Daria fell on the slopes.) Daria finally gets so tired of Keith, she takes revenge on him when the contestants have to balloon their way from Grenoble to Albertville for money. (We see Daria blow the dart into Heather and Keith's balloon.) Not only that, the other contestants help her pull a later prank on Keith. (We see Keith get slime dumped on him.) In the end, Heather gets an exemption, and Keith gets the shock of his life when he becomes the Mole's third victim. (We then see Keith's reaction when he gets the red thumbprint.)<br>
<br>
The James-Bond type music returns as Abby continues.<br>
<br>
Abby: Ten contestants. One winner. Each one attempting to win a jackpot up to 1 million dollars. However, one of the contestants has been hired by the producers to sabotage the game. That someone is the Mole. Each round, the contestants have to take a quiz. Whoever knows the least about the Mole will be executed and must leave the game immediately. Who is the Mole?<br>
<br>
We then see clips of Fern, Raul, Daria, Tom, Heather, Violet, and Mark. As the credits run, we see several people doing their confessionals.<br>
<br>
Tom: Keith, the jerk, is gone from the game. I think everyone's happy about that.<br>
<br>
Mark: Keith brought down group morale big-time. With him gone, maybe we'll be more of a team.<br>
<br>
Violet: We all had a special celebration once Keith was gone. Even Daria took part in it.<br>
<br>
Heather: Getting an exemption was worth it. I got to sit back and watch Keith get what was coming to him!<br>
<br>
Fern: With Keith gone, we can pretty much eliminate Daria as a suspect. As far as I could tell, she was his only suspect.<br>
<br>
Daria: Army boots: 31.87 euros. Green jacket: 27.89 euros. The look on Keith's face when he got the red thumbprint: priceless.<br>
<br>
We now cut to the breakfast room in the Hotel Million the next day. Abby and the seven remaining contestants are eating breakfast.<br>
<br>
Abby: It seems quite a bit more cheerful now that Keith's gone from the game.<br>
<br>
Violet: It sure is! With Keith gone, there'll be fewer confrontations, with Daria or with anyone else.<br>
<br>
Abby: Incidentally, Daria is a sarcastic girl, but it seems that everyone else rallied around her.<br>
<br>
Mark: We might not have, if Keith hadn't been disrupting the group with his antics.<br>
<br>
Tom: And as for Daria, she may be sarcastic but she's very smart.<br>
<br>
Daria smiled slightly at that.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, you've earned $195,000 for the pot. Once breakfast is over, pack your bags -- for you're going to Geneva, Switzerland!<br>
<br>
As everyone (except Daria) reacts by cheering, we hear several people doing interviews.<br>
<br>
Heather: As soon as we learned that we were going to Switzerland, I nearly flipped! Its mountainous terrain will probably remind me of home to some degree.<br>
<br>
Mark: It'll be interesting to go to Geneva. Many international agreements were worked out there, and it's the headquarters of a number of international organizations.<br>
<br>
Daria: I think Mark missed his true calling. He should've gone into International Relations. He's a born peacemaker.<br>
<br>
We then see a clip of the people packing their bags, and then we hear Abby continue.<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): So as soon as we were done breakfast, we packed our bags, got in the two vans, and went straight to Geneva, Switzerland. (We see an arrow heading from Albertville to Geneva.) Once there, we went to the Hotel d'Angleterre, where we checked in for four days, then had lunch in the Windows cafe before heading out to our next location: the Palace of Nations, where our next challenge would be done.<br>
<br>
*************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 2: Palace of Nations, Geneva<br>
<br>
Abby and the seven contestants are standing outside the building.<br>
<br>
Abby: Hello, everyone. Our next challenge is going to test all your mental skills, especially those of one of you. For this challenge, I need one person who everyone thinks would make a great detective.<br>
<br>
Everyone points at Daria, who sighs and raises her hand.<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay, Daria, stand aside with the chaperone while I tell the others what they have to do. (Daria stands aside.) For the rest of you, you all have to play a variation of the board game "Clue". Does anyone know what "Clue" is about?<br>
<br>
Fern: I think I do. Isn't that the one where Mr. Boddy is murdered and the players have to figure out which suspect killed him, where Mr. Boddy was killed, and how he was killed?<br>
<br>
Abby: Very good, Fern. Yes, that's exactly it. And you will be the six suspects. Each of you will go into a room that's been arranged to look like the rooms in "Clue". You will be dressed as one of the following suspects: Miss Scarlet, Colonel Mustard, Mrs. White, Mr. Green, Mrs. Peacock, and Professor Plum. You have to decide which one you will be, then you will be given a script that will indicate what you have to say to Daria, the detective who will be investigating the murder of Mr. Boddy.<br>
<br>
As the contestants start talking, we hear Abby speak.<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): Once our contestants decide who will be which suspect and once they get their scripts, they will then enter the Palace of Nations, get fitted into clothes with the color of their suspect, and head to the room where they will be once Daria goes in.<br>
<br>
Within a half-hour, the contestants have decided who they will be, gotten their scripts, and headed inside. Abby then gets Daria.<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay, Daria, here's what you will do -- oh, here comes someone now.<br>
<br>
At this point, a man in uniform emerges from the entrance to the Palace of Nations. He joins Abby and Daria.<br>
<br>
Abby: Daria, this is Chief of Police Herman Mueller. He is investigating the murder of Mr. Boddy.<br>
<br>
Daria: This sounds vaguely familiar.<br>
<br>
Mueller: Hello, Daria. I got a call saying that Mr. Boddy had been found dead at about 4:00 yesterday afternoon outside of the Palace of Nations. He was murdered; however, the evidence indicates that he was not murdered in the location where he was found. There are six suspects, but I don't know which one committed the crime. However, you might, according to what Fraulein Carmichael says.<br>
<br>
Daria: And what am I supposed to do?<br>
<br>
Mueller: I want you to go inside and interview each of the six suspects. They will be in six of nine rooms. You must figure out which suspect did it, where the murder took place, and how Mr. Boddy was murdered.<br>
<br>
Daria (smirking): I get it. And I suppose my prediction should go something like "I say Miss Scarlet did it, in the lounge, with the candlestick"?<br>
<br>
Mueller (surprised): That's it!<br>
<br>
Abby: And here's an added incentive. If you make the correct prediction, not only will $20,000 be added to the pot, but you will earn an exemption. But if you fail, no money will be added to the pot, and the real murderer will get the exemption.<br>
<br>
Daria (confessional): One of the games I played with my parents when Quinn and I were grounded was Clue. (1) I beat them every time. (She smirks.)<br>
<br>
We then see Daria enter into the Palace of Nations. She sees a placard telling her where the rooms were.<br>
<br>
Daria (smirking): How convenient.<br>
<br>
Daria walked over to the lounge. She opened the door, and heard soft music. Relaxing in a lounge chair was Heather, dressed as Mrs. Peacock.<br>
<br>
Daria: Hello there. Are you Mrs. Peacock?<br>
<br>
Heather: I am. But who are you, and what do you want?<br>
<br>
Daria: I'm Daria, and I'm investigating the murder of Mr. Boddy yesterday afternoon, sometime between 1:00 and 4:00, according to Police chief Mueller.<br>
<br>
Heather: Oh. I will help you as much as possible. Unfortunately, I can't help you much.<br>
<br>
Daria (taking out a notebook and pen): Where were you between 1:00 and 4:00? Were you here?<br>
<br>
Heather: Not at first. After lunch, I went to the billiard room with Colonel Mustard.<br>
<br>
Daria: Do you like to play billiards?<br>
<br>
Heather: No. But my late husband loved to play billiards and taught me how to do so. Actually, Colonel Mustard usually plays with Professor Plum, but Professor Plum had a research paper to do in the study today. I was the only other person who knew how to play billiards, so I played it with Colonel Mustard from after lunch to 2:00. He beat me, as usual.<br>
<br>
Daria: What happened then?<br>
<br>
Heather: I began to feel a migraine coming on, so I left. I intended to go to the kitchen, get a glass of sangria, take my medication, then go to the lounge with my glass. Once there, I planned on turning on some soft music, finishing my glass, and then taking a nice, soothing nap. However, on the way to the kitchen, I met Mrs. White, who was heading to the conservatory. She went with me to the kitchen, and got the glass of sangria for me. Once she did so, I took my medication, left the kitchen, and came straight here.<br>
<br>
Daria: And you were there until the alarm broke out?<br>
<br>
Heather: Yes. In fact, I fell asleep very soon after finishing my glass, and woke up when the alarm broke out.<br>
<br>
Daria: Did anyone disturb you?<br>
<br>
Heather: No. I locked the door and put up a "Do Not Disturb" sign. Besides, I've had migraines here, so everyone knows not to disturb me once I get one of them.<br>
<br>
As Daria finishes writing, we hear Mark do a confessional.<br>
<br>
Mark: Heather played Mrs. Peacock as an aristocrat who spoke very grammatical English. She also gave very detailed info to Daria. I don't know if I would do the same if I was in her position.<br>
<br>
After thanking Heather for her info, Daria walked towards the dining room and peeked inside. No one was in it, so Daria continued to the kitchen.<br>
<br>
Daria (entering the kitchen): Hello? Is anyone here? (Someone pops out from behind a counter.)<br>
<br>
Fern (dressed as Mrs. White): Oh! Just me! I'll be right over! (She comes over to Daria.) I'm Mrs. White. Hear you might be investigating the murder of poor Mr. Boddy.<br>
<br>
Daria: I am.<br>
<br>
Fern (speaking rapidly): I had nothing to do with it, I swear!<br>
<br>
Daria: I'm not saying you did, Mrs. White. I'd just like to know where you were between 1:00 and 4:00.<br>
<br>
Fern: Flitting about. First went to the ballroom with Miz Scarlet and Mr. Green. They talked about the upcoming ballroom dancin competition while I dusted in there.<br>
<br>
Daria (writing in her notebook): They're in a ballroom dancing competition?<br>
<br>
Fern: Yeah. Once I was done in there, I left and went to the dining room. Got the plates, took them to the kitchen, then put them in the dishwasher to wash while I returned to the dining room to clean it. Once I was done there, I planned to go to the conservatory, when who should I see but Mrs. Peacock, on her way to the kitchen. She had a migraine, poor woman.<br>
<br>
Daria: What did you do then?<br>
<br>
Fern: What else? I took her to the kitchen, told her to sit down while I got her a nice cool glass of sangria, then gave her the glass. She took her medication, then left. I headed on to the conservatory and dusted there.<br>
<br>
Daria: I forgot to ask this, but could you give me exact times on this?<br>
<br>
Fern: Oh yeah! Silly me! I finished dusting the ballroom about 1:30, then took a few minutes getting the dishes from the dining room into the kitchen and into the dishwasher. It was about 1:40 when I started working in the dining room, and I must've been done shortly past 2:00. I arrived at the conservatory at about 2:10, and got done about 2:30. Then I went to the library, where I had to do a lot of dusting there. I finished at about 3:05, then went back to the kitchen, where I got the dishes out of the dishwasher, then had my tea break. I was in the kitchen when the alarm broke out.<br>
<br>
Daria: Did anyone come into any of the rooms while you were in them? Other than Mrs. Peacock, of course.<br>
<br>
Fern (thinking): No, but I do remember hearing somebody passing by the library shortly before 3:00. Must've been about two minutes before. Later, as I was finishing up, I remember looking at the open library door, and I saw Professor Plum passing by with a candlestick. But he didn't come in.<br>
<br>
Daria: Thank you for all your trouble.<br>
<br>
Fern: Any time. (We now hear Raul do his confessional.)<br>
<br>
Raul: Fern has some talent as an actress. She certainly acted like someone scared that she was going to be accused, and she spoke like a servant might.<br>
<br>
We then see Daria heading towards the ballroom. She stood in the doorway and looked in.<br>
<br>
Daria: Well, if Miss Scarlet and Mr. Green were in there, they aren't there now. (She heads over to the conservatory, where she peeks in.) Miss Scarlet?<br>
<br>
Violet (dressed as Miss Scarlet): Yes, that's me. Are you here to look at the conservatory? It's really beautiful.<br>
<br>
Daria: I agree, but I'm not here to look at it. I'm here to investigate the murder of Mr. Boddy.<br>
<br>
Violet: Oh yeah. I admit I wasn't too fond of the man, but I didn't kill him. However, if there's any way I can help you find out who did, I'll be happy to help you. Please sit down. (She motioned to a wicker table and some chairs.)<br>
<br>
Daria (sitting down): Were you here between 1:00 and 4:00?<br>
<br>
Violet: Not until 3:30. After lunch, I went to the ballroom with Mr. Green and Mrs. White. Mr. Green and I waited for Mrs. White to finish dusting and while we did, we talked abut the ballroom dancing competition we'll be competing in.<br>
<br>
Daria (writing in her notebook): What number were you going to perform?<br>
<br>
Violet: We were going to perform "Copacabana," sung by Barry Manilow. It's a real fun number, and we both like it! In fact, once Mrs. White was done and left, we practiced it over and over, with breaks in between to catch our breath.<br>
<br>
Daria: Did anyone come in while you were in the ballroom?<br>
<br>
Violet (thinking): Wait a minute ... I think so ... yeah, I remember now. Professor Plum came in at 3:00. He said the lamp in the study went out and he needed a candlestick. Mr. Green got him one, then he left. About a half-hour later, we were done, so I went here, while Mr. Green went to the library.<br>
<br>
Daria (confessional): Violet was very helpful. Almost too helpful. However, unless the murder took place after 3:30, I'd be inclined to dismiss Miss Scarlet and Mr. Green as suspects. Of course, Mr. Green has to verify her alibi.<br>
<br>
Tom (confessional): Violet's very smart. I'd watch out for her. If she's not the Mole, she could easily win -- unless Daria's with her in the finals.<br>
<br>
Daria then entered the billiard room, where she spotted Mark, dressed as Colonel Mustard, checking out a shot on the billiard table.<br>
<br>
Daria: Are you Colonel Mustard?<br>
<br>
Mark (turning around): Oh! Yes, yes, of course. Are you here to play a game of billiards with me?<br>
<br>
Daria: No, I'm here to investigate the murder of Mr. Boddy. Where were you between 1:00 and 4:00?<br>
<br>
Mark: Here. I've been here the whole time.<br>
<br>
Daria (writing in her notebook): Alone?<br>
<br>
Mark: After 2:00, I was. Until then, Mrs. Peacock was with me. We played billiards until she developed a migraine. She then left to go to the kitchen and get her usual glass of sangria. I imagine she headed to the lounge after that and rested there.<br>
<br>
Daria: So after 2:00, you were in here, alone. Did anyone come in here while you were gone?<br>
<br>
Mark: No, but I heard someone passing by the billiard room twice. The first time was maybe a minute before 3:00, the second must've been a minute or two afterwards. I don't know.<br>
<br>
Daria: Did you see who it was?<br>
<br>
Mark: No, I had the door closed. I didn't want to be disturbed. Some of the shots I had to make were really, really tough. Those shots require plenty of concentration.<br>
<br>
As Daria continued to write, we heard Heather do her confessional.<br>
<br>
Heather: Daria's doing a great job interviewing others. She's got a great chance to get into the finals. As for Colonel Mustard, he could definitely be the murderer. He was alone for much of the time. But then again, so was I, so that doesn't mean much.<br>
<br>
We then see Daria in the library, talking to Tom, who's dressed as Mr. Green.<br>
<br>
Tom: Yes, Professor Plum came into the ballroom while Miss Scarlet and I were relaxing for a bit. He needed a candlestick because his lamp had gone out, and I got one for him. Once I gave him the candlestick, he left the ballroom.<br>
<br>
Daria (writing in her notebook): So when did you come to the library?<br>
<br>
Tom: I left the ballroom at 3:30. Once I came here, I picked up this interesting book about Carl Jung. (He shows it to her, as we hear Violet do her confessional.)<br>
<br>
Violet: Tom's very clever. I'm not certain if he's the Mole yet, but he's certainly one of my top suspects.<br>
<br>
Daria (confessional): Well, that's probably two less suspects I have to believe could have killed Mr. Boddy.<br>
<br>
Daria then heads to the study. There she sees Raul, dressed as Professor Plum.<br>
<br>
Daria: Professor Plum? I'm here to investigate the murder of Mr. Boddy.<br>
<br>
Raul (sighing): And I hoped you were here to discuss my research paper. It's so fascinating. Well, what do you want to know?<br>
<br>
Daria: Where were you between 1:00 and 4:00?<br>
<br>
Raul: I was here, alone.<br>
<br>
Daria: And you never left the study?<br>
<br>
Raul: No, unfortunately.<br>
<br>
Daria: And nobody came in while you were here?<br>
<br>
Raul: No. I'm sorry, but I can't help you.<br>
<br>
Daria (smiling slightly): That's okay. You might've been more help than you realized.<br>
<br>
As Raul stares in confusion, we hear Fern doing her confessional.<br>
<br>
Fern: I don't think the killer's going to get away with murder. Not with Daria on the case.<br>
<br>
Daria (confessional): Someone made a big slip. And I know who it is.<br>
<br>
***************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Abby: When we come back, the contestants have some fun seeing the sights of Geneva, a geography contest tests the skills of some of the contestants, two others have to play the role of thief, and we have our fourth execution.<br>
<br>
***************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 3: Outside the Palace of Nations.<br>
<br>
All seven contestants have rejoined Abby. The six who played the roles of suspects are still in costume.<br>
<br>
Abby: Hello, everyone. Daria, I have the coroner's report on Mr. Boddy. Specifically, I have the part which indicates the likely time of death.<br>
<br>
Daria (reading): He apparently died at about 3:10. How convenient. But I already know who killed him.<br>
<br>
Abby: Then tell us.<br>
<br>
Daria: I believe it was Professor Plum, in the study, with the candlestick.<br>
<br>
Abby: Professor Plum?<br>
<br>
Raul sighs and reaches into a pocket. He pulls out a bloody candlestick.<br>
<br>
Raul: How did you know?<br>
<br>
Daria: First, I knew it wasn't Miss Scarlet or Mr. Green because they alibied each other for most of the time during which the murder could've taken place -- including the time that the murder actually took place.<br>
<br>
Violet: But that still left Colonel Mustard, Mrs. Peacock, and Mrs. White, along with Professor Plum.<br>
<br>
Daria: True. And none of them had alibis for the exact time of death. But both Colonel Mustard and Mrs. Peacock said that they were in the billiard room together until 2:00, when Mrs. Peacock left. They also both said that she left because she had a migraine. Also, Mrs. Peacock said that she saw Mrs. White while on her way to the kitchen, and that Mrs. White was heading to the conservatory. Mrs. White confirmed it. On the other hand, Professor Plum said he'd been in the study the whole time. But Miss Scarlet and Mr. Green both said he'd come into the ballroom to get a candlestick, while Mrs. White saw him passing by the library with the candlestick in hand. She also said she'd heard someone pass by a bit earlier, and Colonel Mustard said that he'd heard someone pass by the billiard room before 3:00, then after 3:00. The evidence added up.<br>
<br>
Abby: Good job, Daria. You have added $20,000 to the pot, which means you now have $215,000 in the pot! And you have earned an exemption for yourself!<br>
<br>
Everyone congraulates Daria, as people do their confessionals.<br>
<br>
Raul: Am I upset that I didn't get the exemption? A little. I would've liked to be certain that I would stick around. But I think I'll be all right.<br>
<br>
Heather: I'm really looking hard at Fern. She's done enough suspicious things that she could be the Mole.<br>
<br>
Fern: If I would give Daria any advice, it would be to not trust Violet. She's sneaky enough to be the Mole.<br>
<br>
Mark: Could Raul be the Mole? Possibly. He played the killer in the Clue Challenge.<br>
<br>
Daria: Next challenge, I should watch Tom. If he's the Mole, I'll catch him.<br>
<br>
Abby: Now everyone, I suppose you're all excited about being in Geneva, so you'll all have time to do some sightseeing! (Everyone cheered.) But remember, you should be back at the hotel by 9:00 tonight!<br>
<br>
We then see a montage of the contestants (now out of costume) visiting the various sites in Geneva. Their first stop is the Botanical Gardens and Conservatory. As they go through, we see Fern and Mark talking quietly.<br>
<br>
Fern: So, who do you think is the Mole?<br>
<br>
Mark: Tough choice. I'm thinking either Raul or Violet is the Mole. However, Violet's a little more suspicious than Raul.<br>
<br>
Fern: I agree. In fact, I don't think Raul's the Mole at all.<br>
<br>
Mark: You don't?<br>
<br>
Fern: No.<br>
<br>
Mark: Why not?<br>
<br>
Fern: I've been watching him, and I just don't think he has the skill to pull off the job of being the Mole. He's like you, in fact. Both of you are intelligent people, but neither of you are very clever.<br>
<br>
Mark: I know I'm not. But that doesn't mean Raul isn't more clever than he appears to be.<br>
<br>
Later we see the contestants eating dinner at the Cafe Rafael. As the contestants eat, we hear Tom doing a confessional.<br>
<br>
Tom: I'm looking really hard at Violet. She already seems to have one coalition with Raul, while she and Daria are doing a great job avoiding each other -- in public, at least. Could that be a cover for another coalition? And if so, is Violet just trying to get herself in a good spot to win, or is she the Mole?<br>
<br>
Later the other contestants do some shopping in the Old Town. Raul and Violet are talking as they look at some stuff in the Artisant Espagnol.<br>
<br>
Raul: This is really good stuff!<br>
<br>
Violet: I agree. It's fun to just relax and not think about the game for once.<br>
<br>
Raul: Yes. Oh, here's something nice! And it's really cheap! I think I'll get it as a souvenir.<br>
<br>
Violet: Good! (As they get their purchases and head to the counter to pay,) Incidentally, the next challenge, I'm going to join Fern. I want to watch her carefully.<br>
<br>
Raul: Good! I think she's the Mole!<br>
<br>
Later on, the contestants go to Rosseau Island, and finally to the Jet d'Eau, where everyone (except Daria) gasps in awe at the sight. However, Daria, who is standing off to the side, is smiling slightly. Violet notices this and comes on over while the others are distracted.<br>
<br>
Violet: I know you didn't want to be on Teen Mole in the first place, and that Tom and Jane tricked you into applying. Still, aren't you glad they did so?<br>
<br>
Daria: Well, I must admit that I wouldn't have had the opportunity to go to cool places like this or meet strangers that actually are trying to be nice to me if they hadn't tricked me. Even if they are being nice to me partly for ulterior motives.<br>
<br>
Violet (smiling): How true. Still, do you think that genuine friendships can be formed even in this type of situation?<br>
<br>
Daria (thinking for a moment): I suppose so. Already I think I'm closest to you out of those whom I didn't know before the game, and yet you're the one who's most honest about your ulterior motives in the game.<br>
<br>
Violet (pleasantly surprised): Why, thank you! Oh, by the way, if there are two challenges tomorrow, and Fern and Tom aren't in the same challenge, I'm watching Fern.<br>
<br>
Daria: And I'm watching Tom.<br>
<br>
Violet (noticing Tom approach the two of them): Speak of the devil.<br>
<br>
Tom: Hello, Violet. Hi, Daria.<br>
<br>
Violet: Hello, Tom. Having fun watching the Jet d'Eau?<br>
<br>
Tom: Yes. May I speak to you for a moment, Daria?<br>
<br>
Daria: Sure. (Violet moves to one side.) Yes, Tom?<br>
<br>
Tom: Just be careful around Violet. She has a coalition with Raul already, and she might be tricking him.<br>
<br>
Daria: That may be true; but if she's tricking him, it might not be because she's the Mole, if that's what you're suggesting.<br>
<br>
Tom: You may be right. Still, I'd be cautious around her, if I were you.<br>
<br>
Daria (smiling slightly): If I figure out who the Mole is, and it's not Violet, who says I'm going to let her know everything about the Mole?<br>
<br>
Later that night, the contestants return to the Hotel d'Angleterre, and we get a glimpse of the stars in the sky. Then we move in for a close-up, and we see that Tom is now looking at the stars from his hotel room.<br>
<br>
*******************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Abby: When we come back, five contestants have to take part in a geography challenge, Daria and Tom are in a race against time with some guards, and we have our fourth execution.<br>
<br>
*******************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 4: The Hotel d'Angleterre, next morning<br>
<br>
The contestants and Abby are having breakfast in the Windows Cafe.<br>
<br>
Abby: How many of you have notes concerning your suspicions about who the Mole is? (Everyone raises their hand.) Good. This morning, you will have a chance to review your notes and add any suspicions based on the last challenge. However, after lunch, five of you will be heading to the University of Geneva. Now I need two people to sit out this challenge. (Tom raises his hand, followed by Daria). Okay, Tom and Daria, you will be sitting out this challenge. However, you will be taking part in a challenge tonight.<br>
<br>
Daria (sarcastic as usual): Great. I always wanted to see some of the night life in Geneva.<br>
<br>
Heather (confessional): Interesting that Daria waited till Tom raised his hand before raising hers. I hope she doesn't think Tom's the Mole because if she does, I think she's on the wrong track.<br>
<br>
Raul (confessional): The good news is, Violet and I are taking part in a challenge along with Fern. And Violet will be watching Fern. I'm certain she'll prove Fern's the Mole.<br>
<br>
Violet (confessional): Daria's going to be watching Tom, I'm going to be watching Fern. Whoever the Mole is, we'll find out by tomorrow morning.<br>
<br>
**************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 5: The University of Geneva, after lunch<br>
<br>
Abby, Fern, Heather, Mark, Raul, and Violet are standing in the cafeteria.<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay, I need one contestant who people think might be a good teacher someday. (Raul is nominated.) Okay, Raul, come with me. (She takes Raul aside.) Your task is to assign one of two sets of geography questions to your fellow contestants. (She shows him one set.) This set is the easy set. And this one (she shows him the other set), this one's the hard set. Your fellow contestants must answer 5 questions each. There are 20 questions in all, and they can earn up to $20,000 for the pot.<br>
<br>
Raul sighs as we hear him do an interview.<br>
<br>
Raul: That was a hard decision. I'd love to earn more money for the pot, but we already earned a lot of money -- and it might be good to make some people think I'm the Mole.<br>
<br>
After a moment, Raul decides.<br>
<br>
Raul: I'm going to pick -- this one! (He points at one of the two sets of questions.)<br>
<br>
Abby: Excellent. I'm going to tell the others. (She returns to the others.) Here is your assignment: Raul has picked out this set of geography questions. (She shows them the set Raul chose.) You must follow the arrows to the room where you'll take a Geography quiz. There are 20 questions on the quiz. For each question you get right, $1,000 will be added to the pot. That means you can earn up to $20,000 on this one challenge. Now, you must answer 5 questions each.<br>
<br>
Heather (confessional): This would be a great opportunity for the Mole to sabotage the game. All they need to do is get one question wrong and we lose money for the pot.<br>
<br>
Violet (confessional): Hmm. It might be a good opportunity for the Mole to sabotage the game, but it's almost too easy to sabotage it. Would the Mole sabotage this game? Perhaps.<br>
<br>
They follow the arrows to a lecture room where a professor stood.<br>
<br>
Professor: Guten Tag. I'm Professor Hans Gessler. May I see the set of questions you have? (Fern, who had the set, gives it to the Professor. He looks at it.) Excellent. You know what you have to do? (They nod.) Okay, here's your first question. It's a multiple choice question. Vilnius is the capital of what country? A. Estonia. B. Latvia. C. Lithuania. Or D. Kazahkstan. Who wants to answer this one? (Violet raises her hand.) Yes?<br>
<br>
Violet: C. Vilnius is the capital of Lithuania.<br>
<br>
Gessler: That is correct. (Everyone congraulates Violet.)<br>
<br>
Violet (confessional): I should thank my father for taping The Hunt for Red October, since I remembered that Captain Marko Ramius is Lithuanian by birth and is called the Vilnius Schoolmaster.<br>
<br>
Gessler: Okay, then. Question 2: True or False. Eritrea was once part of Ethiopia. Who wants to answer this one? (A moment of silence, then Mark raises his hand.) Yes?<br>
<br>
Mark: True.<br>
<br>
Gessler: Correct. Question 3: Which of the following countries is not part of the region called Latin America? A. Mexico. B. Peru. C. Argentina. Or D. Spain. (This time, Fern raises her hand.) Yes?<br>
<br>
Fern: D. Spain is in Europe.<br>
<br>
Gessler: Correct! Question 4: True or False. Palestine is recognized as an independent country. (This time Heather raises her hand.) Yes?<br>
<br>
Heather: False. Definitely false.<br>
<br>
Gessler: That is correct. While the Palestinians want to be recognized as an independent country, they aren't one yet.<br>
<br>
Heather (confessional): I hear a lot about the Middle East from my father, so I knew the answer to that one.<br>
<br>
Gessler: Question 5: Which of the following countries is located entirely in a tropical rainforest climate? A. Brazil. B. Japan. C. Phillipines. D. Guatemala. (The other contestants look puzzled, then Mark raises his hand.) Yes?<br>
<br>
Mark: C. Brazil is too big to lie entirely in a tropical rainforest climate, Japan is too far north, and Guatemala lies in a tropical savanna climate.<br>
<br>
Gessler: That is correct! (Everyone cheers as Fern does a confessional.)<br>
<br>
Fern: Mark's majoring in ecology, so he probably knows a lot about geography.<br>
<br>
Gessler: Question 6: True or False. Cambodia is currently a Communist state. (Fern raises her hand.) Yes?<br>
<br>
Fern: True.<br>
<br>
Gessler: That is false. Cambodia was once a Communist state, but now it's a constitutional monarchy. (Fern frowns.)<br>
<br>
Raul (confessional): Fern probably knew Cambodia is no longer a Communist state, but deliberately blew it because she's the Mole.<br>
<br>
Gessler: Question 7: Which of the following religions did not develop in the area known as the Middle East? A. Buddhism. B. Islam. C. Judaism. D. Christianity. (Heather raises her hand at once.) Yes?<br>
<br>
Heather: A. Buddhism is an Eastern religion.<br>
<br>
Gessler: That is correct. (Everyone congraulates Heather.) Question 8: True or False. Chechneya is an independent nation. (Violet raises her hand.) Yes?<br>
<br>
Violet: Uh ... true?<br>
<br>
Gessler: That is incorrect. (Violet looks disappointed.) Chechneya has not been officially recognized as an independent country by the United Nations. Question 9: Cameroon is part of what continent? A. Europe. B. North America. C. Asia. D. Africa. (Everyone thinks for a moment, then Fern raises her hand.) Yes?<br>
<br>
Fern: D. I think.<br>
<br>
Gessler: That is correct. Cameroon is part of Africa. Question 10: True or False. One of the former Soviet republics shares the same name as an American state. (Mark raises his hand at once.) Yes?<br>
<br>
Mark: True. And I believe the name of the state is Georgia.<br>
<br>
Gessler: That is correct. Georgia is the name of an American state and of a former Soviet republic. Question 11: Which country has over 100 different languages? A. Djibouti. B. Chad. C. Iran. D. Fiji. (Everyone looks puzzled for a moment, then Heather raises her hand. By that point, Mark looks like he knows, but it's too late.) Yes?<br>
<br>
Heather: Uh ... A?<br>
<br>
Gessler: That is incorrect. The correct answer is B.<br>
<br>
Heather: Damn!<br>
<br>
Gessler: Question 12: True or False. Mayans live in five different Latin American countries. (Violet raises her hand at once.) Yes?<br>
<br>
Violet: True. However, they don't live in all of the five countries.<br>
<br>
Gessler: That is correct. Mayans live in parts of Mexico, Honduras, and El Salvador; in much of Guatemala; and in all of Belize. Question 13: Name two of the former republics of the Soviet Union. (Mark raises his hand at once.) Yes?<br>
<br>
Mark: Turkmenistan and Tajikistan.<br>
<br>
Gessler: That is correct! Question 14: Which of the following countries recently won independence from Indonesia despite bloody resistance by the Indonesian government? A. Lichenstein. B. Timor Timur. C. Singapore. D. Malaysia. (After a moment of thought, Heather raised her hand.) Yes?<br>
<br>
Heather: I think it's B. I remember hearing about that country's struggle for independence when it was called East Timor.<br>
<br>
Gessler: That is correct! For question 15, take a look at this flag. (He shows a tricolor flag with blue on the top, black in the middle, and white on the bottom.) Which nation flies this flag? (After a moment of confusion, Fern seems to have an idea, for she raises her hand.) Yes?<br>
<br>
Fern: Uh ... Latvia?<br>
<br>
Gessler: Sorry, that is incorrect. The correct answer is Estonia. (Fern shakes her head.) Question 16: True or False. Apartheid still exists in South Africa. (Violet raises her hand.) Yes?<br>
<br>
Violet: False. I think it ended recently -- at least officially.<br>
<br>
Gessler: That is right. South Africa ended its apartheid laws in the 1990s. Here are the final 4 questions. Question 17: Name the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovinia. (Heather raises her hand.) Yes?<br>
<br>
Heather: Sarajevo.<br>
<br>
Gessler: That is correct! Question 18: Hindu is the major religion in which of the following countries? A. India. B. Pakistan. C. Bangladesh. D. Afghanistan. (Fern raises her hand at once.) Yes?<br>
<br>
Fern: A. The others are all principally Muslim, if I remember correctly.<br>
<br>
Gessler: That is correct! Question 19: True or False. The smallest nation in the world is San Marino. (Mark raises her hand.) Yes?<br>
<br>
Mark: False.<br>
<br>
Gessler: That is correct! The Vatican City is the smallest nation in the world. Last but not least, for question 20, take a look at this flag. (He shows a tricolor flag with white on the top, blue in the middle, and red on the bottom. There is also a shield on the flag, which contains white mountains, yellow stars above it, and a blue background.) Which nation flies this flag?<br>
<br>
Violet looks at the flag for several moments. She looks truly puzzled. Then she comes up with something.<br>
<br>
Violet: Um ... Croatia?<br>
<br>
Gessler: I'm sorry, but that's incorrect. The correct answer is Slovenia. (Violet sighs.) Nice job, for Americans. You got 15 out of 20 questions correct.<br>
<br>
Abby (having come in in time to hear this): Good job, contestants! That means you have earned $15,000 for the pot, bringing your score up to $230,000! Now, the rest of you have plenty of time to write down your suspicions about who the Mole is back at the hotel.<br>
<br>
As they leave, we hear people doing confessionals.<br>
<br>
Tom: Interesting that Violet missed two questions. I wonder if she deliberately screwed up.<br>
<br>
Heather: Mark did an outstanding job in the Geography Challenge! He didn't miss a single question. However, that might mean he's the Mole.<br>
<br>
Violet: Fern missed two questions. However, I missed two questions as well, and Heather missed one. I'm just going to have to wait and see when Daria and Tom finish their challenge.<br>
<br>
***********************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 6: Outside the Gilbert Albert's Art Workshops at the Geneva "Cabonitiers" Museum, 8:00 PM local time.<br>
<br>
A car arrives just outside the museum. Inside it, Abby turns to Daria and Tom, both dressed in black clothes.<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay, here's your assignment. The two of you must break into the museum and attempt to steal this collection of jewelry. (She shows them a picture of a gold necklace studded with pearls, emeralds, turquoise, and sapphires, along with matching earrings and a pin. The necklace was numbered 8333, while the earrings were numbered 0990 and the pin was numbered 3712.) However, the guards have been informed that someone might try to steal the jewelry and they've placed them in a room that can be opened only by solving a certain combination. Also, they've locked the jewelry in a vault that can be opened only by solving another combination. Your task is to get into the room, open the vault, and steal the jewelry within one hour -- unless you trip up the high-tech security guarding the vault, in which case, you must steal the jewelry and get out before the guards catch you. If you succeed, I'll add $20,000 to the pot, and the jewelry will be returned. If you fail and are caught, you'll just have to spend some time in a police station until I can pick you up. Understand? (Both nod.)<br>
<br>
Daria and Tom get out of the car, sneak to the side as it drives away, and stealthily approach the back. Once there, Tom fires a grappling hook from a speargun and he and Daria zip up to the top of the building. Once there, Daria uses claws built into her gloves to cut a hole in the skylight, then they unlock the window and use the grappling hook to zip down into the museum.<br>
<br>
Using a map, they stealthily walk through the museum, dodging guards and guard dogs as they do so. It takes 5 minutes to get to the room where the vault is located.<br>
<br>
Tom (checking his watch): We have 50 minutes left. Hey, what's this? (He reads a piece of paper.) "I hope you know your sports statistics, because the combination involves 3 separate numbers from the world of sports."<br>
<br>
Daria: Damn! Which one of us tries to answer the questions?<br>
<br>
Tom: You do. You personally know some athletes, I don't.<br>
<br>
Daria (sighing): Okay. (Reads first question, which has just lit up.) "What number is a perfect score in the world of gymnastics?" Hmm ... this might be the easiest one ... oh yeah! I remember! It's 10! (She types in 10 in the first slot for the combination lock, then reads the second clue, which lights up at that moment.) "How many home runs did Hank Aaron hit?" Damnit! I know next to nothing about baseball!<br>
<br>
Tom: Hold on. Let's try some numbers at random. How about 666? (Daria types it in. No luck.) Okay, how about 777? (Daria types it in, and the first number lights up.) I think we're onto something.<br>
<br>
Daria: Okay, then I'll try 723. (No luck there.) 735? (She tries again. This time, two numbers light up.) Okay, then 7 is the first number and 5 is the last one. Let's try 745. (No luck.) 715? (No luck.) 705? (No luck.) 755? (This time the third clue lights up. Daria read it.) "Name the year in which Tenley Albright won her Olympic gold medal in figure skating." How many minutes do we have left, Tom?<br>
<br>
Tom (checking): 44, I think.<br>
<br>
Daria (thinking): The year in which Tenley Albright won the Olympic gold medal? That's the Winter Games, and I think up until 1994, they had the Winter and the Summer Olympic games in the same year. And I don't remember hearing about Tenley being a post-1994 figure skater, so it's probably before 1994. Um, 1980? (The first two numbers light up.) Okay then, 1972? (No luck.) Okay, it's not the 1970s. 1964? (No luck.) Okay, it's not the 1960s. 1952? (The "5" lights up.) 1956, then. (The number lights up, and the door swings open.) How many minutes now, Tom?<br>
<br>
Tom (checking): 40.<br>
<br>
Daria: I'll sneak in first. When I see what the combination is, I'll signal to you. (She sneaks in, being careful not to trip up the high-tech security devices. It takes her about 5 minutes to get past the laser beams to reach the vault. There, she reads the piece of paper in front of it.) "You had to know your sports. Now you must know your history. Guess the correct numbers to three history questions, and you're home free." Okay, Tom, you can sneak in. I'll read the questions while you do so.<br>
<br>
Tom nods, and carefully slips in. Meanwhile, Daria reads the first question.<br>
<br>
Daria: "How many of the American colonies chose independence in 1776?" That's easy. It's 12. (She types it in, and the number lights up. Daria then reads the next clue.) "Name the year that Constantine established Christianity as the official religion of the empire." Hmm ... Constantine ruled from 306 to 337, so he established it in ... oh yeah! He fought his major rival in the west, Maxentius, in 312, and he claimed to have a vision which implied he'd win if he fought under the sign of the cross. It's 312! (She types it in, and the numbers light up, then she reads the third question.) "What year did the last emperor of the Incas die?" (Just then, she heard Tom say, "Oops!", then heard the alarm go off. She turned, and saw that Tom had tripped the alarm just before reaching her.)<br>
<br>
Tom: Sorry, Daria. I tripped.<br>
<br>
Daria: I'll talk to you later. Right now, let's figure this one out. Atahualpa, the last emperor, was captured by the Spaniards in 1532. (She types it in. The first three numbers light up.) Okay then, 1533. (She types it in. This time, the numbers all light up and the vault opens. Daria reaches in, grabs the jewelry, then hands it to Tom.) Here, you take this. We need to get it out of here!<br>
<br>
They rush to the entrance, only to find guards rushing up to block the entrance. Daria glares at Tom.<br>
<br>
**************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): When we come back, we'll have our fourth execution.<br>
<br>
**************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 7: Inside the police station, some minutes later.<br>
<br>
Daria and Tom are waiting for Abby to pick them up. Daria simply glares at Tom. Then the police chief comes out.<br>
<br>
Mueller: Well, we meet again, Daria. Fortunately for you and for your colleague, I learned that the jewelry theft attempt was just part of a game, so you're going free as soon as Fraulein Carmichael picks you up. Oh, here she comes now.<br>
<br>
Abby (coming in): I heard what happened. Looks like you two lost $20,000 for the pot. (Daria still glared at Tom.)<br>
<br>
Daria (confessional): I know whose fault it is we lost the challenge.<br>
<br>
Tom (confessional): I didn't mean to trip and set off the alarm, but I did. Even so, we might've gotten out more easily if Daria had been a faster runner.<br>
<br>
Nobody speaks on the way back to the Hotel d'Angleterre, where the others are waiting. Once they arrive, Daria emerges first, then waits for Tom to come out. Once he does, she leaps toward him, and pushes him back against the car door, with her hands around his neck.<br>
<br>
Abby: Daria! Don't hurt Tom! (Fortunately, Tom manages to pry Daria's fingers off of his neck. In any case, Daria was not really throttling him. Once he was free, Daria stomped away and into the hotel.)<br>
<br>
Mark: What was that all about?<br>
<br>
Tom: I have no idea.<br>
<br>
Violet (glancing after Daria): Hmm.<br>
<br>
**************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 8: The Windows Cafe, the next day.<br>
<br>
Abby and the contestants are having lunch.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, last night was interesting. Any explanations?<br>
<br>
Daria: I guess I was so mad that I took such care to avoid the lasers, only to have Tom trip and activate the alarm, that I lost my head. I'm sorry, Tom.<br>
<br>
Tom: That's all right, Daria. You had every right to be angry. (They shake hands.)<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, now that that's settled, what about the others? Tonight you have your fourth execution, and one of you is going home.<br>
<br>
Mark: Yeah. And I hope it isn't me.<br>
<br>
Fern: I don't think it's me. I believe that I know who the Mole is.<br>
<br>
Abby: What about you, Heather? Raul? Violet?<br>
<br>
Heather: I'm going with one suspect now.<br>
<br>
Raul: Me too.<br>
<br>
Violet: I'm confident that I know who the Mole is. But I'll have to wait and see on that one.<br>
<br>
Abby: Good idea. Well, Daria has an exemption, so she can't be executed tonight. However, the rest of you are eligible. So, whoever goes tonight, it's been a very good ride, and I'm sorry to see you go.<br>
<br>
They all toast each other as Abby continues.<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): The quiz. Ten questions about the Mole. Whoever knows the least about the Mole will be executed and must leave the game immediately. In the case of a tie, the slowest person will be executed. Question 1: Is the Mole male or female?<br>
<br>
Mark (confessional): Raul didn't do much this round. But he could've chosen the harder of the two sets of questions.<br>
<br>
Abby: Question 2: What did the Mole have to eat for breakfast at the Hotel Million? Question 3: Which role did the Mole take during the Clue Challenge? (We see answers ranging from "Miss Scarlet" to "Detective.")<br>
<br>
Heather (confessional): Mark is truly a team player. Other than Daria, he's the one I think is least likely to be the Mole.<br>
<br>
Abby: Question 4: Which room did the Mole sleep in during our first night at the Hotel d'Angleterre? Question 5: How many exemptions did the Mole get so far? (The answers are 2, 1, and 0.)<br>
<br>
Fern (confessional): Violet may think she's fooling everyone, but she's not fooling me.<br>
<br>
Abby: Question 6: How many questions did the Mole get right during the Geography Challenge? (The answers range from 5 to "The Mole did not participate in the challenge.")<br>
<br>
Raul (confessional): Fern's done the most overt sabotage. She's got to be the Mole!<br>
<br>
Abby: Question 7: What is the number of the Mole's journal? Question 8: Who was the Mole paired with in the Museum Challenge? (The answers are "Daria," "Tom," and "The Mole didn't take part in the Museum Challenge.")<br>
<br>
Violet: Thanks to my observations, and those of Daria, I now am confident that the Mole is Tom.<br>
<br>
Abby: Question 9: What is the Mole's favorite movie? Question 10: Who is the Mole?<br>
<br>
************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 9: The courtyard of the Hotel d'Angleterre.<br>
<br>
The camera pans over seven bags. The last one we spot is Heather's bag. We then see all 7 contestants emerge and take their seats. Abby is standing in front of the computer and screen.<br>
<br>
Abby: Welcome to your fourth execution. As you all know, Daria has earned herself an exemption, so she can't go home tonight. However, the rest of you are in danger of going home tonight. You all know the drill, of course. If a green thumbprint comes up, you remain in the game. If a red thumbprint comes up, you are the Mole's fourth victim. You must pack your bags and leave the game immediately. This round, we had a tie, so the person who took the test the slowest will be executed. Let's begin.<br>
<br>
She walks over to the computer as everyone reacts to the news that there was a tie.<br>
<br>
Abby: Violet.<br>
<br>
She types Violet's name into the computer. Violet watches nervously. A green thumbprint appears. Violet smiles in relief.<br>
<br>
Abby: Fern.<br>
<br>
She types Fern's name into the computer. Fern takes a deep breath. A green thumbprint appears. Fern exhales.<br>
<br>
Abby: Raul.<br>
<br>
She types Raul's name into the computer. Raul fidgets. A green thumbprint appears. Raul nods.<br>
<br>
Abby: Heather.<br>
<br>
She types Heather's name into the computer. As Heather waits, a red thumbprint appears. Heather clenches her fist in frustration, then sighs, gets up, grabs her bag, and leaves with Abby. Sad music begins to play.<br>
<br>
Fern: Heather was a true competitor. More often than not, she played to earn money for the pot. (We catch a glimpse of Heather bungee-jumping.)<br>
<br>
Tom: I'll miss Heather. She was a nice person, and she was a strong athlete. (We catch Heather running through the streets of Lyon, then see her racing through the Maison des Canuts to reach Ann.)<br>
<br>
Daria: One thing I'll say about Heather -- she may have been a jock, but she was a smart person as well. There's all too few smart jocks at Lawndale. (We see Heather answering questions in the Geography Challenge, flying in the balloon, and considering whether to go for the exemption in the Skiing Challenge.)<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, we see Abby and Heather outside.<br>
<br>
Abby: So, what do you think went wrong?<br>
<br>
Heather: I went with one person. Unfortunately for me, it was obviously the wrong person. Still, I had a blast! Now it's back to getting a tutor for geometry. (The limo pulls up then, and Heather approaches it.) See you later, Abby!<br>
<br>
Abby: Bye, Heather! (She waves as Heather gets into the limo. The limo then pulls away from the curb.)<br>
