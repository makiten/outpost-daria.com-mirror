"Mole? Somebody get me a dermatologist!"<br>
by Belle Book<br>
<br>
Chapter Five<br>
<br>
Scene 1: the Hotel d'Angleterre<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): Previously on Teen Mole -- the remaining contestants had to take part in a challenge based on the board game "Clue". (We see Daria interviewing Violet, who's dressed as Miss Scarlet.) Daria correctly accused Professor Plum of killing Mr. Boddy in the study, with the candlestick, earning herself an exemption. (We see Raul, dressed as Professor Plum, pull out a bloody candlestick.) The next day, five contestants had to take part in a geography quiz (we see Mark and Fern answering questions,) while Tom and Daria attempted to steal a collection of jewelry to earn money for the pot. (We see Daria give Tom the jewelry.) There was a tie in the fourth execution, and Heather was the unlucky person who became the Mole's next victim. (We see Heather get the red thumbprint.)<br>
<br>
The James-Bond music returns as Abby continues:<br>
<br>
Abby: Ten contestants. One winner. Each one attempting to win a jackpot up to 1 million dollars. However, one of the contestants has been hired by the producers to sabotage the game. That someone is the Mole. Each round, the contestants have to take a quiz. Whoever knows the least about the Mole will be executed and must leave the game immediately. Who is the Mole?<br>
<br>
We then see clips of Fern, Raul, Daria, Tom, Violet, and Mark. As the credits run, we see several people do confessionals.<br>
<br>
Mark: I must've gotten lucky. I'm still not certain if the Mole's Violet or Raul, though I'm leaning toward Violet. I'm going to have to decide soon, however.<br>
<br>
Fern: I wonder who tied with Heather. Whoever it is, they're going to have to get on the right track before they're eliminated.<br>
<br>
Raul: Fern tried to warn me not to trust Violet. But Fern's probably the Mole, so why should I believe her?<br>
<br>
Daria: I'm keeping my eye on Tom from now on. I believe Violet will be doing so as well, since I told her what happened at the museum.<br>
<br>
Violet: Raul not only told me that Fern suspected me, he also told me Mark had some suspicions about Raul himself. This might prove useful.<br>
<br>
We then cut to breakfast the next day in the Windows Cafe. Abby and the remaining six contestants are having breakfast. Fern is eating an omelette, while Violet is eating pancakes.<br>
<br>
Abby: So, how are you all doing?<br>
<br>
Mark: I'm a little nervous. It's not easy when you know Heather was simply slower than someone else.<br>
<br>
Fern: Yeah. You're wondering who tied with Heather.<br>
<br>
Abby: Daria, you were the one who entered the game because someone tricked you into applying. (Daria glared at Tom, then nodded.) How do you feel now?<br>
<br>
Daria: Well, I wanted to kill Tom and Jane at the beginning, but I must admit that now, I'm really getting into the swing of things.<br>
<br>
Tom (smirking): Maybe we knew you better than you knew yourself.<br>
<br>
Daria: Oh, shut up! (Everyone laughs at that.)<br>
<br>
Abby: What about you, Violet? Raul?<br>
<br>
Raul: Well, I'm happy to be here. I've already formed a coalition, and I'm hoping it'll take me to the finals.<br>
<br>
Violet: I'm playing the game one step at a time, trying not to look too far ahead.<br>
<br>
Abby: Good idea, Violet. Now once you're all done breakfast, pack your bags, because you're going to Lausanne!<br>
<br>
As the contestants reacted in various ways, Mark did a confessional.<br>
<br>
Mark: Too bad Heather is out of the game now. She'd probably love going to Lausanne. As for me, I should like it myself.<br>
<br>
Violet (confessional): Lausanne's not too far from here. I wonder if we're going to stay there long or head out the next day.<br>
<br>
Tom (confessional): Fern and Mark have a coalition. Violet and Raul have a coalition. And I think Violet has a coalition with Daria as well. I'm the only one without a coalition. I wonder what that means for me. I hope I can still stay in the game even without one.<br>
<br>
We then see a map of Switzerland, with the contestants heading from Geneva to Lausanne. Then we see the contestants travelling by two cars. One car contains Fern, Mark, and Tom. Tom's in the front, with Fern and Mark in the back.<br>
<br>
Fern: Who do you think tied with Heather for last place?<br>
<br>
Mark: I'm not certain. Maybe Tom. I don't think it was either one of us, however.<br>
<br>
Fern: I agree. I also think Daria didn't tie with Heather, or Violet. In fact, I think Violet's the Mole.<br>
<br>
Mark: I don't know. I'm still wondering about Raul.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile in the other car, Raul is up in the front, while Daria and Violet is in the back. They are looking at Daria's journal and quietly talking.<br>
<br>
Daria: This seems to be the way things have gone so far. So what should we do now?<br>
<br>
Violet: Well, we know Mark is more confused than Fern. And I believe Raul tied with Heather on the last quiz. So, we should get an exemption for Raul.<br>
<br>
Daria: And completely confuse Mark in the process?<br>
<br>
Violet: Yeah. And I think I know how we can do that.<br>
<br>
Daria (confessional): This is the time to really get working. And with Violet by my side, I think we can make it into the finals.<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): Eventually, we all reached Lausanne, where we had reservations at the Hotel Mirabeau for all our contestants. Then we went to the hotel restaurant, where we had lunch. Later, we checked in and got our rooms before leaving the hotel to begin our next game.<br>
<br>
****************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 2: The Cathedral of Square Cite-Tunnel, Lausanne, after lunch<br>
<br>
Abby and the seven contestants are on the rooftop of the cathedral. Abby is now speaking to the contestants.<br>
<br>
Abby: This next game is going to be a kind of Hide-and-Seek, but the stakes will be high. I need one contestant whom people think most needs an exemption. (Daria voted for Raul, Fern voted for Mark, Mark voted for Fern, Raul voted for Tom, and Tom and Violet both voted for Raul.) Okay, Raul, you have been chosen. Now, I need those who aren't going to be going for the exemption to choose the one person who they think is least likely to be the Mole. (Daria votes for Fern, Fern for Mark, Mark for Fern, and Tom for Mark. Violet then chooses Fern, much to Raul's surprise.) Okay, Fern, you have been chosen.<br>
<br>
Raul (confessional): Violet chose Fern! Now *that's* a big surprise! I wonder why she did that.<br>
<br>
Abby: Raul, your task is to move through the streets surrounding the Cathedral looking for seven green pieces of paper with thumbprints on them. Once you find them, you must get hold of them without being noticed. Fern, your task is to capture Raul before he can get hold of all seven pieces of paper. The rest of you, your task is to spot Raul and relay his location to Fern via a walkie-talkie, which one person will use. If Fern can capture Raul before he grabs all the pieces of paper, you will add $20,000 to the pot. However, if Raul can grab all the pieces of paper before Fern can reach him, he will earn an exemption for himself, and no money will be added to the pot.<br>
<br>
We then hear Mark doing a confessional.<br>
<br>
Mark: Eventually, we all decided that Daria would be the person talking to Fern. The rest of us would be watching the area where the pieces of paper were strewn. Meanwhile, Abby took Fern to the entrance to the Cathedral.<br>
<br>
Abby: Fern, what nobody but you knows is that if you can capture Raul before he can grab all the pieces of paper, not only will the money be added to the pot, but you will earn an exemption for yourself.<br>
<br>
Fern (confessional): You can use every exemption you can get -- unless you're the Mole, of course.<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): So Fern prepared to run as soon as she got the signal that Raul had been spotted. However, what nobody but Raul knew was that he had a listening device that would enable him to hear what the others were saying.<br>
<br>
We then see Abby and Raul on a side street near the Cathedral. Raul is crouched in the starting position.<br>
<br>
Abby: On your mark, get set -- go!<br>
<br>
*************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): When we come back, Raul tries to get an exemption for himself. (We see Raul running through the streets surrounding the Cathedral.) Later on, the contestants see the sights of Lausanne, (we see contestants going through the Historical Museum of Lausanne,) before heading to Bern, where a surprise is in store for them. (We see contestants reacting in surprise.) And then we have our fifth quiz, and our fifth execution.<br>
<br>
*************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 3: Outside the Cathedral<br>
<br>
We then see Raul moving stealthily through the streets surrounding the Cathedral to the first piece of paper. As he did so, he looked at a map. Meanwhile, Mark, Tom, and Violet were all looking for Raul. Raul was able to grab the first piece of paper without being spotted and slid back into the shadows. A minute later --<br>
<br>
Mark: One of the pieces of paper is missing! (He relays the information to Daria, who relays it to Fern. One minute after that, Mark sees a bush being disturbed. Then,) I've found Raul! Tell Fern to get going!<br>
<br>
Daria (through her walkie-talkie): Fern, Mark's spotted Raul! Time to get going!<br>
<br>
Fern: Okay!<br>
<br>
Raul hears Daria telling Fern where to go, and starts moving as quickly (but as quietly) as possible. He steals another piece of green paper, but Mark clearly sees him and relays the information to Fern via Daria. Fern runs as fast as she can to intercept Raul. Raul manages to grab one more piece of paper, but as he is about to sneak past an alleyway --<br>
<br>
Fern (rushing out of the alleyway): There you are! (Raul tries to run, but Fern grabs him before he can do so. To Daria,) I got him!<br>
<br>
Daria (to the others): Fern got Raul! (Everyone cheers as the pot increases to $250,000. Fern and Raul return to the Cathedral, where Abby is waiting for them.)<br>
<br>
Abby: Good job, everyone! You have added $20,000 to the pot, increasing the total score to $250,000! Now Fern, why don't you tell them what you have also earned.<br>
<br>
Fern: Abby told me that if I captured Raul before he got all seven pieces of paper, I'd earn an exemption for myself.<br>
<br>
Abby: That's right. Fern has earned an exemption for herself. (Raul glared angrily at Fern.)<br>
<br>
Raul (confessional): That only added salt to the wound for me. I not only failed to earn an exemption for myself, but Fern got one instead. Violet should never have picked Fern.<br>
<br>
Violet (confessional): After Raul was chosen as the person who needed the exemption most and we learned we had to choose someone who we thought was least likely to be the Mole, I suspected that that person might be battling Raul for an exemption. And I didn't want Mark to get the exemption, so I chose Fern.<br>
<br>
Abby: Now Raul, you have a second chance to earn an exemption for yourself. The pieces of paper you got will be returned, and the others will have to pick someone who they think is second-least likely to be the Mole. However, this person will not be going for an exemption. Other than that, the same rules apply as they did in the first run.<br>
<br>
This time, the process of choosing the person to run against Raul is simpler. Daria, Mark, and Violet all pick Tom, while Fern and Tom himself pick Mark. As a result, Tom is chosen.<br>
<br>
Tom (interivew): Once Abby asked us to choose who we thought was second-least likely, I got chosen. The others all rotated, with Violet being the one chosen to speak to me.<br>
<br>
Raul then returns with Abby back to where he began. He waits for Abby's signal.<br>
<br>
Abby: You understand that if Tom is able to pick you off before you get all 7 pieces of paper, he'll add an additional $20,000 to the pot but not earn an exemption for himself?<br>
<br>
Raul: Yes, I do. But I hope I can get the exemption this time! I might really need it.<br>
<br>
Abby: Yes. On your mark, get set, go!<br>
<br>
We then see Raul moving stealthily through the streets again. Meanwhile, Daria, Mark, and Fern are all looking for Raul, while Violet is standing with the walkie-talkie in hand. Raul grabs the first piece of paper, but nobody spots him. He then grabs another piece of paper, but just after he does so, Daria notices that it's missing. However, she doesn't say anything. This enables Raul to quickly grab the third piece of paper, but Mark spots that it's missing just after Raul slides back into the shadows.<br>
<br>
Mark: I think Raul just grabbed a piece of paper. (Soon afterwards, Raul grabs a fourth piece of paper, but as he does so, Mark clearly spots him.) There he is! There he is!<br>
<br>
Violet (through walkie-talkie): Raul's got at least two pieces of paper! (However, Tom does not seem to hear her directions as to where Raul is, for he doesn't run right away. This enables Raul to grab a fifth piece of paper.)<br>
<br>
Mark: He's got another piece of paper! Isn't Tom going after Raul, Violet?<br>
<br>
Violet (through the walkie-talkie): Tom, what's going on? Raul's got another piece of paper!<br>
<br>
This time, Tom apparently hears, for he starts running, and Violet directs him as best she can. However, Raul grabs a sixth piece of paper, then moves for the kill. Tom runs as fast as he could toward the spot where the last piece of paper is, but Raul is nearing it. Raul slips past an alleyway, and a second later Tom emerges from it -- just as Raul reaches for the last piece of paper. Before Tom can lunge for Raul, Raul grabs it.<br>
<br>
Raul: Yes! I got the last piece of paper! (Up on the top of the castle, Fern glares at Violet, who looks stoic. Tom and Raul return, where Abby's waiting to greet all of them.)<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, this time you guys didn't earn any money for the pot, and Raul has his exemption.<br>
<br>
Violet: How come it took so long for you to run after Raul?<br>
<br>
Tom: I didn't hear you the first time!<br>
<br>
Raul (confessional): I'm so glad I earned an exemption for myself! This will ensure my survival into the next round.<br>
<br>
Mark (confessional): Fern and Raul both have exemptions. My only hope is that Tom tied with Heather on the last quiz, because if he didn't, I'm probably in trouble.<br>
<br>
Fern (confessional): I'm certain the Mole struck in this challenge. And I have a good idea who the Mole is, and how she sabotaged this game.<br>
<br>
Violet (confessional): Tom said he didn't hear me the first time! I think he had the walkie-talkie turned off on purpose. But why else would Daria and I suggest that Tom race Raul this time? (She winks to the camera.)<br>
<br>
Tom (confessional): I wonder why I couldn't hear Violet the first time. Could Violet have cut the signal the first time so that I couldn't hear it clearly, enabling Raul to get another piece of paper? I wouldn't put it past her.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, everyone, we have plenty of time to see the sights of Lausanne. Want to see the sights? (Everyone all clearly wanted to do so.) Okay then, we have dinner reservations at Le Cafetheatre for 6:00, and we'll be returning to the Hotel Mirabeau at 9:00. But until then, it's time for sightseeing! And our first stop is here in the Cathedral!<br>
<br>
We then are treated to a montage of the contestants seeing the sights of Lausanne. They first head through the Cathedral. As they do so, we hear Daria doing a confessional.<br>
<br>
Daria: Although I'm an agnostic, I can appreciate the beauty of cathedrals as much as the next person. Though you'll never catch me saying it to most people.<br>
<br>
We then see the contestants going to the Historical Museum of Lausanne. As they are doing so, we hear Mark and Fern talking.<br>
<br>
Mark: This is such a lovely place! Don't you think?<br>
<br>
Fern: Yeah. I'm sorry you didn't get picked to be the first person that went after Raul. You might well have gotten that exemption.<br>
<br>
Mark: I just hope Tom tied with Heather. If he did, I can still beat him, especially if he picks you during the quiz. If he doesn't -- (his voice trails off.)<br>
<br>
Fern: I know. I think Violet's trying to get you out. That's why she picked me to be the first one.<br>
<br>
Mark: But why allow Raul to get an exemption? We're agreed that she has a coalition with Raul, right?<br>
<br>
Fern: Yes.<br>
<br>
Mark: So if she's the Mole, wouldn't it be to her advantage to somehow prevent Raul from getting an exemption?<br>
<br>
Fern: Not if it means possibly betraying herself to him or to others this early on. She might simply realize that it would be better to keep Raul around since he's completely fooled.<br>
<br>
Mark: Or maybe Raul's the Mole. That's another possibility.<br>
<br>
Fern: That's true. But I still think it's highly unlikely that Raul's the Mole.<br>
<br>
Mark (confessional): I'm really worried. There's now four people who are eligible to be executed -- three if the Mole isn't one of those who got the exemption. That's not very good odds. I'd better decide who the Mole is -- Violet or Raul -- and fast!<br>
<br>
Fern (confessional): I wish I could give my exemption to Mark. I don't need it as badly as he does.<br>
<br>
Later on, the contestants go to the open-air Festival de la Cite. As they look around, Violet and Raul are talking.<br>
<br>
Raul: Why did you pick Fern to be the first one to try to get me?<br>
<br>
Violet: To prevent others from going for the exemption, especially Mark. With the Mole having an exemption as well, Mark is dead meat, especially if you make him think you could be the Mole later on.<br>
<br>
Raul: Divide and conquer, huh?<br>
<br>
Violet (grinning): You got it!<br>
<br>
Raul: So you want me to make Mark think I could be the Mole during the next challenge, right?<br>
<br>
Violet: You got it! That would cause Mark to get so confused he splits his answers between you and me, and he gets executed.<br>
<br>
Raul (confessional): I'm glad Violet explained to me her reasons for picking Fern. Hopefully our coalition will hold and I'll be taken right to the finish line.<br>
<br>
Later on, we see the contestants eating dinner at La Cafetheatre, then to the Esplanade de Montbenon. Violet and Daria are quietly talking to each other as the contestants stroll through the park. Nobody notices them because they're at the back of the pack.<br>
<br>
Daria: So, what's life at the reservation like?<br>
<br>
Violet: For me, it's very good. My father's an important leader in tribal government, and he's doing what he can to improve the lives of Native Americans on the reservation. Unfortunately, too many of my people live in poverty, and they become alcoholics to dull the pain of living such desperate lives. That's how life is on the reservation -- either you're wealthy, or you're dirt-poor.<br>
<br>
Daria (uncomfortably): My people greatly wronged yours.<br>
<br>
Violet: True.<br>
<br>
Daria: Do you know what Manifest Destiny is?<br>
<br>
Violet: Yes. Unfortunately. It's the belief (in the nineteenth century) that God wanted America to expand all the way to the Pacific Ocean.<br>
<br>
Daria: I once said that the people who supported Manifest Destiny did not include many Mexicans (1). I'm also inclined to think they did not include Native Americans.<br>
<br>
Violet (sadly): Yes. Y'know, most of the Lakota didn't want to go to war. All they wanted was their own land. And time after time, they were betrayed. Like in the 1870s. In 1868, the Laramie Treaty was signed, creating the Great Sioux Reservation, which covered all the land in South Dakota. But then Lieutenant George Custer violated the treaty in 1874 because of reports of gold in the Black Hills. There was gold, but still it was *our land*! (Her voice rose in anger.)<br>
<br>
Daria: Never underestimate the greed of my people.<br>
<br>
Violet (sighing): Yes. Mind if we move on to a different subject?<br>
<br>
Daria: Not at all. I'm getting very uncomfortable.<br>
<br>
Violet: Mind telling me about your family?<br>
<br>
Daria: My mother loves working hard. Then she feels guilty about it, which leads her to resent her working hard. Then she tries to spend more time with her family, but she always hangs on my every word, and who needs that? (Violet smiles in some understanding.) Though Mom *has* been helpful in the past. My father often hides behind a smokescreen of cluelessness, when he isn't flying into a rage and venting anger at his father's emotional abuse and neglect in the past. But he does try to be a good dad. And as for my sister, Quinn -- (she thinks for a moment.)<br>
<br>
Violet: Yes?<br>
<br>
Daria: I think Quinn actually is bright, but she's hidden her intelligence by being obsessed with being cute and popular. Fortunately, she's learned that she doesn't have to be dumb if she doesn't want to (2). In the past, she constantly denied that I was her sister, but now she's acknowledged it. And we actually have a closer relationship now that we once did.<br>
<br>
Violet: Do you still love your family, despite their flaws?<br>
<br>
Daria (after a long moment): I suppose I do.<br>
<br>
Violet: That's good. My family's very close-knit. I've got two brothers who aren't doing too bad in school, and very loving parents. I'd love to see them again.<br>
<br>
Daria: I hate to say it, but so do I. But most of all, I want to see Jane again.<br>
<br>
Violet: You miss her? (Daria hesitates.) It's okay to say so, if you do.<br>
<br>
Daria: Yeah. She was my very first friend when I arrived at Lawndale. We have so much in common. Pizza, watching the television show "Sick, Sad World," --<br>
<br>
Violet: I don't think I ever got that show.<br>
<br>
Daria: If we ever room together, you might have to watch it with me. It's really twisted.<br>
<br>
Violet: So I figured. What else did you do together?<br>
<br>
Daria: Oh, we made fun of jerks, airheads, and the brain-dead in general. We still do.<br>
<br>
Violet (smiling): Sounds like fun. I'd like to meet Jane.<br>
<br>
Daria: Maybe you will someday. She's going to Boston Fine Arts College for the mid-year registration. We'll be having pizzas every weekend.<br>
<br>
Violet: If Jane's willing to meet me, count me in on future pizza dinners. (They both smile, apparently unaware that Tom's watching them with a suspicious look in his green eyes.)<br>
<br>
Daria (confessional): After breaking up with Tom, I feared that I'd make no friends in college, but Quinn told me I'd make lots of friends there (3). Maybe she's right, since I might be making a new friend already.<br>
<br>
Tom (confessional): I'm really getting worried about Daria spending a lot of time with Violet. Maybe they're just becoming really good friends, but Violet could be the Mole. And if she is, Daria could be walking right into a trap. On the other hand, if there's one person who can form a coalition with the Mole and make it to the finals, it's Daria. Hell, Daria might even have figured out that Violet's the Mole.<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): Later, after a trip to the Musees et Jardins botaniques cantonaux, everyone returned to the Hotel Mirabeau, where they crashed for the night, unaware of the big surprise in store for them the next morning.<br>
<br>
*****************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): When we come back, the contestants get a welcome visit from home. (We see Violet happily greeting someone.) After that, it's time for the quiz, and the fifth execution.<br>
<br>
*****************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene Four: Hotel restaurant, Hotel Mirabeau, Lausanne<br>
<br>
Everyone is seated at the breakfast table.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, how is everyone feeling today? Daria?<br>
<br>
Daria (in her usual monotone): Oh, just fine. After three rounds having to put up with Keith, any discomfort is light.<br>
<br>
Abby (smiling slightly): And what about you, Mark? How are you feeling?<br>
<br>
Mark: I had a little trouble getting to sleep. It's not easy when you know there's a stronger chance you could go this round than you had before.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, then, I have some good news for you. It's time to pack your bags again. (Everyone groans at that.) Because you're going to the capital city of Bern!<br>
<br>
We see a montage of people packing their bags and taking the train from Lausanne to Bern as several people do their confessionals.<br>
<br>
Mark: Going to the capital city ought to be so cool! After all, it's the capital city of Switzerland, which is the home of so many international organizations!<br>
<br>
Tom: I'm glad I got to take part in the game! Where else would you get the chance to stay in the best hotels without people grovelling at your feet? I couldn't do that in Lawndale!<br>
<br>
Daria: Bags? Check. Host? Check. Four fellow contestants? Check. The Mole? Check. One sarcastic girl? Check.<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): Once we arrived at Bern, we checked into the Hotel Belle Epoque, for a two-night stay in the region. We unpacked and had lunch in the terrace/garden restaurant. While we were there, the waiter arrived with a surprise.<br>
<br>
Waiter: This is for you, I believe. (He hands a newspaper clipping over to Tom, who happens to be the closest one to him.)<br>
<br>
Tom: What's this? Several faces cut out? And a message from the Mole? (Reads) "Are yOu lonely? WeLl, you might bE eveN lonelier in thiS challenge. To avoid being even lonElier than yOu are, you Must greet the peopLe in this photo." Wonder what it means?<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, you'll find out after lunch, when we go to the Prison Tower, at the second Western Gate.<br>
<br>
********************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene Five: The Prison Tower<br>
<br>
Abby is standing outside with all the contestants.<br>
<br>
Abby: Here's our next game. And it has a special twist to it. Six people have come to Bern to spend some time with you. Daria, your best friend Jane is coming.<br>
<br>
Daria (sarcastically): Great. And I thought I'd left all reminders of Lawndale -- other than Tom, of course -- back at home! (Everyone laughs, especially Violet.)<br>
<br>
Abby: Fern, your brother Terrence is coming. (Fern cheers.) Mark, your best friend Alan is coming. (Mark smiles at that.) Raul, your mother Emilia is coming.<br>
<br>
Raul: Maravillosa!<br>
<br>
Abby: Tom, your sister Elsie is coming.<br>
<br>
Tom (sarcastically): Great!<br>
<br>
Abby: And Violet, your father Richard is coming. (Violet nearly squeals in delight.) Now then, I want you all to go up into the prison tower one at a time. Fern, you're up first. (Fern goes up with Abby into the prison tower. Once in there,) Here's the scoop, Fern. You are going to have to pick someone to be your eyes and spot your brother from that window. (She points to a window.) Each person who follows will have to do the same thing. For each person who successfully points out a loved one, I will add $10,000 to the pot. Who do you want to find your brother?<br>
<br>
Fern (unhesitatingly): Mark.<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay, then. You will have to describe your brother very carefully to Mark. I'll go get him. (She leaves, and soon returns with Mark in tow.) Mark, you will be trying to find Fern's brother. Fern will describe him to you. Go right ahead, Fern.<br>
<br>
As Fern begins describing Terrence to Mark, we see her do a confessional.<br>
<br>
Fern: This was really nerve-racking. I had to remember everything I could about Terrence. Reuniting with him will depend all on my memory and on Mark's ability to recognize him.<br>
<br>
Abby: Ready, Mark? (Mark nods. Abby leads him to the window.) Okay, Mark, one of the people in the square is Terrence. Find him.<br>
<br>
Mark looks very carefully at the people in the square. Finally he spots a young man about twenty-one listening to an older man. He was wearing a white shirt and blue jeans. His hair was brown and his eyes hazel.<br>
<br>
Mark: I think that young man is Terrence. (He points to the young man listening to the older man.)<br>
<br>
Abby: Are you sure?<br>
<br>
Mark: Yeah.<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay, then, we'll get that young man. (All three go outside, where Abby goes to get the young man Mark pointed out. Soon,) Is this Terrence, Fern?<br>
<br>
Fern (smiling happily): That's him! (She rushes up to greet Terrence, who's equally happy to see her.)<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay then. Mark found Terrence, which means $10,000 has been added to the pot! Next up, Daria. (Daria goes with her into the prison tower, and gives her the same info that she gave Fern.) Who do you want to find Jane?<br>
<br>
Daria (smirking): Violet.<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay, then. (She goes to get Violet. Once they come in,) Violet, Daria has picked you to find Jane. You must listen carefully to Daria's description of her. Daria?<br>
<br>
Daria begins describing Jane carefully. Once done, Abby leads Violet to the window, and Violet looks out into the street. She soon spots a teenage girl watching a guy doing a painting. The girl has black hair, and wears the same kind of clothes Jane wears.<br>
<br>
Violet: I can't see her eyes ... (she then sees the girl turn to one side, and spots a blue eye.) Yes! That's the one! I'm certain!<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay, then. (All three go downstairs, and Abby gets the girl looking at the painting. Once they arrive,) Daria, is this Jane?<br>
<br>
Daria (sarcastically): I never saw that girl before in my life! Send her back where she belongs!<br>
<br>
Jane laughs and runs up to hug Daria. As they hug, we hear Daria do her confessional.<br>
<br>
Daria: Though I'll never say so out loud, seeing Jane made my trip complete. I missed my partner in crime.<br>
<br>
Abby: Great job, Violet! That's another $10,000 in the pot. Now, Raul, you're up next. (Raul goes with Abby, where he learns the same thing the others learned.) Who do you want to have find your mother?<br>
<br>
Raul: Hmm ... (thinking for a moment, then deciding.) I want Daria.<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay, I'll get Daria. (She brings back Daria, who hears Raul's careful description of his mother.) Daria, now you must figure out which woman is Raul's mother.<br>
<br>
Daria looks very carefully through the village square. Soon, she spots two black-haired women with dark complexions, but she has a hard time telling which one is Raul's mother. Finally --<br>
<br>
Daria: I think that woman is Raul's mother. (She points to one woman, reading a newspaper.)<br>
<br>
Abby: Are you certain?<br>
<br>
Daria (seeing the woman look up from the newspaper): Yes, that's her!<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay, then. (Soon, she brings out the woman Daria pointed out.) Is this your mother, Raul?<br>
<br>
Raul: Si! (He runs up and hugs his mother. As he does so, we hear his confessional.) I was so happy to see my mother. This is why I'm in the game -- my mother deserves a better life than what she's had.<br>
<br>
Abby: Great job, Daria. That's another $10,000 for the pot! Now, Violet, you're up next. (Violet goes with Abby.) Violet, who do you want to find your father?<br>
<br>
Violet: Hmm ... I want Tom.<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay, then. (She goes to get Tom.) Violet, please describe your father to Tom.<br>
<br>
As Violet does so, we hear her confessional.<br>
<br>
Violet: I just hope Tom has decided to lay off sabotaging for the rest of the round. I'd love to introduce my father to Daria.<br>
<br>
Abby: Tom, look out the window and see if you can discover Violet's father. (Tom looks out the window and examines the crowd. Eventually, he sees a tall, sturdy man with facial features similar to Violet's. He's watching a kid playing in the square. At one point, the man looks up and Tom sees that his eyes are brown and deep-set, just like Violet's.)<br>
<br>
Tom: That man is Violet's father. (He points to the man watching the kid.)<br>
<br>
Abby: If you're that certain, we'll bring him out and see if he is really Violet's father. (Abby goes and gets the man.) Is this your father, Violet?<br>
<br>
Violet (lighting up): It's him, all right! (She rushes out to hug her father, who's just as happy to see her.)<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay, everyone! That's another $10,000 added to the pot. Mark, it's your turn. (Mark goes up with Abby, and he's told the same thing everyone else is told.) Who do you want to have find your best friend?<br>
<br>
Mark: That's easy. Fern. (Abby gets Fern, and Mark describes his best friend.)<br>
<br>
Abby: Fern, look out the window, and see if you can find Alan. (Fern looks out, but she's obviously having a hard time finding him. Finally, she spots one young man walking around, gazing at the crowd.)<br>
<br>
Fern: I think that's the guy. (She points to the young man walking around.)<br>
<br>
Abby: Are you certain?<br>
<br>
Fern: As certain as I'll ever be.<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay, then. (She brings out the young man.) Is this Alan, Mark?<br>
<br>
Mark (shaking his head sadly): No.<br>
<br>
As the young man exits, we hear Mark do his confessional.<br>
<br>
Mark: I tried to give her as many details about Alan as I could remember. Either my memory was faultier than I thought, or there were several guys who fit his description. Then again, there's probably a lot of blond-haired, blue-eyed guys around here.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, unfortunately, you didn't earn any money for the pot this time. Tom, you're up last. (Tom goes with Abby.) Tom, who do you want to find your sister?<br>
<br>
Tom: Raul. (Abby goes to get Raul.)<br>
<br>
Abby: Tom, please describe Elsie to Raul.<br>
<br>
As Tom describes Elsie to Raul, we hear him doing his confessional.<br>
<br>
Tom: I don't think Raul's the Mole. But I do think he's too close to the real Mole, and she might manipulate Raul for her own purposes.<br>
<br>
Raul then looks out around the square, completely overlooking a girl dressed in the same clothes Elsie would wear, who's looking at the fountain. He then sees another girl, standing in an arcade, watching the crowd walk by.<br>
<br>
Raul: I think that girl is Elsie. (He points to the girl standing in an arcade.)<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay, then, we'll get her. (Once she's gotten the girl,) Tom, is this Elsie?<br>
<br>
Tom: No. (He glares at Raul as the girl is led away. Nobody sees Violet and Daria sharing small smiles.)<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, you earned $20,000 for the pot, bringing your total up to $290,000! Daria, Fern, Raul, and Violet, you all got to see your loved ones -- and so will Mark and Tom! Let's bring out Alan and Elsie!<br>
<br>
Alan and Elsie emerge to greet Mark and Tom. Both of them are happy to see their loved ones, even if Tom and Elsie don't really show it.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, then, let's all return to the Hotel Belle Epoque, where you can spend the rest of the day with your loved ones. Tomorrow, you'll be sightseeing with your loved ones, and then -- you take the quiz.<br>
<br>
Everyone returned to the hotel, the contestants introducing their loved ones along the way.<br>
<br>
*************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): When we come back, the contestants will take the quiz, and we'll have our fifth execution.<br>
<br>
*************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 5: Belle Epoque, later that night<br>
<br>
Daria shows Jane all the information she's obtained so far.<br>
<br>
Jane: I knew you'd do well in the game! So, Tom's the Mole?<br>
<br>
Daria: That's what it looks like at the time. I've already eliminated Violet; otherwise, I'd never have formed a coalition with her.<br>
<br>
Jane (smirking): I can guess. She seems like a nice girl, and she obviously has a high tolerance for sarcasm and cynicism.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, we see Violet showing her father what she's done so far.<br>
<br>
Richard Many Horses: That was smart of you, deciding to form a coalition with Daria.<br>
<br>
Violet: I agree, Father. She's really a nice girl. You just have to accept her quirks. And she's real smart.<br>
<br>
Richard Many Horses: If you two get to the finals, do you think you'll have a chance against Daria?<br>
<br>
Violet: It isn't over till it's over. But I do think the odds are against me. Still, if I had to do it all over again, I would've still formed the coalition with Daria.<br>
<br>
We then see Raul showing his mother information that he'd written down in his diary.<br>
<br>
Emilia Hernandez: So you think Fern is the Mole?<br>
<br>
Raul: She has to be the one! If you take a look at all that I've written down, you'll agree with me!<br>
<br>
Emilia (reading the information): She does seem to be a prime suspect. I just hope you have the right person.<br>
<br>
We then see Mark and Alan looking at the stuff Mark wrote down about Violet and Raul.<br>
<br>
Alan: I think Violet's the more suspicious of the two.<br>
<br>
Mark: That's what I thought. But then Raul failed to find Tom's sister. I'm so torn.<br>
<br>
We finally see Fern showing Terrence her diary, with plenty on Violet.<br>
<br>
Terrence: Violet certainly looks like she could be the Mole. She's really sneaky.<br>
<br>
Fern: I know. But I'm onto her. Trust me, she won't get away from me.<br>
<br>
Time passes, and it's the next morning. We see the contestants leaving the Hotel Belle Epoque, and heading to the across the river to see the Rose Garden. As they stroll through the park, we cut to Daria and Jane doing an interview.<br>
<br>
Jane: Daria? Sure, she could be the Mole. (Smirking,) But she could be an even better winner.<br>
<br>
Next, the group goes to the City of Fountains. As we see Fern and Terrence looking at the Justice Fountain in awe, we see them doing interviews.<br>
<br>
Terrence: Fern could definitely be the Mole. She's quiet, so that would enable her to fade into the woodwork. Few people would suspect her.<br>
<br>
We then see them going to the French Church, the oldest church in Bern. As the contestants go on a tour through the church, we see Mark and Alan doing interviews.<br>
<br>
Alan: Mark? He could be the Mole, true enough. But somehow, I don't see him as the Mole. And I know him much better than anyone in the game.<br>
<br>
Later, we see the contestants eating lunch in the Goldener Schlussel at Rathausgasse 72, then we see the contestants heading to the Zytglogge Turm, the clock tower. As the contestants walk through, admiring the view, we cut to Raul and his mother, who are doing interviews.<br>
<br>
Emilia: Raul? The Mole? Not very likely. Though he could be good enough to make some people think he's the Mole. (She laughs.)<br>
<br>
Later the contestants head on over to the Botanical Gardens. As they walk through, admiring all the plants, we see Tom and Elsie doing an interview.<br>
<br>
Elsie: Sure Tom could be the Mole. He's quasi-rebellious, so pretending to be something he's not should be no trouble.<br>
<br>
Tom: Pay no attention to Elsie. That's just her faux jadedness talking. (2)<br>
<br>
Later on, the contestants head to the Zoological Gardens. As they walk through it, admiring the animals , we see Violet and her father doing interviews.<br>
<br>
Richard: Oh yeah. Violet could definitely be the Mole. She's got such a strategic mind. She knows how to play the game. Trust me.<br>
<br>
Finally, we see the contestants going to the Gothic Cathedral. Everyone looks around in awe -- except for Daria and Elsie, who look bored, and Jane, who's sketching the cathedral as she walks.<br>
<br>
**************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 6: Terrace Restaurant, Hotel Belle Epoque<br>
<br>
We see all the contestants and their loved ones eating dinner, along with Abby.<br>
<br>
Abby: So, I want to ask you. How does it feel, being reunited with your loved ones? Raul?<br>
<br>
Raul: It feels great! Seeing Mama reminds me of just why I entered the game. My father abandoned us, and my mother's had to struggle as a waitress. Although my uncle's been a great father figure, and provided enough money for us to have some comforts and to get me into college, if I win the money, I'm going to give it all to my mother. (Everyone [even Daria, Elsie, and Jane] look touched by his statement.)<br>
<br>
Abby: That is so nice. Daria, what about you? How does it feel, seeing Jane?<br>
<br>
Daria: It actually feels great! She's one of the few faces from Lawndale I'm actually happy to see again. (Everyone smiles at that.)<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay, let's move on to the game itself. Fern, you and Raul both got exemptions. How does it feel, knowing that you can't be eliminated?<br>
<br>
Fern: It feels great! Unfortunately, I wish Mark could've earned an exemption as well.<br>
<br>
Abby: I'm sure. After dinner, you'll take the quiz, and for one of the four who *is* eligible for execution, it's so long, have a nice time, and at least you can go home with your loved one. (They all react to that, as Abby proposes a toast.) Cheers!<br>
<br>
They all do the toast as Abby continues.<br>
<br>
Abby: The quiz. Ten questions about the Mole. Whoever knows the least about the Mole will be executed and must leave the game immediately. Question 1: Is the Mole male or female?<br>
<br>
Mark (confessional): Violet or Raul? Violet or Raul? Man, this is such a tough choice!<br>
<br>
Abby: Question 2: What did the Mole have for breakfast at the Windows Cafe? Question 3: What did the Mole do during the Race around the Cathedral Challenge? (The answers are "Runner," "Watched from the rooftop," "Watched and communicated with one of the runners," and "Watched and ran.")<br>
<br>
Tom (confessional): I think Violet was up to something in that challenge. But I don't know if that means she's the Mole, or if she had some other game plan in mind.<br>
<br>
Abby: Question 4: Which room did the Mole stay in at the Hotel Mirabeau? Question 5: On the way to Lausanne, who were the Mole's companions?<br>
<br>
Violet (confessional): I know that Daria, Raul, and I travelled in one car, while Fern, Mark, and Tom travelled in the other one.<br>
<br>
Abby: Question 6: Who did the Mole choose to be his eyes in the View from the Prison Tower Challenge?<br>
<br>
Raul (confessional): I believe I'm all set for the finals, where I can expose Fern as the Mole.<br>
<br>
Abby: Question 7: How many exemptions has the Mole earned? Question 8: What is the relationship of the Mole's loved one to the Mole?<br>
<br>
Fern (confessional): While Raul might've deliberately sabotaged that challenge, I'm certain Violet instigated it because she's the Mole.<br>
<br>
Abby: Question 9: What is the Mole's favorite food? Question 10: Who is the Mole?<br>
<br>
Daria (confessional): Trust me, Tom's ability to fool everyone has come to an end.<br>
<br>
***********************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 7: Conference Room, Hotel Belle Epoque<br>
<br>
The camera pans over all six bags, finally resting on Mark's bag. We then see the six contestants and their loved ones walk in and take their seats. Abby's sitting behind a computer, as always.<br>
<br>
Abby: Good evening, everyone. For the loved ones, I'll explain how this works. In a few moments, I'll be typing names into the computer. If a green screen appears, you remain in the game. If a red screen appears, you have been executed. You must pick up your bags and leave with your loved one immediately. Fern and Raul, you have exemptions, so you can't be executed. Unfortunately, the rest of you *are* eligible. Understand? (Everyone nods.) Okay then. Daria.<br>
<br>
She types Daria's name into the computer. Daria and Jane watch expectantly. A green screen appears. Jane smirks at Daria, who looks stoic as usual.<br>
<br>
Abby: Tom.<br>
<br>
Violet and Daria look at Tom as Abby types his name into the computer. Tom just stares ahead. When the green screen appears, he turns and smirks at Elsie.<br>
<br>
Abby: Mark.<br>
<br>
Mark watches nervously as his name is typed in. After a moment, he gets the red screen. Mark sighs, then gets up, grabs his bag, and leaves with Abby and Alan. Sad music plays as all three leave.<br>
<br>
Raul: Mark was one of the few people I eliminated as the Mole early on, because he was such a team player. (We see Mark doing the bungee jump, then we see him working in the pits in the Race For Life Challenge.)<br>
<br>
Daria: I'll actually miss Mark. He tried to keep the peace between me and Keith. (We see Mark trying to calm things down after Keith insulted both Daria and Tom.)<br>
<br>
Tom: Mark was a good guy. He did his best, and he always tried hard. (We see Mark skiing, then we see him pretending to be Colonel Mustard in the Clue Challenge.)<br>
<br>
Fern: I'm going to miss Mark so much. He was a good coalition partner for me. Unfortunately, somebody screwed him up. (We see Mark answering questions in the Geography Challenge, then giving his description of Alan to Fern.)<br>
<br>
By now, Mark, Alan, and Abby have reached the outside of Belle Epoque, where a limo is waiting for them both.<br>
<br>
Abby: What went wrong, Mark?<br>
<br>
Mark: I think Raul and maybe Violet worked together to confuse me. They sure succeeded. Well, that's the way things go. See you sometime soon.<br>
<br>
Abby: You too. See you soon.<br>
<br>
Mark and Alan get into the limo, and it leaves the hotel.<br>
