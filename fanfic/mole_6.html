"Mole? Somebody get me a dermatologist!"<br>
by Belle Book<br>
<br>
Chapter Six<br>
<br>
Scene 1: Hotel Belle Epoque, Bern<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): Previously on Teen Mole -- the contestants had to earn money for the pot by stopping Raul from grabbing seven pieces of green paper. (We see Fern begin running through the area around the Cathedral in Lausanne.) while Raul failed to earn an exemption for himself the first time around, he succeeded the second time. (We see Raul grab a piece of paper just as Tom emerges from an alleyway.) Later on, the contestants have the opportunity to see their loved ones. (We hear Violet's reaction when she learns her father will be coming.) However, each contestant will have to choose someone to be their eyes and spot their loved one from the Prison Tower in Bern. (We see Daria being reunited with Jane.) And Violet's strategy to get rid of Mark pays off as Mark becomes the fifth victim of the Mole. (We see Mark's execution, then see him leave with his best friend, Alan.)<br>
<br>
The James Bond-type music returns as Abby continues:<br>
<br>
Abby: Ten contestants. One winner. Each one attempting to win a jackpot up to a million dollars. However, one of the contestants has been hired by the producers to sabotage the game. That someone is the Mole. Each round, the contestants have to take a quiz. Whoever knows the least about the Mole will be executed and must leave the game immediately. Who is the Mole?<br>
<br>
We then see clips of Fern, Raul, Daria, Tom, and Violet. As the credits run, we see several people doing confessionals.<br>
<br>
Fern: I wish Mark hadn't gotten so confused. Violet is behind this, I just know it!<br>
<br>
Raul: Fern's mad because Mark got himself executed. It's probably just a ploy to trick us all, however.<br>
<br>
Tom: Violet's really sneaky. I would be willing to bet she's the Mole and is pulling all our strings.<br>
<br>
Violet: Well, Mark's gone. Unfortunately, for me to make the finals for certain, Raul's going to have to go this round. I hate having to do this to him, but it's all part of the game.<br>
<br>
Daria: Let Tom slide through the game, sabotaging the games subtly. All the better for Violet and I. (She smiles slightly.)<br>
<br>
We then cut to the terrace restaurant, where we see Abby and the remaining five contestants having breakfast. Tom is having pancakes while Raul is having an omelette.<br>
<br>
Abby: So, you have made it past the half-way point. You are the final five. How does that feel?<br>
<br>
Raul: It feels great! However, I had quite a bit of help getting to this point.<br>
<br>
Abby: Anybody else?<br>
<br>
Fern: I'm glad I made it this far. However, it feels a little hollow without Mark here. I had a coalition with him, after all.<br>
<br>
Abby: It must be sad for you, Fern. Anybody else? Violet?<br>
<br>
Violet: Well, I'm glad I made it this far as well. And what's more, I'm hoping to make it to the finals! It'll be great if I reach it!<br>
<br>
Abby: Daria, you got to see Jane again. What was that like for you?<br>
<br>
Daria: It was just like a piece of home. Only one of the few better parts. (Everyone smiles at that.)<br>
<br>
Abby: Now, I have a question for you all. How many people are looking forward to seeing more of Switzerland? (Several people raise their hands.) Well, I've got some good news for you -- pack your bags as soon as breakfast is done, for we're off to Zurich, Switzerland!<br>
<br>
As the contestants react, we see several of them doing confessionals.<br>
<br>
Tom: Looks like we'll be heading to Germany if this keeps up. I'm looking forward to it.<br>
<br>
Raul: Switzerland is so beautiful. So different from New York! And I'll bet Zurich will be prettier than New York.<br>
<br>
Fern: I'm looking forward to going to Zurich. It's one of the world's financial centers. Also, there's the Swiss Institute of Technology there. I'd like to go through it sometime.<br>
<br>
We then see a map of the contestants heading from Bern to Zurich. As we do so, we hear Abby doing a voice-over:<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): Once we arrived in Zurich, we headed straight to the Dolder Grand Hotel, where we had reservations for three nights. Once we arrived, the contestants went to their own rooms to unpack. (We catch a glimpse of the contestants all going into individual rooms.) Once we did that, we had lunch in the terrace/garden restaurant, then it was off to the Central Library on Zahringerplatz and our next challenge.<br>
<br>
**************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 2: Central Library, Zurich<br>
<br>
Abby is standing with the remaining five contestants.<br>
<br>
Abby: This next challenge will test your intellectual skills. I want one person who would be at home in a library. (Everyone points to Daria.) Daria, since you were chosen by the group, do you want to know what your task will be?<br>
<br>
Daria: No. But I have no choice. (Everyone smiles at that.)<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay, then. Your task is to answer four literary questions. Each answer you give will correspond to a particular book which the other four must find. Each book they find will contain a ticket to one of four particular locations: the Daros Exhibitions Museum, the North American Native Museum, the Theatersaal Rigblick, and the Golf and Country Club Zurich. Each person must go to one of the four locations. Once there, they must pick up a horse and buggy which will pick up each person and return them here to the Central Library. You must do this within one hour in order to earn $40,000 for the pot.<br>
<br>
Fern (confessional): $40,000! That's a perfect temptation for the Mole! I can expect sabotage in this challenge!<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay, Daria. Here's your first question. "My best-known work is a classic tale which appears to be about vampires but which also explores Victorian sexual mores and the problems Western science has in combating true evil. What is the name of my book? And who am I?"<br>
<br>
Daria: Let me check the card catalog. (She rushes over to it, and goes straight to the D's. Soon --) Yes! Here it is! Dracula, written by Bram Stoker! (She gives out the call number.) Who wants to go get it?<br>
<br>
Fern: I will! (She rushes off with the call number, leaving Abby to give the next question.)<br>
<br>
Abby: Here's the next question. "I wrote a novel about a lieutenant who was sent to an abandoned army post and eventually became part of a band of Comanches. This book later became a motion picture, where the Comanches became the Lakota. What is the name of the book? And who am I?"<br>
<br>
Violet: I know that one! It's one of the few movies about Native Americans I enjoy! Dances with Wolves!<br>
<br>
Daria (looking in the card catalog): Here it is! Dances with Wolves, written by Michael Blake. (She hands the call number to Violet, just as Fern rushes back with a green card.)<br>
<br>
Fern: I found this in the Dracula book. It's a ticket to the Golf and Country Club Zurich! I'll take a taxi! (She promptly rushes out with the ticket in hand, just as Violet rushes off to find the Dances with Wolves book.)<br>
<br>
Abby: Here is your next question. "I am perhaps the world's best-known dramatist, and perhaps my best-known work is that of a prince haunted by a ghost who demands revenge. What is the name of this play? And who am I?"<br>
<br>
Daria: That's easy! (She rushes back to the card catalog. Soon,) Yes! I found it! Hamlet, written by William Shakespeare! Who wants to find it?<br>
<br>
Tom: I will. (He gets the call number, then rushes off to get the book.)<br>
<br>
Meanwhile at the entrance to the Golf and Country Club, a taxi pulls up. Fern gets out and begins waiting for the buggy to show up. Back at the library --<br>
<br>
Abby: Here is your final question, Daria. "I wrote the best-known example of gaucho literature in the year 1872. What is the name of the poem I wrote? And who am I?" (Daria begins thinking hard about it, as does Raul. As they are thinking it over, Violet returns with another green card.)<br>
<br>
Violet: Here's a ticket to the North American Native Museum! I'll take this one! (She rushes out of the library. Meanwhile the horse and buggy shows up at the Golf and Country Club. Fern gets inside it and they go off.)<br>
<br>
Daria: I know gauchos are Aregentinian cowboys. I'll start looking in the card catalog under Latin American literature. (As she looks, Tom rushes back with the third green card.)<br>
<br>
Tom: Here's a ticket to the Theatersaal Rigblick! I'll head on over there! (He rushes out of the library. Meanwhile, Daria is looking through the Latin American Literature subject cards. Finally --)<br>
<br>
Daria: Here it is! Martin Fierro, written by Jose Hernandez! (She hands Raul the call number, and he rushes off.)<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, a taxi pulls up at the North American Native Museum. Violet gets out, and waits for the horse and buggy. Soon thereafter, a taxi pulls up at the Theatersaal Rigblick. Tom gets out of it and waits for the horse and buggy. Back at the library --<br>
<br>
Raul (rushing back with a green card): Here's a ticket to the Daros Exhibition Museum! I'll take a taxi there! (He too rushes out of the library. Meanwhile, both Violet and Tom are still waiting. Finally, a horse and buggy comes up to one of them. Fern is inside it.)<br>
<br>
Violet: What kept you? (She gets inside the horse and buggy. They head off to Tom. We now see that there are 40 minutes left.)<br>
<br>
*********************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): When we come back, contestants see the sights of Zurich (we catch a glimpse of the contestants going through the Fraumunster Church), race through the streets for an exemption (we catch a glimpse of Raul rushing out and of a sniper firing at him), and have their sixth quiz and execution.<br>
<br>
*********************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 3: Daros Exhibitions Museum, Zurich<br>
<br>
A taxi pulls up. Raul gets out and pays the driver. Then he sits down on the museum steps and waits.<br>
<br>
Raul (confessional): I took a look at my watch and saw that there were about 40 minutes left. I had reason to hope that there would be plenty of time for the horse and buggy to reach me, but I wasn't certain.<br>
<br>
Ten minutes pass. Finally, at the Theatersaal Rigblick --<br>
<br>
Tom: Great! We have 30 minutes left! (He hops right into the horse and buggy, sitting next to Fern. They head off to Raul. Back at the Daros Exhibitions Museum --<br>
<br>
Raul: 30 minutes left! I just hope they reach me soon! (10 more minutes pass. Finally,) Yes! You made it! And with 20 minutes left!<br>
<br>
He hops into the buggy, sitting next to Violet. The horse and buggy heads back towards the Central Library, where Daria and Abby are waiting nervously. Their nervousness is intersected with shots of the horse and buggy heading through the streets of Zurich. Finally, with about 10 minutes left --<br>
<br>
Abby: You guys made it back, and with 10 minutes to spare! Great job! And $40,000 dollars has been added to the pot, giving you a total of $330,000! (Everyone cheers.) Now, I'm certain that you would like to get back to the Dolder Grand Hotel and relax. But first, how many people want to do some sightseeing of Zurich? (Everyone raises their hand.) Great. You can go back to the Grand Dolder Hotel, relax a bit, and then at about 4:00, you all must be ready to see the sights of Zurich!<br>
<br>
As the contestants return to the Grand Dolder Hotel, we hear people doing their confessionals.<br>
<br>
Tom: Both Raul and Daria had a hard time answering the final question. In fact, Daria had to look in the card catalog for the answer. If Keith and Mark hadn't been eliminated already, I might suspect Daria and Raul more.<br>
<br>
Raul: I think I had a brain cramp. I finally realized that the best-known example of gaucho literature was the Martin Fierro poem; but by the time I did, Daria beat me to it. Oh well.<br>
<br>
Fern: The Mole didn't really strike in this challenge. I wonder why.<br>
<br>
Violet: This probably wasn't a good opportunity for the Mole to sabotage the game. There's probably a better one later on.<br>
<br>
Daria: Well, I was the hero of this challenge. Just like Kathryn was in the first Mole series. Unlike Kathryn, however, I'm not the Mole.<br>
<br>
********************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 4: Grand Dolder Hotel, Zurich<br>
<br>
Daria and Violet are in Daria's hotel room, checking the answers to the quizzes.<br>
<br>
Violet: It's a good thing you had the foresight to write down the answers to as many of the quizzes as you could remember.<br>
<br>
Daria: Yeah. And it's a good thing I agreed to join your coalition. In more ways than one.<br>
<br>
Violet (smiling): Thanks. In any case, I think Tom's going to strike in the next challenge.<br>
<br>
Daria: Probably. He certainly didn't strike here.<br>
<br>
Raul (confessional): I've noticed that Daria and Violet are spending a lot of time together. More time than Violet spends with me now, as a matter of fact. They've probably got a coalition formed, which means I'll soon be out unless Fern is the Mole.<br>
<br>
At 4:00 the five contestants arrive. Abby is there to greet them.<br>
<br>
Abby: Hello, guys. It's time to go sightseeing, and I have a van reserved for all of you. (They all cheer.) You'll be returning to your hotel at 8:00 so you can get baths and just relax. But for now -- it's time to go sightseeing.<br>
<br>
We then see a montage of the contestants travelling to the various locations of the city, interspersed with confessionals from the five players left in the game. The first stop is the Water Church/Helmhaus, where there are exhibitions of various painters. Daria looks at some of the paintings.<br>
<br>
Daria: Maybe someday Jane's work will be shown here.<br>
<br>
Tom: Maybe. I'd like that. She has talent.<br>
<br>
The next stop is the University/FIT building next door to the University of Zurich. They are also given a guided tour of the building. Fern is especially eager to go through the building.<br>
<br>
Fern (confessional): As someone who'd like to be a computer programmer someday, of course I was thrilled to go through this important place in Zurich. I was like a kid in a candy store. (She grins at that.)<br>
<br>
The next stop is the Botanical Gardens at the University of Zurich. Everyone stares in awe, even Daria and Tom.<br>
<br>
Daria (confessional): Where else in Zurich could you find so many different forests and gardens from so many different climates? Hopefully, the tropical rain forest part isn't going to be the only place you can find the flora from that climate. But I wouldn't hold my breath on that one.<br>
<br>
Close to 6:00, the contestants go to Zic Zac restaurant on Marketgasse. Abby, Fern, and Raul all get huge burgers, while Daria, Tom, and Violet all get pizza.<br>
<br>
Tom: You're having pizza, Violet?<br>
<br>
Violet: Daria told me all about her pizza sessions with Jane. And with you. So, I wanted to try some pizza.<br>
<br>
Daria: How do you like the pizza, Violet?<br>
<br>
Violet (after eating part of a slice of pizza): Hey, this is good! I'm glad I decided to try it.<br>
<br>
Daria (to Tom): Never underestimate the joys of pizza.<br>
<br>
Tom (smirking): How true. How true.<br>
<br>
After finishing their dinner, the contestants go to the Backer Park, where they stroll through one of the most beautiful parks in Zurich. Raul is particularly in awe.<br>
<br>
Raul (confessional): I'm used to the streets of New York and to a section that is not very pretty at all, so to see so many beautiful parks is a dream come true for me! No matter how I do in the game, I'll always cherish moments like this.<br>
<br>
Next up for the contestants is Insel-Plastik, a fountain with an island haven in the middle of it.<br>
<br>
Raul: Wow! This is really lovely! You sure don't get to see sights like this in the slums of New York, where I live.<br>
<br>
Fern: That's definitely true. Nor do you always get to see sights like this in California. It's a Mediterranean climate according to Mark. A dry summer, a rainy winter. And there certainly aren't mountains like the ones here in California!<br>
<br>
Then there's a guided tour of the Fraumunster Church. Everyone (even Daria and Tom) look around in awe, especially at the stained glass window done by Marc Chagall.<br>
<br>
Tom (confessional): I'm glad Jane and I got Daria into this game. Though she'll never say so, I'm certain she's having a blast!<br>
<br>
The final stop is the Lindenhof, where there's plenty of chess players. Violet eagerly watches a chess game in progress.<br>
<br>
Violet (confessional): I'm lucky my ancestors somehow bought a chess board, and kept it in the family. It's been in the family for generations, and my brothers and I all learned how to play chess. I sometimes think of this game as like a chess game, especially after you find the Mole.<br>
<br>
By this time, it's close to 8:00, and the contestants, along with Abby, go back to the Grand Dolder Hotel. Once they get inside, they all go back to their rooms, where they get baths or showers.<br>
<br>
Raul (confessional): It's nice to have separate rooms for a switch. Clearly the game is now in the individual phase.<br>
<br>
Fern (confessional): Tom and I are the only people who don't have coalitions. However, I'm certain that Raul and Daria have a coalition with the Mole. And I think Daria knows Violet's the Mole, so Raul might be in trouble. Unless Tom thinks I'm the Mole.<br>
<br>
Tom (confessional): Daria and Violet. Now there's a pair I never expected to get together when I began this game. However, they seem to be getting along quite nicely. Maybe Daria can actually make friends with a person who isn't quite as sarcastic as she is. But that person still has to have a high tolerance of sarcasm and cynicism, and Violet certainly seems to have that.<br>
<br>
Violet (confessional): There's only one problem with this game. You have to figure out who the Mole is and get the most information as you possibly can. Once you find out who the Mole is, you also have to deceive others and lead them off the trail. But you actually form friendships in the game, so that makes it tough when you have to deceive a person you've formed a coalition with, and whom you might consider a friend, so that you can make the finals with someone else, and he can't. I have to do just that, and while I will do it, it'll probably be the toughest thing I ever did. And perhaps the one thing I most regret.<br>
<br>
The last shot we have is that of Daria looking into her journal, and then writing some stuff into it.<br>
<br>
Daria (confessional): Now that Violet and I already have figured out who the Mole is, and now that we're eliminating as many people as we can so we can get into the finals with the Mole, it's time to record as much information about the Mole as you possibly can. I have an advantage here. I'm very observant, and I know the Mole much better than even Violet does. Still, she's going to be a tough competitor. (Smirking,) But a tough competitor makes winning even better! Though you'll never catch me saying that.<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): So eventually, everyone went to bed and had a good night's sleep, blissfully unaware of what their next challenge would be. Except for the Mole, of course.<br>
<br>
*******************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): When we come back, the contestants have to run through the streets of Zurich to earn an exemption (we catch a glimpse of Daria trying to avoid a sniper). After that, it's time for the quiz, and our sixth execution.<br>
<br>
*******************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 5: Outside the Grand Dolder Hotel<br>
<br>
Abby and the five contestants are outside about an hour after they finished eating lunch.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, no doubt you're wondering what the next challenge will be.<br>
<br>
Raul: You got it!<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, your next challenge will involve an exemption. (Everyone reacts at that.) Your task is to get to the Grossmunster church, the most famous church in Zurich, reach the top of one of the twin towers, and ring the bell there. Only one of you can ring the bell. If that happens, I will add $40,000 to the pot, and the person who rings the bell will earn an exemption! If more than one person reaches the church, $40,000 will be added for each person that reaches the church, but they must decide who'll get the exemption. (Everyone reacts to that.) However, there is a catch.<br>
<br>
Daria (in her usual monotone): There always is a catch. (Everyone chuckles at that.)<br>
<br>
Abby: You're right as usual, Daria. This time, the catch is that you have to avoid a group of snipers sent by the Mole to prevent you from reaching the church. If a sniper shoots at you and hits you, you are out of the challenge. You must split up and try to reach the church as quickly as you possibly can without getting hit. Here's a map for each of you. (She hands out a map to each of the five players, along with walkie-talkies.) You also have laser rifles that you can fire at the snipers to prevent being hit or your friends being hit. (She hands out the rifles to the players as well.) The snipers have laser rifles, and they'll all be dressed entirely in black, so you'll be able to tell if you're encountering a sniper.<br>
<br>
Fern (confessional): As soon as I heard about the challenge, I realized why the Mole hadn't struck in the first challenge. She was going to strike in this one. I just had to determine how she'll sabotage the game.<br>
<br>
Tom (confessional): I'm glad Daria got a laser rifle. She's not a fast runner, so she could use all the help she can get if she wants to do well in this challenge. Still, she's probably going to be the first one taken out.<br>
<br>
We now see the five contestants deciding amongst themselves the path each one should take.<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): Eventually the group decided to split four different ways. Daria would go one way, Tom another, Fern still another, and Violet a fourth way. Raul decided to stick with Violet and help her out.<br>
<br>
Some time later, we see the contestants in the starting position, waiting for Abby's signal.<br>
<br>
Abby: On your mark, get set, go!<br>
<br>
The contestants take off almost immediately. A few minutes later, Abby takes out a device with a button on it. She presses the button. Seconds later --<br>
<br>
Sniper #1: That's the signal! Let's go after them! (The snipers head off after the contestants.)<br>
<br>
We catch glimpses of the contestants looking around every corner to see if there's a sniper. Then we see a map of Zurich, and dots which represent Daria, Fern, Raul, Tom, and Violet. Daria is represented by a green dot, Fern by a red dot, Raul by a blue dot, Tom by a black one, and Violet by a purple dot. Abby then speaks:<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): Fern quickly took the lead, but Violet and Raul were right behind her. Tom was fourth, and Daria in last.<br>
<br>
As Daria creeps along, she suddenly spots a sniper. Fortunately, she's able to hide before the sniper spots her. As she's hiding, Violet and Raul nearly run into another sniper. Once the sniper passes, Raul slips around the corner, followed closely by Violet. The sniper turns, but Violet's gotten around the corner by that point. Meanwhile, Tom and Fern haven't run into any snipers yet.<br>
<br>
A minute later, a sniper suddenly encounters Tom. Tom fires at the sniper, then runs. Unfortunately, just before Tom can get around the corner and to safety, he trips, enabling the sniper to hit Tom.<br>
<br>
Tom (on his walkie-talkie): Ive been hit! I think I'm out of the game!<br>
<br>
Daria (confessional): Tom said he tripped, enabling the sniper to hit him. That's certainly a very convenient "trip," if you ask me. He certainly can't help any of us now that he's out.<br>
<br>
Only a couple of minutes later, Fern manages to avoid her first sniper. We see that according to the map, she's the closest one to the Grossmunster Church, though Violet and Raul aren't far behind. Daria is way behind the others, however.<br>
<br>
Then, Daria spots another sniper. She hides, waiting for the sniper to pass. When he does, she begins to tiptoe past. Unfortunately, as she's tiptoeing past, the sniper turns around! Spotting her, he fires at once.<br>
<br>
Daria: Damn!<br>
<br>
Raul (confessional): Daria's being eliminated early in the challenge -- that's no big surprise. I would've been surprised if she made it to the church.<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): With Daria out, that left Fern, Raul, and Violet as the only people who could make it to the church.<br>
<br>
Several minutes later, Raul and Violet are faced with a dilemma. Two snipers are nearby, patrolling the area. There's a tree that they can reach, but it'll be hard for them to both get past the sniper.<br>
<br>
Violet: Damn! One of us is going to get taken out for sure!<br>
<br>
Raul: And that someone's not going to be you! Trust me on that!<br>
<br>
Violet (surprised): You mean -- ?<br>
<br>
Raul: Yeah. I'm going to be the fall guy. I'll get you past those snipers.<br>
<br>
Violet: Are you certain?<br>
<br>
Raul (after a moment's pause): Yeah.<br>
<br>
Violet: Well then -- good luck.<br>
<br>
Raul: You too! (He took a deep breath, then rushed out past one of the two snipers. The first sniper rushed after him, firing. Violet took the opportunity to sneak past the second sniper, who was distracted enough to not pay attention too carefully. Meanwhile, the first sniper managed to hit Raul.)<br>
<br>
Violet (confessional): I hated to see Raul sacrifice himself, especially since I knew that if he didn't get the exemption, he would most likely be out of the game this upcoming round. But on the other hand -- he won't be getting that exemption, and he would stick around if he'd gotten it. And if he saw that Fern was not the Mole, he might suspect Tom, and that would hurt my chances more than if Fern stayed around.<br>
<br>
Both Fern and Violet head on over to the Grossmunster Church, avoiding snipers along the way. Almost a half-hour after the challenge began, we see a girl spot the Grossmunster Church. Taking care to see that there are no snipers nearby, she runs up to it and manages to slip inside. Once there, she gets on a walkie-talkie.<br>
<br>
Fern (to Violet): I'm inside the church.<br>
<br>
Violet (confessional): As soon as I heard that, I realized that I had a dilemma. Should I try to reach the church as well? Or should I let Fern get the exemption and take myself out of the game? I had to decide -- and I did.<br>
<br>
Only a few blocks from the church, Violet spotted a sniper. Instead of waiting until the sniper was past, Violet decided to run for a tree that she saw nearby. The sniper saw her and fired, hitting Violet.<br>
<br>
Violet (on walkie-talkie): I've been hit!<br>
<br>
Hearing this, and realizing that she was the only one left, Fern raced to a staircase that had been marked. She rushed up the stairs. Meanwhile, the snipers rushed toward the church. A minute later, one reached it, but by that point, Fern was half-way up the stairs that led to the top of the tower. The sniper rushed into the church, ran to the stairs, and started up the stairs, but it was too late. Fern managed to reach the top of the stairs, ran to the bell, and rang it. As she does so, we see that $40,000 has been added to the pot, bringing the total up to $370,000.<br>
<br>
Fern: Yes!<br>
<br>
The scene then shifts to the bottom of the stairs, where the previously eliminated contestants have arrived to greet Fern. As they are congraulating Fern, Abby comes up.<br>
<br>
Abby: Congraulations, everyone! You have earned $40,000 for the pot, bringing the total up to $300,000! (Everyone cheers.) And Fern, you have an exemption!<br>
<br>
Raul (confessional): I don't regret taking myself out for Violet's sake. But still, I don't like the odds for me at this point.<br>
<br>
Fern (confessional): I learned that Violet had allowed the sniper to hit her. Violet took herself out of the game because she didn't need that exemption! She's the Mole, after all.<br>
<br>
Violet (confessional): I let Fern have that exemption. It serves my purposes.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, you have earned a well-deserved break, so we'll go back to the hotel now and you can relax for the rest of the day. Tomorrow afternoon, we'll be going to see the Opera House. And I should tell you -- tomorrow night is the quiz, and your sixth execution.<br>
<br>
***************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 6: The Opera House, shortly before dinner the next day<br>
<br>
The contestants and Abby have just finished a guided tour of the Zurich Opera House.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, how did you like the grand tour?<br>
<br>
Tom: It was really interesting! Apparently they were working on a Mozart opera, and Mozart has written some great operas. Too bad Ann was eliminated so early. She would've loved the tour.<br>
<br>
Abby: I agree. Now, back to the game. How does it feel to have an exemption, Fern?<br>
<br>
Fern: It feels great! I'm happy to know I'm not going out this round.<br>
<br>
Raul: Well, I wish I was as lucky.<br>
<br>
Abby: You think you're going out this round, Raul?<br>
<br>
Raul: I have a bad feeling about it. But who knows, maybe Tom will go out.<br>
<br>
Daria (sotto voce, to Violet): Not likely.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, anybody else want to say anything about their chances? Violet?<br>
<br>
Violet: I'm cautiously optimistic. But I think I have a strong chance of making the finals.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, anyway, tonight, you'll be taking the quiz. Fern, you have an exemption, so you aren't eligible to be executed tonight. However, the same can't be said for the rest of you. So, whoever goes tonight, hasta la vista.<br>
<br>
Daria: Except for the Mole.<br>
<br>
Abby: Yes. Except for the Mole. The Mole can't be executed, of course.<br>
<br>
The scene then shifts back to the Grand Dolder Hotel at nightime. Abby speaks:<br>
<br>
Abby: The quiz. Ten questions about the Mole. Whoever knows the least about the Mole will be executed and must leave the game immediately. Question 1: Is the Mole male or female?<br>
<br>
Tom (confessional): Daria can't be the Mole, since Keith's out of the game. Raul can't be the Mole, since Mark's out of the game. That leaves Fern and Violet.<br>
<br>
Abby: Question 2: What did the Mole have for breakfast at the Hotel Belle Epoque? Question 3: Where did the Mole go during the Library Challenge? (The answers range from "The Golf and Country Club Zurich" to "Remained at the library".)<br>
<br>
Raul (confessional): I'm certain Fern's the Mole, and I'm all set to expose her. Unless Violet's misleading me.<br>
<br>
Abby: Question 4: What was the number of the Mole's room in the Grand Dolder Hotel? Question 5: Which book did the Mole go find during the Library Challenge? (The answers ranged from "Dracula" to "The Mole didn't go find any book".)<br>
<br>
Violet (confessional): At the time, I wondered if the Mole would pull some sabotage at the Library. But the Mole struck later on. I'm certain of it.<br>
<br>
Abby: Question 6: How many exemptions has the Mole earned so far in the game? (The answers range from "two" to "none".)<br>
<br>
Fern (confessional): Violet has earned no exemptions so far. It's probably because she doesn't need them -- because she's the Mole!<br>
<br>
Abby: Question 7: What color hair does the Mole have? Question 8: When was the Mole eliminated in the Sniper Challenge? (Answers range from "First" to "The Mole wasn't eliminated".)<br>
<br>
Daria (confessional): So far, so good. But this round's going to tell the tale. I'm pretty certain Tom's the Mole, but if Raul sticks around and either Violet or I don't, it's time to look at Fern.<br>
<br>
Abby: Question 9: How old is the Mole? Question 10: Who is the Mole?<br>
<br>

<br>
Scene 7: A room in the Grand Dolder Hotel, that night<br>
<br>
We see five bags. The camera pans over them, ending on Raul's bag. The five contestants arrive and sit down in the chairs.<br>
<br>
Abby: Welcome to your sixth execution. Now, Fern has an exemption, so she can't be executed. However, for one of the remaining four contestants, the journey ends here. I'll enter your names into the computer. If a green screen appears, you remain in the game. If a red screen appears, you are the Mole's sixth victim. You must pick up your bag and leave the game immediately. Understand? (They all nod.) Let's begin. Violet.<br>
<br>
She types Violet's name into the computer. Violet watches nervously. Soon, a green thumbprint appears. Violet smiles.<br>
<br>
Abby: Daria.<br>
<br>
She types Daria's name into the computer. Daria watches stoically. The green thumbprint appears. Daria gives one of her small smiles.<br>
<br>
Abby: Tom.<br>
<br>
She types Tom's name into the computer. The others all watch Tom. The green thumbprint appears, and Tom smirks. Violet looks pityingly at Raul, who sighs.<br>
<br>
Raul: Go ahead. Enter my name in. I want to get this over with.<br>
<br>
Abby: If that's what you want, okay then.<br>
<br>
She types Raul's name into the computer. Sure enough, Raul gets the red thumbprint. He sighs, then gets up, grabs his bag, and leaves with Abby as sad music begins to play.<br>
<br>
Fern: Raul was such a good player. He came from a tough background, but that gave him the strength to do well in this game. (We see Raul's meeting with his mother and his conversation about what he'd do for her if he won.)<br>
<br>
Violet: I'm sorry to see Raul go. He had become at least a casual friend during the time we spent in the game, and it's hard to know that he's out. (We see Raul bungee jumping, then running through the streets of Lyon, and finally running through the maze.)<br>
<br>
Daria: Raul. He was a strong competitor who was at least more interested in learning than many Hispanics seem to be. I'll actually miss him. (We see Raul as Professor Plum, and we see Raul predicting during the Skiing Challenge.)<br>
<br>
Tom: It's actually surprising to me to see Raul go. I thought he had the potential to make it at least a little bit farther. (We see Raul in the balloon challenge, running through the streets of Lausanne, and taking part in the Library Challenge.)<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, outside, Abby is talking to Raul.<br>
<br>
Abby: What do you think went wrong?<br>
<br>
Raul: I think Violet misled me into thinking the Mole was someone other than who it really is. And I think I know why.<br>
<br>
Abby: Are you mad at her?<br>
<br>
Raul: Right now, I am a little mad at her. But I'm not mad enough to throttle her for it.<br>
<br>
Abby (smiling): Of course. See you in the States, Raul.<br>
<br>
Raul: See you, Abby.<br>
<br>
He gets into a waiting limo, and it drives away. We then see the Final 4 being questioned by Abby.<br>
<br>
Abby: Daria, are you the Mole?<br>
<br>
Daria: No, I am not the Mole.<br>
<br>
Abby: Fern, are *you* the Mole?<br>
<br>
Fern: No, I am not the Mole.<br>
<br>
Abby: What about you, Tom? Are you the Mole?<br>
<br>
Tom: No, I am not the Mole. (Violet smiles to herself at that.)<br>
<br>
Abby: Violet, does that mean you are the Mole?<br>
<br>
Violet: No. It just means one of the other three is lying. And I know who is the Mole.<br>
<br>
We then see the pictures of all the contestants, along with the question "Who is the Mole?" As the word "Who" appears, we see Fern's picture. Then, we see Violet's picture as the word "Is" appears. After that, we see Daria's picture as the word "The" appears. And finally, we see Tom's picture as the word "Mole?" appears.<br>
<br>
WHO IS THE MOLE?<br>
<br>
FERN, VIOLET, DARIA, OR TOM?<br>
