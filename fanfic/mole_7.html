"Mole? Somebody get me a dermatologist!"<br>
by Belle Book<br>
<br>
Chapter Seven<br>
<br>
Scene 1: Grand Dolder Hotel, Zurich, Switzerland<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): Previously on Teen Mole -- Daria had to answer four literary questions which would lead the others to four different locations in Zurich. (We see Daria answering questions, then we see Violet jumping into a buggy at the North American Native Museum ). Afterwards, the contestants see the sights of Zurich. (We see Tom conversing with Daria at the Water Church/Helmhuas, then later see the contestants going through Fraumunster Church.) The next day, the contestants run through the streets of Zurich for an exemption. (We see Raul take himself out of the game, enabling Violet to continue on.) The run ended with Fern winning the exemption. (We see Fern ringing the bell.) In the end, Raul became the Mole's sixth victim. (We see Raul's execution.)<br>
<br>
The James-Bond music returns as Abby continues:<br>
<br>
Abby: Ten contestants. One winner. Each one attempting to win a jackpot up to a million dollars. However, one of the contestants has been hired by the producers to sabotage the game. That someone is the Mole. Each round, the contestants have to take a quiz. Whoever knows the least about the Mole will be executed and must leave the game immediately. Who is the Mole?<br>
<br>
We now see clips of Fern, Daria, Tom, and Violet. As the credits run, we see the Final Four doing confessionals.<br>
<br>
Fern: Raul trusted Violet, and he paid for it. However, I don't think Daria will make the same mistake. I think Tom will go instead.<br>
<br>
Daria: So far, so good. Violet's done a real good job in masterminding the executions of Mark and Raul. And all I have to do is sail along, and just take notes. Oh, and help Violet with her scheming, of course.<br>
<br>
Tom: Fern or Violet. One of those two is the Mole. I think it's Violet, but I could be wrong. I know it's not Daria, however.<br>
<br>
Violet: I'm sorry I didn't tell Raul I'm pretty certain Tom's the Mole, but if I had told him, I might not get into the finals. Now all I have to do is allow Fern to think I'm the Mole, and I'll be set for the finals. I might lose to Daria, but if I do, at least I tried.<br>
<br>
We now cut to breakfast at the Grand Dolder Hotel. Abby is eating breakfast with the Final Four.<br>
<br>
Abby: So. You have made the Final Four. How does it feel for you?<br>
<br>
Fern: It feels great! I strongly believe that I'm going to make the finals, and that would be great!<br>
<br>
Violet: I'm happy about it! But I'll be even happier if I make the finals.<br>
<br>
Abby: So true. What about you, Daria? Tom?<br>
<br>
Daria: Well, I'm actually having a good time. Of course, getting this far makes up for the way I was tricked into applying. (Everyone smiles at that.)<br>
<br>
Tom: I'm happy to get to the Final Four! And whatever happens, happens, as far as I'm concerned.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, do you want to know where your next stop is? (Everyone nods.) You're leaving Zurich -- and going to Friedrichshaften, Germany! You'll be spending a night in the Flair Hotel Adler, so pack your bags!<br>
<br>
Everyone cheers as we hear people doing confessionals.<br>
<br>
Fern: Looks like we'll be ending the game in Germany! I don't mind that -- Germany's a pretty place.<br>
<br>
Violet: I'm glad I was picked to go on this show. I never would've dreamed that I'd have gone to such places as Grenoble, France; Bern, Switzerland; and now Germany -- until I became a contestant.<br>
<br>
Daria: Germany should be an interesting place. At least it's not Lawndale. Or Highland, the home of Beavis and Butthead, everyone's least-favorite duo!<br>
<br>
Tom: Right now, Daria and Violet have a coalition. Fern and I don't. One of us will be going this round, and I hope I'm not the one.<br>
<br>
We then see a roadmap of the contestants heading from Zurich to Friedrichshaften, on the shores of Lake Constance. Then we zoom in on the contestants, who are travelling in a small van. Abby's driving the van, Fern and Tom are immediately behind the driver, and Daria and Violet are behind them. Both groups are conversing amongst themselves.<br>
<br>
Fern: How worried are you about Daria having a coalition with Violet?<br>
<br>
Tom: Not as worried as I was about Raul having one with Violet. Daria's a very smart girl, and I wouldn't put it past her to allow herself to join a coalition with the Mole just so she can observe the Mole up close and personal. Assuming the Mole's Violet, of course, and not you.<br>
<br>
Fern: I'm not the Mole. And I'm not that worried about Daria having a coalition with Violet, either. I don't think she's as likely to trust Violet completely as Raul was. Raul trusted Violet too much, and he paid for it.<br>
<br>
Tom: True. Very true.<br>
<br>
Violet: Maybe we'll be roommates at Raft University, Daria.<br>
<br>
Daria: That would be very interesting, considering that we met before our freshman year ever began. But as long as you're the type of person who won't throw wild parties while we're sharing a room, I wouldn't mind being your roommate.<br>
<br>
Violet: I'm not. If you play chess, you probably prefer peace and quiet. Besides, I'd probably wish to avoid parties during my freshman year, if not afterwards. I don't want my grades to suffer while I'm at college.<br>
<br>
Daria: Nor would I. Getting back to the game so far, it looks like Fern's going to go next, right?<br>
<br>
Violet: If she doesn't get an exemption, she will. She thinks that I'm the Mole. And it's in our best interests to make certain she doesn't get the final exemption.<br>
<br>
Daria: It sure is.<br>
<br>
We then cut to a glimpse of the contestants checking into the Ringhotel Krone Schnetzenhausen, and having lunch.<br>
<br>
*********************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 2: Outside the Ringhotel Krone Schnetzenhausen, after lunch<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay, gang. It's down to the four of you. One of you will be going home at the end of this round. But not before you do another series of challenges. For this challenge, I'm going to need two people that can ride bicycles, and two who aren't good at riding them.<br>
<br>
Quickly, Fern and Tom volunteer to be the bicycle riders.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well then, Fern and Tom, here is your part of the challenge. You have to follow a series of black, red, and gold flags to the Zeppelin Museum. Along the way, you will have to answer a series of questions about zeppelins, ending with a final question at the Zeppelin Museum. Each question you get correct, $10,000 will be added to the pot. There will be 4 questions in all, so you can earn up to $40,000 for the pot. Daria and Violet, you will take a boat trip to the Mainau Island of Flowers and Plants. There you will have to photograph four flowers or plants. Pictures showing each flower or plant will be given to you on the boat. For each flower or plant you photograph in 1 hour, $10,000 will be added to the pot, so you can earn up to $20,000 for the pot.<br>
<br>
Fern (confessional): We have to bicycle to the Zeppelin Museum while Daria and Violet get a boat trip to an island. Somehow, it doesn't seem fair.<br>
<br>
Violet (confessional): The Mole could strike in one of these challenges. But most likely, the Mole will allow others to screw up. It's the type of challenge that the Mole doesn't have to sabotage.<br>
<br>
We then see Fern and Tom suiting up and getting on their bicycles.<br>
<br>
Abby: On your mark, get set, GO!<br>
<br>
Fern and Tom take off. Abby then takes Daria and Violet to a waiting car, which will take them to the waiting boat.<br>
<br>
Fern and Tom follow a series of flags to their first question. Fern takes the paper containing the question off the flag. Nearby is a bench, with a laptop computer turned on.<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): Once the contestants get a question right, they will be allowed to continue on to the next question. If they don't get a question right before they reach the Zeppelin Museum, they will be directed to the dock where the boat to the Mainau Island goes.<br>
<br>
Fern (reading): "Who is the Zeppelin named after?"<br>
<br>
Tom: I remember reading it somewhere. I think it is Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, a retired German army officer.<br>
<br>
Fern: Okay, Zeppelin it is. (She types it into the laptop.) Yes! We can go on now!<br>
<br>
They bicycle on. A little while later, they come up to a flag with another piece of paper. This time, Tom takes it.<br>
<br>
Tom (reading): "What year did Zeppelin launch his first airship?" I think it was sometime in the early 1900s.<br>
<br>
Fern: Oh, I remember! It's 1900!<br>
<br>
Tom: You certain?<br>
<br>
Fern: Yes. I read it in a World History class.<br>
<br>
Tom: Okay, then. (He types it in. Soon, the reply comes.) You got it right again! We can move on now!<br>
<br>
They bicycle on. A little bit before the Zeppelin Museum, they come across a flag with a question attached. Fern grabs it.<br>
<br>
Fern (reading): "Which airship inspired the famous phrase, 'Oh, the humanity!'?"<br>
<br>
Tom (smirking): I know that one. The Hindenburg. I once compared the crash of a float to it. (1)<br>
<br>
Fern types it into the computer. Soon --<br>
<br>
Fern: Yes! We can head straight to the Zeppelin Museum!<br>
<br>
They bicycle right up to the Zeppelin Museum. Once there, they park their bicycles, then approach a guard.<br>
<br>
Tom: Excuse me, we're contestants in a game. Do you happen to have something for us?<br>
<br>
Guard: Yes, I do. (He hands them an envelope. Tom opens it. Inside, there's a final question.)<br>
<br>
Tom: Final question. "Who is the person that influenced Zeppelin's work?" Damn! I don't know that one!<br>
<br>
Fern: I don't know either. (She thinks for a moment, then gets an idea.) I heard about some guy named Alberto Santos-Dumont. Let's try him.<br>
<br>
Tom: Okay. (To guard:) Alberto Santos-Dumont?<br>
<br>
Guard: Sorry, you're wrong. The correct answer is David Schwartz, an Austrian engineer.<br>
<br>
Fern looks angry at herself as we see her and Tom do confessionals.<br>
<br>
Tom: Fern missed that question. The only one we missed. That might make her look suspicious. On the other hand, that was a hard question.<br>
<br>
Fern: Most of the questions we were able to figure out eventually. This one, we got wrong. To be accurate, I got it wrong. I don't know whether to be mad or just disappointed.<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): So Fern and Tom were able to get 3 out of 4 questions correct, adding $15,000 to the pot. Now it's Daria and Violet's turn.<br>
<br>
********************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 3: The Mainau Island, some time later<br>
<br>
Daria and Violet disembark, four photographs and a camera in hand.<br>
<br>
Violet: Who should take the photos? And who should use the photgraphs to spot the flowers and plants?<br>
<br>
Daria: Can you use a camera? If not, I'll take the photos.<br>
<br>
Violet: I'll take the photos. I'm pretty good with them.<br>
<br>
Daria (confessional): It was late June when we arrived in Friedrichshaften, so we knew the flowers that were here would include tropical and subtropical flowers and plants, as well as roses. We also had a guide as to what flowers and plants would be blooming at this time. So all I had to do was find the flowers and plants that were in the photos, and we'd do quite well. Of course, finding them in an hour would be a tough task.<br>
<br>
Violet (confessional): Daria had to look for an orange tree, a Cape Jasmine gardenia, a hydrangea bush, and some roses. We'll definitely find at least two of them, maybe three, in an hour. But four? I'm not so certain.<br>
<br>
********************************************************************<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): When we come back, Daria and Violet photograph flowers and plants (we catch a glimpse of Daria pointing out a flower,) someone gets an opportunity to get the final exemption (we see Tom calling someone,) the contestants take part in a game of buying and selling (we catch a glimpse of Fern and Violet looking at some items,) and we have our seventh exemption.<br>
<br>
********************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 3 (continued)<br>
<br>
Violet: Which flower or plant do you want to find first?<br>
<br>
Daria: Hmm. How about an orange tree? That shouldn't be too tough to find.<br>
<br>
The duo begin to look around for an orange tree. Within a few minutes --<br>
<br>
Daria: I found one! (Violet takes a look, and sure enough, it's an orange tree.)<br>
<br>
Violet: Great! Watch the birdie! (She takes a photo.) There, that's done! What's next?<br>
<br>
Daria: Hmm. Let's look around. The next location we find a flower we're looking for, we'll photograph it.<br>
<br>
They head on, getting information about where the various flowers they're looking for along the way. Eventually --<br>
<br>
Daria: Hey, I found something! The Italian Rose Garden! There would be a Frau Karl Druschki rose here! How many minutes do we have left?<br>
<br>
Violet: 35 minutes. (They head on into the garden. Soon --)<br>
<br>
Daria: Here it is! A Frau Karl Druschki rose! (Violet takes a photo of it.) How many minutes now?<br>
<br>
Violet: Almost 30 minutes left.<br>
<br>
Daria: Well, let's go! (They head on out and head on over to the park. There they look for the hydrangea exhibit. Soon,) Here's a hydrangea bush! And it's a blue one, just as the photo said!<br>
<br>
Violet takes the picture. Then she looks at her watch.<br>
<br>
Violet: Yikes! We have only 15 minutes left! We'd better hurry!<br>
<br>
The two hurry out of the park and toward towards a greenhouse where the Cape Jasmine gardenia is located. They finally reach it and hurry inside. Soon --<br>
<br>
Daria: I found it! Hurry, Violet!<br>
<br>
Violet hurries. But just as she prepares to take the photo --<br>
<br>
Violet: Damn! The signal on my wristwatch went off! So close, too!<br>
<br>
Daria (sighing): Well, we might as well head on back to the boat.<br>
<br>
Violet: Yeah. Back in Friedrichshaften, we can get the photos developed.<br>
<br>
Daria (confessional): This might've been an easy challenge for the Mole to sabotage. All Violet could've done is take her time taking pictures or take her time while we were searching for the flowers. But somehow, I doubt the Mole was at work in this challenge.<br>
<br>
Violet (confessional): I'm somewhat disappointed we didn't get all the points we could have. But 3 out of 4 isn't bad. But was the Mole at work in this challenge? Not likely, since I'm not the Mole, and there's no way Daria could be the Mole.<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): So in the end, Daria and Violet barely missed getting all four photos. But with 3 out of 4 photos, they also earned $15,000 for the pot.<br>
<br>
Violet (confessional): It almost seems too easy. I just know the Mole's going to strike sometime soon. Don't know when, but he will.<br>
<br>
Fern (confessional): Right now, I'm feeling sorry for Tom. I'm certain he'll be going soon -- unless he's figured out that Violet's the Mole. If he has, it'll be between Daria, Tom, and I for the final two spots, and I don't know who'll be left out in the cold -- Daria, Tom, or I. However, I doubt Daria will be left out in the cold.<br>
<br>
********************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 4: The Ringhotel Krone Schnetzenhausen dining room, that evening.<br>
<br>
The contestants are eating dinner. Tom is having fish while Violet is having venison.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, I have some good news for everyone. Fern and Tom, you were able to get to the Zeppelin Museum by answering the three questions on the way correctly. Unfortunately, you missed the final question. You have earned $30,000 for the pot. (Fern looks mad at herself.) Daria and Violet, you were able to find and photograph 3 out of 4 flowers or plants within an hour, so you have also earned $30,000 to the pot. Therefore, you have earned $60,000 for the pot, bringing the total up to $430,000! (Everyone cheers at that.) Ah, and here's something for all of you -- dessert!<br>
<br>
A cook brings out five pieces of pie, four of them with whip cream on them, one without.<br>
<br>
Abby: Who wants which piece of pie? (She chooses a piece of pie with whip cream on the top.)<br>
<br>
Eventually, everyone chooses a piece of pie -- with Tom picking the piece without whip cream on it. As he does so, we hear Abby do a voice-over:<br>
<br>
Abby: What nobody knows is that the pieces of pie are part of the next challenge. Tom chose a piece of pie without whip cream on it, so he will be involved in the next challenge.<br>
<br>
Eventually, the four contestants go to their bedrooms. Once they're all inside, Abby goes to Tom's room. Tom opens the door and lets Abby in.<br>
<br>
Abby: You're probably wondering why one piece of pie didn't have whip cream on it. (Tom nodded.) Well, that's because whoever ate it will be going for an exemption. You took the piece of pie, so you're getting an exemption.<br>
<br>
Tom: That's cool.<br>
<br>
Abby: However, you can only earn this exemption if you lure one person into your bedroom after hours. If you succeed, $20,000 will be taken from the pot.<br>
<br>
As Tom thinks it over, we hear him do a confessional.<br>
<br>
Tom: This is a huge exemption. It's the final exemption you can earn. And I'm the only one left who never had a coalition partner. Fern had one. Daria has one. Violet had two, and now has one. I could sure use that exemption. On the other hand -- $20,000 is sure a lot of money to lose!<br>
<br>
After a moment, Tom decides.<br>
<br>
Tom: I'm going for the exemption.<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay then. Who would you like to call?<br>
<br>
Tom (thinking for a moment, then deciding): Violet.<br>
<br>
Tom gets on the phone and calls. Within a minute, Violet answers the phone.<br>
<br>
Violet: Hello?<br>
<br>
Tom: Violet. It's Tom. I need you to come over to my room at once.<br>
<br>
Violet (after a moment's pause): Why?<br>
<br>
Tom: I have some information that would positively identify the Mole.<br>
<br>
Violet (excitement in her voice): Okay then. I'll come.<br>
<br>
Tom: Thanks. (As he puts the phone down, he turns to Abby.) She fell for it!<br>
<br>
Violet (confessional): I believe Tom about as much as I believe I will beat Daria at the end. But if it fools Fern, why not play along and let Tom think I believed him?<br>
<br>
Violet leaves her room and knocks on Tom's door. Tom lets her in -- and then she sees Abby.<br>
<br>
Violet: Uh-oh. This does not look good.<br>
<br>
Abby: You know what the rules state about leaving your rooms after hours?<br>
<br>
Violet (nervously): Uh, yeah. But Tom said he had information that would positively identify the Mole.<br>
<br>
Abby: Tom, why don't you explain yourself?<br>
<br>
Tom: That piece of pie I took? It didn't have whip cream on it. The one who got it would earn an exemption. But I could earn it only if I lured someone into my room.<br>
<br>
Violet (angrily): And you called me just so you could lure me out of my room and earn that exemption for yourself? I'm such an idiot! I can't believe I fell for it!<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, you did. And your gullibility has cost the group $20,000. So now the pot's down to $410,000! And Tom has an exemption.<br>
<br>
Violet nods, then turns to Tom.<br>
<br>
Violet: Congraulations, Tom. But who fooled who?<br>
<br>
Tom looks confused as Violet leaves and returns to her room. Immediately, she calls Daria.<br>
<br>
Violet: Daria? This is Violet. Tom urged me to come over to his room at once. He said he had some information that would positively identify the Mole.<br>
<br>
Daria: Don't tell me you fell for it.<br>
<br>
Violet: I wasn't fooled by his claim. But I left my room anyway. After all, it'll only convince Fern I'm the Mole. And more important, she doesn't have an exemption.<br>
<br>
Daria: Very clever. I must admit, I may have made the smartest move in the game by allying myself with you.<br>
<br>
Violet: I think we both made very smart moves by deciding to form the coalition.<br>
<br>
Daria (confessional): Violet's a real strategic player. She suspected Tom was tricking her, but decided to play along just to make herself look more suspicious to Fern. I couldn't do that, as no one suspects me, thanks to Keith.<br>
<br>
Tom (confessional): I'm in the finals! I can't believe I'm in the finals! Violet's probably the Mole, so she'll also make the finals. That leaves Daria and Fern. Of those two, I'd pick Daria to get into the finals. Then it's between me and Daria for the win, and I have a bad feeling I'll lose that battle. But at least I'd have made it into the finals.<br>
<br>
*****************************************************************<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): When we come back, Violet's actions cause Fern to openly accuse her of being the Mole, the contestants will be buying and selling items in Kempten, then we'll have our seventh execution.<br>
<br>
*****************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 5: The dining room of the Ringhotel Krone Schnetzenhausen, the next morning<br>
<br>
Abby and the contestants are just about ready to eat breakfast.<br>
<br>
Abby: I have some news for Daria and for Fern, just in case neither one has been informed by either Tom or Violet of what happened last night. (Fern looks confused, while Daria has no expression, as usual.) Last night, Tom took a piece of pie, and it didn't have whip cream on it. This made him eligible for a final exemption. However, to earn this exemption, he had to lure someone out of her room after hours. He chose Violet, who fell for the trick. As a result, Tom earned an exemption for himself, and $20,000 has been taken from the pot. The jackpot's down to $310,000.<br>
<br>
Fern (glaring at Violet): Well, well, well. So you finally made a move that revealed who you are.<br>
<br>
Violet (calmly): And who am I?<br>
<br>
Fern: The Mole.<br>
<br>
Violet: Maybe I am, and maybe I'm not.<br>
<br>
Fern: You would say that. However, the fact still remains that you cost us $20,000 because you left your room!<br>
<br>
Violet: True enough. Still, I'm not solely to blame for losing money for the pot.<br>
<br>
Fern: If you're referring to Tom, I would've gone for the exemption myself if I was in his position. You didn't have to fall for his trick.<br>
<br>
We then see Violet and Fern doing confessionals.<br>
<br>
Violet: Fern's going down this round. She just doesn't know that it's because she's on the wrong track altogether.<br>
<br>
Fern: The only way I'm sticking around is if Daria somehow is fooled into thinking Violet's not the Mole. If she knows that Violet's the Mole, we'll probably tie, and I'm pretty certain how that's going to wind up.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well guys, we have one more stop to make before the next-to-last execution round. So, after we finish our breakfast, it's off to Kempten in Bavaria. We have reservations at the Hotel Minotel Goldnes Kreuz, so pack your bags!<br>
<br>
As everyone reacts, we see Daria and Tom doing confessionals.<br>
<br>
Daria: Looks like we'll finish in Bavaria. At least we're not finishing in Lawndale.<br>
<br>
Tom: I'm looking forward to spending time in Bavaria. It's a really picturesque place. And best of all, I'm set for the finals, so I can just enjoy myself.<br>
<br>
We then see a map, and we see the contestants leave Friedrichshaften and arrive in Kempten. As they do so, we hear Abby doing a voice-over:<br>
<br>
Abby: Once we were done, we left the Ringhotel Krone Schnetzenhausen and headed to Kempten. There, we checked into the Minotel Goldnes Kreuz and had lunch before doing our next challenge, at the Hildegardplatz!<br>
<br>
**********************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 6: The Hildegardplatz, Kempten<br>
<br>
Abby and the contestants stood near the weekly market.<br>
<br>
Abby: As you can see, there's a weekly market in the Hildegardplatz. This weekly market is part of your next challenge. I need two people who are good at shopping. (Fern and Violet raise their hands.) Okay then. Fern, Violet, your task is to buy 10 items within an hour's time, and to return them to that stall. (She pointed to a stall that was set up, but was empty.) That's where Daria and Tom come in. You two are going to have two hours to sell those 10 items. If you succeed, $40,000 will be added to the pot. Fern, Violet, here's 1000 marks. You can spend up to that much money to buy the 10 items you need.<br>
<br>
As Fern and Violet trip off to buy 10 items, we hear Fern and Tom do their confessionals.<br>
<br>
Fern: I love to shop, so the buying part should be easy enough to do well. Unless the Mole decides to screw it up for me.<br>
<br>
Tom: I have no doubt Fern and Violet will find 10 good items to sell. However, I'm not a very good salesman; and even if I was, Daria will probably drive people away with her sarcasm. She's good at that.<br>
<br>
We see Fern and Violet looking around.<br>
<br>
Violet: Oh, here's a good item, I think.<br>
<br>
Fern (taking a look): You're right. It *is* a good item! How much is it? (When she gets the info, she pays the woman, then they move on.) Oh, here's another great item! Let's buy this one!<br>
<br>
Violet (confessional): Fern's a born shopper. I'm okay with it, but it's not my favorite thing to do. Daria could probably care less about shopping.<br>
<br>
As Fern and Violet gather items, Daria and Tom watch from behind the stall.<br>
<br>
Tom: Looks like Fern's a born shopper. Violet's not doing so bad, either, but I don't think she likes it as much as Fern does.<br>
<br>
Daria: Fern might get along pretty well with my sister Quinn. On the other hand, Quinn's obsessed with being cute and popular -- or at least once was -- and Fern's not that way.<br>
<br>
Tom: No, I don't think Fern's obsessed with being cute and popular. However, she might've been once.<br>
<br>
Daria: Another Quinn? Oh joy! (Tom smirks.)<br>
<br>
Within an hour, Fern and Violet have 10 items and return to the stall.<br>
<br>
Daria: It appears you're a born shopper, Fern. You might get along pretty well with my sister Quinn.<br>
<br>
Fern: Not likely. I do love to shop, but I never was obsessed with being cute. Nor was I the most popular girl in school, although I had my fair share of friends. Being a computer whiz -- or geek, depending upon your choice of words -- can do that to you. Anyway, here's our items. Good luck selling them.<br>
<br>
Fern and Violet leave as we see Daria do a confessional.<br>
<br>
Daria: Once they went, the nightmare of selling these items began. And I *do* mean, nightmare.<br>
<br>
We are treated to a montage of Daria and Tom trying to sell items.<br>
<br>
Tom: Guys! How many of you need an extra pair of shoes? Well, here's your chance! I have a nice pair of men's shoes! Only 2 marks! Get them while they're still around!<br>
<br>
Daria: Here's a so-called nice dress for you! Only 5 marks! For women who don't need it at all! Get them now! Or whenever you get tired, whichever comes first.<br>
<br>
Daria's steady stream of sarcasm causes many people to avoid her. Tom, on the other hand, manages to sell three items within an hour. Finally, someone buys a dress from Daria.<br>
<br>
Daria: Thank you. It's good to get this dress off of my hands and into yours!<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): What neither Daria or Tom know is that they are going to have their sense of fairness tested soon.<br>
<br>
We see a man approach the stall where Daria and Tom are trying to sell items. He buys a doll for his daughter from Tom. As he goes, he leaves a book behind. Daria notices it.<br>
<br>
Daria: Sir! You left this book behind!<br>
<br>
Tom: Wait a minuute. Maybe we should keep it. After all, he might not need it anymore.<br>
<br>
Daria: If he doesn't need it anymore, we'll keep it. But if he does, we'll return it. (She then rushes after the guy as fast as she can.) Sir! You forgot this book!<br>
<br>
Man: Oh! I must've left it behind at the stall! Thank you very much. (He takes the copy of Tom Stoppard's Rosencrantz And Guildenstern Are Dead from Daria.) I saw that play once. It's very funny.<br>
<br>
Daria: For a play that's taken from a classic work of Shakespeare.<br>
<br>
She returns to the stall and joins Tom in trying to sell more items. Some time later --<br>
<br>
Daria: How many minutes do we have?<br>
<br>
Tom: 15. And we've sold 6 items so far! I don't think we're going to succeed in selling all 10 items.<br>
<br>
They do manage to sell another item, but sure enough, time runs out without them selling all 10 items.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, the bad news is that you failed to sell all 10 items. Therefore, you failed to get $40,000 for the pot. (Tom scowls a little, while Daria has no expression, as usual.) However, you still earned some money. Do you remember the guy who left behind a copy of Tom Stoppard's Rosencrantz And Guildenstern Are Dead?<br>
<br>
Tom: We sure do.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, if you returned that book to him, you would earn $20,000 for the pot. You did, so the pot's back up to $430,000! (Everyone cheers at that.) Tomorrow, you'll have some time to see the sights in Kempten, but tomorrow night you'll have the quiz.<br>
<br>
********************************************************************<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): When we come back, the contestants will take the quiz and we'll have our seventh execution.<br>
<br>
********************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 7: The Hotel Minotel Goldnes Kreuz, the next morning after breakfast<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, how many of you are looking forward to seeing the sights of Kempten? (Everyone except Daria raise their hands.) Well, let's go!<br>
<br>
The first thing they see is the castle waste dump in one of the oldest parts of Kempten, then they head on over to the baker route.<br>
<br>
Fern (confessional): When I see the baker route, the first thing I think of is that song from the film Beauty and the Beast where Belle sings "There goes the baker with his tray like always/ The same old bread and rolls to sell."<br>
<br>
The contestants then go to see the St. Mang-place, and get a guided tour through the church. After that, they go to the town hall square and pass through a residence area and an orangerie before heading to the Marstall and getting a guided tour through the Alpinmuseum.<br>
<br>
Violet (confessional): This is really interesting! It's certainly a look into a life and culture that's different from my own.<br>
<br>
The next stop is the Lorenz Basilica, and then they go to the grain house, where the Allgeau Museum is stored, and finally return to the Hildegardplatz.<br>
<br>
Tom (confessional): It's a different experience just passing through the Hildegardplatz than it is when you're trying to buy items or to sell them. You have more time to look around and just soak up the atmosphere.<br>
<br>
They then head to the Zumsteinhaus before having lunch. After lunch, they go to the Schlossie at the outside staircase, then go to the Fischer route before heading across the river to the Archaeological park Cambodnum (APC)<br>
<br>
Daria (confessional): I have to admit, this has been some tour through Kempten. Most tourists probably don't get to see towns like this. Thank God.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, we'll head back to the hotel so you can prepare for the quiz tonight.<br>
<br>
As they head back to the hotel, we hear Abby do her voice-over.<br>
<br>
Abby: The quiz. Ten questions about the Mole. Whoever knows the least about the Mole will be executed and must leave the game immediately. Question 1: Is the Mole male or female? Question 2: How many questions did the Mole guess in the Bicycle to the Zeppelin Museum challenge? (The answers range from "2" to "3" to "The Mole didn't take part in the challenge.")<br>
<br>
Tom (confessional): Fern missed the final question. That is somewhat suspicious.<br>
<br>
Abby: Question 3: What is the number of the Mole's journal? Question 4: What did the Mole do during the Flower and Plant Photography Challenge? (The answers range from "Find plants" to "Photograph them" to "The Mole didn't take part in the challenge.")<br>
<br>
Violet (confessional): The one person I think is the least likely to be the Mole is Daria. After all, Keith paid the price for thinking she was the Mole.<br>
<br>
Abby: Question 5: What did the Mole have for dinner at the Ringhotel Krone Schnetzenhausen? Question 6: What did the Mole do in the Exemption Challenge? (The answers range from "Lure a contestant out of her room" to "Get lured out of her room" to "Stayed in her own room.")<br>
<br>
Fern (confessional): Violet's leaving her room after hours is the final piece of the puzzle. She's the Mole!<br>
<br>
Abby: Question 7: How many exemptions did the Mole earn? (The answers range from "2" to "1" to "0".) Question 8: What did the Mole do during the Hildegardplatz Market Challenge? (The answers are either "Buy items" or "Sell items.")<br>
<br>
Daria: Tom's the Mole. And Violet and I know it. After this round, it's between the two of us.<br>
<br>
Abby: Question 9: What color hair does the Mole have? Question 10: Who is the Mole?<br>
<br>
****************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 8: A room inside the Minotel Goldnes Kreuz, later that night<br>
<br>
The camera cuts to four bags. It passes over Daria's bag, then Tom's, then Violet's, and finally over Fern's.<br>
<br>
The Final Four walk in and sit down in four chairs. Abby is behind the computer, again.<br>
<br>
Abby: Welcome to your seventh execution. Now, Tom has an exemption, so he's guaranteed to make it into the finals. The rest of you aren't so lucky. In a moment, I'll be entering your names into the computer. If a green screen appears, you remain in the game. If a red screen appears, you are the Mole's seventh victim. You must pick up your bag and leave the game immediately. If everyone's ready, we'll begin.<br>
<br>
As Abby prepares herself, Fern looks surprised, apparently realizing that there's no tie.<br>
<br>
Abby: Daria.<br>
<br>
She types Daria's name into the computer. Daria watches stoically. A green screen appears. Daria smiles slightly.<br>
<br>
Abby: Fern.<br>
<br>
She types Fern's name into the computer. Fern watches fearfully. She then gets the red screen. Fern looks at Tom, apparently comprehending something. Then she gets up, grabs her bag, and leaves with Abby as sad music begins to play.<br>
<br>
Fern (on the way to the limo): I should've known. I should've known! But I didn't.<br>
<br>
Violet: Fern was a fine player. She gave it her all, and tried her hardest. Although I'm glad I'm in the finals, I'm also sorry to see her go. (We see clips of Fern bungee-jumping and of Fern golfing.)<br>
<br>
Daria: Fern would probably have made a fine Mole. She had it all -- a quiet demeanor, a clever brain, and a talent to fade into the woodwork. The only thing she didn't have that I do is a sarcastic streak. (We see Fern skiing down a slope, flying a balloon, and conversing with Daria while dressed as Mrs. White.)<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, outside the hotel --<br>
<br>
Abby: So, what went wrong?<br>
<br>
Fern: I was outwitted. I just didn't realize it until it was too late. The Mole fooled me very well. (We see Fern answering geography questions, running through the streets of Lausanne, and greeting Terrence.)<br>
<br>
We cut back to the Final 3.<br>
<br>
Tom: Y'know, I'll actually miss Fern. She got real far in the game. But at least I now know who the Mole is -- and it's not Fern. (We then see clips of Fern getting into a buggy, ringing a bell, and buying items.)<br>
<br>
We cut back to the outside of the hotel, where the limo has arrived to pick up Fern.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, I'll see you soon.<br>
<br>
Fern: Yeah. (She gets into the limo.) Munich, please!<br>
<br>
The limo leaves with Fern. As it does, the scene switches to Abby, Daria, Tom, and Violet.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, we know Fern told the truth when she said she wasn't the Mole. But one of you lied. Daria, are you the Mole?<br>
<br>
Daria: No, I am not the Mole.<br>
<br>
Abby: Tom, are *you* the Mole?<br>
<br>
Tom: No, I am not the Mole.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well then, are you the Mole, Violet?<br>
<br>
Violet: No. One of the other two lied. And I know which one did.<br>
<br>
We then see the following:<br>
<br>
WHO IS THE MOLE?<br>
<br>
DARIA? TOM? VIOLET?<br>
