"Mole? Somebody get me a dermatologist!"<br>
by Belle Book<br>
<br>
Chapter Eight<br>
<br>
The Hotel Minotel Goldnes Kreuz, Kempten<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): Previously on Teen Mole: Fern and Tom took part in a bicycling challenge leading them to the Zeppelin Museum in Friedrichshaften, Germany (we see clips of them riding on their bicycles), while Daria and Violet went looking for plants and flowers to photograph (we see clips of Violet taking a picture). Tom had the opportunity to earn the final exemption for himself (we see a clip of him taking a piece of pie without a blueberry on it), but only if he could lure one player out of her hotel room after hours. He chose Violet, who seemingly fell for his trick (we see a clip of Violet leaving her hotel room). The next day, the contestants go to Kempten, where Fern and Violet have to buy items that Daria and Tom have to sell (We see clips of Fern and Violet shopping, then of Daria and Tom trying to sell items). And in the end, Fern became the Mole's seventh victim (We see the clip of Fern's execution).<br>
<br>
The James-Bond type music returns as Abby continues:<br>
<br>
Abby: Ten contestants. One winner. Each one attempting to win a jackpot up to a million dollars. However, one of the contestants has been hired by the producers to sabotage the game. That someone is the Mole. Each round, the contestants have to take a quiz. Whoever knows the least about the Mole will be executed and must leave the game immediately. Who is the Mole?<br>
<br>
We now see clips of Daria, Tom, and Violet. As the credits run, we see the finalists do their confessionals.<br>
<br>
Tom: I'm in the finals! However, I'm certain that Daria's up against me, and there's just no way I can win against her, especially since she's been near Violet the whole time.<br>
<br>
Violet: My coalition with Daria can't help me anymore, so it's time to let it go now. I've just gotta do my best, and maybe I'll win! Though with Daria up against me, somehow I doubt I will win.<br>
<br>
Daria: The coalition's ended. I'm on my own now. Just the way I like it. Every woman for themselves.<br>
<br>
We then cut to the breakfast room in the Minotel Goldnes Kreuz. Abby is with the finalists.<br>
<br>
Abby: So, you are the finalists. How does it feel? Tom?<br>
<br>
Tom: It feels great, especially since I got that final exemption! That might've been the only way I got in.<br>
<br>
Daria (sotto voce, to Violet): Unlikely.<br>
<br>
Abby: And what about you, Violet? How does it feel, being in the finals?<br>
<br>
Violet: I'm thrilled! But I can't think too much about it now. I need to focus more on winning the game now. If I don't, I might lose so close to the end.<br>
<br>
Abby: Very strategic, Violet. And what about you, Daria? You were the one who didn't want to be in the game. And yet, you're in the finals. How does that feel?<br>
<br>
Daria: I hate to say it, but maybe Jane and Tom did the right thing in getting me in this game! I might not have met some great people otherwise, espeically Violet. Although I wouldn't have met Keith, either. Still, it did provide me with the opportunity to bust on him, and that was a real pleasure for me.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, you'll all have a real treat. Pack your bags, for you're headed to Fussen, and nearby is the castle built for King Ludwig II of Bavaria, which you'll have a chance to see before this game's over!<br>
<br>
As everyone reacts, we see various people doing their confessionals.<br>
<br>
Tom: I heard about Schloss Neuschwanstein. It's supposed to be real beautiful! Or so they say. If so, I can hardly wait to see it.<br>
<br>
Violet: It's great to go see these small places in Bavaria. Most tourists would probably go to places like Munich, and miss such pretty towns. I'm lucky in that regard.<br>
<br>
Daria: King Ludwig II? He's the one who's supposed to have been mad? Oh joy.<br>
<br>
We then cut to a glimpse of the finalists travelling by van to Fussen. Abby's driving again, with Violet right beside her in the passenger seat. Behind the two are Daria and Tom.<br>
<br>
Tom: Well, for once you're not sitting near Violet, Daria.<br>
<br>
Daria: You probably know that we had a coalition. Well, it can't help either one of us anymore, so it's over and done with.<br>
<br>
Violet: But that's all right. We both knew it would have to end sooner or later.<br>
<br>
Tom: I have to hand it to you two. You made the coalition work.<br>
<br>
Daria: We had similar goals. It also helped that Violet has a high tolerance for sarcasm and cynicism.<br>
<br>
Violet: Living on a reservation, I tend to encounter people like you a lot, Daria. That helps.<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): So eventually we arrived in Fussen. Once there, we checked into the Minotel Sommer Am See, where we had lunch in the Hotel Restaurant Bootshafen before doing our next challenge.<br>
<br>
**************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 2: The streets of Fussen<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay, our next challenge will test how well you three really know each other. It's called "Three Questions," and you'll probably remember it from the first Mole series. You have each answered a questionnaire about the other two finalists. One by one, you'll be taken to a location. The other two will have to answer three of the questions from the questionnaire. If all three questions are answered correctly for each one of you, $20,000 will be added to the pot! Who wishes to go first?<br>
<br>
Violet raises her hand. She is led off. Soon, Abby is standing on a street, with Daria and Tom.<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay. Here's the first question. Violet was asked, "Which person is more likely to be single after 10 years?" If you say Daria, we go this way (she points to the left), if you say Tom, we go this way (she points to the right).<br>
<br>
Daria: Me. Definitely me.<br>
<br>
Tom: Yeah. She probably knows you tend to shield yourself from pain by keeping people away with your sarcasm.<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay, we'll go this way. (They head off to the left. Soon,) Here's your second question. Violet was asked, "Which person would be most likely to reach the White House?" If you say Daria, we'll go this way (she points to the left), if you say Tom, we'll go this way (she points to the right).<br>
<br>
Daria: You. I'm not rich, and besides, I'm too sarcastic for my own good.<br>
<br>
Tom: Well, I'm not planning on going into politics, but I'd agree with you Daria. Sarcasm wouldn't work all that well in politics. We'll say me.<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay, we'll go this way. (They head off to the right. Soon), Here's your final question. Violet was asked, "Which one of you is more likely to cheat on a future spouse?" If you say Daria, we'll go this way (she points to the left,) if you say Tom, we'll go this way (she points to the right).<br>
<br>
Both Daria and Tom look very uncomfortable.<br>
<br>
Daria: Why couldn't we have had a better question?<br>
<br>
Tom: Yeah.<br>
<br>
Abby: I don't think Violet knew that question would be one of those chosen, if that makes you feel any better. Also, she wasn't too happy to see it on the questionnaire, either. Said something like "Why would anybody want to answer this one?"<br>
<br>
Daria: You, Tom. Definitely you. Men are more likely to cheat than women. Besides, you were still going out with Jane when you kissed someone else behind her back.<br>
<br>
Tom (embarrassed): True enough. But you didn't mention that that someone was you. (1)<br>
<br>
Daria (looking real embarrased, to Abby): Long story.<br>
<br>
Abby: I'm sure.<br>
<br>
Tom: However, I'll say me as well.<br>
<br>
Abby: Ok, we'll go this way. (They head off to the right again. Soon they're standing on a street.) Okay, your answers have led here. Let's see if Violet's in one of these houses. Violet!<br>
<br>
Tom: Violet!<br>
<br>
Daria: VIOLET!<br>
<br>
Seconds later, the door of a house on the right side of the street opens. Violet emerges.<br>
<br>
Violet: You found me. Good.<br>
<br>
Tom (confessional): Daria's coalition with Violet really helped her out here. I wouldn't have known as much about how Violet would've answered.<br>
<br>
Abby: Congraulations, Daria, Tom. You found Violet, and $20,000 has been added to the pot. It's now up to $450,000! (The trio cheer at that.) Who's up next?<br>
<br>
Tom raises his hand, and he's led off by Abby. Some time later, Abby, Daria, and Violet are standing on another street.<br>
<br>
Abby: Daria, Violet, how did Tom answer his first question: Who is more likely to succeed in the future? If you say Daria, we'll go this way. (She points to the left.) If you say Violet, we'll go this way. (She points to the right.)<br>
<br>
Violet: Unfortunately, it's probably you, Daria.<br>
<br>
Daria: Yeah. Native Americans aren't too successful. They have too many obstacles to overcome. Alcoholism, poverty, the prejudice and condescension of others, you get the idea. In any case, we'll say me.<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay, we'll go this way. (They head off to the left. Soon,) How did Tom answer this question: Which contestant do you know the most about? If you say Daria, we'll head this way. (She points to the left.) If you say Violet, we'll go this way. (She points to the right.)<br>
<br>
Daria: My best friend Jane dated Tom before I did, and then I dated him, so it's definitely me.<br>
<br>
Violet: I agree. Definitely Daria.<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay, we'll go this way. (They head off to the left again. Soon,) How did Tom answer this question: Which one is the most strategic? If you say Daria, we'll go this way. (She points to the left.) If you say Violet, we'll head this way. (She points to the right.)<br>
<br>
Daria: You, Violet. You masterminded the departures of three contestants in the game.<br>
<br>
Violet: Yeah. We'll say me this time.<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay, we'll go this way. (They head off to the right. Soon, they're standing on another street.) Okay, let's see if Tom's in one of these houses. Tom?<br>
<br>
****************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): When we come back, Tom and Violet have to find Daria (we hear Tom and Violet calling out Daria's name), and the finalists stroll through Fussen. Later, the contestants have to get out of locked rooms in Schloss Neuschwanstein for the final challenge (we see Tom on the phone). Finally, the contestants take the final quiz. (We see a clip of the finalists in Schloss Neuschwanstein, taking the quiz). Who's the winner? Who's the runner-up? And who is the Mole?<br>
<br>
****************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 3: More of the streets of Fussen<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): Daria and Tom managed to find Violet and add $20,000 to the pot. Now, Daria and Violet are trying to find Tom. Their answers have led them to this street. But will they find Tom?<br>
<br>
Daria: Tom?<br>
<br>
Violet: Tom?<br>
<br>
Daria: TOM!! (Silence.)<br>
<br>
Abby: No Tom, I'm afraid. You got at least one question wrong. Let's go find Tom.<br>
<br>
The group goes off to find Tom. Soon, they wind up on another street.<br>
<br>
Violet (sotto voce, to Daria): I'll bet Tom sabotaged the questions. (Out loud,) Tom?<br>
<br>
Abby: Tom? Are you here?<br>
<br>
Daria: TOM!!<br>
<br>
The door of a house on the left side of the street opens. Tom emerges.<br>
<br>
Tom: What kept you? Did you get the questions right?<br>
<br>
Daria: No. Thanks to you, no doubt.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, let's see where you two went wrong. The first question was, "Who is more likely to succeed in the future?" How did you answer that question, Tom?<br>
<br>
Tom: Violet. She's the daughter of a Native American chief, and I thought that might help her out in the future. Besides, she's not half as sarcastic as Daria, and I thought Daria's sarcasm might hurt her chances of success later on.<br>
<br>
Violet: We chose Daria, Tom. We agreed that as a Native American, I'd have more difficulty being successful than Daria.<br>
<br>
Tom: Oh. I should've thought of ethnocentrism being a possible factor.<br>
<br>
Daria (confessional): It's possible that Tom simply failed to take into account the ethnocentrism Violet will probably have to face outside of college. But I doubt it.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, you got the first question wrong. Here's the next question. "Which contestant do you know the most about?" Tom, how did you answer that question?<br>
<br>
Tom: Daria, of course.<br>
<br>
Violet: We got that one right!<br>
<br>
Daria: Of course, missing that question would be too obvious.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well then, you got one question right. What about the final question? "Which one is the most strategic?" Tom?<br>
<br>
Tom: Violet. She's good with chess -- she said so herself -- and certainly the departures of Mark, Raul, and Fern seem to have the fingermarks of Violet on them.<br>
<br>
Violet: We decided that I was the most strategic.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, you got two out of three correct. Unfortunately, the first one was the one you got wrong. You didn't earn any money for the pot, so it still stands at $450,000.<br>
<br>
Daria: I suppose it's some comfort that we weren't completely clueless when we answered those questions. But not much. (The others smile at that.)<br>
<br>
Violet (confessional): Tom probably deliberately got the first question wrong. It certainly was the easiest one to screw up without it being too obvious.<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): After one round in which Daria and Tom found Violet, and one in which Daria and Violet failed to find Tom, it was Daria's turn to hide somewhere in Fussen. (We see Daria being led off by Abby.) And it was Tom and Violet's turn to find Daria.<br>
<br>
Abby, Tom, and Violet are now standing on a different street in Fussen.<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay, how did Daria answer this question? "Who is most likely to fit into society?" If you say Tom, we'll go this way. (She points to the left.) If you say Violet, we'll go this way. (She points to the right.)<br>
<br>
Violet: You, Tom. Definitely you. She'd probably think that ethnocentrism would hinder me from fitting into society.<br>
<br>
Tom: But you're not sarcastic. I can be. Moreover, you at least tolerate sarcasm and cynicism quite well.<br>
<br>
Violet: But so do you. And in any case, Daria once told me how your sister called you "quasi-rebellious." (2) She'd definitely say you, Tom. I'm certain of it.<br>
<br>
Tom: Okay, if you're certain -- we'll say me.<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay then, we'll go this way. (They head off to the left. Soon,) How did Daria answer this question? "Which contestant do you think you'll be still keeping in touch with after 10 years?" If you say Tom, we'll go this way. (She points to the left.) If you say Violet, we'll go this way. (She points to the right.)<br>
<br>
Tom: That's a tough one! She did agree to keep in touch with me after we went off to separate colleges. (3)<br>
<br>
Violet: True. But we're going to the same college. And what's more, you're from an upper-class background. I'm more from an upper-middle-class background, roughly similar to Daria.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well?<br>
<br>
The two contestants think hard for a good long moment. Finally, Violet comes to a decision.<br>
<br>
Violet: Tom.<br>
<br>
Tom: Yeah, me.<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay, we'll go this way. (They go off to the left again. Finally,) How did Daria answer this question? "Which contestant played the game the hardest?" If you say Tom, we'll go this way. (She points to the left.) If you say Violet, we'll go this way. (She points to the right.)<br>
<br>
Tom: You, Violet. Definitely you.<br>
<br>
Violet: I agree. She would say me.<br>
<br>
Abby: Okay, we'll go this way. (They head off to the right. Soon they are on another street.) Okay, your answers have led us here. Let's see if Daria's behind one of these doors. Daria?<br>
<br>
Tom: DARIA!<br>
<br>
Violet: DARIA, COME ON OUT OR WE'LL PLAY A PRACTICAL JOKE ON YOU THE SAME WAY WE PULLED ONE ON KEITH!!<br>
<br>
That's when a door near the end of the street opened. Daria emerged.<br>
<br>
Daria (smirking): Who can resist such a threat? (Violet smiles at that.)<br>
<br>
Abby: Great job, Tom, Violet. You earned another $20,000 to the pot, bringing the total up to $470,000! (The trio high-five each other as we hear the others do their confessionals.)<br>
<br>
Violet: Two out of three. Not bad. Of course, the one we missed was the one where we had to guess how Tom answered the three questions.<br>
<br>
Daria: I had to smile when Violet threatened me like she did. Maybe my sarcasm's rubbing off on her.<br>
<br>
Tom: I'm glad I helped Jane trick Daria into getting onto Teen Mole. If Daria hadn't gotten on, she wouldn't have met Violet. Of course, she wouldn't have met Keith, either, but we all have to meet jerks sometime.<br>
<br>
Abby: And now it's time for you guys to have some fun. So how about a sightseeing tour of Fussen itself?<br>
<br>
Everyone cheers wholeheartedly at that.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, then, the producers managed to get a tour guide just in case you wanted to do the guided tour. And here she is, Fraulein Emily Schmidt! (A young woman with blonde hair and green eyes arrives and greets the finalists.) Emily speaks English as well as her native German. Emily, if you're ready ...<br>
<br>
Emily Schmidt: I'm ready when the others are ready. Are you guys ready?<br>
<br>
Daria: No. But it appears that I have no choice.<br>
<br>
Tom: Please don't get too worried when Daria says stuff like that.<br>
<br>
Violet: Yeah. That's just Daria -- sarcastic and cynical, but still good-hearted. Even if she won't admit it.<br>
<br>
Emily Schmidt (looking relieved): Okay, let's go. Our first stop is the old Sebastian's Cemetery!<br>
<br>
We then get clips of the guided tour, beginning at Sebastian's Cemetery. As they take a look at the grave of the Bavarian court painter Dominic Quaglio, we hear Daria do an interview.<br>
<br>
Daria: No tour should begin without a trip to a cemetery. And no tour should be complete without it, either.<br>
<br>
The group then continues to the Franciscan monastery with St Stephan's Church, then on to the F&uuml;ssen Holy Ghost Hospital. As Emily guides them through it, we see Tom do an interview.<br>
<br>
Tom: The best part about being in Fussen is that nobody grovels when they hear your last name is Sloane. Here, you're just another tourist rather than the son of the wealthiest family in Lawndale.<br>
<br>
Then they go to the Baroque courtyard old Benedictine monastery of St. Mang before heading to the Lute-Makers-Fountain. Violet gasps as she looks at it. Daria and Tom aren't as obviously impressed, but they both smile slightly.<br>
<br>
Violet: This has been such an awesome trip! It's too bad it'll be ending soon.<br>
<br>
Daria: I hate to say it, but I agree. Being tricked into taking part in the game might've been worth it, after all.<br>
<br>
Tom (smirking): I would agree, especially if you win, Daria. Personally, I've had a great time, and I'm almost sorry to see it end.<br>
<br>
Then, Emily guides Abby and the finalists to the former monastery and present-day Parish Church of St Mange.<br>
<br>
Emily: It's about 3:15. Do you guys want to go to the Fussen Heritage Museum before we wrap up our trip at the interior courtyard of the Hohes Schloss? (The four all agree.) Okay then, we're off to the Fussen Heritage Museum!<br>
<br>
They travel to the Fussen Heritage Museum and are guided through it. When they come to the Anna Chapel, Emily points out the Fussen Dance of Death painting.<br>
<br>
Daria: Nothing says fun like the view of a painting about Death.<br>
<br>
Violet (smiling): Typical. Personally, I wouldn't think it very fun.<br>
<br>
Tom: I know my mother wouldn't. However, I'm more like Daria.<br>
<br>
Finally, they go to the interior courtyard of the Hohes Schloss, one of the palaces for the King of Bavaria, especially that of Ludwig II. As they travel through it, we hear Violet do an interview.<br>
<br>
Violet: France. Switzerland. Germany. If I hadn't applied for Teen Mole, I would never have had the chance to see any of those countries. So, whatever happens to me, I'm a winner already.<br>
<br>
Later on, we see the contestants return to the Minotel Sommer Am See. We then get clips of the finalists doing their confessionals.<br>
<br>
Daria: It's between Violet and I for the win now. We're watching Tom's every move and writing it down. I think I have the advantage since I've known Tom longer than Violet, but she's a very competitive player.<br>
<br>
Tom: I'm certain Violet's the Mole. The problem is, Daria probably knows it, too. Worse, she's so observant, I'll bet she knows far more about Violet than I do. Looks like I'll get second place.<br>
<br>
Violet: Daria and I both went with Tom since the fourth round. We're now competing for the win. I'm going to give it my all. May the best woman win. (She pauses for a moment.) That would probably be Daria.<br>
<br>
*****************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): When we come back, the finalists have one last challenge where they're locked up inside rooms inside the Hohenschwangau Castle (we get a glimpse of Daria, Tom, and Violet trying to get out of their respective rooms). Later on, it's time for the final quiz. Who's the winner? Who's the runner-up? And who is the Mole?<br>
<br>
*****************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene Four: The Minotel Sommer Am See Hotel, Fussen<br>
<br>
We see Abby and the finalists eating breakfast in the Hotel Restaurant Bootshafen.<br>
<br>
Abby: I have some news for you. Today you'll be doing your final challenge, and tonight you'll be taking the final quiz. How do you feel about that?<br>
<br>
Daria: I'm ready to get it over with. (Everyone smiles at that.)<br>
<br>
Tom: I'm ready for whatever happens.<br>
<br>
Violet: Just curious as to where the final challenge and the final quiz will be taking place.<br>
<br>
Abby: Well, after breakfast, you'll be heading off to the Hohenschwangu Castle. After the guided tour, you'll be taking part in a challenge where you'll be locked up in three rooms in the castle. Emily Schmidt will be your guide for the tour, and she'll tell you all the stuff she can about the rooms. The final quiz will take place in the Schloss Neuschwanstein.<br>
<br>
We then see a map of the contestants heading to the Hohenschwangu Castle from Fussen. Once they arrive, they're greeted by Emily Schmidt.<br>
<br>
Emily Schmidt: Are you ready to see the castle this time, Daria?<br>
<br>
Daria: No. But the others are, so I'm outnumbered.<br>
<br>
Emily Schmidt: I'll take that as a yes. Follow me. (She begins by taking them inside to a large hall which takes up the whole width of the Castle.) This is the Festsaal Hall, also known as the Hall of Heroes and Knights. You might find the stucco ceiling interesting. It's decorated with neo-Gothic ornaments on pink background with diorama silver stars. All the columns are done in Gothic style.<br>
<br>
They all look up at the ceiling, then at the paintings.<br>
<br>
Tom: Interesting paintings. Could you explain what they're about?<br>
<br>
Emily Schmidt: The paintings illustrate the Wilkina Saga, which are part of the legends of Dietrich of Berne.<br>
<br>
Violet: I don't think I ever heard of those legends. Then again, I never learned a lot about Germanic myths.<br>
<br>
Emily Schmidt: Unfortunately, they were lost in Germany. However, they were preserved by a Norwegian copy of the 13th century. If you'd like to move on. (She then led them into what looked like a huge dining room.) This is the Hall of the Swan-Knight, the former dining room. It's famous for the wall paintings depicting scenes from the saga of Lohengrin, the Swan-Knight.<br>
<br>
Tom (looking at the paintings with interest): Lohengrin. Wasn't there an opera written about him by Richard Wagner? I like that opera. One of the few operas I like.<br>
<br>
Emily: Yes. He happened to be friendly with King Ludwig II and stayed in this castle. Wagner also wrote an opera about Lohengrin's father, Parsifal, or Perceval, the Grail Knight in the earliest legends about the Holy Grail. Our next stop is the Chapel. (She leads them out of the Hall of the Swan-Knight and into the Chapel.) This was the former arms and drinking hall, rebuilt into a chapel during the life of King Maximilian II. Holy Mass is still celebrated here.<br>
<br>
Daria: Note to self: next time you come to Germany, take as many pictures as you can.<br>
<br>
violet: I agree. The entire castle is a really pretty place.<br>
<br>
Emily: If you'd like to move on. (She led them up 90 stairs, which obviously tired Daria, to another room, obviously a bedroom.) This is the Oriental Room. It used to be Queen Mary's bedroom. It was decorated in an oriental style in memory of the trip of King Maximillian II of Bavaria to Greece and Turkey in 1832-1833.<br>
<br>
Violet (looking at the room): Wow! This room really is fit for a queen!<br>
<br>
Emily: And next door is the Living Room of the Queen. (She leads them out of the Oriental Room and in the Living Room.) This room was restored in 1849. It has a big chandelier of silver, decorated with swans, the heraldic picture of the castle.<br>
<br>
Tom: No surprise. I think the castle's named for swans.<br>
<br>
Emily: Yes it is, Tom. (She leads them into another room.) This is the Hohenstaufen Room. It used to be the dressing room of both Maximilian II and Ludwig II. It also was Ludwig's music room. The paintings on the walls illustrate special events from the era of the Staufer selected by Maximilian.<br>
<br>
Daria: Ludwig II. Isn't he supposed to be the one known as Mad King Ludwig?<br>
<br>
Emily: Yes, that's the one. Although it may not be quite true to call him mad. However, he was mentally disturbed, and had a tendency to retreat into a fantasy world. He particularly loved Wagner. He spent so much money from the treasury on the Schloss Neuschwanstein. That's why his ministers declared him as mad, and planned to lock him away.<br>
<br>
Tom: So Ludwig II was more like Madame Bovary in a way than our image of the madman.<br>
<br>
Emily: Madame Bovary? Oh, I see. The French middle-class woman who longed for old castles, moonlight rendezvous, that sort of thing. Yes, Ludwig was more like Madame Bovary. He may even have committed suicide like her. However, there is some speculation he was murdered.<br>
<br>
Violet: Madame Bovary committed suicide? How?<br>
<br>
Emily: I think she took arsenic. Anyway, let's move on. Richard Wagner used to play his own works here for Ludwig II.<br>
<br>
Daria: I almost feel sorry for Wagner. Then again, he was an anti-Semite and a womanizer, so maybe I should feel more sorry for Ludwig.<br>
<br>
Emily (taking them into another bedroom): And here's the Tasso Room, the bedroom of both Maximilian II and Ludwig II. The paintings tell the story of Armida and Rinaldo according to the epic "Jerusalem Liberated" by Torquato Tasso.<br>
<br>
Tom (looking at the paintings): They're quite beautiful!<br>
<br>
Emily (then heading into another room): This is the Berchta Room. It used to be the Queen's writing room. The images tell the myth of the birth of Charlemagne in the Reismuhle near Gauting.<br>
<br>
Violet: Look at the painted ornaments with climbing plants and twines!<br>
<br>
Daria: Yeah. Nothing says excess like a room full of ornaments, climbing plants, and twines. (The others smile at that.)<br>
<br>
Emily (taking them in another room): This is the Authari Room. It was named after the ancient Bavarian saga of Authari, the King of the Langobards. He wooed for Princess Theodelinde, the daughter of Duke Garibald I. Wagner stayed in this room during his visits to the castle.<br>
<br>
Violet: Did Wagner ever visit any of the other castles of Ludwig II?<br>
<br>
Emily: No. Just this one. The Schloss Neuschwanstein was never really finished, otherwise, he might've spent time there. Also, King Ludwig II spent most of his time at this castle.<br>
<br>
Finally, after 5 more rooms, the tour's done.<br>
<br>
Emily: Now, I'm going to have to lock you into three rooms, according to Abby's instructions.<br>
<br>
Abby: You'll have to find your way out by solving instructions which are being placed in the rooms even as we speak. You'll have one hour to solve the instructions and get out. If you all succeed and get down to the Hall of Heroes during that time, $80,000 will be added to the pot.<br>
<br>
We then hear Daria and Violet do their confessionals.<br>
<br>
Daria: Great. $80,000! Tom won't pass up the opportunity to keep us from earning that money.<br>
<br>
Violet: Daria's thinking that Tom will prevent us from earning $80,000 for the pot. While I do agree that the opportunity would be tempting, Tom might try to throw suspicion off of himself by playing the hero.<br>
<br>
Emily: Daria, you'll be locked up in the Authari Room. Tom, you'll be locked up in the Hohenstaufen Room.<br>
<br>
Tom: Great. Locked up in the music room of a mentally disturbed guy who retreated into a fantasy world. (The others smile at that.)<br>
<br>
Emily: And Violet, you'll be locked up in the Berchta Room. (That's when a guy comes up to Emily and privately talks to her.) Okay, good. Daria, Tom, Violet, they've put the instructions in the rooms. I'll take you and lock you up now.<br>
<br>
************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Abby (voice-over): When we come back, the contestants try to find a way out of the locked rooms, and we have the final execution. Who's the winner, who's the runner-up, and who is the Mole?<br>
<br>
************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 5: The Hohenschwangu Castle, near Fussen.<br>
<br>
All of the contestants have been locked up in their respective rooms. Suddenly, the lights all go out!<br>
<br>
Daria (inside the Authari Room): Of course. Great. I need to find instructions. But how to go about looking for them?<br>
<br>
Tom (inside the Hohenstaufen Room): Hmm. Let's see -- where are the instructions? (Suddenly, he spots a cloth on the little table that hadn't been there before, and a night-light. He holds the cloth up to the night-light, and sees some writing on it.) "What instrument would Wagner have used to play Lohengrin for Ludwig II?" I think I saw a piano in the room.<br>
<br>
He began looking for it. Meanwhile:<br>
<br>
Violet: What's this? (She finds a flashlight.) I'd better take a look around. (She flashes the light around.) Ah. Here's my first clue, on this sofa. "Who in Bavarian saga was born in the Reismuhle?" Charlemagne, of course! And this flashlight's obviously here to help me.<br>
<br>
As Violet shines her flashlight around the wall paintings, we see Daria in the Authari Room, finding a cloth and holding it up to a night-light.<br>
<br>
Daria (reading): "Find the bed that a famous composer would've used while visiting this castle." Obviously, the composer's Wagner, so I'd better find the bed he slept in.<br>
<br>
She began looking for it. Meanwhile:<br>
<br>
Tom: Yes! (He picks up a cloth and holds it up to the night-light.) Here's another bit of writing: "People dressed in this area." That would be a dressing curtain or wardrobe. I'd better find it.<br>
<br>
As he went looking for the dressing curtain or wardrobe, Violet found something.<br>
<br>
Violet: Here's something! (The flashlight reveals writing on the painting above the sofa, the kind that can easily be washed off and not hurt the painting.) "Find the Queen's writing desk." That shouldn't be too hard for me.<br>
<br>
As she shines her flashlight around, Daria has found the bed.<br>
<br>
Daria: Let's see. Ah, here's a piece of cloth. (She picks it up and holds it up to a night-light.) "Head to the fireplace." Okay, so there was a fireplace in here. Now, I just need to find it.<br>
<br>
As she begins looking around, Tom has found the wardrobe. He opens it.<br>
<br>
Tom: Another bit of information! (He brings the cloth to the night-light.) "Look under the mirror." I hope I can find which mirror is meant.<br>
<br>
He begins looking around. Meanwhile, Violet's found the writing desk.<br>
<br>
Violet: Yes! I found the writing desk. (She spots a cloth on it, along with a message.) "The second drawer to the right." Hmm, that doesn't seem too difficult.<br>
<br>
She opens it, and finds a music box inside. She begins to wind it up. Meanwhile:<br>
<br>
Daria: Here's the fireplace! (She grabs a cloth out from inside it and brings it to the nightlight.) "Look on top of the table close to the bed." That's simple enough.<br>
<br>
She heads on over to the table. As she does so, we cut back to Violet, who's watching a figurine of Charlemagne rise up from the music box, holding a key!<br>
<br>
Violet: All right! (She grabs it and rushes to the door. She turns the key in the lock. It opens and she rushes out.) Now where are the others? Should I wait for them, or should I go downstairs?<br>
<br>
Fortunately, at that moment, Daria has opened the box on the table, and she also discovers a key.<br>
<br>
Daria: This is almost too easy. (She moves to the door, turns the key in the lock, and smirks as she hears the click. She also opens it and exits.) Violet? Tom?<br>
<br>
Violet: Here I am, Daria. So you got out, too.<br>
<br>
Daria: Yeah. Wonder where Tom is.<br>
<br>
At that moment, Tom has opened drawers on a bureau below the mirror. He has checked one drawer. No luck. However, in the second one:<br>
<br>
Tom: Yes! Here's what I'm looking for! The key to the door, no doubt.<br>
<br>
Tom grabs the key, rushes to the door, and tries it. He hears the sound of a click, so he opens the door and rushes out.<br>
<br>
Tom: Daria? Violet? Are you out yet or do I have to wait?<br>
<br>
Daria: I think you'd better wait a few years, Tom.<br>
<br>
Tom (smirking): No thanks, Daria. I see you got out. What about Violet?<br>
<br>
Violet: I was the first one out. Let's see if we can find the stairs and get down to the Hall of Heroes. That's where we're supposed to be before two hours is over.<br>
<br>
They started moving towards the stairs, Violet carrying the flashlight she took from the Berchta Room. Soon they reached the stairs.<br>
<br>
Violet: I'll go first. Tom, you can go second. And Daria, if you wish, you can hold Tom's shoulder as you go down.<br>
<br>
Daria: I'll definitely do that. Don't want to trip.<br>
<br>
The group goes down the stairs. When they reach the bottom, Violet shines her flashlight around. Soon, she spots the Hall of Heroes, and they all go inside it. As they arrive inside, the lights come back on!<br>
<br>
Tom: You can turn off your flashlight, Violet. I think I see Abby coming our way.<br>
<br>
Sure enough, they see Abby coming. Violet turns off her flashlight.<br>
<br>
Abby: Congraulations, guys. It took you a half-hour for all of you to get out of your rooms, head down the stairs, and reach the Hall of Heroes. You have earned $80,000 for the pot, bringing the jackpot up to a grand total of $550,000! (Everyone cheers as Emily Schmidt returns to the hall.) Now, your time here is about to come to an end. I'll take you back to the Minotel Sommer Am See if you wish to do some last-minute studying for the final quiz tonight, then we'll head to the Schloss Neuschwanstein after dinner, where you can take the final quiz.<br>
<br>
**************************************************************************<br>
<br>
Scene 6: The Entrance Hall in the Schloss Neuschwanstein, sunset<br>
<br>
Daria, Tom, and Violet are sitting in front of three computers. Abby is standing in front of them.<br>
<br>
Abby: Welcome to your final execution. You have taken an amazing journey, both through France, Switzerland, and Germany, and to figure out which one of you is the Mole. Now, both journeys are about to come to an end. There will be 20 questions on the quiz tonight. The one person who knows the most about the Mole, other than the Mole themselves, will win the jackpot of $550,000. In the case of a tie, the person who answered the questions the fastest will win the money. After you're done, you'll be taken to different rooms, where you'll wait until it's time for you to see your results. Let's begin.<br>
<br>
Daria, Tom, and Violet turn to their computers as Abby begins:<br>
<br>
Abby: 20 questions about the Mole. Question 1: Is the Mole male or female? (We see Daria in front of her computer.) Question 2: In which order did the Mole jump from the top of Topenga Canyon?<br>
<br>
Tom (confessional): Daria was the only person who refused to jump off the canyon. That probably made several people suspicious of her.<br>
<br>
Abby: Question 3: Where did the Mole go after completing the "I'm Going on a Trip" Challenge? (We see Violet in front of her computer.) Question 4: What was the Mole's first stop in the Race through Lyon Challenge?<br>
<br>
Daria: The only thing Tom did that was even remotely suspicious in the first round was nearly spin out in the Racing Challenge. And I'm not certain if that was deliberate or unintentional.<br>
<br>
Abby: Question 5: What is the number on the Mole's journal? (We see Tom answering a question confidently.) Question 6: What did the Mole do during the Golfing Challenge?<br>
<br>
Violet (confessional): Tom asked Daria and I to go before him in the Golfing Challenge. This enabled him to get a question he knew he wouldn't be able to answer. That seems suspicious to me.<br>
<br>
Abby: Question 7: What is the Mole's favorite movie? (Daria seems to be thinking hard about this one.) Question 8: What did the Mole do during the Rescue Maze Challenge?<br>
<br>
Tom: Violet certainly looked suspicious during that challenge. She seemed to have problems guiding Raul through the maze to reach Ann, but Raul claimed the headgear went out on him during it. Could Violet have caused the headgear to go out on him?<br>
<br>
Abby: Question 9: Did the Mole successuflly complete the Ski for Life Challenge? (Violet confidently puts an answer down.) Question 10: Who was the Mole's partner in the Balloon to Albertville Challenge?<br>
<br>
Daria: When Violet told me of what she saw Tom doing just before the challenge, Tom moved ahead of Fern as the prime suspect on both our lists.<br>
<br>
Abby: Question 11: Which role did the Mole take during the Clue Challenge? (We see Tom smirking as he clicks on an answer.) Question 12: Who was the Mole paired with in the Museum Challenge?<br>
<br>
Violet: Tom's the Mole. Both Daria and I realized that in the fourth round, and we stuck with him. And now we're here.<br>
<br>
Abby: Question 13: What did the Mole do during the Race around the Cathedral Challenge? (We see Daria confidently clicking on an answer.) Question 14: Who did the Mole choose to be his eyes in the View from the Prison Tower Challenge?<br>
<br>
Tom: I chose Raul, and I suspect he deliberately sabotaged the challenge. However, I think he had instructions to do some sabotage from Violet. That was quite clever of her.<br>
<br>
Abby: Question 15: Where did the Mole go during the Library Challenge? (We see Violet looking at that question.) Question 16: When was the Mole eliminated in the Sniper Challenge?<br>
<br>
Daria: Tom was the first one out. He was out sooner than even I was. That definitely seems like sabotage to me.<br>
<br>
Abby: Question 17: What did the Mole do in the Exemption Challenge? (We see Tom at that point, smirking.) Question 18: What did the Mole do during the Hildegardplatz Market Challenge?<br>
<br>
Violet: Tom may think he fooled me into leaving my room during the Exemption Challenge, but I had my own reasons for falling into his trap.<br>
<br>
Abby: Question 19: How many of the Mole's questions did the other two get during the Three Questions Game? Question 20: Who is the Mole?<br>
<br>
Tom: I am not the Mole.<br>
<br>
Daria: I am not the Mole.<br>
<br>
Violet: I am not the Mole.<br>
