I do not own the Daria characters, they belong to Viacom.&nbsp; I will return their
toys when I'm done playing with them.&nbsp; I'm not making any money off of this
fic.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lyrics to "I'm all right" belong to Jo Dee Messina</span></b></p>

a song-fic, per se, although I did post the song lyrics that were the
inspiration for this.&nbsp; It actually came out a lot more angst than I intended,
but that's ok!&nbsp; I doubt there will be any kind of sequel, but one never knows.&nbsp;
If you are looking for a happy ending, this is definitely not the fic for you.&nbsp;
I tried my best to look at the type of characters I was writing and how they
would react to this kind of situation, and this is what I got.&nbsp; I would say
this is set roughly 2005.&nbsp; I also have lyrics to the song "Mona Lisa Smile" but
I'm still debating whether I want to post them in their entirety. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>If Trent
was surprised by the strange number that flashed across his mobile's caller ID,
Jesse took no notice of it.&nbsp; Granted, Jesse was more and more preoccupied
lately, as his girlfriend could easily go into labor any second.&nbsp; Trent knew
there was no way he'd be able to hear the person over the noise of the pub they
were playing in, so he hit the reject button and carefully shoved the small
phone back into his jeans pocket.&nbsp; Trent had always been somewhat wary that he
would drop the tiny thing on some random concrete floor and shatter it into a
million silver pieces, and there was no telling how much money Janey had spent
on it, despite his protests that he didn't want her to be able to get in touch
with him anytime.&nbsp; As he and Jesse climbed back onto the small stage for a
second set, slower and unplugged for the later crowd, the odd phone call was
all but forgotten.&nbsp; As Jesse began to strum his own acoustic, Trent began his
latest song in a voice hoarse and husky.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Trent
pulled into his sister's driveway in the wee hours of the morning, grimacing at
the strange car in the driveway.&nbsp; Somewhere in his deepest fantasies, the one's
that no one really knew about, he'd hoped that Jane would get together with his
best friend and they would be one big happy family.&nbsp; Trent snorted at himself,
and glanced over the car with a speculative eye.&nbsp; Well, whoever Jane's new
boy-toy was, he was well off.&nbsp; A silver Jag, one that had been well taken care
of, but had been driven quite a bit, if the film of road grime was any
indication.&nbsp; Ah well, he had limited places he could stay, and if Jane and her
latest escapade got too loud, he could always bang on the wall.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Trent let
himself in the front door with his keys, noting with a small amount of
gratitude that all was quiet.&nbsp; Apparently, everyone within was asleep, but
Trent was too wired from his show to fall into bed quite yet.&nbsp; He rarely played
the pub these days, but always enjoyed the rush that accompanied a successful
show like the one he'd just had.&nbsp; The guys had all turned out to play the first
set, at least, although Max and Nick had cut out at intermission, each claiming
family obligations. &nbsp;Jesse and he had begun the second set with a few of their
old favorites, until, eventually, Jesse had to make his way home to his
girlfriend of the past five years, who was nine months pregnant.&nbsp; Trent had
continued playing, taking requests from the crowd, until the pub was mostly
empty and his voice had given out.&nbsp; He ruminated on the past as he made his was
up the stairs toward his bedroom.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>As he
dropped tiredly into his desk chair and turned on his desktop, Trent did some
quick math in his head, figuring out how much money he and Jane would have left
over for groceries after the household bills.&nbsp; Satisfied they had enough to buy
extra groceries in case they suddenly ended up with a houseguest to feed, Trent
clicked open a browser window and proceeded to check his e-mail, disappointed
when there was nothing from the one person he wanted to hear from.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Trent woke
slowly the next morning, cursing the evil daystar that was filtering in through
his bedroom curtains.&nbsp; Jane insisted on having only curtains and no blinds in
her house, claiming that natural light was the best for her art.&nbsp; Trent didn't
argue, since she was the sole breadwinner.&nbsp; Sure, he occasionally brought home
some dough from the occasional gig, like the pub the night before, but his
dreams of a record label had never quite come to fruition.&nbsp; He was determined
that he would never sell out, although he did occasionally write a silly jingle
for local businesses, usually working out payment in trade of some sort.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>As he scrubbed
his eyelids with his palms, Trent remembered with a groan the extra car in the
drive the night before.&nbsp; He knew he should probably make his way downstairs and
find out what kind of meathead Jane had drug home this time, and whether or not
he was legal, before he left for the market.&nbsp; The refrigerator had been
depressingly empty the day before, and Trent had had a thought the he'd like to
make spaghetti for dinner.&nbsp; God, he needed to get laid, before he turned into
any more of a woman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Trent didn't
exactly mind being Jane's house husband, as her paintings were bringing in more
and more money with each show.&nbsp; However, life did get lonely sometimes,
especially when he was alone in a house with only his sister and chat rooms for
company for a couple of weeks.&nbsp; Maybe it was time to get in touch with Monique
again for a tumble in the sack.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>As Trent
gathered up some clean clothes and made his way to the bathroom, he vaguely
noticed the door the spare bedroom was shut.&nbsp; Shrugging it off as Jane's
attempt to keep the price of the energy bill down by not running the air
conditioning in an unused room, he continued on his trek across the hall.&nbsp;
Trent was in the shower, humming to himself, when the door to the spare bedroom
opened and his houseguest sleepily wandered out and down the stairs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>As Trent
made his way back to his bedroom, scrubbing his hair dry with a towel, he
stopped briefly in the hallway.&nbsp; He could have sworn that bedroom door was shut
when he'd gone into the bathroom.&nbsp; Jane's one night stands had never stayed in
the spare room before, not in his memory, anyway.&nbsp; Curious, he pushed the door
open and saw an innocuous black duffel bag at the end of the bed, stuffed to
the brim with jeans and tee-shirts.&nbsp; No part of the clothing identified itself
as specifically male or female, and there were no underwear to be seen.&nbsp;
Whoever was staying with them was planning on staying a while, though.&nbsp;
Shrugging it off, Trent went downstairs and into the kitchen to grab the
magnetic notepad off the fridge to make a list and found a note from his
sister.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Trent-</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I heard
you come in late last night and didn't want to wake you up too early.&nbsp; Gone to
get some breakfast.&nbsp; If you want, meet us at Pizza King for lunch at two.&nbsp; See
ya!</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Jane</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Us.&nbsp; Apparently,
the owner of the jag was indeed a friend of Jane's, but as much as Trent racked
his brain, he couldn't for the life of him figure out who it could be.&nbsp; He
shook his head, deciding he'd find out eventually, and set about making a
grocery list for a household of three.&nbsp; It was already pushing noon, he'd have
just enough time to buy groceries, come home and put them away, and meet Jane
and her friend for lunch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Two hours
later, Trent flung the glass door of Pizza King open and scanned the restaurant
for his sisters jet black hair.&nbsp; He found it in no time, she was sitting in a
booth facing the door.&nbsp; The bench was too tall for him to see the color hair of
the person sitting across from her, and curiosity drove him to their table to find
out who the owner of that car was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>As Trent
stood at the edge of the booth, his blue eyes meeting hazel, he was stunned
speechless.&nbsp; He figured he shouldn't be surprised, after all, this was his
sister's best friend of the past ten years or so.&nbsp; Her visit came as a
surprise, as he had just spoken with her in a chat room the day before
yesterday, and she had made no mention of coming to visit.&nbsp; He suddenly
remembered the phone call he'd ignored at the pub and realized that it had
probably been her trying to call.&nbsp; He wondered if there were any problems with
her family, or if this was simply a social visit. Trent found himself trying to
swallow the sand that had seemed to form in his throat, and barely managed to
croak out his drink order to the perky waitress that had wandered over to their
booth.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Trent slid
into the booth next to Jane after she raised a sardonic eyebrow and patted the
seat next to her.&nbsp;&nbsp; As Jane and her friend caught up over a pepperoni pizza, he
picked at his own slice and took big gulps of his drink, wondering when he had
developed such a case of cotton-mouth.&nbsp; Trent noticed vaguely that there had
been a pause in conversation and both girls were looking at him expectantly.&nbsp;
He'd been so lost in thought that he had no idea what had been asked of him, so
he simply grinned and shrugged, having no idea what he'd just agreed to.&nbsp; He
was almost frightened to know when both women began to chuckle, the sound
causing the hair on the back of his neck to stand up.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The last
person Trent had expected to see that day was Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&lt;insert

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The week
passed by in a flurry of visits, dinners out and shopping, on the girls' part
anyway.&nbsp; Trent chose to spend those particular afternoons on his own, lining up
gigs for himself, or the band on the nights all the members were available.&nbsp; On
the fifth evening of Daria's visit, Trent's cell phone rant.&nbsp; Jesse's
girlfriend was going into labor, and Jesse wanted Trent to meet him at the
hospital for moral support.&nbsp; When he told the girls what was happening, Jane
elected to stay home, having never done well around babies, or hospitals.&nbsp;
Daria state she wanted to come along, if only to get out of the house for a
little while.&nbsp; Trent shrugged and began searching for his car keys when Daria
held hers in front of his face, grinning mischievously.&nbsp; Trent smiled in thanks
as he took them and they made their way towards Lawndale Medical to find a
haggard Jesse chain smoking in the parking lot.&nbsp;&nbsp; Trent threw his arm around
his best friend's shoulders and patiently led him back to the maternity ward,
Daria following closely behind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>A few hours
later, Jesse in the delivery room with his girlfriend, Trent and Daria waited
patiently in the waiting room, facing the plate glass windows of the nursery,
the curtains closed for the night.&nbsp; At nine-thirty, a nurse came out and told
them that the new mother was in a room and could receive visitors.&nbsp; As Trent
watched Daria hold and coo over Jesse's new daughter, Trent felt a small jerk
of pain in his chest.&nbsp; It would be several hours before he realized it was that
green-eyed monster known as jealousy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>As they
made their way to the parking lot, Trent dug Daria's keys out of the pocket
they had been stuffed into in his haste and handed them back to her.&nbsp; She took
them with a smile and they both got back into her car.&nbsp; Trent gave her a
questioning glance when she pulled out of the parking lot and turned the
opposite direction from Jane's house.&nbsp; Daria simply shrugged in return and
turned the radio up a bit, singing along with joyous abandon.&nbsp; Trent couldn't
remember the last time he'd seen her so...free.&nbsp; As he watched her belt out
lyrics at the top of her longs as she randomly made turns down the streets of
Lawndale, the summer breeze blowing her hair back, he decided he liked her best
this way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Daria
finally came to a stop under the giant strawberry that he and Jesse used to get
high under.&nbsp; She turned in her seat, towards him, resting her head gently on
the headrest of the driver's seat.&nbsp; He did the same, wondering what she was
thinking.&nbsp; As her gaze raked over his face, then his neck, then his chest, he
realized he was being sized up.&nbsp; Sure, they had kept up a passing acquaintance,
mostly through e-mails, over the years since she'd left for college, then took
a job with a newspaper in Boston, but they'd never really come to <i>know</i>
one another.&nbsp; Trent let her gaze wander, giving her a genuine smile when her
eyes finally met his again.&nbsp; He maintained eye contact with her as he leaned forward,
excruciatingly slowly, closing his eyes just as his lips brushed hers in a
soft, chaste kiss.&nbsp; As he pulled back, he saw her eyes were still shut, her
mouth open slightly.&nbsp; He leaned in again, this time pushing his mouth hard
against hers, tasting her.&nbsp; He felt her smile against his mouth and opened his
eyes again as she pulled away, straightening in the driver's seat.&nbsp; She started
the car and headed&nbsp; back to Jane's house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>As they
made their way upstairs and to their respective rooms, Trent grabbed Daria's
hand on impulse.&nbsp; He tugged it gently toward his room, but she dug her heels in
to the carpet, shaking her head slightly.&nbsp; She smiled as she turned toward her
own room, whispering a soft good night before she shut the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>When Trent
woke up the next morning, he stared at the ceiling for a few minutes before
stretching and standing.&nbsp; His face held a goofy grin as he recalled the
previous evening.&nbsp; Trent made his way to the window, glancing down into the
street, seeing that it was going to be another beautiful summer day.&nbsp; He did a
double take when he saw that Daria's car was gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Quickly
dressing, and running his fingers through his hair, he ran down the stairs.&nbsp;
After a cursory exploration of the house, he finally found Jane in the living
room, in front of her easel as usual.&nbsp; Questioning her, Jane simply raised a
brow and shook her head, pointing out that Daria's week vacation was over and
she had to get back to work.&nbsp; She then handed over a plain white envelope with
his name written in neat cursive on the cover.&nbsp; He plopped down onto the couch,
dropping the envelope into his lap as he scrubbed at his eyes with the palms of
his hands.&nbsp; He tore it open to find a sheet of notebook paper with the same
neat cursive written on it.</span></p>

this, I want nothing more than to share your bed with you, my heart tells me I
should tear this paper up and go to you, but my head tells me not to be an
idiot.&nbsp;&nbsp; I may regret it in the future, but I don't want to be hurt, and I don't
think you can promise not to hurt me yet.&nbsp; Know that I'll always have feeling
for you, and thank you for the song.</span></i></p>

heard his ode to her, and had figured it out.&nbsp; He knew he should go after her,
and a couple of years ago, he would have been in his car already.&nbsp; However, he'd
learned a few things about Daria over the years, from their constant
communication, and he knew that she was probably right.&nbsp; He folded the letter
up neatly, stuck it in his pocket, and hugged his sister, who was giving him an
empathetic smile.&nbsp; He simply shrugged, gave her a soft smile, and made his way
to the kitchen to find some breakfast.&nbsp; </span></p>
