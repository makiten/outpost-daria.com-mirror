Tuesday</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey Penny, what’s up?” Jane asked, as she entered Casa
Lane. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hmm?” responded the older Lane sister, looking up from some
book of hers. “Why didn’t you tell me that Trent gained a girlfriend?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“A girlfriend? Oh! Monique, hah?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah. Trent’s height or a bit shorter, black hair. Dark
eyes too,” she added, as an afterthought.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yup, that’s Monique,” Jane agreed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And what?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And what’s the sitch with her and Trent?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“They’re a couple – sort of,” Jane shrugged. “I could never
really figure-out what is going-on between them. Somehow, it seems no more than
force of habit, yet neither seem interested in breaking it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mmm… And what’s she like? Where she works-at? Axl’s?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No, she’s one of the Harpies.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Say what?” Penny shivered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“She’s in another music group, you know? Trent’s in Mystik
Spiral, she’s in the Harpies.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh. I see,” Penny nodded. “Right. And are they any good?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I have no desire of learning that,” Jane shrugged. “Trent’s
enough to put anyone off the music liking, you know?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Right,” Penny had to agree with that. “And is there
anything else you want to tell me about her?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nope,” Jane shook her head. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No chance of Trent marrying her?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nope.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Okay, new conversation topic. Anything happened in the school
today?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane paused. “Remember Andrea?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The one who spreading rumours about the big evil and the
inhumanity of Principal Li?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s her. She almost got into a fight with Sandi Griffin,
but was talked out of it by Daria. However, nobody saw her afterwards – after
that class.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Penny shrugged. Jane shrugged too and went upstairs to her
room, to do her homework.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We're back,” Aaron’s voice came out of Sophia’s phone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, what are the news?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Encouraging and reassuring. Obviously, both neighbours were
<i>seriously</i> into that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Into what <i>that</i>?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Bio-stimulants. We’ve found some interesting books on biology
and botany and I-know-not-what, and a lot of them were on human anatomy.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So what do the mushrooms got to do with that?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Those mushrooms were fly agarics of some sort. Ruttheimers
– at least the older one – and Nicholson were making – or planning to make some
sort of home-made intoxicant. A liquid kind.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You mean like alcohol?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You know – no, of course you know, Miss Texan – that Mexican
natives can get high from peyote cactus, yes? Well, fly agarics can do the same
thing.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sophia looked thoughtful. “Let me think. Ever since today’s
lunch the possibility that one or both of the neighbours were playing with fire
in the medical sense. However, I thought that the mushrooms would only
encourage sexual potency, not be actual…” Her voice trailed-off and she
groaned. “Of course! It was just a cover-up: take upon yourself a lesser sin so
that no one would be looking for a greater one!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sophia’s gaze turned triumphant. Nevermind Angela Li: this
time she was going to get something big – something really big!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I've found something too,” Hassan said, smiling slyly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh? What?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“This,” Hassan triumphantly produced a small plastic bag – one
of several he always had in his pockets – which contained some unidentifiable
at first glance forest refuse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What’s this?” Sophia asked, perplexed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Some short white fur. Really short and thin. Dog’s fur.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dog’s fur… This struck something in Sophia’s mind. “The
white bulldogs of Mrs. Petersen!” she exclaimed. “The two older ones got sick
from something, and the oldest one died from internal poisoning.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Precisely,” Hassan smiled his smile. It made him look somewhat
like a shark. “The mutts found the mushrooms too.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sophia noticed. Apparently, Ruttheimers and Nicholson were
very inexperienced in such matters, allowing dogs – and birds – spoil their
crop. Which, in turn, led-on to thoughts that Nicholson and Ruttheimers weren't
experienced, ‘mature’ enough for drug dealers that a tiny – in fact, any
argument escalated into a double beheading. And more importantly, who <i>would</i>
behave one of the richer men in town and his son? Certainly not Nicholson
himself, if he decided to do so…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We’ve done some distance, boys,” Sophia told her
assistants, “but that’s not enough. Now we must find-out the employment lines
of Ruttheimer and Nicholson estates. Understood?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two men nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tiffany, who has been cleaning some hall-tables in the
corridor next to Sophia’s room heard enough. After cleaning some more she left,
ready to make next report of the day…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The report is ready, Ms. Li!” Amy said, feeling excited
that she had actually did something that was important to their current
situation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ah! That’s good, that’s very good, Miss Barksdale,” Angela
Li replied, as if awakened from a dream. “Let’s see.” She began to read or
scale the written report. “Interesting, very interesting… Only what’s it got to
do with sexual potency!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nothing!” Amy Barksdale felt an urge to defend her report.
“No mushroom is – or was – ever used for that and accomplished success. Hey,
you’ve got mail.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So I see,” Angela Li agreed, “I hope it’s Miss Blum-Deckler
– and it is. Hmm?..” She took a good look at the e-mail, then at the written
report of Amy’s and paused, alternating looks between the two. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, she smiled – kind of like she did in her old photo.
“Miss Barksdale, contact your lawyer sister, please. We’ll send Miss
Blum-Deckler’s reports… and yours. Hopefully, she and her comrades-in-arms of
the legal world will understand what’s what.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes ma’am!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey Daria, how was your day?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria discontentedly cast a sidelong look towards her
mother. “Well fine, boring as usual. Quinn and her buddies, on the other hand,
had a lot of excitement – almost got into a fight.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“<b>Da</b>ria!” Quinn exclaimed in indignation. “You had to
tell them <i>that</i>?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Tell us what?” Jake asked, oblivious as ever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen gave him an exasperated glance. “Never mind, Jake, let
me handle this. Quinn, what you and your friend got into today?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“<b>No</b>thing, mom!.. Well, almost nothing…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And with ‘almost’?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, that crazy Goth chick-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Andrea Hecuba,” Daria helpfully explained.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“-was shouting some nonsense about Lawndale coming to an end
and Ms. Li being inhuman.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That girl must be nuts,” Jake said with feeling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria sighed. She felt sorry for Andrea, yet even she was
hard pressed to believe that that was not so. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“…And then, after she ran-away from her non-fight with
Sandi, she just disappeared,” Quinn was finishing her narrative.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What do you mean, disappear?” Daria’s interest to Quinn’s
tale came all of sudden, and with a vengeance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s what I mean, vanished,” Quinn explained willingly.
“One moment she was sitting under a tree, looking as if she was going nowhere,
then a gust of wind came along, the door shut with a bang, and when it
re-opened, she was gone. And it all happened in less than a minute!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Quinn!” Helen exclaimed, exasperated. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You got mail!” her laptop beeped in its’ squeaky voice.
Helen’s attention instantly turned to it, Quinn’s tale forgotten in ‘less than
a minute’.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But not in Daria’s mind…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ah, ladies and gentlemen, we seem to have received some informal
report,” Valeriy Vitale declared grandly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Just tell us what it is,” Mindy Horowitz said tiredly. She
and Alan Schrecter have spent a lot of time by now working on <i>who’ll</i>
inherit the Ruttheimer estate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Valeriy turned to Michael Davis. “Davis?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Apparently, Ruttheimers and Nicholson were growing some
sort of toadstool, that is supposed to increase a man’s sexual potency-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nonsense,” Eric Schrecter said, disdainfully. All looked in
his direction. “Sorry,” he semi-retired to the background, “but I <i>know</i>
things about medicine and such, and I <i>know</i> that no mushroom can increase
a man’s sexual potency. I <i>know</i> that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“-or be used as some sort of a hallucinogenic drug, like the
peyote cactus,” Michael Davis continued, after ensuring that he won't be
interrupted again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Interesting,” Arnold Riordan, turning back to Eric
Schrecter. “Tell us, o font of medical knowledge, what kind of charges can such
accusations bring-on?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Eric bristled. “Very funny, Riordan. For a start, there has
to be real proof that either the deceased or Nicholson were planning to sell –
or are or were selling these mushrooms. Them toadstools could’ve grown
naturally – where <i>were</i> they grown, anyway?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“In the copse that is located in the area that brought-on
the lawsuit,” replied Alan Schrecter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Also,” Davis said thoughtfully, “it says here that last Saturday
a lot of birds – blackbirds, crows, rooks, magpies, et cetera – were acting,
drunk, drugged, in other words – affected by some psychotropic substance.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We’ve received a complaint about that,” spoke the last
Schrecter in the room – Peter. “From some old lady, who claimed that
Ruttheimers or Nicholson were poisoning the birds with some<i>thing</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Indeed?” asked Valeriy Vitale. “Then I think we should
learn more about this old lady and her complaint. It might be… important.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And one last thing,” Michael Davis spoke loudly. “The fax
suggests that Mrs. Petersen’s bulldogs – they got sick, remember? – may’ve also
made an acquaintance with this fungus. Thus-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Somebody – get a map of that area of Lawndale in here now!”
Valeriy Vitale, Mindy Horowitz, and Alan Schrecter barked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So let me get this straight,” Jane incredulously asked
Daria. “Upchuck, his dad and his neighbour were growing some mushrooms that
were supposed to make them sex-giants?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s the official story, at any rate,” Daria agreed. “The
unofficial rumour, however, states that these mushrooms could’ve been
hallucinogenics instead…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You mean fly agarics or such?” Penny Lane wedged-in into
the conversation, demonstrating a deep interest. “It’s possible that one of
that trio found a book on berserkers-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Berserkers? What’s that?” Jane asked, confused.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“A class of Viking warriours,” Daria patiently explained,
“renown for their mercilessness, battle prowess, and battle fitness.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mmm. But I bet that they were physically better-off than
any of our mushroom-growers to begin with,” Jane argued.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You're probably right. Besides, nothing is ever mentioned
of their <i>sexual prowess</i>, anyways,” Daria replied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Still, beheading seems to be a little bit extreme,” Jane
brought the conversation back to the old track.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We <i>still</i> aren't sure that those two facts –
mushroom-growing and decapitation – are related,” Daria re-assured her. “And
even if they are, I don’t think that they <i>are</i> standing side-by-side,
see?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Lane sisters agreed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, Michelle, it’s so sad that you must go, but it is
understandable,” Mrs. Petersen was telling her relative. “You are, of course,
always a welcome guest here.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mrs. Petersen, thank you so much for your wonderful meal,”
Michelle Landon said quickly, “but can I ask you for one more thing?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Certainly. What is it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Can I see your bulldogs? My late brother – he spoke of them
so flatteringly, that I really wanted to see them in the flesh, if it’s not too
much bother.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It isn’t,” Mrs. Petersen smiled – the bulldogs <i>were</i>
her weak spot, it seemed. “Yo! Girl! Bring forth Biter and Thrower!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Here is the puppy, ma’am,” Tiffany Blum-Deckler appeared,
looking demure. “I don't know where the older dog is.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What?! Biter is gone?!! Find him!!!” Mrs. Petersen bellowed
and almost collapsed from the shock.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The manour turned into a buzzing hive almost instantly, all
searching for the lady’s missing bulldog...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Daria was downstairs, Helen was busy talking on her
cell phone, Quinn was talking on the kitchen phone, and Jake was playing
solitaire on his laptop. “I'm going out!” Daria declared to everyone in
general, and no one in particular.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s nice, kiddo,” Jake replied, not looking up from the
computer’s display. “Return for dinner – we’re having take-out!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria nodded and left outside.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Daria walked down Lawndale streets in the direction of
Casa Lane, the wind seemingly picked-up, and turned cold and... weird? Daria
didn't have time to ponder that when somebody tapped her on the shoulder. “Who
is it?” she angrily whirled around.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Whoa, chill, Daria – right? You're Daria?” a tall, thin
Goth girl waved her hands in a gesture of peace.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah, that I am,” Daria nodded in agreement. “You're
Monique, Trent’s friend?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monique nodded in agreement. “Tell me, Daria, what’s news on
the Ruttheimer double-murder?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Shouldn’t you be asking Trent?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Trent’s not the most reliable font of information, you
know?” Monique said in a carefree tone of voice, “and neither of his sisters
likes me, I feel.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria raised an eyebrow. “Jane’s dislike for you I know, but
what did you do to upset Penny?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monique shrugged. “Search me, it’s one of those instinct
things, I guess. Anyways, your mother is one of the lawyers, and I was
wondering – any news?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Now why would my mother have any news?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“’Cause your lawyer firm would probably start their own
discreet and private investigation,” Monique said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And this whole double-murder concerns you why?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“For two reasons. First, the police will most likely to be
tempted to search for the killer among us, those who dwell on Dega street and
beyond. And second, the killer will also most likely to be tempted to live or
hide among us, on Dega street and beyond. Thus, we have something of a
double-bummer, see?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“My condolences,” Daria replied, half-sincere,
half-sarcastic. “But don't worry – it seems to be inside job more and more, as
the time goes by.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So no stranger from the Dega street?” Monique asked,
sceptically.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mhm.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, thanks,” Monique replied and quickly left,
disappearing in the distance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria shrugged and went her own way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was fetid and dark in that place – some place somewhere
beyond the Dega street. And there were various people in that place, somewhere
beyond the Dega street. And all of those various people were of female gender
or persuasion. A door opened and yet another female walked-in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Monique! So what are the news?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Apparently, Nicholson did kill Ruttheimers – or somebody in
his pay, openly or secretly. And it <i>does</i> seem to be centred around their
growing of those foul mushrooms in their little copse.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ah,” the voice of the inquirer turned happy in an evil sort
of way, and a matching smile flashed in the internal darkness of the place.
“This is good, this is well.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Indeed it is, considering that Linda Griffin drives us on
most possessively.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Considering who her ancestors were, it is not surprising,”
Monique shrugged. “Now what shall we do with that chicklet, Andrea?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“She is foolish,” spoke yet another female vice. “The fluff
of her childhood is half-replaced by the feathers of the adulthood already –
yet she still acts with foolishness worthy only of a newly-hatched nestling!! I
say we pluck her heart and brain out!!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Peace, Calais,” the apparent leader of the Harpies spoke.
“We’ll just keep her safely locked-up till the crisis passes. Then… we’ll see.
After all, your advice wasn't forgotten.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The rest of the group exchanged meaningful looks between
each other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ah, got it!” Alan Schrecter said, delightedly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Got what?” Peter Schrecter looked-on, sceptically. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The complaint,” Alan replied, acidly. “From Mrs.
Vudrudakis, who’s leading some sort of a local Green-Peace organization.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Wonderful,” Mindy Horowitz groaned. “I hate dealing with
organizations, they’re so unreasonable.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Indeed, indeed,” Alan Schrecter nodded. “Anyways, Mrs.
Vudrudakis accused her neighbours of cruelty to animals. Aka, Charles
Ruttheimer and Alexander Nicholson of starting some sort of pestilence amongst
the birds, and Lawrence Arnolds – the major-domo of Louise Petersen – of
shooting them down with a shotgun and what-not, in their weakened condition.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh? Indeed?” Valeriy Vitale spoke softly. “Then I think it
is time I gave a call to my friend in the law enforcement, Lt. Reilly, and
he’ll question the good old lady for further details. Any opposition?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was none.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And so we’re off, scouring the neighbourhood for more
clues,” Aaron said. “You just <i>had</i> to one-up me with those strands of
canine fur, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don't look so glum, little buddy,” Hassan chuckled. “It was
only natural. If birds found those mushrooms, why not dogs? I just followed my
nose!” he added grandly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Aaron made a dry face. “Tell me, Hassan, do you Muslim
infidels have any ‘bio-stimulants’ of your own? Like those mushrooms?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Us true warriours need no ‘sti<b>mu</b>la<b>nts</b>’, but
some good wine,” Hassan smacked his lips.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Drinking wine is a sin, and you're an infidel,” Hassan
muttered under his nose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It is not!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The way you’re drinking it, it is! Some times you’re not
touching it at all, other times you’re drinking it by pails at once! Naturally
you get in trouble because of it so often!” Aaron paused, looking at his
comrade’s face. “Say, why <i>are</i> you looking so smug?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Am not!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Are too! You look smug as a cat, who saw a pot, full of
sour cream…” Suddenly Aaron’s face unclouded. “Oh, I get it! It’s that little
maid of the old lady, the one on whom Peter Joneston decided to concentrate his
gaze too. What is with <i>goy</i> men falling in lust with younger <i>goy</i>
women anyways?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You won’t get it, you old ape,” Hassan shook his head in
mock sadness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mr. Guthan? Mr. – Hassan?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two men turned around. ‘That little maid of the old
lady’, an Asia-American, Tiffany something, was walking down the street as
well. “What are you doing here, Miss Tiffany?” Aaron said, before his partner
opened his mouth and said something <i>ribald</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I'm searching for my mistress’s older white bulldog,
Biter,” Tiffany exclaimed. “Did you see it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No,” Aaron shook his head in the genuine concern. “Sorry
Miss, we didn’t.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But we’ll be happy to help you search for it,” Hassan said
quickly. “Won't we, Aaron?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, thank you, sirs,” Tiffany said in genuine appreciation.
“The bulldog <i>needs</i> to be found, before some disaster strikes again.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Aaron’s complaint died on his tongue, unsaid. After all,
they <i>didn’t</i> know what they were looking for in particular, and a white
bulldog was some sort of a tangible goal, after all. “Don't worry Miss, we’ll
help you find it,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was then a police patrol car cruiser drove by. The trio
followed it with <i>long</i> glances.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Say, Miss Barksdale,” Angela Li turned Amy Barksdale.
“You're a reporter, right?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, I work in TV business, yes. Why do you ask?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“My ‘new-old’ friends in the LPD just called. Apparently,
they’ve been called to investigate a complaint of animal cruelty in the Upper
Lawndale area. Care to take a stroll there with your, ah, news stuff? You may
find something worthy of your recording equipment.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, but I barely now Lower Lawndale. Mayhaps I get lost up
there?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don't worry, I'll help you find your way around there,” Ms.
Li chuckled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Then lead-on.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two women left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey, Daria!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ow hi there, Jane. Hi, Penny.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why’s the long face?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s my family. They’re at it again,” Daria deadpanned. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Your parents are oblivious, and your sister is annoying?”
Penny brought-out. “What is her name? Quinn?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, that is so. Apparently, it takes a very strong crisis
to shake us out of our routine lifestyle.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You mean like me taking you for an unofficial third-rate
global tour?” Penny asked, mockingly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes.” Daria paused. “No, scratch that. “I guess that mom
does have the right to be absent-minded, since Upchuck and his dad were two of
the more <i>prominent</i> clients of the firm. No, it’s Monique that’s got me
wigged.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Monique?” Penny frowned. “Trent’s supposed girlfriend? She
came here this morning. Let me guess – she talked about Monday’s news.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Did she give you any reasons why?” Penny asked, curious. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“One reason disguised as two, actually,” Daria admitted.
“They – the ‘poor folk’ on Dega street – they’ll get most, if not all of the
lumps.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Do you believe her?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don’t care. We're not too close to each other, remember?
In fact, I don’t think she knows where I live – it looked to me like she
accidentally ran into me on the street, see?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It looks to <i>me</i>,” Penny said thoughtfully, “that
Monique is working for someone.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Say what? Care to substantiate this theory?” Daria and Jane
looked with eagerness at the older girl.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Penny paused, unwilling to share with the younger girls some
of her crazier suspicions and wonderments around Monique. “Look, Monique came
to see Trent this morning, and talked to me instead.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ah,” said Jane. “That explains why you were so inquiring
about her when I came home.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, well, anyway, she was already back then interested in
any news on the sitch.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So’s the majority of Lawndale,” Daria argued. “After all, a
double beheading is big news even for Boston or Gloucester, I reckon, let alone
a little town like Lawndale. And secondly, I suspect, everybody will – publicly
or privately – feel relief when the killer or killers will be put in jail.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So how does this stack-up against Monique?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not seriously – certainly not courtroom-rate material,”
Penny admitted. “Bu-ut, also seriously – what kind of a person will go all day
long, searching for the info – <i>seriously</i> searching for the info, not
just some casual questions?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Good point,” Daria admitted, not happily. “Monique did seem
to be knowing rather well what she was talking about.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But who could hire her?” Jane asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Who would hire her, you mean,” Penny corrected her little
sister. “I doubt that Monique is a professional investigator, you know?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The phone rang.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Excuse me, Ms. Li?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, Miss Barksdale?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Can I… just phone my relatives and tell them that I might
just be late for dinner and such?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ms. Li pondered that. “Very well,” she agreed. “Call them.
But be curt.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes ma’am!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Who is it?” Daria spoke into the receiver.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Daria? It is I, Amy. I'll be late today – I’m on a tour of
Upper Lawndale.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Right. Roger,” Daria said, and Amy on the other end
hanged-up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Who was it?” Jane asked Daria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Amy. She’s touring Upper Lawndale.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Really, why?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey girls, want to hear a strange thing?” Penny Lane spoke
from her point of the room. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I just saw a police cruiser go by really fast, but with
its’ blinker and siren turned-off, headed in – that direction, I believe.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That way lies Upper Lawndale, too,” Jane added
thoughtfully. “Daria, something tells me that Ms. Li will be a bit sympathetic
if we develop slight tardiness in our studies.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria sighed. “Very well, come on. It’s natural that I’m
worried about Amy; after all, I’m only human.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Lane sisters exchanged some strange looks, as they went
outside.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Where are we going again?” police lieutenant Reilly asked
his partner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“To check a complaint of Mrs. Vudrudakis about animal
cruelty of her neighbours,” the other police officer shrugged. “Heck, it must
be pretty important that our law firm got a notice of that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, that old witch does live in the posher parts of the
neighbourhood,” Reilly commented. “And – here we are.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They stopped before a small, but well-managed estate, and
rang the doorbell.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A small, wizened old lady opened the door. “Who is it?” she
asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Police officers Reilly and James about a complaint of
animal cruelty?” Reilly asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“At last! Well, come to the veranda, I'll tell you all.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tiffany, Hassan and Aaron were following the police cruiser,
when it stopped before a small dwelling. An old lady appeared shortly
afterwards, and took them inside to a veranda.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hassan and Aaron exchanged glances. Aaron wanted to ditch
the girl and learn what the policemen were talking about with the old woman;
Hassan was having doubts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tiffany solved it by herself. “Do you think this looks like
a dog’s crawlway?” she asked Hassan, pointing to such an opening under the
fence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hassan looked it, flushing his nostrils. “It could be,” he
agreed eagerly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Do you think that the proprietress will mind if we have a
look for Biter on her grounds?” Tiffany continued her idea.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Leave everything to us, Miss,” Aaron said grandly. He and
Hassan knew how to get in already.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So ma’am, what was your complaint about, exactly?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, you don't know how the poor animals are treated around
here!” Mrs. Vudrudakis exclaimed. “Those poor ponies in the pony ride in the
zoo are covered with sores, and the cats and dogs around here are so scraggy
and skinny!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Kind of like the Ruttheimers were,” Reilly told his partner,
as if he was making a private comment. But Mrs. Vudrudakis heard it as well and
pounced onto it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The Ruttheimers? Why, they were some of the worst cases
around here! They and their Nicholson neighbour – he was as bad as they were!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ow? How so?” The police officers exchanged looks with each
other, pencils and notebooks appearing as if from nowhere in their hands. “It’s
your neighbours you’re talking about, right?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Unfortunately, yes. Those reprobates! The Ruttheimers,
wicked pennypinchers, starved themselves and their help, let alone poor
animals! And Nicholson – oh, he the true Catholic!! Why, when I called his
attention to the fact that Ruttheimers, father and son, were wicked, and that a
man was judged for the company he kept, he threatened me!! Told me to go to
Hell!! Why, that smooth-faced liar and hypocrite! The fact that both
Ruttheimers – those two misers – are dead, it’s his doing, no doubt!!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Right, ma’am, so what has overfilled the cup of your
patience, that you launched a complaint to Lawndale’s lawyer firm?” Lt. Reilly
asked, instead of telling her to shut-up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why, their latest devilry – whatever they had grown in that
bloody copse of theirs!” Mrs. Vudrudakis snapped. “It’s just a few feet away
from my back fence, don't you see?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Right. So what was ‘their latest devilry’?” Reilly
persisted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I have no idea! But poor birds dropped like crazy, as if
from some pestilence, and one of them fell almost upon my tea-cup.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Say ma’am,” James spoke for the first time. “Was it just
birds, or some other animals? Squirrels, perhaps, or small dogs?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Dogs too, dogs too! A couple of dogs went into that copse
and exited it, looking drunk, drugged! Why, something white is showing there
even now!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Curious, the two officers went there to see what white <i>was</i>
showing over there – and returned, looking whitish-green themselves. “Ma’am,”
one of them spoke, “you better come inside. This isn’t a sight for you to see.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The three conspirators hid behind a house corner, watching
the drama unfold. One of the policemen took the old lady into the house, while
the other one drugged from out of the bushes and over the fence a…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hassan and Aaron barely had time to prevent Tiffany from
screaming. But even so, their actions were wasted, for the old lady saw what
the other policeman brought forth too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Her screams shook-up the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What has happened here?” Ms. Li asked Lt. Leslie James, as
she and Lt. Reilly turned-on their blinker, and contacted the LPD’s HQ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The police officer explained. Amy turned green, but Angela took
her by the hand, and dragged her towards the crime scene. No one looked in
their direction, everything was in chaos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hello? Mr. Arnolds? It’s Tiffany Blum-Deckler...” The
girl’s voice was shaking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What’s going-on? Did you find the dog?” the major-domo
snapped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Aaron quickly took-over the conversation. “Yes Mr. Arnolds,
but it is dead?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What do you mean, dead?” the major-domo roared, ignoring
and uncaring that somebody might overhear it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Somebody caved-in its head with an axe,” Aaron explained helpfully.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What?” somebody else roared into the phone’s receiver.
Sadly, it was Mrs. Petersen herself, who started to listen-in on the phone
conversation early enough.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Somebody caved-in its head with an axe,” Aaron repeated
himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mrs. Petersen fainted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, Ms. Li, did you find anything?” Amy Barksdale
nervously asked, as the older woman finished examining the crime scene. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, I think I have,” Angela Li replied thoughtfully, as
they returned back to the front, unnoticed by everyone in the hubbub. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Or rather – by every person, for a bird – a big one, like a
hawk or a kite, was watching everything from a lamp-post, most attentively,
noticing what everyone below it was doing…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“…So tell me, Miss Barksdale,” Ms. Li’s spirits were
seemingly going up, “is your sister Helen involved in this?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“As a lawyer you mean? I'm not sure, but here’s the lawyer
squad arriving.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why won't we go over there and say hello?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Eric Schrecter was in a foul mood. His cousin Alan and Mindy
Horowitz took him along in case it’ll be medical, but he doubted it. “Couldn't
it be just something land-related?” he sighed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mr. Schrecter?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes?” he turned around in the direction of the meek voice –
and instantly his day brightened. “Why, you’re Helen’s sister! The TV anchor!
Amy Barksdale?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s me,” Amy nodded in delight. “Me and my friend Ms. Li
were taking a stroll through here, when we heard the screaming-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“-And found a clue,” Ms. Li interrupted curtly Amy’s bubble.
“Take some of your law-protecting buddies with you and let me show it <i>before</i>
it is trodden-down into oblivion.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a change, Daria, Jane and Penny arrived amongst the last
arrivals – and so they have missed on most of the drama. They <i>did</i>,
however, see a weeping Tiffany being consoled by the pair of men they saw on
Monday as being assistants of Mrs. Griffin’s missing cousin, and Amy Barksdale
and Ms. Li talking with several men very animatedly. And then Mrs. Griffin’s
sister – aka Sophia Hakiojopoulos – arrived on the crime scene as well. “What
the hell is going-on here?” she barked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The chief of LPD, police officer Matson, turned to her.
“You're the federal investigator, aren’t you?” he asked, none too happy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes. And I’m also Mrs. Petersen’s guest, and currently my
hostess is in a deep shock, too. So what’s going-on here?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Let me handle this, Valeriy Vitale interceded smoothly
before the two bearers of American law-and-order. “Ms. Hakiojopoulos, kindly
wait. This is a <i>partially-private</i> investigation.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sophia’s gaze went over the smooth lawyer leader. “I <i>expect</i>
a spoken report this evening, however – which gives you, oh, about two hours,”
she said in a steely voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But of course,” Vitale agreed easily and readily, “but of
course.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, girls, it looks like that we're too late,” Penny Lane
shook her head sadly. “As they say in Siberian villages, the fighting is done,
and all that’s left to do is to sort whose hat belongs to who.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Say, isn't that Monique, talking to some unpleasant – girl?
That’s a girl, right?” Jane asked her older sister instead. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Penny and Daria looked there. Monique <i>was</i> talking to
some female, who looked like Monique, a few years older – and a few degrees
nastier. And that girl gave-off serious wiggins on Penny’s radar. “That’s it,”
the older Lane sister muttered. “Daria, Jane – keep watch for Amy; I'm going to
be a concerned sister and talk with Monique about Trent.” She left, leaving the
younger girls rather confused.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“This is unpleasant news, Calais,” Monique was saying to the
other girl. “Both the flock’s leader and our benefactress-“ she suddenly
stopped, as Penny came within earshot. “Hello, Penny,” she said, turning
around.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hello, Monique,” Penny replied, looking none-too-happy.
“Can you and I talk? In private?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, here we are, in private, so talk,” Monique said
curtly to Penny. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Certainly. Monique – I've known you barely for an
incomplete day, and I’m starting to dislike you. You seem to have an
above-average interest in this gruesome manner, you’re cloaked in mystery, and
you keep unpleasant characters around.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Trent doesn't mind.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Trent probably isn’t aware of that fact. I’m surprised that
he is – or was – aware enough to recognize you as his girlfriend. I'm not
Trent, however, and I do not fancy the idea of you being my future
sister-in-law.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I do not plan to marry Trent,” Monique said, almost
growling. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“All the more reason for you to stop coming to our home,”
Penny replied. “I do not fancy waking-up one morning and discovering that you
suckered my brother into providing temporary housing for Calais over there, or
anybody else in your band.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monique’s face turned rigid, her eyes turned cold, her voice
– icy. “I will come and go to your house as long as I please,” she said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You do whatever you want, Monique,” Penny said, her own
gaze and voice hard steely, “but you’ll never be welcome there – ever. I <i>really</i>
don’t like your attitude.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, you can suck my-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And it’s break-up time, ladies,” Lt. James pulled the girls
apart. “Pick your quarrels somewhere else – somewhere private, okay?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two girls pierced the police officer with bone-chilling
gazes, but each went to different parts of the crowd. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Officer James exclaimed. The last thing needed right now was
a fight, it could easily start-up a riot in <i>this</i> atmosphere…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey, aunt Amy,” Daria said, approaching her aunt. “What’s
going-on in here?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ow! Hey, Daria,” Amy said, feeling surprisingly shy. “What
are you doing here?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“We were attracted by the hubbub – now answer <i>my</i>
question?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, Ms. Li was showing me around town, when we heard the
police’s siren and saw its’ blinker. Ms. Li went to investigate – and found-”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Actually,” Lt. Reilly heard Amy’s story and decided to set
things right, “actually, it was me and my mate who found the evidence of the
dirty deed.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Which is what?” Daria asked. “Do tell.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don’t know, kid,” the police officer looked genuinely
debateable, whether to tell her or not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ow, come <i>on</i>,” Daria pleaded. “After all, after
yesterday, when two human corpses were fished from the river with no heads
attached, surely whatever has happened today won't be anywhere as bad?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The policeman sighed. “We found a dead dog. Over there. In
the bushes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So what’s so bad about it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The dog’s head was caved-in. With an axe.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How can you be sure that an axe was used?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“’Cause it was still there, in the victim.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Great!” Jane said sarcastically to Daria. “Now Lawndale has
its’ very own axe-murderer! Just like those horror flicks we're so fond-of!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s the trouble with today’s youth,” Eric meanwhile told
Amy, using the fact that no one was paying attention to them. “They just watch
the wrong things on television – and then act them out in real life, with the
consequences like of today, and possibly yesterday.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Do you think there’s only one culprit behind today and yesterday?”
Amy eagerly asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I hope so. Because otherwise it would mean that there’s a
copycat – and we’ll have to catch <i>two</i> murderers, which is at least <i>twice</i>
as hard than to catch one,” police officer James spoke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Eh, do you know whose dog it was?” Penny asked, returning
from her brief confrontation with Monique.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The answer came from the mouths of yet newer arrivals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes,” Mrs. Petersen’s major-domo, Lawrence Arnolds, said,
ashen-faced. “This is Biter, Mrs. Petersen’s second oldest bulldog.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How can you be sure, sir?” a policeman asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Only Mrs. Petersen’s bulldogs are white with just one brown
ear – the right one. And also, I've seen a lot of Biter for the last five
years, so I know him pretty much on sight.” He paused. “Can I take the body off
your hands?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Certainly, sir. You just have to sign some papers,” Valeriy
Vitale said, aware of Sophia’s steely gaze on him. “And may I add, that both
our investigator and that of the police found hints of whodunit’s identity
might be. And so, we expect that all interested parties came to Mrs. Petersen’s
manour this evening for some revelations.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both Arnolds and Sophia nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Later this evening, Mrs. Petersen’s manour was once again
abuzz with activity – but it was activity of different kind. The powerful old
lady seemed to have received a shock from which she couldn't recover: her life
force almost vanished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“…Why are we here, mom?” Jodie Landon nervously asked
Michelle, as she held her younger sister Rachel by hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Because your ex-grandmother-in-law requested it, I was
told,” Michelle said thoughtfully, none-too-happy about it herself. “And it’s
impolite to refuse a woman in her condition, now is it? Just play along, girls,
and hopefully we’ll soon leave, okay?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jodie and Rachael reluctantly nodded. “Good. Now go and
mingle with our guests.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jodie and Rachael went off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was then, seemingly, a shadow slid off the wall and
became 3-D. Actually, it was Sophia Hakiojopoulos. “Good work with your girls,
Mi,” she said with genuine respect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Knock it off, Sophia,” Michelle replied. Something knocked
against a window – a branch or maybe not. Sophia was instantly over there,
staring intensely into the night. “Sophia, what are you doing?” Michelle
nervously called-out. The unstable light and shifting shadows made Sophia’s
face appear ridged, cold, inhuman, while her eyes glowed from some street-light
reflected in them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I'm sorry, Michelle,” Sophia turned around, now looking
completely human as before. “It’s just that I feel that something is out
there.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, there is. Whoever killed the Ruttheimers and Biter.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“<i>And</i> possibly poisoned Wanderer?” Sophia added wryly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not exactly. I think Wanderer’s death came from natural
causes – he ate what wasn't right for him, hence the moral: don't eat anything
off the ground.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hmm,” Sophia nodded. “That’s true, of course, but there is
also something – or someone – else. Someone who is hostile to <i>me</i> in
particular.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Possibly Linda Griffin?” Michelle suggested. “Not that she’s
a wonderful boss, but she does seem to hate you with a passion that’s beyond
natural.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sophia nodded. “Perhaps you're right. But I think that there
is somebody – possibly more than one – involved in this as well.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mother, why do we have to be here?” Sandi Griffin asked her
mom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Because it’s good manners,” Linda snapped. “If this was
some legal manner, concerning, say, the inheritance of the Petersen manour –
than we <i>would</i> have no right to be here. But this – this is a private
soiree, and we can be here.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Actually,” spoke Eugene Podgio, a friend of Arnolds’ and a
guest of Mrs. Petersen (and a possible groom of Miss Joneston), “this isn't
what one would call a soiree, not really.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And how would you know that, sir?” Linda Griffin instantly
bristled. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I'm having one on Thursday, lady. At Lawndale’s Art
Gallery, to be exact. Didn't you see the posters?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ah, yes,” Linda nodded. “I see. See you then, then.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Right.” Eugene Podgio left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I’m impressed with your people skills, Linda,” a voice
spoke from the shadows. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mom? Is it one of your weird friends?” Sandi asked
nervously. She only heard them on the phone; they had some sort of a curious
accent – or even voice-sets – and she didn't fancy meeting one of them in person.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, it is,” the voice from the shadows agreed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mom,” Sandi continued, heartened, in a fashion, by this
admission. “Why’d you bring me here? There’s nobody of my age in there.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sure there are,” Linda argued. “Amy Barksdale brought her
Morgendorffer nieces along – you’re friends with one of them, right?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah, but Michelle Landon also brought her girls,” Sandi
shrugged. “Still, Rachael too young to be worrisome, and I <i>can</i> handle
Jodie, I believe… Well, I'll be off, mom, have fun talking to your friend.” She
went into the living room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You two <i>are</i> kin,” the voice from the shadows spoke. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don’t think we’ve met in person <i>before</i>, Alecto,”
Linda Griffin’s voice was bone cold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So we haven’t. Even now, for you cannot see me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yet you can see <i>me</i>. Step into the light, Alecto, <i>now</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The leader of the Harpies stepped forth. She was a tall,
powerfully-built woman; probably more intimidating than an average male citizen
of Lawndale. Alecto’s hair was darker than her black clothing while the irises
of her eyes were yellow, like a hawk’s. Alecto’s hands were in the pockets of
her pants. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Linda looked over the taller woman. “So what is so urgent
that you came to see me in person.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why, tis those murders.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Monique told me that you didn't have anything to worry about.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That was early morning. Now, new things are appearing that
Monique was unaware of in the morning.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Linda shrugged. “Night brings forth things that morning’s
unaware off? Why I’m not surprised?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“How about this: I saw your sister of whose existence you’ve
admitted this morning, and – I believe that your family legend is true.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Linda’s face turned icily rigid. “Why are you telling me
this, Alecto? Don't you want to stay in my good graces?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Are you threatening me and my flock?” Alecto’s voice was
very calm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Are you trying to get me angry?” Some of ice drained from
Linda’s voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alecto’s eyebrows rose. “You were always smart, Linda
Griffin. But seriously, the murderer concerns us too. Do not think that we’re
high and mighty.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Linda shrugged. “Very well. Are you here to enjoy the-
soiree?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why not. Care to show me around?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Linda nodded. “Why not?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jodie was walking through the corridor, when she collided
into somebody. “Hey!” she and that somebody spoke simultaneously. Then they
took a good look at each other. “So you’re my cousin,” once again they spoke at
the same time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jodie Landon and Nina Joneston finally met, and at once
tension ran through the air. “So you’re one of my cousins?” Nina asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I've met your mom – my aunt – earlier today. She and dad
have a great family resemblance, you know? And so do you – look like my dad, I
mean.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah, I was told by my mom that I rather look like my late
uncle Joseph,” Jodie agreed. “You, however, look like <i>our</i> grandmother,
you know?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What does grandmother Joneston look like?” Nina asked,
curious. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Like you. But taller than you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I see. Taller than dad?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don’t remember uncle Joseph that well,” Jodie admitted.
“Taller than my mom, for certain, though.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nina nodded, storing that bit of information. “Say, did you
meet my brother Peter?” she asked,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not yet.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Do you have any siblings? No, wait, I heard your mother
tell grandmother Louisa that you have a younger sister – Rachael?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, she’s here with me and my mom tonight. Dad – couldn't
make it. And I have a baby brother too, his name is Evan.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Must be nice having a baby brother,” Nina muttered. “<i>My</i>
brother, Peter, is almost as bad a womanizer as that Ruttheimer boy was.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You know Up… Charles Ruttheimer the III?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Him? Oh yeah. He and his father usually were with Alexander
Nicholson – another man with issues about women.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Do you have any opinion on who could’ve done it?” Jodie
carefully asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nina carefully looked around and shrugged. “I have no idea.
Remember, too, Jodie, that on Saturday there was a lot of rain outside.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So what?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, I think that whoever done them in did it then – since
it was the best of times to do that type of thing.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And he has also killed Biter?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That I cannot be sure of. That could’ve been anyone. That
old hag, Mrs. Vudrudakis, for one thing. She always claims to be a big animal
lover, but grandmother Louisa always says that whoever is raising the most murk
in the water may be the one to benefit from it the most.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jodie shrugged. “Maybe you’re right.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Want me to show you around?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why not?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hello, Tiffany.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ow hi, Mr. – Hassan, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Please, call me Hassan. Just Hassan, really. It’s my mate
Aaron who is <i>Mr.</i> Guthan, while our boss is Ms. Hakio – and so on.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Right,” Tiffany nodded. “So, uh, what do you do for a
living?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Follow my boss around, help her with whatever the Bureau
assigned her to investigate – or if she just found something on her own.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But how’d you <i>met</i> her?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hassan paused, remembering the crazy times of his teenage
years, and how he was <i>extremely</i> lucky to get out of it with his hide
unscathed and his life kept… “It was a coincidence,” he finally said. “One of
those things that work-out in the end, you know?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ye-es,” said Tiffany, who was thinking her own thoughts. “I
do see. Is it terribly exciting, working for her?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It’s not dull, not dull,” Hassan said. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tiffany just nodded, smuggling up to him. And then, there
was no more talking for awhile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sandi, what are you doing here?” Quinn Morgendorffer asked,
surprised. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s what I would like to know too,” Sandi sighed. “Mom
made do it – what’s your story?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, both my mom and aunt Amy are in attendance – mom
because she works for the firm and aunt Amy as a guest of honour. Therefore,
mom took me and Daria so that we could impress, perhaps, some important
people.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Did you see Tiffany around here?” Sandi asked, very
quietly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quinn shook her head. “But I think I saw Jodie.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh drat. <i>That’s </i>the last person <i>I</i> want to
meet right now. Seriously though, I guess this means that Mrs. Landon is here
too.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And what can <i>I</i> do for you, ladies?” Peter Joneston
appeared behind their backs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sandi and Quinn glared. They’ve been instructed somewhat
about who’s who around here, and besides, there was something quite
‘Upchuckian’ about Peter Joneston in any way, so the two quickly walked away. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Peter Joneston just glared at their backs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria Morgendorffer just stood by the refreshment centre and
acted bored. She <i>was</i> bored – after Monday and today’s afternoon, this
Tuesday’s evening was rather anti-climatic. And so Daria idly looked around,
and saw Linda Griffin. The latter was walking around with some female stranger,
who was tall, yet female, and reminded Daria of a Monique. Somewhat. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ah, Miss Morgendorffer,” Ms. Li’s voice’s spoke over her
head. “And why did you answer <i>this</i> social call?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Both mom and Amy were going, and so me and Quinn went too,”
Daria said grouchily. She could see aunt Amy, deep in a conversation with her
mother’s lawyer boss, and that made her cranky. “Why are <i>you</i> here?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Why, I’m a ‘guest of honour’,” Ms. Li smiled unpleasantly.
“That smooth lawyer, Vitale…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You know him?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I know of him. Supermen of law, they are. Belonging in
Hell, they are too.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And Master Yoda next, you are not,” Daria replied in the
same fashion. “Still, did you see Tiffany around here?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not since this afternoon,” Ms. Li shrugged, growing serious
once more. “Oh well, this is largely informal, now that Mrs. Petersen is now largely
out of picture, so maybe she’s slacking-off. I can understand. That bulldog
with a cloven head <i>was</i> a rather unappetizing picture, after all.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You seemed to have been holding-out quite nicely,” Daria
casually noted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I'm two…three decades older than Miss Blum-Deckler, Miss
Morgendorffer,” Ms. Li said calmly. “Naturally I have better self-control than
your sister’s friend.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Speaking of friends, here comes Jodie Landon and Nina
Joneston – re-discovered cousins,” Daria said casually.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So they do,” Ms. Li agreed calmly. “Miss Morgendorffer, if
they show any interest in talking to you, please reply in kind.” With those
parting words Ms. Li seemingly lost interest in everything, but the contents of
her glass of punch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria shrugged, and turned to wait.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She didn’t have to wait long. The two female Afro-Americans <i>did</i>
approach her, after all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey, Daria!” Jodie cheerfully said. “This is Nina, daughter
of my late uncle Joseph.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey,” Daria said, unsure where she stood with Jodie’s
cousin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey!” Nina cheerfully replied. “So you’re Jodie’s friend?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“One of them, at any rate,” Daria agreed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Where’s Jane?” Jodie asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“She’s at home. The Lanes have some sort of an unpleasant
family development launching at their house.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sorry to hear that,” Nina said. “Maybe me and my brother
can help – financially?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I don’t think so,” Daria said, her face expressionless.
“The Lanes – from oldest to youngest – have views and certain issues concerning
financial aide from strange and unknown people. So-”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s cool, but maybe something can be worked-out still,”
Nina argued. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, the next time I see Jane – and that’ll be on school
morning Wednesday tomorrow, Jodie will relate your kind offer to her, and see
what’ll come-up.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Splendid!” Nina Joneston beamed. “Jodie you do that – oh
drat, I got to go. Talk to you to later!” She left in a hurry, leaving Jodie
and Daria somewhat confused. Then they saw Alexander Nicholson pass them by,
and they had a revelation…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so, the time went by. However, soon, at 8:30 PM, Valeriy
Vitale called that the guests would group together at last.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ladies and gentlemen!” the leading lawyer said, while his
assistants for the evening – Eric Schrecter, Alan Schrecter, and Mindy Horowitz
– took their places close to him. “I've assembled you all tonight because of a
reason, or rather – you came here because of a reason – who is responsible for
this, this state of Mrs. Petersen.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sophia Hakiojopoulos frowned. Underneath the smooth veneer
of the lawyer’s speech something stank. It was a ratty smell, it was more of a
general wrongness kind of one. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“As you all know, yesterday, our town was shocked – shocked
by the fact that two of our more prominent citizens – you even knew them – Mr.
Charles Ruttheimer Jr., and his son Charles Ruttheimer the III. Whoever did
that to them will pay – in their own time. But for now we have another problem
– the demise of Biter the white bulldog.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Typical,” Daria muttered to no one. “A bulldog’s death is
equalized to a beheading of two humans. Just another sign that our society is
going to Hell in a handbasket.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hmm?” sounded to her right. Daria looked there, and her
eyes travelled up – and up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Who're you?” she asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not now,” the extra-tall woman said. “The lawyer there is
getting to the climax of his speech.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And so, when today the dog’s body was discovered, something
else was found too: a clue! A clue as to who done <i>that</i> particular crime,
at any rate.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Dogs before people. Nice to see that the prerogatives are kept
still in human society,” Daria mumbled, keeping a watchful eye on her
unexpected neighbour, who seemingly ignored her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The clue was a series of footprints,” Valeriy Vitale
rumbled, pointing to a series of slides. “A series of footprints belonging to
female shoes – lady shoes!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What’s he driving at?” Linda Griffin wondered. Angela Li,
who was standing next to her, just shook her head. Dumb lawyer show-off
theatrics. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The thorough investigation of those footprints have brought
forth another fact – that this was an inside job: whoever that had killed Biter
actually <i>knew</i> him.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Just get to the point already, Slick,” Angela Li shook her
head in dejection. She disliked that lawyer profusely – and she just met him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“This resulted in another thorough investigation of the lady
shoes in the house, and a culprit was found,” Vitale’s voice rose high.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Damn theatrics,” Angela Li, Daria Morgendorffer, and Alecto
thought at the same time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It was – Nina Joneston!” the lawyer’s voice shook. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Crash! The mulatto woman jumped-off the chair before anyone
else could react and fled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, I wonder what Daria is doing,” Jane told her sister
Penny, who was busy surfing the Internet. “It’s a piety that we didn't go.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Jane, you told me yourself that you’re feeling sort of threatened
by Daria in the family plan,” Penny said jokingly. “Well, here’s the choice for
the two of you to do individual things.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mmm,” Jane said wryly. “I've been doing my ‘individual
thing’ way after you left and way before Daria came. Coincidentally, what did
break-up that perfect pair of you two?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Jane, don't you start,” Penny said in an edgy voice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Sorry, I'm just curious. Answer me laconically, if you
prefer.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Laconically? – Very well. Two factors: our mom and Daria’s
sister.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Quinn? What did <i>she</i> do?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“She got born.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Ooo-kay. I can really see how you and Daria bonded. But to
those of us uninitiated folks, what has happened.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Didn't you ask for a <i>laconic</i> version?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah, but not with the generous helping of mystery on the
side too. Penny, spill!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was some sound on the roof.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Penny,” Jane finally said. “What’s that?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, it’s nothing, probably just the crows or some other
birds, pecking something up the roof,” Penny shook her head. “Nothing to worry
about.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Should I wake Trent?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Actually, I think his snores do an admirable job of scaring
the possible perpetrators away as it is. Let him lie.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He’s the man of the house- in dad’s absence. And Wind’s
absence, too.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And which one of those three is the most manliest?” Penny
asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You,” Jane said with an angelic smile. The two sisters
laughed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the sound returned – scratching and tapping over the
window. “Read Poe much?” Penny turned to Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I once tried to draw the Raven, yes, but it turned-out
rather unimpressive,” Jane admitted. “And, for some reason, I put it on the
bust of our great-aunt Olivia – you know, the one that lived in Africa?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh yeah.” Now the two sisters clearly heard the scratching
and the tapping noises on the wall over their window.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Excuse me,” Penny quietly said. “Jane, here’s the plan.”
She produced a large, thin, rectangular suitcase from under the bed. “You stick
your head outside and see what’s the matter – I’m right behind you with <i>back-up</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane looked at Penny intently. “Very well. But if something
happens – say, I get my eyes pecked-out, or ripped-out, or something – it’ll be
on <i>your</i> medical plan.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You got it, sister,” Penny smiled piratically. “Now go and
stick your head out of the window!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane did. Instantly, a pair of some strong, sinewy paws or
talons or whatever grasped her by the neck and began to choke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>BANG!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The pressure vanished instantly, and Jane felt how somebody
pulled her back in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Jane, are you okay?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Well, I still have my eyes and not two bloody messes in my
eye-sockets, so yeah. Still, how did that?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don’t know. I shot at it, but it got away?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You have a gun?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“A hunting rifle, yes. I think I hit it, but it got away.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Great,” Jane said. “A trained animal killer. What next?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Next,” Penny said, smelling Jane’s head, “you need a bath.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You're right. Whatever it was, it stank. And now – so do I.
I hate this evening.” Jane went downstairs in order to take a bath.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Penny smiled once again – and it was an unpleasant smile.
“You know something, Monique-and-the-Harpies,” she said coldly. “This means <i>war</i>.”</p>
