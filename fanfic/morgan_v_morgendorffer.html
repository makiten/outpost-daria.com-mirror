<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Isn’t it strange that all your husbands
just seem to die with elevated nicotine levels?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The woman stammered as she replied “th-they
smoke, I told them to quit-”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“No one else saw them smoke,” said the man
as he picked up a scalpel and slowly drew it down the woman’s cheek.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“They hid it from all but me, please,
whatever you’re planning-”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“There were no cigarette butts in the
trash, no cigar butts, the pipes and pipe tobacco was unused, it was only the
last two that cops started to make the connection but they never had enough to
actually build a case or for probable cause, and your husbands got increasingly
agitated as their nicotine was suddenly cut off and they then die in a car
crash on their way to work in the morning.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The woman just stopped talking now. She
knew she was busted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“So what are you planning to do to me?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The man picked up a slide and a pipette and
placed some drops of the woman’s face and he smeared the blood between the
sheets of glass.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>After he put the slide … … wherever he put
it, he picked up a knife. He placed the tip of the knife over the soft spot
under the woman’s sternum.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She had long ago given up trying to free
herself of the plastic and ductape that pinned her to the table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Having a knife slide into her chest and
through her heart hurt less than she thought it would. She felt the flesh part
around the knife, it felt cold and it stung, and the way her heart reacted to
the knife entering one of it’s lower chambers felt like a really bad period
only higher up and with a much heavier discharge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It took less than fifteen seconds for her
to lose consciousness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Having fed the gators, Dexter returned to
his new harbour.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The cops, led by Frank Lundy, were still
working on the bay harbour, so now Dexter dropped his cadavers into the
everglades.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It was strange that having the feds arrive
in force would shut Dexter down for the foreseeable future, but a local serial
killer was the business of local cops first with a single federal agent leading
the investigation, whereas that vigilante that showed up recently, he was
essentially considered a terrorist, and had he killed anyone on Dexter’s turf
under the call sign of the Bay Harbour Butcher, the full weight of the FBI
would have been brought to bear and the effect the cops were after, Dexter
being unable to kill anyone, would have been achieved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Dexter got in his car and returned to Miami.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The gators should mean that the current
cake and ass party shouldn’t happen again, unlike the refrigeration of the sea,
the stomachs of the alligators should destroy the evidence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Should … …</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If any body parts were found here, Dexter
would have to move again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>And there lied his worst enemy: A pattern
of activity matching his pattern of movement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>What other options did he have?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He could try incineration, but he would
have to pick his venue carefully. He could try placing the cadavers in medical
waste bins in marked biohazard bags, that should be fairly reliable, but that
could still go wrong and he would be found out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He could dig a pit, fill that with
charcoal, placing the parts within the charcoal, mixture of resin and sodium
chlorate to start it, but he would need a location high enough over the water
table that the charcoal won’t get soaked, AND he would need to be absolutely
certain no one would walk in on him as he was burning the bodies or that no one
would extinguish the fire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>What else?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The Sweeny Todd option?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Dexter chuckled at this idea, he knew it
would horrify Harry, his step dad and mentor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It would mean that he’d only have the bones
and intestines and other inedible or unpalatable organs to dispose of, the rest
could be frozen and consumed at leisure as stews, pies, steaks, curries …</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Debra would have to move out though, sudden
appearances of large amounts of meat and organs in the freezer, especially if
not packaged in the standard containers, and he couldn’t share the meat
preparations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Still, it would save on his food shopping.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He continued to mull things over as he came
up on a woman walking along the side of the road.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Who walks this far from civilisation?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria glanced back at the car coming up
behind her, she reviewed her position with relation to the road, and moved
about 30cm further out just in case.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>But the car was slowing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Cautious driver or was the driver
interested in her?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As she turned slightly towards the vehicle,
she placed her hand on the Sig holstered in the back of her trousers (around
the side, anything hitting you in the back you don’t want your own weapon
helping the enemy, that’s not what it’s there for) under her backpack full of
two or three dried snacks, a camping pan, some firelighters, and just about
every gun she felt she could bring along from the last city she had hit. She’d
even managed to get some inside holsters, holsters that conceal the gun on the
inside of the trousers, that meant she didn’t have to worry about the gun
sliding into or out of her trousers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The fact she was reaching for a gun should
be concealed from the angle the driver was viewing her from.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The man lowered the window and asked “are
you okay? This is a bit far out of town for a pedestrian.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This guy was probably a local, or he
wouldn’t be commenting on the remoteness of the location.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“I’m fine, wouldn’t mind a lift though,”
said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If this guy decided to attack her, she
would feel perfectly fine with the idea of slotting him and making off with his
car.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If he didn’t, it would be a free ride, maybe
a way to gather some intel on her next target: Miami.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“I’m prepared to reimburse estimated fuel
costs.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“That’s not necessary, I’m headed for Miami, is that your destination?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“It is.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Hop in.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria removed her pack and stepped into the
car. She wore loose jeans and a loose red shirt with a pineapple motif and a
tan coloured fishing hat. The shirt was big enough to hang over the gun holstered
inside the back of her trousers. Her boots were high enough to seal the
trousers against snakes and other creatures that she wouldn’t want crawling up
her legs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She closed the door, noting the handle was
still in place and she fastened her seatbelt. If she did slot him, odds are it
would be while they were moving at 70 miles an hour on a highway, and it was
possible the result would include a leap across the central reservation and
having that happen to the vehicle you’re in while you’re not wearing a seat
belt would just make things that little bit worse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She had another gun just under the flap on
the top of the pack, she kept both hands on the carry handle on the top of the
pack in case she needed it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He selected gear 1 and moved off, ascending
to gear 3, and then gear 5 as he reached 40mph.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She looked around the outside of the
vehicle, watching where he went, and kept looking at him, hoping to get some
visual cues in the event he was planning to attack her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He did have this vibe to him that told her
he was dangerous, but she knew that vibes were unreliable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He wasn’t trying to make conversation with
her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He was glancing at her occasionally, as if
trying to assess her mood or intentions. Pick up a stranger in the middle of
nowhere, course he’d be nervous. He’d also be nervous if he was going to attack
her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Some of his glances went to her hands, both
hands on her bag, she was probably providing a clue that she was ready to act
against him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>That could either deter or spur an action
from him. That’s the thing about strangers, you don’t know them, so you
therefore don’t know what they’re going to do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They got onto a main road, route 9336, and
he selected gear 4 to boost to 60mph, returning to gear 5 when he felt they
were moving fast enough.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They were headed to Miami like he said.
Just because he was honest about that part didn’t mean he wasn’t a threat, so
no relaxing until … … No relaxing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They started passing signs of human
civilisations, car parks, farms, etc.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They then passed into the suburbs, the
junctions now too close together to support a 60mph limit, they dropped to
40mph.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Eventually 9336 became a duel carriageway, and
he took Highway 1 to route 821, this was a proper highway, and the speed limit
increased to 70mph.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Eventually they ended up in a hotel
district and Daria said “pull over anywhere along here.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They did. They had stopped in full view of
way too many strangers for him to try anything without drawing attention to his
appearance, his vehicle and his vehicle index, so she released her seatbelt and
prepared to alight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria stepped out of the vehicle taking her
bag with her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Thanks,” she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“No problem,” said the man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She closed the door and walked away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The man pulled away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Now Daria had to find herself somewhere to
hole up while she built enough intel for an attack.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There was something about that woman Dexter
couldn’t quite shake, something about her bothered him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He got home and removed his air
conditioning unit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The box of slides of blood he kept, the
trophies of his previous kills, the only parts of his victims he kept. He added
tonight’s slide, and ran his fingers back and forth over the row of slides.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He then closed the box and put it back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He then put the air conditioning unit back
and sat down behind his desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Turning on his computer, he kept trying to
put a name to the face. He had seen that woman before. Definitely. Where
though?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>His front door opened and Debra entered.
“Evening Dex.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Deb,” acknowledged Dexter. Debra was his
foster sister, she was a homicide detective at Miami Police Department, where
he also worked as a blood splatter analyst.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Have any idea where Clearasil Daria’s
likely to strike next?” asked Debra.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria! That’s the name he was trying to
find.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“No idea,” Dexter said, “if I were her I’d
pick a city out of a hat.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He opened a search engine and entered
‘Clearasil Daria’.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He clicked on one of the images at the top
of the page.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>That was her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Maybe she’ll hit Miami,” said Dexter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“With the Bay Harbour Butcher working
here?” asked Deb.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“The Bay Harbour Butcher only seems to
target killers, she goes after pimps, and she hits them en masse. I think at
some point, she’ll turn her attention to Miami.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Clearasil Daria. Clearasil because
Clearasil eliminates pimples, and Daria eliminates pimps.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She apparently has this idea that if she
just keeps killing them in these massive surprise attacks, eventually people
considering taking up forcing girls and women into prostitution will just stop.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This doesn’t seem to have happened yet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria was like a serial killer in that she
has a key stressor, but that was where it ended. She didn’t stick to one
method, she used all available, she used poison, fire, shrapnel, blast force,
blunt force, sharp force, electricity, radiation, deception, and there was no
way to identify where she had been, she managed to manufacture everything she
needed, RDX, perchloric acid, DDNP, tetryl, used whatever she could buy or
steal, coke cans, pipes, light bulbs, pencil leads (why call them leads?
Graphite for fuck’s sake, no lead in there), gasoline, glycerine from soap,
sodium, silane, phosphorus, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, nitrogen dioxide, she
had also been seen using suppressors obviously improvised out of beer cans.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Usual pattern was that she would kill the
first ones as quietly as possible, using drugs and other harmful materials to
poison the first targets, the next ones she would kill using knives or blunt
instruments, and the final wave was where she would go completely overt and
shoot, bomb and incinerate them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She always avoided killing or injuring
prostitutes because the whole point of her activity was to protect them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Her method was clinical in it’s own way, it
made a gynormous mess, but it was done in a way that delayed discovery until
she was on her way out. Another thing that made her different from most other
serial killers was that she was not cold blooded. She was widely perceived as
being cold blooded because of how she had interacted with people at school, but
she had been spurred into action because of her empathy. She was a hot blooded
killer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He wanted her blood in his collection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>But now he had to find her again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Game on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria broke into the motel reception area.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She couldn’t hide from the cameras, so she
would simply change the tape, fast forward it, and hit play at the appropriate
point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The Managers will just think it was a minor
screw up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Meanwhile, Daria was going to break into
the computer and register another guest, combining two names at random, paying
in cash for the next month or so. She added the cash. ‘The customer must exist,
here’s the money. … Ah, my memory’s just really shit is all.’</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She could, of course, just hire the room
like anyone else during business hours, but there’s a chance someone would
recognise her, and then she’d be located, and her room watched, and then she’d
be screwed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She completed the operation and went to the
room to set up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“This is your head,” said Quinn, indicating
the skull and dragon skin model down range.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The bone stand in was a composition of
materials that was designed specifically to imitate bone. There was a brain
stand-in composed of actual cow brains from a local abattoir.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Quinn picked up a 9mm M1911 and slid the
slider back. Chamber was empty. She pulled it all the way back and saw the
first round pop up against the clip’s mandibles, she released it and switched
the selector to ‘arm’, announcing “FIRING, ONE SHOT!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She lined up the sights and fired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The gun was now pretty comfortable in her
hands. She remembered that raid. Holding something that could throw lumps of
lead at supersonic velocities was not the same as something that could throw
plastic balls filled with paint at barely enough speed to fracture them at
their maximum designed effective range.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“This is your head after a 9mm round takes
it apart.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Quinn removed the clip and locked the
slider back, there were no other rounds in the chamber, but assumptions kill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Want to take a look?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The eight year old kids hesitantly
approached.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>A sheet of paper had been set up behind the
fake skull, and all the brain matter had been splattered across it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The Hydrashok rounds were not as commonly
available as the full jacket parabellums normally used, but Quinn wanted to
make a point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There was a small entry wound in the eye,
not too surprising, but the sphenoid and temporal bones had completely
detached, and the hole in the parietal and occipital bones was huge, jagged,
and had a spider web pattern.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“ONLY in the movies does the protagonist
always win. … In real life land, even if you do your best, you get into a
gunfight, it’s highly probable you will be the one that gets this happening to
you, and not your opponent.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Any questions at this point?” asked Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Yes,” said one kid in the middle of the
crowd, “why did you get into it?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This question was a bit of an asshole, but
it always came up. The only answer Quinn had was “I didn’t trust the police to
get it right. … I should have, but I didn’t. Not only did I nearly get killed
by gangsters in a brothel, I also nearly got killed by gangsters in prison too.
Want to see what a shiv does to you?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“How did it go?” asked Stacy as Quinn
returned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Usual, mouthy kids puked, couple asked why
I saved your ass, I had to give the answer designed to suck the dick of
authority,” said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“You take them before they become
gangsters, your sister takes them after they become gangsters,” said Stacy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Not funny,” said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“I know,” said Stacy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Stacy sure had changed. She used to
apologise for just about everything she did and didn’t do weather it was good
or bad. Now she was confident and strong.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>They all had doctorates in chemistry now,
Sandi and Stacy focused on biochemistry, Tiffany, unbelievably, on physical
chemistry, Quinn had gone for the pure math and business qualifications, and
they now owned the beauty market.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Quinn wondered if Daria’s call sign would
ever change to reflect her success.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Dexter ate breakfast in front of the
computer. This was unusual for him because he preferred to avoid getting crumbs
and what knot on his keyboard, but he wanted to make as much progress as he
could and it was really difficult to do this kind of thing at work with Doakes
looking over his shoulder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Sergeant James Doakes, former special
forces, knows Dexter’s a killer although probably not THE killer Miami PD was
looking for, not sure how, but Doakes knows.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Dexter could usually sneak his research
into his targets, but he normally had a good idea what to look for and how to
get his answers with minimal abnormal behaviour.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Finding Daria meant figuring out how she
worked. Fact was he didn’t have an address or witness statements or anything on
file that could assist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The fact Daria goes into a city and plans
everything herself might work in his favour because he’d built up a good idea
of the layout of the city’s criminal activity from the crime scenes he’d
visited, so he should in theory have an advantage over Daria if he knew how to
exploit it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Debra emerged from her room, dressed, but
her hair still damp, and she picked up the plate of breakfast Dexter had
prepared for her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She wandered over to Dexter and looked at
what he was working on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Wow. … You really think you can catch the
bitch?” asked Debra.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Probably not,” said Dexter, “but it’s fun
to try.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Right,” said Debra as she carried her
breakfast to the coffee table and sat down to eat it here. “Well, good luck
with that, and we do have our own serial killer to catch.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>‘Yeah, me,’ thought Dexter. It was a bit
awkward having his sister hunting him, it might have been an idea for Harry to
have included Debra in this, although there was apparently a reason Dexter had
been chosen: Dexter was a sociopath.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If Harry hadn’t gotten Dexter into this,
Dexter would most likely have killed the innocent or otherwise gotten caught,
either way it would have been bad. Debra on the other hand, wasn’t a sociopath,
and getting her involved would have gotten Dexter caught.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Anyway, back to the other killer: Clearasil
Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria goes to a city, finds the pimps, then
decides how she’s going to kill them and initiates her attack.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He should, in theory, be able to observe
her entering or exiting a known area where prostitution occurs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The question is when will or when did Daria
start looking around?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Most things have patterns, cycles of
activity, when would Daria expect to see the most prostitute activity?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It generally depends on when their
customers would have the free time, for instance, morning breaks, find a
prostitute, get a blow job, lunch time, maybe spend a little bit longer,
actually get into bed, afternoon break, see morning break, evenings would
probably see the most activity, three or four hours to fuck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She’d also need a consistent source of
electricity in order to manufacture some of her explosives and it is normally
helpful when distilling or refining some materials.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Although the only two materials you’d need
that aren’t widely available are explosive and oxidising materials.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Looking at the explosives Daria had used in
the past, the detonators are thought to consist of 15mm copper pipe with a
plate soldered to one end and explosive filler added from the other. The
diameter of the pipe was such that she would definitely have enough for any
explosive material she chose to detonate, plenty of ingredients for tertiary
explosives existed on the shelves of many shops nationwide.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Fusing was little more than foil, wire, and
batteries, she tended to use impulse explosives added to the detonator whenever
she needed a delay element in the fuse, and a lot of pimps surprisingly were
getting killed by car bombs, so Daria must be disguising the bombs more
effectively too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She was also getting vacuum pumps from
somewhere because a number of pimps died from radiation burns, unless she was
stealing the X-ray tubes from hospitals or dentists, she had to be evacuating a
jar with an appropriate system set up within. What she’d then need to do is rig
a power system capable of belting out a lethal dose. Seven greys of radiation
would be needed, that’s seven joules per kilo of flesh, aim at the gut using
something rigged from a glass ketchup bottle with a brass olive as an anode,
you can get a decent concentration of keV level X-rays, the symptoms might
resemble food poisoning and a skin rash maybe, that would be about half a kilo
of intestines in the target zone, so 3.5 joules would be sufficient.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>400mAh at 9V = around 13kJ, so a PP3
battery would be all the power she needs … of course the bulb she would likely
find for her heated cathode would be suitable for 3V, and she’d need to boost
the 9V to about 6 or more kV …</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The resources she would need were
definitely not the way to approach this, his best bet was to guess her scouting
method.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria walked the street dressed in a floral
dress and woolly jacket, a pink 10 Gallon hat and star shaped shades.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Hopefully she looked enough of a dork that
everyone would ignore her. She identified a number of women and even a few men
that seemed to be parading around in revealing clothes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Now, that on it’s own wasn’t enough, they
could be waiting to meet someone specific, so she needed to see them being
approached by strangers for sex or their pimps for money. It was the pimps she
was after anyway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She passes a car with two men sitting in
it. both men looked bored.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Cops? Could be gang enforcers. Daria would
have to find a good position to observe from that wouldn’t make her look
conspicuous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She picked a payphone and pretended to
insert coins in it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She might have a problem convincing people
she was actually talking to someone if she stood there for more than 10
minutes, she was dressed as a dork, but a dork wouldn’t carry bags of change
around just in case they happen to want to spend hours on a pay phone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She would have to find a better location.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It didn’t look like it was going to be an
issue though, this man appeared and walked along the line of men and women,
talking to them and collecting money off of them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria couldn’t be seen to leave at the same
time as this guy, or those stalkers, police or gang, would know she was
watching him, she’d be compromised.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If she could at least see what car he
drove, she should be able to get the index and potentially find it’s owner’s
address. The guy approached the stalkers and a side window dropped. He dropped
some of the money into one of the occupant’s hands. Stalkers were cops. Gang
members would be paid in private, the dynamic was definitely wrong for this to
be internal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria held her position and watched the
pimp go back the way he came. There was a better way to find a pimp than to
follow him from his show street: Hire one of his whores and hypnotise her.
Usually that gave her all the intel she needed and it would do it far faster
than following pimps around. She could then confirm the intel in a short space
of time and plan her attack on the individual and his or her gang.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>One thing she sometimes did was irradiate
some of the pimps and gang members early on. The two good things about
irradiation was that the symptoms resembled food poisoning early on, the
pathology made it difficult for the coroner to determine exactly what happened,
the fact that so many pimps and gangsters died this way had led the cops to
realise that that was what she was doing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The other good thing was that any actual
food poisoning would set off a panic. The number of false sightings meant the
police couldn’t respond to all the calls and still handle the day to day
criminal activity. (pretending for a minute they even do that.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Another thing she could to if she
hypnotised a whore is manipulate her target into doing something that would
help her kill him more effectively. She could often get enough trivia that she
could use the gangs themselves as her weapons, and she could also use the
prostitute to place weapons or distract the pimp while she places the weapon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She headed off to try and identify another
show street, even if she didn’t see the pimps, she could plan her pickup and
interrogation of the prostitutes the pimps sponge off of.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She did notice the occasional lone
prostitute standing there, but she was less certain those would be actual
prostitutes because of both their proximity to what looked like middle class
residences. Housing associations generally did what they could to keep
prostitutes from working on their streets because a lot of them were parents
who didn’t want “unwholesome influences” around their children. More likely
they were bait for vice squad honey traps.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If she ever got picked up, she would have
to kill the arresting officers, no delay, she was an escaped death row felon,
and you can expect to escape the same prison system exactly once if at all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Of course a side effect of killing a cop
was that she would have to call off the operation this time and hit another
city.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She had considered including bent cops in
her kills, those shits pissed her off especially as they were supposed to be
protecting people from harm, and instead were doing the exact same thing the
pimps were. On the other hand, there was the perception of the public to
consider, if she was also going after cops, the public would be more
understanding of the diversion of police resources into hunting her. Pimps?
Sure you couldn’t have a vigilante running around, but pimps weren’t that
popular to anyone who wasn’t a gangster or gangster wannabe themselves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Shooting cops would be a massive
escalation, gangs don’t share intel or resources or co-ordinate or really do
anything that would make them a threat to her. LEOs, however, do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>That was one thing that concerned her
though. Gangs may not act for mutual self interest, but that was also an
indication that gangsters just didn’t care. Even the most level headed gangsta
had an ego the size of a universe, usual mentality was ‘it won’t be me that
dies.’</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>That could be said about just about
everyone in the violence business, cops, criminals, soldiers, security guards,
they usually had enough fear of death to stay alert when they perceived a
threat, but the sheer size of the united states was such that the probability
of any given city being the next place she cleans was not that high. Mainly she
hit small cities, only hitting the larger ones every now and then simply
because smaller cities were easier. She wasn’t going to have much of a
deterrent effect, this was increasingly apparent because any city she hits a
subsequent time, business is just as booming as it was before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The high turnover did have one favourable
effect, it made it easier for LEOs to infiltrate gangs, those who were about to
enter a gang would see entire gangs being wiped out and might decide to go for
something with actual survival prospects.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She crossed another road.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>That people carrier with that man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria glanced again as she crossed the
road.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The guy that drove her into Miami. A stretch to call it a coincidence, but not impossible either.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Okay, time for a Crazy Ivan, see if he’s
following her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Dexter couldn’t be sure but the fact she
had turned a full 270 degrees indicated a Crazy Ivan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If she saw him, she could have recognised
him from earlier.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He needed a change of vehicles or to follow
her on foot in some kind of disguise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He broke off and headed home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He was certain it was her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria had kept the mirror at about upper
arm height. It peeked around her arm and she saw the people carrier pause, the
man look at her, and then it drove off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He was following her. Definitely. He had
recognised her diagnostic manoeuvre and broken off his surveillance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If he was a serial killer or serial rapist,
why hadn’t he tried anything while they were out in the middle of the forest?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Because he hadn’t considered her to be of
interest then.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Why now?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Because he recognised her?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He knew where she was likely to go.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He might call the police.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>And the police will hang up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He might pursue her himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She needed information.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She remembered the sat-nav destination that
had been displayed when she was riding with him, that might be his home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She headed off in search of an internet
café so she could get the location on Google maps. She could then mark it on
her own map, and use that to find out who was following her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Dexter finished breakfast and set off to
work. Last night had been useful only because he had confirmed the identity of
the woman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria Morgendorffer, Call sign ‘Clearasil
Daria’, was indeed in town.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Now Dexter had the problem that she knew a
man looking like him was following her around.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>That was going to make Daria hard to
follow. Harder to follow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He rarely had to follow anyone around.
Usually police reports had so much information about the day to day habits and
the locations frequented by his target that he almost NEVER had to follow
anyone around.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If he was a full cop instead of a CSI, he’d
have the training specifically for following people around without being seen
by them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If he was seen by her any more times during
her operation, she could decide to leave or turn around and slot him. One of
the main things he always had to do was prepare the battle space for maximum
advantage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This was not an option in this case, right
now he had absolutely no information that could help him capture her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He got in his car and drove off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He could draw up a shadow plan and grab her
on her way out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The problem with that was there would need
to be only one exit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If there were two or more, his odds of
success would depreciate rapidly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>No. He needed to find her base of operations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Okay, electricity, you need easy access
that no one’s going to see. Just about anything outside could be discovered and
disrupted at any time. She needed to assure that her equipment wouldn’t be
discovered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>How do you manufacture nitrated explosives
without access to industrial grade chemicals? You ionise the air to make
nitrogen dioxide. You have to do that somewhere cold too otherwise all your
nitrogen dioxide will evaporate, and that stuff smells too, so emphasis on the
cold.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>You also want to use it immediately if you
can, because again, PHEEEEE-EWWWWWW!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>You also want to be certain that when you
apply the nitrogen dioxide to the fuel that all the nitrogen dioxide is used,
and that the final product isn’t swimming in the stuff once it’s formed. Again,
you have to hide it, and it has to be able to run by itself unsupervised while
she goes out looking for targets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She had asked to be dropped off on a motel
strip. He could start there, but she could be in a motel on the other side of
town. How many days would it take for her to gather her information?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>No way to tell.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>All he could do was try.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He parked up and entered the police
station.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>His driving style was so clinical the guy
had to be either a qualified driving instructor, a Vulcan, an android, or
unhinged. What concerned Daria was that the guy worked at a police station, but
was he a cop?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She recognised another car as well, it was
one that had left a few minutes before he had, being driven by a redhead.
Girlfriend or wife? She also worked at a police station.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Yet she hadn’t seen her at any point. She
knew because she was extremely alert when it came to identifying stalkers. She
wasn’t in on the hunt, so this was some kind of side project, or maybe he was
trying to do it all alone and take all the credit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>That would be damn idiotic, but some cops
did astound her with their level of stupidity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Maybe it was the damn janitor with
delusions of grandeur.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Now, what of the black haired woman in the
jeep that was also following the man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The woman had noticed Daria, this couldn’t
really be helped, the only way for Daria to follow the man was to follow the
man, she had only one person working surveillance: Daria Morgendorffer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria continued on past the police station,
and watched to see what the woman in the jeep would do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The woman followed Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She might know something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria headed off down an alley, speeding
off past a pair of dumpsters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She parked the bike behind the furthest and
ran back to the first, moving a trash can up to it for cover.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The woman drove past.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria waited until she was past the second
dumpster before she ran up to it and, like a crab, ran up to her jeep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The woman was looking at the bike and
ahead, but failed to notice Daria until Daria was sat behind her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Good morning,” said Daria, as she lifted
her gun into view before lowering it so it was out of sight while still
pointing at the driver. The woman frowned and barely sighed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Why don’t we go somewhere more secluded
and talk about why you were following the man I was following?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Okay,” said the woman, as she put the jeep
into reverse and backed out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>British accent. Tourist or immigrant?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“While you’re driving there, hand me your
wallet would you?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The woman handed Daria her wallet and Daria
opened it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Lila West. So Lila, you don’t sound local,
and you don’t look like you’ve spent very long in the sun at any given time,
what are you to my target?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“What is he to you?” asked the woman.
Clearly the woman wan not new to the whole people pointing guns at her thing.
Law enforcement, military, security or criminal?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Whatever her background, she was calm.
Daria closed her wallet and returned it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Annoying. I want to know how annoying he’s
likely to get. Describe him.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The woman turned the vehicle onto the road
and selected gear 1, heading back to the main road, she said “Well, he’s got
this girlfriend called Rita Bennet, saddled with two kids, Astor and Cody,
Dexter could do much better than her, and you by the way so hands off.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“What else?” asked Daria. Was the woman
pretending to have a romantic fixation or was that straight up? If it was
straight up, Daria might appear to be a rival.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“He does some beautiful paintings at work,
he gave me a couple of them.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Paintings? A sketch artist? No, that would
mean he gave her a couple of sketches. “Paintings of what?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Of blood spray. He was attempting to
replicate blood splatter patterns from a crime scene.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>A scene examiner. “What else? And have you
warned the other woman off of him?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Other wo- … You mean his sister?” asked
the woman, as she laughed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>His sister? “Does his parents also live
there?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Lila laughed even louder. “No, his mum
lives across town and his dad is dead. And the only reason his sister lives
with him is because she’s still freaked that her fiancé happened to be the Ice
Truck Killer, I mean, imagine, she’s a cop, and she’s dating a fucking serial
killer.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria smiled and chuckled “that is actually
quite funny, I have to admit.” She then said “I notice you withheld their
names.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Dexter Morgan, Sister’s Debra Morgan.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Okay. You’ve been really helpful. Shopping
mall, park up in there.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Lila turned off the main road at the
appropriate junction and entered the car park.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She pushed the button and took the ticket
saying “You will refund the parking fee, won’t you?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“What? … … It’s going to be five bucks at
most. Just park up.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The woman parked in the first available
space and Daria produced a small syringe, 3cc capacity. “Head back, open your
mouth.” The needle wasn’t suitable for hypodermic injections, it was strictly
for spiking drinks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“What is that?” asked Lila.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“It’s my alternative to killing you. My
ONLY alternative.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Lila sighed and tipped her head back and
opened her mouth as instructed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria slowly dripped the liquid into the
woman’s nose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The woman would have little choice but to
swallow it, the viscosity was just too low for her to be able to manipulate it,
she was definitely swallowing it all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria watched the time in the jeep’s clock
and once five minutes had elapsed, she pinched the skin on the woman’s neck
hard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>No reaction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Hopefully she was a rubbish actor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria reclined the seat and folded the
woman’s arms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The liquid was a really strong solution of
rohypnol, some of the pimps she had been able to steal things from had drugs
such as GHB and Rohypnol, and rohypnol was useful here because it was an
amnesiac.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Dexter Morgan. And Debra Morgan was about
to marry a serial killer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There should be something on that somewhere
on the web.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As for verifying that Dexter is a blood
splatter analyst, that would be difficult without breaking into either the
police station or Dexter’s apartment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It might also be worth checking out Lila’s
place, Daria now had Lila’s address, so she can check that out at her leisure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>In fact, now would be a good time to do
this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“So this guy steals a motorbike, and rather
than either trash it or sell it to a chop-shop, he leaves it in a back alley?”
said Debra.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“I know. It’s like the guy wussed out
halfway through delivering the bike, he was like, ‘I’m gonna steal this bike’,
he steals it, then he’s like ‘This is wrong, I can’t continue down this line’
but rather than returns it, abandons it,” said Vince, “Probably never made it
past 1<sup>st</sup> base either.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As if Vince ever managed to get a girl to
accept a drink from him. Vince Masuka: Fellow CSI, hornier than a rabbit with
near fatal Viagra poisoning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Dexter returned to his lab with his coffee
and resumed his official work. He had finished noting the location of every
motel in Miami earlier that morning. Apartments would be a problem because
there are just too damn many of them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Aside from that, motels and hotels have one
thing that apartments don’t: A high turnover of occupants. If Daria used an
apartment, she was more likely to be noticed because the neighbours would be
familiar with the appearance of most the other residents. The landlord is more
likely to notice as well, they usually find out what they can about the person
renting their property because they don’t want to be saddled with someone who
would destroy the flat or drive everyone else out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Dexter would have to figure out if he could
cover more than one motel at a time, because he didn’t know how much time she’d
take to complete her survey.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It would help if he had the authority to
just walk into a motel and ask for the CCTV footage of the last 48 or so hours.
He produced his ID, there would be so many questions …</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He could just break into the managers
office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>That, on balance, was less risky, he’d be
able to avoid being identifiable if anyone did see him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Lila’s apartment reminded her of Jane’s
bedroom, all the works of art, the mish-mash of items …</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>A drawer full of sobriety chips.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Maybe stalking this Dexter guy was her
substitute addiction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>No apparent needle marks, drug addicts tend
to have piss poor hand-eye co-ordination and often forget to sterilise the
needle and the injection site, so if she was doing drugs, she was either
smoking, snorting or … Girl’s teeth were perfect. She was skinny, that could
indicate drug use due to the physiological effect of a screwed up metabolism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Rita and her kids were real, and after
looking on line and following up with a visit to the library, it seemed that
Debra Morgan really was a cop and really did almost marry the Ice Truck Killer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The set up and motivation would be too
elaborate and too pointless, so Daria decided to trust what the evidence
indicated for now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She’d have to talk to people to find out
what the actual state of relations were between Dexter and anyone else, so she
had no way of projecting the probability that Lila would tell Dexter of her
encounter with Daria. There was a chance Lila might end up with no choice but
to reveal what she could remember to the police. The fact she was pretty calm
throughout her encounter with Daria mean that the memory of Daria should be too
fresh to be unaffected by the rohypnol. If the woman had been more agitated,
the memory might have stuck a little more hard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Okay, next stop: Dexter’s apartment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria would have to find out if Dexter held
the qualifications to be a blood splatter analyst.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She headed out from Lila’s apartment,
securing it just the way she had found it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It took a while to go anywhere on foot, but
she couldn’t spend too long in any stolen vehicle or she would attract
attention.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>After her long trek, she arrived at
Dexter’s apartment, neither his nor Debra’s vehicle was around, so for the
moment she assumed his apartment was vacant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She couldn’t see anyone paying particular
attention to the block, so she proceeded with her break in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She picked the lock and entered the
apartment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There’s that neatness again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She knew his computer might log her
activity on it, but she couldn’t find what she needed without using it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>As the computer booted up, she took the
time to look through the drawers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>One folder held a series of letters from
colleges telling him he had passed the veterinary medicine courses,
pharmacology courses, there were also certificates in … martial arts?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Hmm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She entered ‘CV’ into the file search.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She found three versions, dated in
sequence, she figured the earlier two were superseded by the third.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She checked out the third one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He was definitely qualified for scene
examination.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>And just about everything else on the
planet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She decided to check out his internet
history.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Lots and lots of traffic to AFIS, CODIS,
MDPD …</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He could be a vigilante.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There was no sign of the guy having any
kind of hobby.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She opened another draw and found some
sobriety chips.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Is that where Lila latched onto him?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He could be substituting homework for a
drug addiction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>But with his expertise in pharmacology,
just why, why, WHY would he get on drugs to begin with?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He’d attended five or six sessions, these
were weekly sessions, Lila had attended more than twenty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Well, there wasn’t much more for Daria to
go on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Debra.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>What would Debra think of Dexter’s
obsession with police work?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Maybe he had concealed items he’d use for
his hobby somewhere?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She turned off the computer and closed
everything, placing the chair where she had found it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Where to hide stuff?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Well, the air conditioning unit was right
next to her, might as well start there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She pulled it out and immediately found a
wooden box.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She removed the wooden box and opened it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Slides.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She removed one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The material was red.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Blood?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>No labels.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Why no labels?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>To minimise the probability of the slides
being connected to criminal activity?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Hmm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria closed the box and returned it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She placed the air conditioning unit back
where she had found it and moved on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She found a bag in the bottom of his
wardrobe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Duct tape.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Polyethylene dust sheets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Hypodermic needles and bottles of
Etorphine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She found a tool bundle and unrolled it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Knives, meat cleavers, bone saws, scalpels
…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Dexter was now looking more and more like a
serial killer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The alcoholics anonymous or narcotics
anonymous meetings may relate to another project.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>His dad was dead. Was his death the result
of a crime? Dexter’s key stressor?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria packed everything back up and returned
it to it’s hiding place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There had been more than forty slides in
the box.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If those slides were trophies, that’s more
than forty kills.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He was highly adept at killing people and
getting away with it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>And he was interested in her. He wanted her
blood, on a slide, in his collection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This changes things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Quinn turned up at the school. The
demonstration had been set up in the gymnasium in advance of her arrival.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Three kids and the school principal were
stood there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Quinn quickly checked her watch and said
“how long should we wait for the others?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“There are no others,” said the principal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Eh? How come?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Apparently the fact you’re gay pissed them
off, they feel you’re an inappropriate influence.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Quinn had never hidden the fact she was
gay, she never went into details, and neither did Sandi, and the paparazzi, of
course, made up all sorts of things about Quinn and Sandi’s sex life, but Quinn
hadn’t felt a need to hide it since high school.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Right,” said Quinn. She was surprised at
how shocked she sounded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Are you really a lesbo?” asked one of the
kids.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Have you brought any strap-on dicks with
you?” asked another.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Yeah, I can see where having an openly
lesbian guest teacher could be a problem: They’re not worried about their kids
being traumatised, they’re worried about weeks of non-stop lesbian sex jokes at
the dinner table,” said Quinn. “Okay, you probably have more questions about
lesbian sex than you have about gang wars, but that’s not what I’m here for, so
remember the gang war questions and focus on those only.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria opened the freezer portion of the
refrigeration unit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The power line entering the freezer was the
only clue anyone would have that anything unusual was going on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The power lead connected to a neon
transformer she had stolen from a previous city, and that boosted the voltage
high enough that it would jump between the two wires at the top of the bottle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The bottle was upside down over a jar, the
nitrogen dioxide dripped into that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She had about 300mL.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She unplugged the system and packed the
transformer up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She then removed the jar and put the
perforated lid on it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She then retrieved the improvised test tube
rack of capped lengths of copper pipe. The lengths of pipe had crushed
firelighters in them. She uses the radiator behind the fridge to heat the
nitrogen dioxide, that then travels along some plastic pipes to the copper
pipes, that slowly nitrates the hexamine to make RDX.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The nice thing about RDX is that it can be
used on it’s own as a detonator filler.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Another explosive material, also an
oxidiser, was in a bedside cabinet in an oven tray. She used salt and made
sodium perchlorate from it. She checked on that and saw the water level had
dropped about a third, and that crystals were starting to form.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She often had to make new electrodes for
this process. She could use copper wire for the manufacturing of nitrogen
dioxide because there was no way for the copper to migrate from one electrode
to another or to dissolve, and it’s oxide was a solid at room temperature, but
in a liquid the electrodes would dissolve. Carbon required such an ionization
energy that she wasn’t worried about it dissolving in the manufacturing of the
perchlorates, whereas carbon dioxide was a gas and using carbon to manufacture
nitrogen dioxide would erode the electrodes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She sat on her bed and lay back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She needed some sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Her sleep cycle was roughly nocturnal, but
she didn’t really sleep that deeply. She grabbed whatever sleep she could when
she could.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Having someone as skilled as Dexter chasing
her was agitating the crap out of her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Dexter had a hypodermic syringe, but no
darts or anything for launching darts. She couldn’t be certain, but that
indicated his favourite method of capturing people was to get right up on them
and inject them direct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He’d want surprise, so he’d set up an
ambush.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He’d therefore need to know where she’s
going to be so he can get there before she does.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This was going to be a serious pain in the
ass. Maybe she should kill him first.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>What were his targeting criteria anyhow?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She should have returned to his computer
and looked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>DAMN IT!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She had been so freaked out. …</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She was STILL freaked out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Maybe she should abandon Miami this time
around.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Jujitsu wasn’t that impressive next to MCMAP,
and Daria had kicked Kerry Thompson’s instructor qualified in MCMAP ass, so
Daria should be able to take him in a fight, but the element of surprise
undercuts everything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>What was that about warriors and egomania?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She didn’t want to let someone else dictate
her actions, but if she died, she would no longer be able to kill pimps.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She might be able to do a partial job now,
but if she only part does a city, than pimps would wonder just what it is about
  Miami that scared her off?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>No. If she cancelled Miami, it would be a
total disaster.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She had always been in danger from every
law enforcement agency in the United States, but she had always remained hidden
from them. This one serial killer, on the other hand, knows she’s here and
knows she’s planning to kill every pimp in the city.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He may not know her requirements for
electricity and somewhere she can leave explosives plants running, and he
hopefully doesn’t know she knows he’s after him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She needed a new plan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Rita insisted on seeing Dexter on nights he
attended Narcotics Anonymous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This was to verify that he had attended,
and that he was still on course.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Why the hell had he told Rita he was
addicted to drugs? His apparent expertise in pharmacology could EASILLY be
explained away by conversations with other CSIs, he’d basically gone and
complicated the ever living fuck out of things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Of course if he hadn’t lost his temper and
bounced a frying pan off Paul’s head in Rita’s kitchen. … Paul: Colossal prick,
Rita’s ex-husband. He shows up after doing time for beating the shit out of
Rita, he starts manipulating the kids to get them to compel Rita into letting
him back into their lives. He pulls this stunt where Rita would be forced to
allow him partial custody of their children, then he goes and threatens Rita
right next to him …</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>So, Dexter knocks him out, drags him to a
motel, sets him up with a skin full of Heroin with a needle and other gear so
he’d be in violation of parole. Automatically back in prison pending a future
parole hearing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Problem was he managed to convince Rita he
was set up by Dexter, and then Paul then does a death by inmate (walk up to the
biggest, most psychotic fuck ugly prisoner in there and starts a fight), and
now Rita wonders how Dexter knows how to set people up like that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Of course, if she had asked “Are you doing
drugs” instead of “Are you an addict,” his sarcasm might not have gotten the
better of him, and he wouldn’t have to be attending these mind numbingly boring
assed utterly irrelevant …</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He SO needed to kill someone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>And there was Lila’s apparent interest in
his deep dark secrets. He made up this cover story for the group, first night,
Lila takes him out for a cup of coffee, and the first thing she asks is “So
tell me: Exactly how full of shit are you?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Did Lila know he’s a serial killer?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He collected his sobriety chip, shook hands
with other people, where was Lila?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Hmm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He drove off to Rita’s house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He would need to sneak out once Rita fell
asleep and break into those motels, he had to find which one Daria was staying
at before she could attack.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Then he’d have to return before Rita wakes
up and finds him missing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She finds him missing, she’ll assume he’s
out scoring drugs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Well, actually, being excluded from Rita’s
house wouldn’t be that much of a problem in the short term.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He could play this just fine, his emotional
connection was fake … well … fake-ish … well … he wanted to assure Rita and her
kid’s survival prospects as far as possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Maybe he wasn’t a true sociopath after all?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Well, this was all fascinating, but this
introspection was a distraction, he had work to do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Sandi finally asked “Are you feeling okay
Quinn?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Quinn looked up from her plate of
Tagliatelle Carbonara she had been playing with.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Yeah. … Fine.” Quinn had been silent all
night, looking somewhat sullen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Sandi hoped it wasn’t the food, she had
thought she was quite a good cook. But then so did Quinn’s dad. Sandi had also
hoped that being naked except for a waist length corset and locking en-Pointe
heels would arouse the other hunger Quinn normally felt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Quinn finally said “Some of the parents at
that school I spoke at, actually most of the parents at that school I spoke at,
cancelled their permission because they found out I was gay. How is it … No, I know
a lot of people are still homophobic, I’m aware our mail department still finds
bombs, poisons and other dangerous or menacing letters addressed to us … I just
can’t get my head around the fact … I don’t know, I just … How is it still such
a problem?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“I don’t know what to tell you. … I’m sorry
you had to go through that,” said Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Just our products sell just as well in the
‘Bible Belt’ as anywhere else, hell, Saudi Arabia and Iran can’t quell public demand and those two are about as homophobic and misogynistic as
they get,” said Quinn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Well, if you pretend I’m them, maybe you
can feel better,” said Sandi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Appreciated, but that’s the wrong way to
deal with it. I only want to hurt you for sexual pleasure, I do it to release
frustration, I could end up going way too far and … … It just doesn’t motivate
me, it’s a distraction to think about it. It displaces any fantasy I have. …
I’m sorry.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Sandi nodded. … She wished there was
something she could do to cheer Quinn up. Times like this, all Sandi could do
was wait and hope Quinn would get sufficiently over it enough to still enjoy
life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The clatter of the cans falling from the
top of the door woke Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She had taped one can to the frame over the
top and placed another can on top of it. As soon as someone opens the door, a
load of noise is made, drawing Daria’s attention to the fact someone is
entering the motel room while she’s asleep or taking a shit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Had Dexter found her? This was going to be
complicated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria pulled her gun and Groucho-walked up
to the bedroom door. She emerged, aiming her gun at whoever had opened the
door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The cleaning lady screamed and fell down
beside her cart, saying something in Spanish.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria holstered her weapon and said “I left
a ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign on the handle.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“My boss said this room was empty,” said
the cleaning lady.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Okay, you know that book I signed when I
leased out this room and took the room key from the office?” asked Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“I’ll check,” she said as she left.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria returned to the bedroom and sat down
on the bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She didn’t want to bug out, but as a
history nerd, Daria knew full well that history was littered with the
embarrassment of leaders who had pushed things just a little too far. Or a lot.
Operation Barbarosa sprang to mind. Operation Market Garden. Saddam invading Kuwait. She could get seriously dead from this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>On the other hand, if she didn’t push
herself every now and then, she gets rusty. If she could do this even with
Dexter hunting her, that would be a really sweet victory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There was only one place he could really
ambush her, and that was entering or exiting her motel room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>That’s not particularly insurmountable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She should be able to do this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Dexter broke into the first Motel on his
list.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It was silent. No TV, radio, no nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He entered the cabinet with the stack of
VCRs and shelf of VHS tapes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He found the one looking at the rooms and
turned on the screen. He had a rough idea when Daria is likely to leave and
return to her apartment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He might have asked Debra for her insight
into the work habits of prostitutes, before moving to homicide, Debra was
working Vice as a decoy prostitute.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He tried to think of a female detective
that hadn’t had to work vice as a decoy whore. … … … … … … … … … Nope.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He rewound the tape and looked for his
target.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Dexter returned to Rita’s place, hoping to
sneak in without alerting her to the fact he was returning from a midnight
excursion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The drug addiction story meant that Rita
won’t suspect Dexter of being a serial killer, so that was a plus. For now
Doakes, having followed Dexter to a meeting one night, was also convinced
Dexter was a drug addict, that was also a plus. Debra might hear of it, that
might cause her to search Dexter’s apartment for hidden Heroin stashes, causing
her to find the slides matching the bodies sitting in their morgue tent and the
tools with striations matching those found on the bones of the bodies sitting
in their morgue tent, that was a minus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He just got to Rita’s bed, which was empty,
when he heard the back door, which he’d snuck in through, open and close.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Rita entered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She did not look at all happy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“How much money did you steal?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Not ‘Where have you been?’ but ‘How much
money did you steal?’</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Oooh fuck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Dexter eventually said “None. I couldn’t go
through with it.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“So you’re in recovery, yet you’re looking
to fund your habit?” asked Rita.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Actually this was going to be a substitute
addiction. Was going to steal money, but I decided against it because it would
draw too much attention.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Since when does Rita know how to stalk
people? Okay, back to the topic on hand: Rita seeing Dexter committing some
felony offences.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“I see,” she said. “Dexter, this is not a
healthy way to go. And … … It’s creepy. … … Go home. We’ll talk later.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“But … I … ” Dexter stammered, feigning
reluctance. He then sighed, nodded and left. This should be acceptable as long
as Rita don’t report him, but at the moment there’s no evidence Dexter actually
did anything. He was tops at counter-forensics.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Rita followed him on foot, if he drives the
next night, he should be able to keep Rita off him while he hunts Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria started her final approach to her
motel room again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She walked around the back of the motel and
hid around a bush for ten minutes, holding her gun ready to react.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If Dexter was going to ambush her at this
point, he would walk right past her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The ten minutes elapsed with nothing
happening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria continued onto her motel room,
re-holstering her gun, but keeping one hand on it as she used her key to open
the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She entered and closed the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She waited there for ten minutes, watching
everywhere in silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She thought she saw some movement at one
door and she Groucho-walked up to it, her flashlight in her other hand braced
against her gun hand. She passed the door and checked around her again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She thought she saw him in her peripheral
vision and just about stopped herself from putting a round in the back wall of
the motel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She turned to face outwards, glancing both
ways.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If he was in the motel room, she needed a
reliable way to diagnose it. There were three rooms, the bedroom, the bathroom,
and the lounge/kitchen area.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She entered the bathroom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There was no place big enough to conceal
him within it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She moved back into the lounge/Kitchen
area.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The cupboard under the one and a half bowl
sink was big enough to conceal him, nowhere else was sufficient in the area she
was now clearing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She kept glancing back at the two other
rooms to try to catch him if he was hiding in the bedroom and was trying to
move from the bedroom to the bathroom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She completely cleared the Lounge/Kitchen
room and finally checked the bedroom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Wardrobes first, being injected in the
ankles would give her more time to respond than being injected through the
carotid artery, she could unload the clip through the bed and might even have
time to recharge the gun and burn off a second clip.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Beds were next.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Okay, he wasn’t there. At all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Man this was annoying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She set up her intruder alarm and decided
to make use of the adrenaline and cortisol saturating her blood plasma by
shadow-sparring, turning the TV on and selecting a news channel so she could
absorb anything that might be of interest to her. Quinn showing up in Miami for instance. If that were to happen, she would Definitely have to call it off. One
serial killer was enough of an ass pain to her, every federal agency saturating
  Miami was certain doom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>About an hour later, she felt sleepy enough
to try to grab some sleep and had seen nothing on the news to interest her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Dexter was on his way to another motel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Doakes hadn’t appeared in any of his rear
view or wing mirrors since he had shown up at the NA meeting and told him to
stay on the wagon and “By the way: You owe me a set of Michelins you
motherfucker!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He was looking out for his girlfriend Rita
this time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Contrary to popular belief, shaking a tail
is not about driving at warp 10 through narrow streets and back alleys. That’ll
just get you on the news and just about every ‘Police, Camera, Action!’
variation in existence. The way to shake a tail is to drive like an idiot.
Signal the wrong way, change lanes erratically, cut people off. You basically
keep driving like an idiot until the other guy makes a mistake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>But luckily no one was following him
tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Game on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria woke up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It had been a week and a half since she had
arrived in Miami, and she had completed the groundwork for the overt stuff and
the subtle phase kills.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Now it was time to go overt. All she had to
do was what she normally did, then she’d be out of Miami and away from Dexter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She tooled up and hydrated, and packed up
anything that could indicate her presence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Now it was time to go to the forward attack
position.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Dexter was on foot, lock pick kit in hand
when he heard an explosion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He didn’t see any fireballs, but he knew it
had to be fairly close, maybe a block away, they were in a residential area.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He then heard another explosion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Then he heard some gunshots.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Had it started?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He ran back to the people carrier and drove
towards where he had heard the noise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He found two cats lodged in the backs of
cars parked on the driveways of ambient houses, the side windows were shattered
and there was blood splattered on the inside of the windscreens. The fender was
also blown out. The charges were small and planted under the cabin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Wow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He drove past five or six dead bodies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He then noticed some bodies on the porch of
a house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He could just about hear the gunshots
through his car windows.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He then saw Daria emerge and glance in his
direction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She took a second look, and obviously
recognised him, but she shrugged and kept on running.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She was committed to the mission, and
didn’t consider him any greater threat than her targets. She might also have
decided she would prefer to have him live. Her mistake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Dexter was following her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If he was still on her ass when she was
leaving, she would shoot out his tyres so he’d have to follow on foot. If she
couldn’t lose him on foot, she might need to slot the guy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>For now she was perfectly happy to let him
watch provided he didn’t interfere.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She continued onto her next target. A car
full of men appeared in front of her, they were leaning out pointing guns at
her. She selected full auto on the micro-Uzi she was currently carrying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She shot at the radiator first. That was
where the bullet fuse for the bomb she had planted was located. The driver
exploded, and the gangsters leaning out the side looked shocked at the apparent
effect Daria’s bullets had possessed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria swept from left to right across the
car, taking full advantage of their inattention to her. She then continued on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Dexter pulled up in the next parking lot
and parked to continue on by foot. He was fit enough that he should be able to
follow on foot without Daria getting away from him, and he wasn’t shooting up
every brothel he came across, so he’d have more rest breaks than she did. The
difference now was that he was able to use ambient cover or concealment more
effectively.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>This was his last chance to grab her, as
soon as she was done shooting up the city, she would be gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He caught up with the sound of gunfire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He saw her pull a tube from her backpack
and flip a switch that seemed to lift a pair of sights.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>No way …</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She pushed a button on it and an apparent
bolt of lightning shot from the button to the back of the device. A fireball
then shot out the back, unaffected by gravity for a full half second until the
heat finally managed to draw it up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The car full of gangsters she was aiming
for blew up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The gasoline tank hadn’t been hit, but the
cabin no longer had any windows, the roof was now miss-shaped, and the driver
was missing his torso.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Some of the crime scenes had shown up
fragments of that looked suspiciously like a rocket nozzle, but that was thought
to be off a firework.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>No witnesses had described a rocket
launcher. It didn’t resemble any specific type he’d seen, in fact the colour
looked wrong, she’d made it herself. She shot the nearest two bodies she ran
past, just to make sure. White butterfly effect had probably killed them, but
she obviously wasn’t taking chances.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He continued to chase her, holding his
breath as he ran through the smoke. It smelt like sea spray. Sodium
Perchlorate: Lose the oxygen and you get salt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Makes a handy tertiary explosive too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The warheads probably weren’t designed to
blast through armour, but then they didn’t need to be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria finished off her last target and ran
to her disposal site located in a back alley that garbage men feared to tread.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The rocket launcher tubes she had retained
in order to reduce the probability of the police working out she was packing
rockets. That was pretty much the only thing she had to worry about, but you
never know what you’d need to burn, so she always had one ready.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The disposal site consisted of a trash can
with a bag of gasoline in it, she’d rigged a lid that sunk into the can with a
trash bag on top of it to stop anyone else adding anything to it. She dropped
what she wanted to burn in it and followed it up with a flare, five seconds,
fire starts, then she’s out of there. She pulled yet more garbage bags off of
her escape vehicle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She got on her escape vehicle, a small
motorcycle she had stolen in anticipation of her escape. She started it and was
about to shift it out of neutral when she felt a sting in the side of her neck
and the feeling of pressure in her carotid artery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Damn iiiiiii-” she just about got out
before the etorphine took effect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Dexter hit the kill switch on the motorbike
and pulled Daria off it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He carried her over his shoulders until he
found what seemed like a good place to hide her until he could retrieve his car
and transport her to a suitable kill room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If anyone asked why he was leaving the
crime scene, he’d say he needed more supplies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Handily enough, that was true. The crime
scene was fucking massive. Four city blocks. He’d have to pack the car floor to
ceiling with data sticks, swabs, sketchpads, and enough coffee to keep him up
all night and the next few days. The one good thing about the mess Daria had
made was this excuse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Daria awoke to the feeling of dampness in
bands across her torso, arms, legs, forehead, and opened her eyes to the sight
of plastic on the ceiling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>After trying to move she found she
couldn’t. Not a millimetre.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Aww for fuck’s sake.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“That was quite a fight you gave me,” said
Dexter as he got up and walked over to Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Apparently not enough. You know I’d have
been okay with leaving you alive. Strictly speaking I should have killed you to
mitigate the risk of this happening to me. I know where you live, I know where
you keep your blood slides and your knives, I know you use etorphine to knock
people out … It seemed important to let you live. … It still does.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“So you’re not pissed off about the fact
you’re about to die?” asked Dexter. Daria noted the plastic apron, the plastic suit,
the rubber gloves, the face visor, everything designed to keep her blood from
linking him to her murder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Well … Hmmm. … YEAH I’M PISSED! … … How
much time have you allotted?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Ten minutes,” said Dexter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Guess I’d better hurry then. I still
consider you to be a useful asset, whatever you think of me. I’ll tell you
everything I know about what I do, it’s possible none of it will be of use, but
you never know, so listen up,” said Daria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Dexter listened to her talk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Dexter arrived home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He hadn’t seen Debra’s car outside, but he
decided to check her room to make sure she was out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>If she wasn’t, he’d just make out that he
was checking to see if the room needed cleaning, stating the absence of her car
made him think she was out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>But the room was empty, so Debra was indeed
out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Dexter removed the air conditioning unit
and removed the wooden box.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He opened the box and removed the slide
with Daria’s blood from his pocket.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He stared at his newest trophy as he
remembered how Daria had seemed to just stare blankly at the ceiling as his
knife had plunged into her chest. He had felt her convulse as she bled out
through the knife, her heart further tearing itself on the blade as it had
reacted to the impalement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>It was just like any other kill, one minute
she was a conscious, living being. Then he pushed his knife into her chest,
skewering her heart, and her personality, her experience, everything ingrained
in her brain, her thought processes froze as there was no longer any oxygen to
react with the glucose, and she had felt the process, she knew everything that
made her her was being lost. Then the irreversible tissue necrosis that made it
permanent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The arms and legs that had earlier that
night been trying to defeat him were now dead as he wistfully sliced through
the skin, muscle, tendons and cartilage linking her limbs together. Much easier
and neater than going through bone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>That’s what he did. Take live people and
turn everything that they were into five bags of alligator food.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Something felt a little off though.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>What was it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Probably the fact that in some ways Daria
was just like him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Not completely, mind. He kept it low key
and only went after murderers. She went after pimps and made a public statement
about it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>But yeah. That must be what felt off about
it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>His compulsion had been sated once again.
He put the slide in the box and closed it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He placed the box back in it’s hiding place
and returned the air conditioner to it’s position.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He picked up his bag of knives and went to
his room to put it away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>-=-=-=-=-</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“Sign here,” said the UPS currier.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Ian Jarrod signed the document and the
currier turned and left.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The guy had been nervous when he had
knocked on the door and hand asked if he was Ian Jarrod.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Not a surprise, this being a Crip
neighbourhood and all, no cop car ventured within three blocks of this house.
It was not at all surprising or even offensive, in fact it was extremely
gratifying that the currier couldn’t leave fast enough.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He chuckled, and then he turned his
attention to the box addressed to him from ‘You Know Who’.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He didn’t know who. Who did he know that
was in the habit of shipping cube metre capacity boxes to him?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He pulled his switch knife and cut away the
tape.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There was an inner box of PS foam.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The foam was 100mm thick.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Inside the foam was a folded up human.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“The fuck?” he asked as he tipped the box
over towards the human content’s back, and when the head fell back, he noticed
that it was a woman in her late twenties, not bad looking though, kind of
strong, maybe he could make her into a dominatrix, although that would require
her to be more switched on than what a heroin user would be, so he would have
to addict her to crack.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The woman was in expensive looking
lingerie, she had a nasal gastric tube going up her nose, a plastic bottle
seemed to be part full of stomach acid, there was a tube in her mouth, from
some of the movies he had seen, he knew it led into her trachea, there was a
thinner tube going up through that connected to an oxygen cylinder. Whoever had
packed her had taken every precaution to prevent her from asphyxiating as she
was delivered to him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He remembered that the box had no air holes
and the position might not have allowed her to breathe while she was sedated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>There was a box underneath her labelled
‘IMPORTANT: CHECK CONTENTS BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE!’</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He cut open the box and found a note, an
antiseptic wipe, and a syringe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>“In this syringe is the correct dose of
cocaine to awaken your gift. Wake her up before removing the tubes. Feel free
to test her for disease but I assure you she is clean of all disease. Have fun
with her.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>No signature or anything saying who had
sent her. That bothered him a little, but who was he to turn down free pussy?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She might know something, he could always
beat the information out of her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He opened the wipe and sterilised a spot
over her carotid artery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>He then removed the cap and checked there
was no air in the needle before he pushed it into her neck and pushed the
plunger forward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The woman woke up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She wore a relieved expression as she saw
confirmation that she had successfully hypnotised Dexter into sending her to
any pimp he could find in another city.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>She also decided to never do Miami again. You survive getting caught by the Bay Harbour Butcher exactly once if at all.</span></p>
