<H1>Morning</H1>

<H3>Author: Voice Of My</H3>

<P><B>Category</B>: General</P>

<P><B>Synopsis:</B> Daria gets ready.</P>

<P>
<HR width="100%"></P>

<P>Daria opened her eyes and stared up at her smooth grey ceiling, before
turning from her back to lie on her right side. She closed her eyes in
an attempt to fall back asleep. The blankets were too heavy, and so she
could not help but stay awake. An hour passed, and Daria continued to try
to find more comfortable positions.</P>

<P>Eventually, the pale yellow door that connected her room to the house
slit open, almost grabbing Daria's attention. An aggressive female hand
shot into the room and flicked the light switch. Squinting at the light,
Daria reluctantly sat up. From behind the door, she could hear her mothers
voice telling her to get ready for school. She felt footsteps moving from
her door towards the stairs, and the hollow thuds of someone descending
the staircase.</P>

<P>Sadly, Daria placed her glasses on her face. Reluctant to leave her
bed, she took an excessive amount of time to excruciatingly pull herself
out of it. Standing up, Daria was overcome with a tired dizziness, and
sat back down. She held the side of the bed and stared down at nothing,
letting her tangled hair clot around her shoulders. Finally regaining her
composure, she stood up a second time.</P>

<P>Still dizzy from fatigue, she limped towards the door. She halted suddenly
when she heard a small cracking sound, and simultaneously felt a sharp
edge press against the sole of her right foot. Looking down, Daria noted
that she had stepped on a cassette tape she had left lying near her bed.
It was broken, and a large piece of it was embedded in her sock. </P>

<P>With a look of irritation in her eyes, Daria stood, momentarily at a
loss for what to do. After a slight hesitation, she lifted her right foot,
and tried to pull the piece of plastic out of her sock. Standing on a single
foot, Daria lost her balance and began to fall over backwards. In a frightened
reflex she tried to spin through the air and catch herself, but only succeeded
in slapping her shoulder into the framing of the bed instead of her back.</P>

<P>Daria gave a surprised cry, consumed by a childish sense of frustration
which quickly deformed into a more bleak perspective of depression. Daria
took the opportunity of sitting on the floor to remove the plastic shrapnel
from her sole.</P>

<P>She finally succeeded in leaving her room. The first thing she saw in
the hallway was her sister, Quinn, striding from the bathroom to the staircase.
This helped to balance Daria's mood, and she did not hesitate to claim
the bathroom for herself.</P>

<P>Seeing the fogged mirror, Daria made a vexed sound. The air was heavy
with a wet heat. She shut the door and locked it before flipping a switch
next to the light. A fan ignited loudly from the ceiling, and Daria removed
her clothes. Placing her glasses on the wet counter and fumbling to find
her hairbrush, she edged into the shower, turned on the water, and jerked
to attention, despite her attempt to brace herself. The water was cold.
She let the feeling of liquid ice pierce her awake. Finally, she twisted
the metal knob in front of her, and the water slowly eased into warmth.
Once she was comfortable and awake, Daria began to brush her hair slowly
and deliberately. She grimaced in pain as she ripped small knots of tangled
hair out of her scalp.</P>

<P>Opening the shower door, Daria half-heartedly tossed the comb towards
the sinks, and missed. Without taking the effort to try and deduce where
it had landed, Daria closed the shower door and her eyes. Lathering her
hair with a scented shampoo, Daria shuffled from foot to foot before finally
rinsing it out. She did not bother with conditioner. Finally, Daria scraped
a bar of soap across her body obsessively and rinsed herself over again.</P>

<P>Exiting the shower, Daria walked up to the sink. She put her glasses
on for the second time, and found her hair blower. She plugged it in and
held it to the back of her head with her left hand. While doing this, Daria's
right hand found her toothbrush, lay it out, and forced some toothpaste
onto it. She continued brushing her teeth and blowing her hair like this,
while staring blankly at the fogged mirror.</P>

<P>Finished with hygiene, Daria quickly dried herself with a heavy green
towel, then realized she had forgotten her new change of clothes. Muttering,
Daria put the yellow shorts and blue shirt she slept in back on, and headed
to her room. </P>

<P>Walking into her closet, Daria quickly and easily threw off her sleeping
attire and gathered her normal clothes. In two minutes, she was in her
black pleated skirt and green blazer, tying her boots. Moments later she
was walking downstairs and into the kitchen.</P>

<P>Daria entered quickly and silently, grabbing some bread and pushing
it inside the family toaster. Her father and sister were at the table.
Her mother was pacing, arguing with a phone. Standing with nothing to do,
Daria was relieved when her toast appeared. She quickly grabbed it and
smeared its surface with a modest amount of butter, before forcing it into
her mouth. Already moving towards her backpack near the front door, she
made one last swallowing motion of her throat, and her toast was eaten.
She picked her backpack up and left the house.</P>

<P>The wind was dancing harshly, but it was not cold. Daria squinted under
the bright sunlight, and shivered despite the warmth it provided. Walking
on her un-stretched legs was irritating at first. She turned to one side
of the abandoned sidewalk and began trotting at a faster pace. She moved
her head back and forth slowly, taking in all of the unspectacular houses,
with their similar cars and similar families huddled around their doors,
or she looked through their windows and saw them eating the same breakfasts.
She let out a depressed sigh, and focused on the cracked sidewalk instead.</P>

<P>With a clear lack of focus, Daria continued to inch her way along the
sidewalk. Every so often she looked up and scanned the houses, but the
were all boring and soft. Every two out of three houses were white. The
rest were ambient pastel colours. They slowly blended together as Daria
walked by, one never-ending stretch of painted wood.</P>

<P>A couple more minutes of dejected walking, and Daria's face softened
slightly, with hidden gratitude. Her head was angled towards an ill kept
clapboard house. It was painted off white, and there were cracks in the
outside walls. Clumps of grass grew uncut, and large packs of dandelions
grew poisonously without contest. </P>

<P>Daria turned into the walkway and eagerly approached the door. She calmly
raised her hand and pressed the doorbell. After a moment, dull noises could
be heard from inside the house. Jane Lane, dressed in her usual daily attire,
still short breathed from running, and wet from a shower, opened the door
slowly. The hot moisture curled off of her forehead and dissipated in the
air. They friendly eye contact, and Daria said hello. </P>
