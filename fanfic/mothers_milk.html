<P><font face="Times New Roman" size=4>First, a bit of an 
explanation: while I've stopped fanfic production except for the 
<b>Wildfeed</b>, that hasn't stopped me from envisioning life 
post-Driven Wild Universe.  Every once in a while I'll plop out a 
scene or two for a story that I hope, with luck and perseverance, to 
have ready by 2010.  2015 at the latest.  This is one of the longest 
and most complete of the scenes I've written.  It is part of a larger 
fic that would center around a visit by Amy, Joel, and their baby to 
the Morgendorffer home just after the Christmas holiday, over a year 
after "Memory Road."  As in the actual series, Daria would be a 
freshman at Raft, and having a difficult time.  The story as a whole 
would focus on the friction in her relationship with Amy, now that 
her favorite aunt has a child of her own to devote her time to.</P>
<P>This scene, however, has none of that drama.  I showed it to 
<b>Roger E. Moore</b>, and he insisted that I post it and show other 
fans.  So if you don't like it, mail your rotten tomatoes to him!</P>
<P>And enjoy...</P>

<P>"Aunt Amy, why do you keep so much of your milk in the fridge?" 
asked Quinn, scrunching up her face at the sight of four baby bottles 
full of cream-colored liquid chilling next to her diet soda. </P>

<P> "In case I get the urge to slam back a couple shots of vodka.  A 
woman can't survive on fruit juice alone, you know."  Amy's words 
were playful, but her expression was that of someone who remembered 
far too many days without alcohol or any tempting substances 
whatsoever. </P>

<P> "Does drinking affect your milk that much?" </P>

<P> "Not if I don't mind my son puking on the furniture and filling 
his diapers with a stink that permeates the apartment for days.  It 
happened once after I drank a couple of glasses of champagne.  Not 
fun."  Amy wore a pained, amused expression.  "He's not too fond of 
caffeine and spices, either.  Mostly it's just a matter of taste - it 
sours the milk and irritates his bowels.  So it's blandness for Amy 
until he's on solids.  Having an extra supply on hand is always good 
in case I stray." </P>

<P> "I didn't realize you had to be so careful.  I thought you didn't 
want anything with taste because you were trying to lose your 
pregnancy fat." </P>

<P>An annoyed expression crossed Amy's face.  "Well... that, too." </P>

<P>When Quinn scrunched up her nose at the milk again, Amy sighed. 
"Quinn, honey, you've seen me breastfeed before." </P>

<P> "Yeah, but the milk, like, went into his mouth so it was all 
natural and I didn't have to see it.  But <I>that</I>... from your 
<I>breasts</I> -"  Quinn's face reddened and her gestures grew wilder 
as she tried to articulate her thoughts.  "It's like your breasts are 
<I>in</I> the fridge, or something!" </P>

<P>That did it.  Amy could not hold back a fit of surprised laughter. 
Quinn watched, stunned (though not as stunned as she might have been 
a year ago), as her aunt guffawed and snickered and giggled and 
guffawed all over again.  When Amy at last regained her composure, 
she went over to the fridge. </P>

<P> "Here," she said, reaching past Quinn for one of the bottles. </P>

<P> "What are you doing?" Quinn asked, as her aunt unscrewed the top 
and set it aside.  Amy then poured a little breast milk into her 
decaf coffee. </P>

<P> "AGH!  I can't believe you just <I>did</I> that!"  Quinn watched 
with utter horror as her aunt stirred her coffee until it turned 
light brown. </P>

<P> "Why not?  It's not bad."  Amy held the bottle toward her.  "Far 
better than freeze-dried Coffee Mate any day.  And at least I know 
where it came from.  Don't you ever wonder how much waste goes into 
your-"</P>

<P> "La-la-la!  We are not having this conversation."  Quinn tried as 
quickly as possible to finish up her breakfast so she could flee. 
However, her outburst was enough to draw Daria into the kitchen, 
where she looked at her aunt and sister with a deadpan expression. 
</P>

<P> "Found a new way to torture Quinn?  I - is that what I think it is?" </P>

<P> "I swear, they'll market this stuff someday at gourmet food 
shops.  It's got a ton of vitamins and nutrients."  Amy shook the 
bottle gently at Daria.  When Daria recoiled a little, she rolled her 
eyes.  "You two are so prudish.  You must take after your mother. 
She would never in a million years taste breast milk." </P>

<P> "That sounds like a clumsy attempt to goad us," Daria told Quinn. </P>

<P> "Well it won't work," Quinn responded defiantly. </P>

<P> "Nope," said Daria. </P>

<P> "You know, last week your Aunt Rita said the same thing," Amy 
said innocently.  "I never would have guessed you two had such a 
strong, close resemblance to her." </P>

<P>Daria and Quinn stared at her, then at each other. </P>

<P> "It worked," Quinn sighed. </P>

<P> "Yep."  Daria went over to the cabinet and took out two glasses, 
which she then laid on the counter.  She pushed one forward.  "Okay. 
Breast me." </P>

<P> "Daria!" Quinn gasped, as Amy tried to stifle her own surprise at 
her niece's blunt language. </P>

<P> "Just say when," Amy said, tipping the bottle over the glass, so 
a thin stream of cream-colored milk poured in.  At about an inch and 
a half, Daria motioned for her to stop.  She picked the glass up 
slowly and sloshed the milk around a little.  It seemed even in 
texture, maybe a little thicker than regular milk.  Daria brought the 
rim of the glass to her lips, then -</P>

<P> "You know, I'd hate for Quinn to miss out on the excitement." </P>

<P>Amy poured the same amount of liquid into the other glass and 
pushed it toward Quinn, who spent a long time washing out her cereal 
bowl before taking it.  She sloshed the liquid around, as Daria had, 
then eyed her sister before bringing the glass to her lips. </P>

<P> "So, which of you first?" asked Amy, brow raised, clearly amused 
by their discomfort. </P>

<P> "You go, Daria," Quinn said quickly.  "Yours was poured first and 
you don't want it to go sour." </P>

<P> "But it was your twisted fascination that got us into this mess," 
Daria shot back. </P>

<P> "Fine!" Quinn barked.  "Together, then." </P>

<P>Daria nodded.  Both sisters held the glasses to their lips for an 
interminable amount of time, while Amy strained to hold in her 
laughter.  Before either could go through with it, Helen breezed in 
to make her morning coffee. </P>

<P> "Hi, girls!  How are things g -"  Helen's eyes narrowed as she 
took in the scene.  "That's not what I think it is.  Is it?" </P>

<P>Daria pushed her glass toward her.  Helen took it and sniffed the 
milk, then rolled it around a little. </P>

<P> "I don't remember mine being quite this pale," she said critically. </P>

<P> "Mom!" freaked Quinn. </P>

<P>Helen took a sip.  "Mmm.  It has a nice flavor.  Must be from all 
those cheese fries you consume, Amy." </P>

<P> "Excuse me," Amy replied, a little indignant, "I just had a 
wonderful talk with Quinn about all the food I've cut from my diet 
since I got pregnant." </P>

<P> "What on earth made you girls want to try this stuff??" </P>

<P> "Oh you know your daughters," said Amy, a twinkle in her eye, 
"always craving the unexplored.  I couldn't pour fast enough." </P>

<P>Helen raised a skeptical brow at her sister, but decided not to 
press.  Instead, to everyone's surprise, she took another sip... then 
another.  Daria and Quinn watched her intently, prepared for a 
violent reaction.  When nothing happened, Daria at last went to the 
cupboard for another glass, while Quinn took hers and tipped it 
enough to allow a tiny bit of liquid into her mouth. </P>

<P>Several seconds of mouth-swishing later, she pronounced, "This 
isn't so bad."  She took a bigger sip.  "I can see why babies like 
it.  It's kind of sweet." </P>

<P> "You two certainly never complained," Helen said with a wry glance. </P>

<P>Quinn rolled her eyes and took another sip.  Daria placed her 
glass on the counter in front of Amy, who smirked before filling it 
half way. </P>

<P> "Hey!  That's too much," Daria said crossly. </P>

<P>"Come on now," said Amy in a sing-song tone, "get with the 
program.  Bottoms up." </P>

<P>Daria watched the cloud of smugness thicken around her aunt as she 
took another sip of coffee.  Prickling with irritation, she took her 
glass and raised it slowly.  "You know I was never a joiner."  Then 
with one swift motion, she emptied the entire contents into her 
mouth. </P>

<P>Breast milk flooded every crevice, puffing out her cheeks and 
overwhelming Daria so much with its flavor, it was all she could do 
to keep from spitting it out.  Amy, Helen, and Quinn stared at her 
expectantly, Amy's smugness replaced by vague astonishment.  Daria's 
cheeks burned until she detected the sweet under taste that Quinn had 
spoken of, and was able to swallow... swallow... swallow... until 
finally it was all gone.  Daria then looked directly at her aunt. </P>

<P>" It could use nutmeg." </P>

<P>"I'll make note of that," said Amy with a smile. </P>

<P>"You should thank her, Daria," Helen said, her tone amused, but 
firm.  "That's probably the healthiest thing you've consumed all 
week." </P>

<P>Now Daria rolled her eyes.  She glanced over at Amy, and they 
exchanged a look - a truce.  At once the atmosphere in the room 
relaxed into one of a typical family morning.  Daria and Helen went 
to make breakfast, while Quinn prepared to exit and Amy sipped her 
coffee.  Just then Joel strolled into the kitchen, rubbing the sleep 
out of his eyes, and took in the activity. </P>

<P>"Is that...?"</P>

<P>"Breast milk," the four women replied. </P>

<P>Joel shook his head.  "Won't ask." </P>

<P>"You want some?" asked Amy, taking another sip of coffee. </P>

<P>"Nah, it's okay."  Joel gave her a kiss good-morning, then wiggled 
his brows.  "I got my fill last night." </P>

<P>Amy nodded blandly - when suddenly her eyes widened, and she 
spurted milky coffee across the counter. </P>

<P>"Aunt Amy??" wondered Quinn, as her aunt gagged and coughed. </P>

<P>Joel pounded on her back while the Morgendorffers looked on, 
confused and concerned... until at once Joel's meaning sank in. </P>

<P>Daria frowned.  "He didn't just -" </P>

<P>"EwwWWWW!!!  I so did <I>not</I> need to know that!" gasped Quinn, 
before bolting from the room. </P>

<P>"For heaven's sake, Amy, even Jake and I had our limits!"  Helen 
glared at her. </P>

<P>"I was kidding, I was kidding!" Joel burst out, laughing a little 
with embarrassment as he tried to avoid his fianc&#233's evil eye. 
</P>

<P>"Of course you were," said Daria, before making her own exit. </P>

<P>"Joel?" </P>

<P>Recovered, Amy now spoke in an even, mildly dangerous tone. 
"Remember that talk we had about keeping certain <I>humor</I> between 
us because it might not <I>translate</I> well to other people?" </P>

<P>Joel smiled weakly. </P>

<P> "Why do I feel this sudden need for a newspaper?" </P>
