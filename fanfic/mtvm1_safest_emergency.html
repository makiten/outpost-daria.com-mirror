<p><b>(SUPER: SOMETIME NEAR THE START OF A SCHOOL YEAR, THE NOT TOO DISTANT
FUTURE, SOMEWHERE NOT TOO FAR AWAY FROM YOU...)</b>
<p><i>(SCENE: Open road, farmland area. Lots of green, therapeutic to those
of a certain frame of mind... such as Mr O'Neill, driving a small, "practical"
mid-eighties car (use your imagination, hopefully it's less vivid than
mine), talking with typical enthusiasm to an unsure-looking Barch, riding
shotgun. Looking out the front windscreen, we see an ornate set of
metal gates, with a large sign reading: LIBRATIA EDUCATORS' RETREAT. The
gates open automatically, and the car goes through.)</i>
<p>O'NEILL: ... and not only will we finally get to meet your sister, I
hear the speaker they have tomorrow is <b>wonderful</b>! Just a short half
hour, and you come out feeling like a <b>new teacher</b>!
<p>BARCH: Sounds great, skinny! <i>(awkward pause)</i> Isn't that whale
sounds show on the radio you like on now?
<p>O'NEILL: <i>(looks at car clock in front of him)</i> Oh no, you're right!
It'll already have started! I hope I haven't missed anything <b>exciting</b>...
<p><i>(He hastily flips on the radio, but not to worry -- he hasn't missed
anything exciting, even by the standards of whalesong broadcast. But after
a few seconds, the undeniably relaxing calls of the Orca (as opposed to
the kind found on #Daria+) is obnoxiously interrupted by an overblown radio
news theme, and the quacking of some third-rate wannabe Ugly Phil...)</i>
<p>RADIO ANNOUNCER: <i>(more self-important than urgent)</i> And we interrupt
our scheduled program to bring you this special report. <i>(O'Neill looks
at Barch, concerned)</i> Three people, believed to be diagnosed mutants,
are confirmed dead and many more injured as a woman goes on a violent rampage
in a teachers' retreat fifty miles outside Baltimore... <i>(Barch has gone
pale)</i> Details are still unclear... <i>(O'Neill turns the radio off)</i>
<p>O'NEILL: Janet? Is everything okay? <i>(silence, except for the faint
sounds of screaming in the background... the car rounds a corner, to pass
the main part of the retreat complex... we see a few buildings, a car park
a way ahead, a high outdoor stage seen from behind, and a whole lot of
blood. A woman is standing on the stage, facing away, holding some kind
of nasty-looking automatic weapon and some other meter-looking gadget...
said stage is right in front of our heroes (for want of a better word).</i>
<p>BARCH: <i>(deadly, not the comical semi-squeal we normally hear)</i>
Stop the car, Timothy.
<p>O'NEILL: But it's not <b>safe</b> here, Janet...
<p>BARCH: <i>(shouts)</i> STOP THE CAR!
<p><i>(O'Neill eeps and jams the brakes on. Right behind the woman with
the gun.)</i>
<p>BARCH: <i>(quiet, serious)</i> It's not safe anywhere, Timmy. Not for
us. Not anymore.
<p><i>(O'Neill just looks at her, bewildered and worried, as she opens
the door, gets out of the car, and begins to walk towards the stage. Music:
"How To Disappear Completely", Radiohead. Fade out all sound except for
the music, as Ms Barch climbs a staircase at the back of the stage and
strides across to confront the gunwoman. The latter turns around and points
first the meter and then the gun at Barch, who smiles and says something.
The gunwoman nods. Ms Barch turns around and shouts to O'Neill...)</i>
<p>BARCH: DRIVE, TIMMY! GET OUT OF HE-- <i>(she's cut off, best not to
know what by, fast cut to O'Neill, cringing to semi-foetal and shutting
his eyes in horror and shock. He stays that way for a few seconds, before
opening them again. Looking distant, he starts the car and drives off,
accelerating... behind him, a street sign buckles over...)</i>
<p><i>(If we were going to bother with opening credits, we'd roll 'em right
about now. This is a fanfic, we don't have the budget. So...)</i>

<p><i>(SCENE: Home office, casa Landon. Andrew Landon is on the phone,
talking... animatedly.)</i>
<p>ANDREW: Well, Danny, you can just tell the Senator that if the speech
doesn't go out as is, he can <b>kiss</b> that little <b>campaign donation</b>
of mine goodbye! No way are my tax dollars going to be wasted on some lousy
public hospital or worthless state orphanage when there are mutant bastards
out there cheating welfare, cheating business, cheating <b>who knows what</b>!
<i>(pause,
calmer)</i> Look, Danny. You're right, I do feel strongly about this. <i>(back
to angry)</i> I've worked <b>so</b> damn hard to get where I am today,
so has my wife, we have three beautiful children, and they're all succeeding
<b>on
their own</b>. To have some lousy freak of genetics take it all away...
<p><i>(Cut to: A computer screen. Andrew's tirade into the phone is heard
faintly in the background, fading out. We see an anonymous word-processor
window on the screen, with a fairly generic (but impressive) college 
application
essay being typed on it. Pan down and out, and there's no-one in the swivel
chair actually typing -- the keys are apparently going up and down of their
own accord. Zoom back, and we see Jodie Landon leaning back in an armchair,
halfway across the room, talking on the 'phone, with half an eye on the
computer.)</i>
<p>JODIE: <i>(into the phone, grinning)</i> Don't worry, Mack, I'm going
to the dance on Friday. <i>(pause)</i> It's not a problem. Dad will faint
-- I finished all the hundred sixty college application essays he asked
me to write <i>(pause again, the typing stops, the mouse moves, and a printer
loudly springs into life in the background)</i> ten seconds ago. I'm safe.
Besides, it's not like I could turn my back on "mandatory school activities",
even if he did haul me out of the design committee. See you at school tomorrow,
okay? <i>(hangs up)</i>
<p><i>(Cut to: DeMartino's homeroom. Jane, Daria, Mack, Jodie, and other
assorted human debris are sitting down listening to the Evil Goddess Li
(slight exaggeration) read the morning notices in various levels of attention
and/or consciousness.)</i>
<p>MS LI: <i>(loudspeaker V/O)</i> And I would like to take this opportunity to
inform you that the people who defaced the "Welcome to Lawndale" sign
<b>will</b> be caught and disciplined, and that the sign has 
<b>already</b> been
replaced by one by the well-known artist Andrew Blenkins, best known for his
design work for One Humanity. <i>(mutters something mercifully 
unintelligible)</i> On a less... aesthetically pleasing note, some of 
you may be
aware of the recent public outcry over... mutants in our free and fair society.
After consultation with the school board and several influential 
local busine-- figures, it has been decided that <i>(obligatory 
reverential tone)</i>
Llllaaawwndale High will implement a Genetic Watch Initiative in 
accordance with
this state's Mutant Act of this year, starting immediately. Any 
student showing evidence of... naturally inexplicable abilities will 
be required to submit to a full medical, genetic, physical and 
psychiatric examination to ensure that Lawndale High can remain the 
secure and <b>safe</b> learning environment it is today. Thus 
concludes the morning notices. Commence learning!
<p><i>(Jodie, whose expression has been dimming throughout the speech,
now looks genuinely frightened. Daria sees this and makes a move to talk...
but remembers the "security" cameras and thinks better of it.)</i>
<p><i>(Cut to: Lawndale High hallway, change of period. Daria and Jane
run into Jodie (still looking nervous) and Mack as they leave a classroom
and steer them down the hall, around a corner, past a bathroom, behind
a block of lockers, through a door, down a flight of stairs and into some
kind of empty storage room.)</i>
<p>DARIA: <i>(calm, sympathetic)</i> This is the only place on this side
of the building where Big Brother isn't watching. Or listening. Anything
you say here, stays here.
<p>MACK: <i>(eyebrows raised)</i> OK. <i>(pause)</i> Jodie, something's
been bothering you all day. What's the problem?
<p>JODIE: It was that... Genetic Watch thing she announced.
<p>MACK: I know. I've got a couple of friends, just out of high school,
who'd be--
<p>JODIE: It's more than that, Mack. <i>(She pulls a pen out of her bag,
and floats it slowly from one hand to the other. The others just stare.)</i>
<p>JANE: <i>(first to recover)</i> Does anyone else know? Your parents?
<p>JODIE: No, you guys are the first. Dad would freak if he found out.
<i>(not worried so much as resigned)</i> He hates three things: taxes, welfare
cheats and "mutes".
<p>JANE: Well, at least you can keep this one hidden easy enough. <i>(pause,
as if in thought, then cautious)</i> What do you think I've been doing
for the last few weeks?
<p>DARIA &amp; JODIE: Excuse me?
<p>JANE: You know those little rain showers we normally have in the mornings
around here about this time of year?
<p>JODIE: Yeah, but...
<p>JANE: You noticed how there haven't been as many lately? Especially
on the mornings when I'm out running? <i>(she lets this sink in)</i>
<p>DARIA: <i>(slight disbelief)</i> And why haven't I found out about this
until now?
<p>JANE: Um... nerves? <i>(Daria cocks an eyelid)</i> Seriously, I wasn't
sure... how you'd take it.
<p>DARIA: I'm not my sister, Jane. As long as I'm not the one who gets
struck by lightning, I couldn't care less. <i>(pause)</i> I think there's
a fashion club meeting at my house tonight -- do you want to come over?
<i>(Jane smirks, Daria follows suit, Jodie and Mack look at them like they're
not sure if they're joking or not.)</i>
<p><i>(a pause)</i>
<p>MACK: So, do we know if anyone else is...
<p>JODIE: Nobody I know of. And now Ms Li's effectively declared us
untermenschen, it's not like anyone's going to be going out of their way to...
<i>(fire siren starts to ring)</i> ... tell the world...
<p>(Mack starts to go out the way they came. Daria shakes her head and
guides him to another door on the other side of the storeroom. Jane and
Jodie follow.)
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%"><i><font color="#000033">Sitting quietly in Bennet's 
economics,
some boring as hell Monday morning. I sketch a wolverine on the pad in
front of me, instead of the usual football diagram on crystal meth
that's on the board. But at least she isn't a total fruit loop like the
rest of them. She just can't teach for shit.</font></i>
<p><i><font color="#000033">Every other class has been let out for ages
now. With the bell. But old Bennet can't always hear it from this end of
the building, or that's her excuse anyway. I can, of course. But I can
hear a lot of things. All the way to the cafeteria one way, or Ms Barch's
lab, halfway across the building. I cast an ear her way, maybe the random
male she's relieving of the burden of self-esteem will deserve it this
time. Search... relative silence. Nobody's there. Barch is taking the day
off, it seems. Isn't the kid creeping up on her door going to be 
relieved.</font></i>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><i>(SCENE: Ms Barch's lab, five minutes earlier. Said teacher is absent
due to fatal illness (cranio-facial lead infusion). The door rattles and
squeaks as it is opened the slightest amount. Come to think of it, not
all of those squeaks were made by hinges... sure enough, it's Brittany
at the door, peeking in with trebida-- trepi-- like she's really <b>scared</b>!
Seeing that the coast is clear, she tiptoes in and puts a paper on the
late Ms Barch's desk. She starts to leave, pauses, looks around, and gets
what can only be described as an I'm-about-to-do-something-bad-but-fun!
grin on her face (and <b>not</b> the kind of thing you're thinking of,
Miss Friedman! Get your mind out of the gutter, it could use the change
of scenery after so many years...) and goes over to one of the benches.
It's overcast outside, the lights aren't on and it's hard to see much.
Opening the cabinet, she removes a Bunsen burner and gas hose, which she
connects to one of the gas taps. Cut to an overhead shot of the burner
igniting -- no matches required. We zoom back, and see that the gas tap
isn't on either. Meanwhile, Brittany is looking at the pretty blue flame,
fascinated.)</i>
<p>BRITTANY: Ooooh...
<p><i>(She gently picks up the burner with her right hand and ever so carefully
moves it so that the flame is going straight into her other hand. Instead
of getting burnt, her left hand "ignites" itself -- the flames doing no
damage to her skin, just floating a millimetre or so above and looking
pretty and orange. Putting the Bunsen burner down, she clasps her hands
together, spreading the fire, and starts waving them about. They trail
sparks and larger teardrop-shaped flames, hanging in the dark air for a
few seconds before disappearing. Brittany keeps it up with a vacant-as-usual
look in her eyes, utterly mesmerised by her own lightshow, watching it
expand and become more complex. Then she draws her hands back behind her
head... and decides to twirl one of her ponytails. Bad move. Whatever it
is keeping her hands from catching alight doesn't apply to dead cells,
such as hair. Net result: flames in close proximity to her head, which
she knows at least instinctively is somewhat essential to her ongoing 
life.)</i>
<p>BRITTANY: <i>(Yeah, I know it's obvious and clich&eacute;d, but I can't
keep on writing descriptions for twenty lines straight. It's boring.)</i>
Eep!
<p><i>(The fire alarm we heard earlier goes off in the background. Every
gas tap in the room has a metre-long jet of flame coming out of it, providing
a little light. She flails about, her now partially-extinguished hands
occasionally slapping at the burning ponytail. She stumbles out of the
room...)</i>
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%"><i><font color="#000033">The kid creeps up to Barch's
desk like an amateur spy, but spies, even the amateurs, tend not to squeak
so much. Oh, joy, it's our much-loved head cheerleader. But she's female,
it's not like she has to worry about the real wrath of the teacher... even
if she does have an assignment late, which would be the likely reason why
she's putting a piece of paper on the desk. Starts to leave, stops and
turns around, and goes to one of the benches. Opens a cupboard, removes...
something... can't hear <b>that</b> much... does... something... I sniff.
She's playing with fire, obviously. But that doesn't smell like a gas flame
now. Sniff. It smells... it could be anything burning. Half a minute of
this, the smell getting stronger but no more identifiable, and then it
changes. Sniff. The stupid bitch's set her own hair on fire. Guess I'll
have to go and help her out, it's not like anybody would voluntarily head
towards the Lair of the Mantis. Nobody male, anyway. Wait for a second.
Sniff again. What the hell is <b>that</b>, burning? The fire alarm goes
off. Finally. "Orderly fashion, students! Stand up and walk out of the
class to the designated area in a <b>brisk</b> and <b>orderly</b> fashion!"
implores Bennet. Fat chance. Join the stampede out of the classroom, cut
a left where everyone else takes a right and start running to where my
ears and nose say the cheerleader is.</font></i>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><i>(Cut to: Hallway a way outside the science lab, a few kids are still
in the hall on their way to wherever it is LHS students go in a fire drill.
They stare in shock at the apparition of the cheerleader on fire without
metaphors involved. She's in no control at all now, little fireballs shooting
off her fingers and hair (the right half of which has almost completely
singed away. One of the fireballs hits one of the kids -- it's one of the
three J's, looking lost away from Quinn. Shirt on fire, he runs off screaming.
The screams fade eventually, but not because of distance. The fireballs
keep on coming, slamming into a huge "STUDENT COUNCIL: WORKING FOR YOU"
banner over a doorway and setting it alight. At exactly the wrong time,
a large class of year nines led by Ms Defoe turns the corner and passes
through the doorway. The banner falls on top of them. Ms Defoe turns in
horror as her students struggle and burn underneath the flaming effigy
of school spirit. Brittany staggers on...)</i>
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%"><i><font color="#000033">Keep running, following the screams
and the flames. Finally get a clear view of her, staggering without getting
any ground in any one way or another. And if Ms Defoe wasn't leading her
freshman Art class through the double doorway, I might be able to catch
up to the cheerleader and stop her before she does any more damage. Of
course, this still leaves the question of what to do when I do... oh, shit.
That stupid banner on the other side of the wall just came down. Burning.
On top of the Art class. Defoe is in shock. The kids seem to be pulling
themselves out, but Brittany's moved on and the blockage means a nice long
detour. Begin to <b>sprint</b>.</font></i>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><i>(Cut to: An outside shot of Lawndale High. Windows smash. Balls of
fire ranging in size from a golf ball to half a metre's diameter fly out.)</i>
<p><i>(Cut to: Another LHS hallway, this one with lockers. Daria, Jane,
Jodie and Mack come out from one door, another on the opposites side of
the hall explodes into flame, spilling pieces of burning plasterboard and
brick into the hallway, to herald the arrival of Brittany. The four rush
straight back behind the door they came from, leaving it half-open.)</i>
<p><i>(Cut to: Yet another hallway, the one our heroes presumably came
through. They're leaning back against the wall by the door, Mack being
nearest to it and taking a few quick looks back through.)</i>
<p>DARIA: Is she still there?
<p>MACK: Yeah... just going round in circles.
<p>JANE: So what are we going to do?
<p>JODIE: Do? Get the hell out of here and wait for the cops, like everyone
else. We're students, not comic-book superheroes.
<p>DARIA: And the ability to pull a Matilda at a hundred feet is in no
way a comic-book super power. <i>(pause, deadpan)</i> And as much as I'd
like to see LHS turn into the ending of Carrie, I've got some writing I
don't have backed up on O'Neill's desk and I can't get it back if it's
a small pile of ashes. <i>(slightly exasperated -- this is classic Daria,
you can hardly tell)</i> You're telekinetic, get a chunk of plasterboard
and knock her out.
<p>JODIE: This still isn't the movies, Daria. I'd probably kill her or
cause a lot of pain rather than just knocking her unconscious.
<p>DARIA: As compared to however many people she's run into already? (sighs)
You're right. Jane, can you attract rain like you drive it away?
<p>JANE: Dunno, never tried it before. But there's a big stinkin' roof
in the way.
<p>MACK: Would a lightni--
<p><i>(f/x: <b>BOOM</b>!)</i>
<p><i>(A huge fireball, courtesy of the still-out-of-control Brittany,
slams into the top and side of the doorway and Mack is blown backwards,
indirectly answering his question. The three girls run over to help. Jodie
looks him over quickly and drags him out of the line of fire. Once there,
he gets up by himself, a little uneasily.)</i>
<p>JANE: <i>(forced casual)</i> Let's get the hell out of here and wait
for the cops.
<p><i>(Cut to: LHS main building, outside shot. The students have been
herded into groups on the front lawns and car park, staying in the most
open spaces. Teachers are standing around, vainly attempting to take the
roll in spite of the fact it's obvious no more than two-thirds of the school's
population is out here. As the four come out a side door and make their
way to the nearest grouping, conspicuously dark clouds begin to gather...
Mack, Daria and Jodie look to Jane for an explanation.)</i>
<p>JANE: <i>(shrugs, eyes glowing very slightly)</i> We can at least help
put the fires outside out, and at this rate she'll blow a hole in the ceiling
pretty soon anyway... <i>(to their continuing looks)</i> What?
<p>DARIA: Since when do you care about the maintenance of school buildings?
<p>JANE: Hey, that was the art room she was heading towards. I've got a
20'-square canvas in there I haven't finished and no way is she turning
it into--
<p><i>(A metre-radius fireball blows out the main front doors, and the
terrible image of the flaming, now totally bald, dirty and scarred Brittany
slowly reveals itself, in the classic Carrie pose, from the darkness inside.
Rain starts to fall, right on cue. Through the miracles of movie lighting
and a power cut, her flames are the only light in the totally dark building,
and through the miracle of the MPAA, her uniform is undamaged beyond a
few scorch marks. The crowd draws a collective breath at the sight... and
she stops, dead, in her tracks. Note the commas. A familiar set of three
metal claws retract from the general area of her heart, and Brittany's
body drops to the floor. The claws disappear into the darkness. Black.)</i>
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%"><i><font color="#000033">Jump through one or two fire-broken
walls and finally get a clear view of Brittany from behind, still stumbling,
still fumbling fireballs all over the place. I'm directly behind her and
still wind up dodging them... finally catch up, have to do something,
half the hall's already burning, extend those claws...</font></i>
<p><i><font color="#000033">The doors open. Ten thousand eyes stare at
Brittany, watch the life go out of her as I pull back.</font></i>
<p><i><font color="#000033">Oh, gods, <b>no</b>. What have I just 
done?</font></i>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><i>(SCENE: LHS auditorium. Music: "When I Tell You In The End", The
Superjesus, continues throughout the auditorium scene. This room seems
to have escaped the ravages of the pyromaniac cheerleader. The student
numbers seem slightly diminished -- presumably through injuries -- and
there are one or two obvious mutants in the crowd, looking uncomfortable
and alone, and a few relatively ordinary-looking types not feeling much
better. On stage sit the usual cast of idio... teachers, except for Ms
Barch, obviously. Alongside them are Jodie, an unfamiliar preppy-looking
type who is presumably the president of student council, and Kevin, with
his usual dumb grin replaced by one of total sadness and wearing a black
armband with his football uniform. Ms Li has the floor.)</i>
<p>LI: <i>(holding back tears a little too easily)</i> How are we to make
sense of such a tragedy? Two days ago, at this very school, Brittany Taylor,
an undiagnosed mutant, someone held highly in the school's esteem, lost
control of herself. She lost her own life, left twelve in intensive care,
many more with minor injuries, and <i>(voice raises <b>ever</b> so 
slightly)</i>
caused hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage to school property.
<p><i>(Fast cut to the remaining cheerleaders, sitting together in a row
(any comments on their collective resemblance to bowling pins, to be knocked
down or up, I leave to the reader) in the audience.)</i>
<p>ANGIE: I can't believe Brittany was, like, a mute. That's, like, not
something we can have on the cheerleading team.
<p>OTHER CHEERLEADERS: Yeah./You're so right./You mean she couldn't tal--
<b>oh.</b>/No
kidding.
<p><i>(Cut back to the stage.)</i>
<p>LI: I have asked-- <b>Kevin Thompson</b>, our varsity quarterback and
the late Ms Taylor's boyfriend, yes, <b>he</b> has asked <i>(Kevin looks
briefly confused over his misery)</i> to deliver a speech, talking about
his grief, <b>our</b> grief, and <b>where</b> we can go from <b>heerrrre</b>.
<i>(steps back, goes off stage, and after a few seconds the grieving Kevin
realises what's going on and comes forward)</i>
<p>KEVIN: <i>(pulling out a small stack of palm cards, Tiffanyesque, unlike
in ATGIL he hasn't practised this one)</i> Good morning, sut-- student
body. I'm Kev-in Thompson, a-nother student here at Lawndale High, and
QB for the football team. On Mon-day something happened to my best fr-iend

<p><i>(Brief cut to Ms Li, off stage, she's talking on a mobile phone.)</i>
<p>LI: <i>(to phone)</i> Don't worry, Mr Landon, I've made arrangements
for the quarterback of the football team and the head of the student council
to make speeches supporting the GWI. One of them is going on right now...
<p>(Back again to the audience, they're looking around, confused and
suspicious... even Kevin's not normally <b>this</b> bad. Speaking of whom...)
<p>KEVIN: No-bo-dy really knows what, but she started going around the

have been ay-bul to prev-ent this traggedy. Th-ank you.
<p><i>(Fast cut to the football team, sitting together in the audience
near the front -- we see Mack, two of the three J's (Joey is missing) and
a few other semi-familiar faces.)</i>
<p>JEFFY: Yeah! Go Lions!
<p><i>(Utter silence, fast cut to Daria and Jane)</i>
<p>DARIA: I'm impressed. I honestly didn't think it was possible for Ms
Li to sink this low.
<p><i>(Fast cut to the cheerleaders again.)</i>
<p>ANGIE: Yeah, exactly, guys. I mean, if we'd, like, had the Genetic Watch
going, Brittany would <b>never</b> have been, like, a mutant...
<p><i>(Back to the stage, Ms Li has taken the podium again apparently without
noticing how badly the speech she wrote for Kevin went.)</i>
<p>LI: I'd like to thank Kevin for his <b>touching</b> speech. That must
have been very hard for you, Kevin, and I want you to know that you have
the school's complete sympathies. If religion were permitted in public
schools, you would be in all of our prayers. <i>(mutters)</i> As if God
is of any use right now. <i>(back aloud)</i> And now, I welcome the president
of Lawndale High Student Council, Dean Bradfield McBale, <i>(blatantly
fake)</i> who I believe will be discussing the mutant problem as well?
<i>(Dean, the preppy-looking type, gives a subtle-as-a-brick nod -- obviously
this was staged -- and steps up to the microphone.)</i>
<p>DEAN: <i>(Think of the politician with the most boring voice you can
and subtract about thirty-five years)</i> Thank you very much, Ms Li. As
most of you are no doubt aware, the issue of genetic mutants in society
has been the significant one in the newspapers, on the television, on the
radio, indeed everywhere in recent times, dominating debate for the forthcoming
state elections. And I'm sorry to say that, as Kevin so... touchingly described
to you, it has adversely affected our school. This only proves the need for our
Genetic Watch Initiative, which I for one hope will be expanded, and 
other areas
of mutant participation in the community of <i>(in a similar but less 
pronounced
reverential tone to Ms Li)</i> Lllawndale Hiigh. Therefore, mutants will
be exempted from extracurricular activities such as representative sport
and debate teams and indeed <i>(gestures to a small pin on his shirt)</i>
student council until their capabilities are properly determined. Separate
classes will be created for diagnosed mutants, suited to their <b>special</b>
needs while allowing the school to properly cater for the unaffected.
<p><i>(There are mutterings throughout the audience, Jodie looks unsettled.
Fast cut to Daria and Jane again.)</i>
<p>DARIA: What a polite way of saying segregation.
<p>JANE: Does this mean I get the Art room all to myself?
<p><i>(Back to the podium.)</i>
<p>DEAN: The results -- names, physical manifestations, detailed explanations
of the abilities -- of the tests performed as part of the GWI will be published
on the main school notice board. Furthermore, to ensure that this Friday's
dance is as enjoyable to all concerned as possible, diagnosed mutants and
those of plain human genetics will not be permitted to attend together.
<p><i>(There are loud mutterings, some angry, some agreeing, some just
confused. Jodie looks physically sick.)</i>
<p><i>(Cut to: the football team in the audience -- the two remaining J's
have started a minor fistfight over some minor issue, not involving Quinn
for a change, one or two of their stupider teammates are cheering them
on indiscriminately, and Mack... Mack is sitting in his chair, head in
his hands, eyes watering a storm even through his fingers. One of his 
teammates,
who looks suspiciously like a slightly younger Kevin, has a red NY Yankees
cap on backwards, let's call him... Fred, say... is sitting next to him
looking worried in a stupid kind of way.)</i>
<p>FRED: Yo, you OK, Mack Daddy?
<p>MACK: My eyes... my eyes...
<p>FRED: Your eyes... what's wrong with 'em?
<p>MACK: They... they hurt... like hell...
<p>FRED: Mack?
<p>MACK: They're... burning... just burning...
<p>FRED: Okay, Mack, right... let me see?
<p><i>(With difficulty, Mack drops one hand and opens the eye closest to
Fred for just a split second... letting him see that it's just a plain
red glowing ember. Fred jumps away, scared and trembling.)</i>
<p>FRED: (gibbering) M-m-m-mu... M-M-Mack D-daddy's a m-m-mutant...
<p><i>(Suddenly, Mack's head snaps up and he tears his hands away from
his head.)</i>
<p><i>(Cut to: Auditorium, outside doors. They break open as one, people
crowding to get out.)</i>
<p><i>(Cut to: Stage. Chairs have been knocked over in the rush to get
out, and it's deserted except for Kevin, who's sprawled on the floor, unable
to run off owing to the hole in his head.)</i>
<p><i>(Cut to: Mack, alone in the audience, head in his hands again, sobbing
uncontrollably. There aren't any tears this time.)</i>
<p><i>(Cut to: Outside LHS. Two ambulances pull up, sirens blaring, followed
by God knows how many police cars of all shapes and sizes. Cops of various
descriptions get out, most of them in riot gear of the kind normally reserved
for small-cell terrorism or anti-capitalist protests. They immediately
go into showy preparations to storm the auditorium, while hustling to get
any stragglers out. The front row raises its weapons and prepares to charge
in -- and freezes in mid-crouch. A familiar red convertible glides in through
a gap between cop cars and a familiar face gets out. Readers are asked
to put all thought of non-DWU Kara Wild fanfic out of your mind as Amy
Charlotte Barksdale reveals herself from the driver's side in a wheelchair,
and rolls calmly into the building. She reappears a few seconds later with
Mack, who is walking tall and relaxed, hands by his sides, eyes lightly
shut. They get into the convertible and drive off.)</i>

<p>MS LI: <i>(struggling to stay calm)</i> <b>Yes</b> Mr Thompson, I know
you must be feeling a lot of-- <i>(she winces and holds the phone away

<p><i>(She hangs up, obviously relieved that <b>that's</b> over. She pushes
a button on the intercom that clich&eacute; requires her to have.)</i>
<p>MS LI: Is Ms Manson still on... <i>(pause)</i> holiday? <i>(vaguely

on his way out right now, could you get him before he goes and tell him
to drop in here? <i>(another affirmative buzz, Burnsesque)</i> 
<b>Ex</b>cellent.
<p><i>(Cut to: O'Neill's classroom. Clearly he's attempting to have a 
counselling
session with the LHS student who needs it most... namely, one Charles 
Ruttheimer
III. Poor kid, must be the lack of a middle name that's troubling him.
Or maybe the unsurprisingly large pile of... ahem... explicit publications
that have been placed rather pointedly on a desk on the far side of the
room. No, wait, it's probably the scars on his cheek from being slapped
and scratched repeatedly by someone wearing fake nails.)</i>
<p>O'NEILL: <i>(doing what he does best -- trying to be nice)</i> Now,
Charles, I know that the young women of Lawndale High sometimes... fail
to appreciate your charms. But you have to understand--
<p>UPCHUCK: <i>(pleading, the try-hard seduction is off, in an unusually
high-pitched but not actually irritating voice)</i> But I didn't <b>mean</b>
to do it this time, Mr O'Neill! I was merely admiring DeAnne's fine figure
from a distance. Appreciative of the opposite sex I may be, but I am first
and foremost a gentleman! I would <b>never</b> touch a woman in such an...
intimate area without her express permission!
<p>O'NEILL: Yes, Charles, but... given your past record, you can hardly
blame her for...
<p>UPCHUCK: It-- it can't have been-- I was twenty feet away!
<p>O'NEILL: You were the only other person anywhere near her, Charles.
<i>(sigh)</i>
There's no point in denying it. What we can do is get you some counselling
for your... problem. If you can do it and not remember afterwards, then
there may well be something seriously--
<p>UPCHUCK: <i>(breaking)</i> Okay, fine! Take me to one of your god-forsaken
shrinks! Spin them whatever you like! Let them sedate me and torture me
until I'm nothing but a... robot for them to program! Can they help me
with THIS?!
<p><i>(And with that, he sticks out his tongue. To the other side of the
classroom. Whipping out with speed, it sticks to the top porno mag and
brings it flying back across the room. He drops it in front of O'Neill
and whips his tongue back in. Then he spits on it -- a huge green splodge
suddenly appears on the cover, maintaining this fic's PG13 rating (ha!),
and hardens.)</i>
<p>UPCHUCK: <i>(irate)</i> WELL? I'm a FREAK! Can you "happy-thoughts"
me out of this one? Can <b>you</b> do ANYTHING?
<p><i>(O'Neill levitates Upchuck's immodest wallet out of his pants pocket
using the coins inside and dumps in on top of the hardened green saliva.)</i>
<p>O'NEILL: <i>(level)</i> Yes, I think I can.
<p><i>(Cut to: A well-furnished house, spare bedroom. Mack is on a couch,
asleep, a pair of dark, faintly red-tinged sunglasses on his face. He stirs,
and his pose alters so we can tell he's waking up, even without being able
to see his eyes. He lifts up a hand to take off the glasses...)</i>
<p>AMY: <i>(V/O, apparently from inside Mack's head)</i> Don't touch them!
<p><i>(Mack sits up with a start.)</i>
<p>MACK: Who... what the hell are you? What are you doing?
<p>AMY: <i>(V/O, calm and calming)</i> A friend. And keeping you from blowing
a hole in the ceiling.
<p><i>(Mack leans forward and looks to be starting to sob again as he 
remembers.)</i>
<p>MACK: Oh, God... four feet to the right... that would have been Jodie...
He's <b>dead</b>...
<p>AMY: <i>(V/O, suddenly)</i> Don't. <i>(Mack snaps up)</i> There was
<b>nothing</b>
you could have done. It's <b>not</b> your fault. <i>(the voice gets louder)</i>
You have <b>nothing</b> to feel guilty about. <b>Nothing</b>.
<i>(Amy's
voice starts echoing through Mack's head...)</i>
<p>MACK: <i>(faintly)</i> Nothing... nothing at all. <i>(smiles)</i>
<p><i>(He gets up slowly, confidently, and leaves the room.)</i>
<p><i>(Cut to: Underground room with "evil genius's HQ" written all over
it in big letters. Damn metaphorical graffiti artists. Upchuck is led by
Mr O'Neill down a flight of stairs overlooking a hangar-sized complex...
plenty of grime, huge screens on the walls at odd angles, large computer-like
interfaces at every spare square inch, and a centrepiece is a huge, 
comic-book-impressive
machine: a narrow walkway, with a hard chair in the centre and a triad
of cathedral-like pulpits at one end, all done in a faintly, ominously
glowing grey stone. Upchuck looks at the device with a mix of curiosity
and foreboding. O'Neill follows his gaze and smiles.)</i>
<p>O'NEILL: Impressed? We've been working on that for a while. <i>(sighs)</i>
It was one of Janet's dreams was to see that come to fruition. Now... I
think we may stand a chance. The trick is to get as many people as possible
within range, which is easy enough, but we needs fuel, too. So if we can
do something at the dance on Friday, say...
<p>UPCHUCK: (looking confused and a little frightened) Um, we?
<p>O'NEILL: Oh, Anthony, Sam and I... Maggie, when she gets back. And Janet,
until... (trails off)
<p><i>(They reach the bottom of the stairs and turn left, away from the
machine. We see a room about the size of an LHS classroom, but it seems
like a small alcove compared to the rest of the complex. The sink, large
table and cooktop would imply that they use it as a kitchen/dining room
of sorts. "They" being Anthony DeMartino, Samantha Morris and presumably
O'Neill, who goes over to the other two for a typically warm greeting.
Upchuck just stares in shock at DeMartino. His right eye isn't bulging
at all. And more to the point, he's about one and a half times his usual
size, has long, dense, straight yellow fur growing out of most of his top
half, and sabre-teeth. Hmmm, I wonder what mutant this guy is.)</i>
<p>UPCHUCK: M-mister DeM-martino...?
<p><i>(DeMartino looks up, growls a curse and shrinks back to his normal
size. His eye starts bulging slightly again, and behaves as usual when
he speaks.)</i>
<p>DeMARTINO: <b>SORRY</b> about that, <b>CHARLES</b>. I prefer not to
use my mu<b>TA</b>tion to <b>SCARE</b> my <b>STU</b>dents. It's an 
un<b>FAIR</b>
advantage.
<p><i>(Upchuck whimpers)</i>
<p><i>(a long pause)</i>
<p>UPCHUCK: But... so what... what are you... what are you guys trying
to do?
<p><i>(O'Neill beams.)</i>
<p>O'NEILL: Well, you see, Charles, it all started when Ms Li became principal.
She took money from the school budget to have this place hollowed out,
either for a security HQ or a fallout shelter, I'm not sure. Someone found
out, and to keep it from getting to the media, she had the place was sealed
off. <i>(childish grin, conspiratorial)</i> Or that's what she <b>thinks</b>,
anyway... <i>(fades out, the camera starts panning away, we clearly see
a photo of Daria and Tom, with Daria circled and the notation "She knows.")</i>
<p><i>(SCENE: LHS car park, the next morning. What? Oh, come on, I'm not
going to give away <b>all</b> of the evil plan <b>now</b>. Some people...
Anyway, Jodie, looking like she's been up half the night crying (she has)
pulls in, gets out of her car and starts walking to the main building.
Dean McBale is waiting there and tries to join her. Jodie keeps her 
distance.)</i>
<p>DEAN: Hi, Jodie. <i>(pause)</i> Do you want to talk? About...
<p>JODIE: <i>(miserable)</i> No.
<p>DEAN: Okay, that's fine. <i>(She turns and goes in the opposite direction,
he keeps walking with her, not trying to close or open the gap. A long
silence.)</i> Jodie?
<p>JODIE: <i>(sharp)</i> What?
<p>DEAN: About the dance. Look, my date kinda flaked out on me, you probably
heard, and it's still compulsory because Li needs the funding to cover
the GWI, and we both know how much sympathy she has for cases like yours
-- none at all. I can understand you not wanting to go with anyone after
what happened yesterday, but if you need a ride or anything, I can...
<p>VOICE: <i>(O/S)</i> I don't think that'll be necessary, Dean.
<p><i>(Jodie looks over Dean's shoulder and her expression clearly says
she can't believe what she's seeing. In the background, a familiar 
modified-for-a-wheelchair
red convertible speeds off down the road. In the foreground, Mack stands
with a warm smile on his face, looking rather like Blade with the 
sunglasses.)</i>
<p><i>(Cut to: Lawndale High hallway, Jodie and Mack are walking to class
arm in arm, chatting idly. Well, idly for "Dawson's Creek" characters anyway...
*shudder*)</i>
<p>JODIE: So you'll be okay as long as you keep the sunglasses on?
<p>MACK: Apparently. I hope I don't have to find out.
<p>JODIE: And... you're okay about... Kevin.
<p>MACK: <i>(sighs)</i> No, I'm not. <i>(resolved)</i> But there's nothing
I can do about it now. There was nothing I could do about it then. So there's
no point.
<p><i>(Jodie nods, understanding. She briefly looks suspicious... but shakes
it off.)</i>
<p>MACK: So, Jodie... that woman I mentioned...
<p>JODIE: <i>(<b>now</b> she looks suspicious)</i> What about her?
<p>MACK: She wants to see us all. This weekend.
<p><i>(A pause. They turn a corner at a T-junction, passing a large noticeboard
in the hallway. On it is a huge poster decorated with something vaguely
resembling the T1000, announcing YOU'RE BACK! -- LAWNDALE NOT QUITE HALLOWEEN
DANCE THIS FRIDAY -- SHOW YOUR SCHOOL SPIRIT BY COMING ALONG! -- ATTENDANCE
IS MANDATORY and on a small sticker underneath, the message "Mixed-genetic
couples are asked not to attend.")</i>
<p>MACK: <i>(eyeing the poster)</i> Say, Jodie, what are we going to do
about...
<p>JODIE: ... the dance? <i>(sighs)</i> I don't know, Mack. <i>(pause,
the faintest of smirks)</i> I guess we'll just come in dateless and "hook
up on the night"...
<p><i>(Thunder rolls and the waters of the Lawndale sewers part as Ms Li
comes steamrolling down around the hall around the far corner towards Jodie
and Mack, with Dean right behind her. Mack and Jodie take one look and
walk off -- one turns left, the other right. Ms Li hurries to catch up
with them, and trips up after a few steps. Hmmm...)</i>
<p><i>(Cut to: Ms Li's office, later on. The Princess of Paranoia sits
calmly and patiently at her desk with an unfamiliar man of about Ian McKellen's
age in a suit, waiting for someone. A knock on the door indicates that
that someone has arrived.)</i>
<p>LI: Come in!
<p><i>(Mack enters, bag on his back. He sits in front of the desk, putting
his bag down beside the chair.)</i>
<p>LI: Ah, Mack. Thank you for coming. <i>(She and the man eye his sunglasses,
but neither says anything.)</i>
<p>MACK: <i>(suspicious -- Ms Li? Nice?)</i> Hi, Ms Li. <i>(pause)</i>
Who's this?
<p>LI: Paul Hanson. He's--
<p>HANSON: <i>(cutting her off)</i> A... partly-retired senatorial aide.
I also do work in my spare time, such as it is, for One Humanity -- you've
heard of them?
<p>MACK: <i>(nods, not happy)</i> Yeah. The anti-mutant group, right?
<p>HANSON: Oh, no, no. We support the rights of <b>all</b> humanity. <i>(Mack
cocks an eyebrow, very Dariaesque)</i> And are vehemently against special
privileges for any of it. We <i>(pause)</i> also support the right of parents
to <b>choose</b> what's best for their children. <i>(And the audience joins
Mack in a collective "I knew it" expression.)</i>
<p>MACK: So I guess your organization supports the GWI.
<p>HANSON: Yes. So you can understand our concern that one of the school's
top students, and the captain of its senior football team, has been accused
of being an... undiagnosed mutant.
<p>MACK: Do you consider mutation a crime, Mr Hanson?
<p>HANSON: Of course not! It's a perfectly--
<p>MACK: Then how can someone be accused of it?
<p><i>(a pause)</i>
<p>LI: <i>(different tack)</i> Mack, someone died in the auditorium yesterday.
<p>MACK: <i>(curt)</i> I know that.
<p>LI: He died because someone couldn't control his mutation, Mack. If
our students are going to be in that kind of mortal danger all the time,
we need to know exactly what is happening. A bill including the compulsory
genetic testing of all suspected mutants is being put through Congress
as we speak, but I'm sure the Michael Mackenzie I know would be happy to
voluntarily submit to such a test in the name of school spirit.
<p>MACK: <i>(sighs, nothing to lose)</i> There's no need, Ms Li. The tests
have already been done. <i>(opens his bag, removing a manila folder full
of typically scientific-looking papers, and places it in front of Li)</i>
You should find everything you need to see me back in class and the team
here.
<p>LI: <i>(reading the first paper)</i> It says here the test was positive,
manifested by <i>(pause, quoting)</i> "a ray of concentrated visible and
infra-red energy, emitted from the eyes at all times unless the eyes are
closed or covered by lenses of ruby quartz," whatever the hell that is.
"The ray, blocked or otherwise, does not affect his normal vision." Look
me in the eye and take off your sunglasses, Mack.
<p>MACK: <i>(quietly angry)</i> Read that over again a couple of times,
Ms Li, you seem to have missed a hell of a lot. These glasses won't come
off that easily. <i>(pause)</i> And do you really want to lose the "potential
Rhodes scholar" you were talking to Ms Barch about a month ago? <i>(he
gets up and leaves)</i>
<p><i>(Li and Hanson look at each other)</i>
<p>HANSON: <i>(frowns)</i> Well, if <i>that's</i> the way he's going to
play it...
<p>LI: <i>(smiles... the "evilly" part is kind of redundant, really, isn't
it?)</i> There's more than one way to put a mutie in its place. <i>(flicks
a switch on the intercom, speaks)</i> Would Jodie Landon please report
to the principal's office immediately.
<p>HANSON: His girlfriend, I take it? <i>(takes the folder, starts flipping
through)</i>
<p>LI: Ohhh, yes. They've been together for several years, and--
<p><i>(Hanson curses under his breath)</i>
<p>LI: <i>(raised eyebrow)</i> Is there a problem?
<p>HANSON: Well, yes. These tests were done at the Lawndale Egalitas 
Laboratories,
by one Dr Amy C. Barksdale.
<p>LI: And that's a bad thing?
<p>HANSON: Maybe, maybe not. Doctor Barksdale is... probably one of the
the world's most respected spokespeople on mutant issues. Pro-mutant, you
understand. Made a small fortune out of writing satire and social commentary
in her twenties, and somewhere down the line it turned into a large one,
no-one's quite sure how. She spends the money on mutant research and education,
mostly. Not one much for the public eye, but when she does say something,
it gets heard.
<p>LI: <i>(worried)</i> So why on earth would she be in Lawndale?
<p>HANSON: No idea. Maybe she just has relatives in the area... or maybe
there's something a little bigger about to happen here.
<p>LI: <i>(changing subjects with a large, heavy, blunt object)</i> Well,
never mind, we should be fine for now at least. Jodie'll be here soon,
she's an intelligent girl, and I'd be very surprised if she didn't listen
to reason...
<p><i>(fast cut to Jodie in the hot seat)</i>
<p>JODIE: No.
<p>LI: <i>(firm)</i> You must understand, Ms Landon, that with the recent
increase in street crime we cannot have the vice-president of the student
council coming to and leaving a school dance, at night, alone.
<p>JODIE: <i>(calm)</i> I'm not coming alone. Mack and I have had arrangements
for a while now to share a ride, and we can't abandon them now.
<p>LI: <i>(faux-sympathetic)</i> We're worried about you, Jodie. We can't
take the risk... someone has already died as a result of Mack's lack of
control of his own abilities--
<p>JODIE: I know that, Ms Li. They're under control. They're going to stay
under control.
<p>LI: <i>(trying to cover her resignation)</i> You are aware of the 
regulations
on mixed-genetic couples at the dance?
<p>JODIE: Yes, Ms Li. I guess we'll just have to come in all alone and
lock eyes across the dancefloor... you know how it is. <i>(smirks, gets
up and leaves)</i>
<p><i>(Li puts her head in her hands for a second, then looks up again
with the same smirk as Jodie...)</i>
<p>LI: <i>(&agrave; la "Arts &amp; Crass")</i> Call her parents.
<p>HANSON: I'm sorry?
<p>LI: Never mind. <i>(picks up the phone, dials)</i> Hello, this is Principal
Li at LHS, may I please speak to Andrew Landon? It's about his daughter...
<p><i>(Cut to: Daria's locker, after school. She's shoving some books into
her bag, talking to the waiting, ready-to-go Jodie, Jane and Mack.)</i>
<p>DARIA: So, this telepath that gave you the glasses wants to see us on
the weekend. <i>(Mack nods)</i> Jane, your parents don't care and may well
be dead for all we know, Mack's aren't going to get back until Monday even
if they do manage to get seats on the next flight... <i>(she hauls her
backpack out of her locker and shoulders it on)</i> Jodie can tell hers
it's another extracurricular... <i>(slamming the locker shut and locking
it)</i> ... and that just leaves me. Any bright ideas for excuses to keep
Hell's guard dogs, occasionally known as my parents, down? Preferably 
believable
ones? <i>(pause)</i> And who are we going to see, anyway? <i>(they start
to leave)</i>
<p>MACK: Her name's Barksdale. Amy Charlotte.
<p>DARIA: <i>(do I really need to tell you how deadpan she is?)</i> Oh,
that's all right then. I can just tell them I'm going to see my aunt.
<p>JODIE/JANE: <i>(simultaneously)</i> Your aunt?/That Amy?
<p>DARIA: My aunt. <b>That</b> Amy. And then I'll ask her what the hell
she's doing in town without even trying to tell me. <i>(pause)</i> Or torture
my parents.
<p>JODIE: I thought you hated your relatives, Daria.
<p>JANE: Ah, the exception proves the rule.
<p>DARIA: She's the only one I have I can respect. Or was when I last saw
her... about a year and a half ago. Made my cousin's wedding tolerable,
hard as that is to believe... <i>(fade out)</i>
<p><i>(Fade in to the group leaving through a side door, still talking.)</i>
<p>MACK: ...and I think that's the first time I've seen anyone serve cheese
fries for breakfast.
<p>JANE: Hey, you should see the stuff <b>I</b> eat in the morning.
<p>DARIA: No, you shouldn't.
<p>JODIE: That bad? Because...
<p>ANDREW LANDON: <i>(O/S)</i> Jodie! What the <b>hell</b> is this I'm
hearing about your going to the dance with a mutant?
<p><i>(On hearing this, Jodie strides the short distance to her car, opens
the door, gestures for Mack to get in, and drives off.)</i>

<p><i>(Classical music. Nature imagery. Upbeat messages on screen along
the lines of "the power to connect". A phone company. *snore*.)</i>
<p><b>ACT THREE</b>
<p><i>(SCENE: Daria's room. The phone rings. Daria, in the famous "something
(possibly the question of how exactly Jodie and Mack are going to handle
her parents) eating at your soul" pose, hauls herself upright and picks
up the phone. Usual diagonal 'phone split screen. Avert your eyes, 'shipper
purists -- it's Tom on the other end.)</i>
<p>DARIA: Amy?
<p>TOM: No, it's Tom. I don't know who Amy is, unless you're talking about
my old French teacher. <i>(pause)</i> Daria, do you have something you
want to tell me?
<p>DARIA: <i>(deadpan, uneasy)</i> Yes. I know all about you and the Mob,
the cops are on their way.
<p>TOM: <i>(chuckle, deadpan)</i> Oh, <b>those</b> cops? Made it here five
minutes ago. Gave 'em a little something from the petty cash box and sent
them on their way. Assuming I don't have to kill you for knowing too much,
are we still on for that dance tomorrow night?
<p>DARIA: Yes, if Ms Li doesn't let the power get even more to her head
and decide to ban all couples from it instead of just the mixed-genetic
ones...
<p>TOM: Yeah, I heard about that. As long as they're not taking blood tests
at the door, we're fine.
<p>DARIA: Excuse me?
<p>TOM: Oh, didn't I mention it? Apparently, I'm a "benign" mutant. Meaning
I tested positive as a kid to that X-factor gene or whatever it is... but
it hasn't shown up as anything obvious yet. So I'm as screwed as the rest
of them if the Federal Mutant Act passes, and I can't even shoot funky
green acid out of my arms to make up for it.
<p>DARIA: Ah, your parents are rich. You'll be fine. Just don't wear 
sunglasses.
<p>TOM: Excuse me?
<p>DARIA: Long story. You'll see on the night. <i>(sighs)</i> Remind me
again why we're doing this.
<p>TOM: Friendship? Love? Because your principal needs the money and is
making you go, so you may as well drag someone down with you? Because you
want to show me off? Because it's an essential part of the aliens' plans
to have you seduce me at the Hallowe'en dance -- not that we're even that
close to Hallowe'en -- and impregnate me?
<p>DARIA: Funny, I could have sworn it was the other way around. See you
tomorrow. <i>(pause)</i> And come dressed as anything from Rocky Horror
and I gut you in public.
<p>TOM: Damn, and I put so much work into that Columbia costume. <i>(long
pause)</i> Um, about Jane?
<p>DARIA: She has to come, but she swears she's okay with it. Don't
worry, you'll know if you've pissed her off when you get struck by lightning
in the middle of the auditorium.
<p>TOM: I take it the guy she's going with will be wearing a lot of rubber
then? <i>(pause)</i> That didn't sound right.
<p>DARIA: <i>(definite smirk)</i> No, it didn't. <i>(smirk fades, sigh)</i>
And I don't think she's coming with anybody.
<p>TOM: Oh.
<p><i>(long pause)</i>
<p>DARIA: So, um... see ya.
<p>TOM: See ya.
<p><i>(they hang up)</i>
<p><i>(Cut to: Landon residence. Jodie's car comes round the front driveway
and parks. She gets out, finding her father waiting.)</i>
<p>ANDREW: Just tell me how it happened.
<p>JODIE: What?
<p>ANDREW: You <b>know</b> what! The dance! The boy!
<p>JODIE: <i>(sighs)</i> I don't know what, Dad. And I'm going with Mack.
<p>ANDREW: Mack?
<p>JODIE: <i>(level)</i> Michael Jordan Mackenzie.
<p>ANDREW: Oh. <i>(pause)</i> Sorry. <i>(caught off guard, turns and goes
inside)</i>
<p><i>(Jodie just stares at the door, incredulous, then shrugs and steps
in.)</i>
<p><i>(Cut to: Andrew's home office. Again. He's on the phone. Again.)</i>
<p>ANDREW: Hello? LHS? Yes, I'd like you to take down a message for Ms
Li. I don't know <b>what</b> problem she has with my daughter or Mr Mackenzie,
but she can stop annoying me about it. If she makes that kind of 
accusation  again, she'll be seeing me in court, and she knows I've
already paid Reinhardt more than she ever could.
<p><i>(Cut to: Jodie's room. The computer is off. Jodie is leaning back
across the room, talking on the phone, as in the earlier scene.)</i>
<p>JODIE: And just when I thought I had my parents figured out, they pull
this on me. But it looks like we're still going. Now, what are we going
<b>as</b>?
Robin Hood won't work with sunglasses.
<p>MACK: Dunno. Blues Brothers?
<p>JODIE: I think half our year's doing that. They're still hung up on
Men In Black.
<p>MACK: The Matrix?
<p>JODIE: No way. One thing I <b>have</b> got figured out about my parents,
they'll never let me out of the house in that much black. Hell, <b>I</b>
wouldn't let me out of the house in that much black.
<p>MACK: <i>(pause)</i> Amy gave me a hell of a lot of that quartz stuff.
Anything with a mask over the eyes could work.
<p>JODIE: <i>(mildly sarcastic, mild compared to Daria anyway)</i> Robocop?
<p>MACK: Could work. Erving--
<p>JODIE: Your older brother?
<p>MACK: Yeah. He had this crappy plastic costume he wore to this dance
in his junior year. It'll probably fit me now. Just a matter of finding
it -- I think the visor's removable, or at least movable -- and figuring
out a way of adding the quartz.
<p>JODIE: And finding a valid excuse for Maid Marian to be going out with
a police officer.
<p>MACK: <i>(pause, chuckling)</i> We've been hanging around Daria too
much.
<p><i>(SCENE: Lawndale High school dance. There are pieces of very tacky
Hollywood-Halloween decor strewn sparsely across the auditorium, pumpkins,
green witch's faces, black and orange streamers and balloons, you
get the idea, but no-one's really put an effort in. Chaperones and security
guards everywhere, of course. A DJ is present, not Upchuck this time, he's
in the audience, thank God. Said DJ is playing some horrible Britney Spears
song (I almost said tune, but...) who really cares which? The one with
"she's a star" in the chorus. Okay, away from that unpleasant topic, let's
check out the dancegoers: the cheerleader seen slapping Upchuck in "The
Daria Database" (does anyone really care what her name is, if any?) is
here with some random footballer, dressed as Romeo and Juliet, surprise
surprise. More unrecognisable students -- we see a Superman and Lois Lane,
a disturbing amount of Harry Potter witches among the year nines, someone
dressed as Marilyn Monroe (the [in]famous billowing white dress), someone
dressed as Marilyn Manson (blue makeup around the eyes and a weird-coloured
suit, thankfully not <b>that</b> stage outfit), and Quinn, in some kind
of lavender fairy outfit with matching wings, antennae and Doc Martens.
The three J's, dressed in "cute" formal servant outfits, are following
her as if on leashes, as per usual. About half the people are just in formal
wear, not bothering with costumes. And there's not a Man in Black in 
sight.)</i>
<p><i>(Cut to: some kind of fairly large back room close, but not too close,
to the auditorium. A boombox has been set up near the windows and opposite
the main doors, there are pieces of not-at-all-tacky Hallowe'en/Samhain
decor strewn sparsely across the room, and someone has scrawled "LAWNDALE
HIGH HALL OF SANITY" in letters as large as possible across the blackboard.
Given the song playing on said boombox -- "The Shape of Punk To Come" by
Refused -- it would appear to be true, at least compared to the alternative.
The classroom is reasonably packed, but the only face with a name to it
is Andrea (slate-grey jacket, buttoned up, we can't see what's underneath
beyond the top of her usual shirt), who shares the area with a handful
of LHS victims whose costumes have made them anonymous and extras, and
including the one with brown hair and narrow glasses occasionally referred
to as Lynn Cullen for the resemblance to the fanfic character. A small
moshpit has been set up. Moshing to a recording in formal wear -- only
in Lawndale. And the ARIA Awards. We can see the street from the window,
and in this case a pale grey limousine driving up towards the school car
park.)</i>
<p><i>(Cut to: LHS auditorium, outside. The grey limo pulls up and Jodie
and Mack get out. Mack is actually dressed as a very fake-looking Robocop,
the costume fitting him a little tightly. Jodie is wearing the Maid Marian
costume. They walk inside and up almost to the ticket desk in the anteroom
holding hands, then break apart, Mack going ahead.)</i>
<p>MACK: <i>(dropping something big and colourful with an obvious security
strip on it onto the table in front of a dazed Ms Li -- it looks more like
a ticket to a major rock festival than a school dance)</i> Michael Jordan
Mackenzie.
<p><i>(He walks through, stands near the door to the main auditorium, and
waits. Jodie goes forward.)</i>
<p>JODIE: <i>(handing over her ticket)</i> Jodie Landon.
<p><i>(She walks to the auditorium door, bows to Mack, takes his hand,
and they walk in, getting closer together with every step.)</i>
<p>MS LI: <i>(finally waking up)</i> Six inches!
<p>DARIA: <i>(from behind)</i> Excuse me?
<p>LI: <i>(looking behind her, she sees Daria and Tom. Tom is in a regulation
James Bond suit and tie, fake concealed weapons easily visible. Daria looks
like a modern-day version of Hela, the Norse goddess of death, no doubt
Jane had a hand in this -- top half is a formal navy-blue gown, bottom
half is rags over pants of the exact colour and apparent texture of a 
three-days-dead corpse.)</i> Oh! Uh... Miz Morgendorffer!
<p>DARIA: <i>(condescending)</i> That's right, Ms Li. And this is Tom Sloane.
<p>LI: Tom Sloane? Son of Angier? <i>(to Daria's nod, muttering just a
little too loudly for her own good)</i> Glad to she she's got better taste
in men than that Lane tramp. <i>(aloud)</i> I don't suppose he could be
persuaded to maybe share some of his wealth and wisdom with the Lawndale
public school system?
<p>TOM: He normally takes that kind of request through his secretary.
<p><i>(While Ms Li seethes, Daria takes Tom's ticket and drops it with
hers onto the table.)</i>
<p>DARIA: I've paid the entry fee, dressed up like an idiot as you asked,
and got a rich kid along to see just how bad LHS is so maybe he'll still
make a donation out of sheer pity. Can we get out of here early? Now, for
instance?
<p>LI: <i>(choosing to ignore the snipes)</i> No, no-one is permitted to
leave befoooorre midnight. For security reasons. Enjoy the dance! <i>(hurries
them through the auditorium door, then gets back behind the desk with a
sigh of relief)</i>
<p>TOM: <i>(V/O, from inside)</i> So what do you think she meant with that
taste in men comment?
<p>DARIA: <i>(V/O, ditto)</i> No idea, I thought she was coming dateless.
<p>TOM: <i>(V/O)</i> Well, there she is. Dancing with a guy. Why don't
you go and ask her?
<p><i>(a pause)</i>
<p>DARIA: <i>(V/O)</i> No. No way. I don't know, I don't want to know.
It's her business and nobody else's.
<p><i>(Cut to: The auditorium. Miss Spears plays on, and Jane, dressed
like Spike from Buffy the Vampire Slayer -- in other words, her usual gear
with black jeans instead of shorts and a floor-length black duster, though
she's forsaken Spike's Billy Idol dye-job, I wonder why -- is dancing nice
and close. To Jesse "Morono" Moreno. And Daria's staring at them as if
they were a car accident. Say, maybe <b>that's</b> why Jesse's so out-and-out
<b>stupid</b>...)</i>
<p><i>(Cut to: The auditorium, an hour or so later on. The DJ is still
behind the decks, but is currently silenced by a band. Not the BSB clone
you'd expect with Ms Li in charge, this is a "real" band, a four-piece
with guitars and a drummer and everything... never mind that they look
like they'd lose in a fight with Hanson *shudder*, are wearing very fromageux
Sgt.-Pepper-type outfits, and are near the end of covering and conclusively
proving very wrong the title of Radiohead's "Anyone Can Play Guitar". To
be fair, they can't sing or play drums or bass either. What? Yes, they
<b>are</b>
worse than Mystik Spiral -- at least that lot only murder their own material.
One last "... and they won't be a nothing anymore" and they get off stage,
leaving only a few security guards standing right at the back where nobody
can see 'em. Dean McBale replaces the singer at the microphone.)</i>
<p>DEAN: <i>(attempting to do showmanship, works about as well as the idea
of a sex scandal involving John Howard)</i> Goooood evening, Lawndale,
and welcome to the twelfth annual Not Quite Hallowe'en Dance! <i>(pauses
for applause. Of course there isn't any.)</i> Another night of good food,
good music, and <b>bad</b> dancing! <i>(fast)</i> Please observe the six-inch
rule at all times. To prevent lawsuits from parents who don't trust their
own offspring, no student will be permitted to leave before the prom finishes
at midnight and all students must be home before twelve-thirty. <i>(pause)</i>
Now, let's get down and boog-<b>ay</b>!
<p><i>(The DJ starts "The Rockafeller Skank" by Fatboy Slim -- make it
the live version with the riff from "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" in
it -- and the crowd starts dancing, or at any rate attempting to. At the
back of stage, there's a sickening crunch. Something springs upward from
the squashed-flat corpse of one of the security guards.)</i>
<p><i>(Cut to: The Hall of Sanity. The stereo is screaming out Radiohead's
"Idioteque" (yes, I'm a fan of the band) and the former moshers are working
out some dance moves to it. Well, some are still trying to mosh. The less
said, the better, really. Daria and Tom are wallflowering near the door,
watching the moshers with some amusement. Said amusement disappears when
Jane gets thrown out of the pack and into the wall, near OH.)</i>
<p>DARIA: <i>(shooing Tom off with her hand)</i> Jane, I'm sure there's
a perfectly good reason you're here with Jesse, and I'm going to wait here
patiently until I find out exactly how many times you got hit on the head.
<p><i>(Tom, thrown in both senses of the term, stumbles towards the door,
looks out, and his eyes go wide. He moves away from the door and gestures
that maybe Jane and Daria should too. The reason? All good things must
come to an end, all parties must end with a bust, and all clich&eacute;s
must be fulfilled, so to that end, Ms Morris storms in, reaching
over to grab one of the less athletic students. On the other side of the
room. Think "Stretch Armstrong".)</i>
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%"><i><font color="#000033">The Hall of Sanity is the only
reason I keep mine at money-making bullshit like this. It's been going
on for a few years, since Ms Li cut the drama budget and they stopped using
the room. Either Security Queen still doesn't know about it, or just prefers
to deny it. No-one really cares either way.</font></i>
<p><i><font color="#000033">Someone's slipped the last Radiohead CD on
and people are trying to dance without stopping the mosh, the morons, so
I force my way out. And then the kid next to me gets scooped up from twenty
or so feet by Ms Morris. If this was a comic book, I'd be looking for a
phone booth right about now. As it is, I lay low. She stretches out around
behind us and starts pushing everyone in the room first into each other
and then towards the doors. I can see Daria Morgendorffer's boyfriend looped
up in one arm, and that Jane Lane (what were parents on when they named
her?) chick turn around and shout at the bitch. Oops. Her hands busy, Morris
just sneers and sticks her neck out towards Jane, a sadistic grin on her
face.</font></i>
<p><i><font color="#000033">A lightning bolt smashes the corner window
and strikes Ms Morris across the shoulders. She snaps back to her normal
shape, unconscious and possibly dead, but nobody's about to check. They're
all too busy running for the doors, from the freezing rain and wind and
from Ms Morris as if she could still do something. All except for Jane
-- she's looking back, with the biggest, smuggest smirk on her face anyone's
ever seen, and her eyes glowing solid white. Then the rain stops abruptly,
her eyes snap back to blue and she calmly walks out.</font></i>
<p><i><font color="#000033">I follow. Get halfway to the main auditorium
-- that damn Radiohead song's still playing, but the Fatboy Slim isn't
-- and something picks me up from behind. I have exactly enough time to
shout "RUN!" before getting thrown into the wall.</font></i>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><b><i>(Montage -- Music: "Idioteque" continues)</i></b>
<p><i>(Main auditorium. The bulk of the people who were in the Hall of
Sanity throw the back door open... and see Upchuck and O'Neill wreaking
general havoc. Upchuck is leaping around, playing Spiderman with his tongue
and crushing people at random. O'Neill is standing on stage directing 
proceedings
and blocking the doors with any scrap metal he can get his mind around.
We see Daria and Tom, running close to the walls, get pinned to one by
what looks like it may once have been a window frame.)</i>
<p><i>(Hallway, behind the auditorium. "Wolverine" has made a hell of a
dent in the wall, though his/her wounds are healing, and we see DeMartino,
in full sabretooth mode, striding his way back to take advantage.)</i>
<p><i>(Amy Barksdale, sitting on a platform in the centre of a huge, cubic
room with what looks like a cheap VR headset on. Suddenly, she throws it
off and rolls out.)</i>
<p><i>(Main auditorium. Jane rushes in a side door ready to shout for help
and sees that there really isn't much point. Anyone who hasn't been pinned
to the walls by O'Neill or squashed flat by Upchuck is milling around the
blocked-off front doors. Mass panic.)</i>
<p><i>(Mack, leaning out from under a table, fiddling with his helmet and
trying to get a clear shot at O'Neill. He gets one. He flicks a switch
on the helmet. The blast paints the auditorium red and blows a hole in
the far ceiling. O'Neill ducks in time.)</i>
<p><i>(Amy's convertible, going down a street at speeds only dreamt of
by revenue-raising traffic cops.)</i>
<p><i>(DeMartino and "Wolverine". The latter is still lying apparently
unconscious by the wall. DeMartino lifts a clawed arm to strike... and
"Wolverine" rolls, taking a swipe at DeMartino's leg on the way. Letting
out a roar, DeM limps slightly after him/her.)</i>
<p><i>(O'Neill pulling himself up again and floating the microphone into
his hand. He speaks.)</i>
<p>O'NEILL: Now Mack, I understand your anger, but that's really not the
best way to handle it. You should really get some counselling, get help.
<p><i>(Jane clenches her fists, her eyes getting brighter)</i>
<p><i>(a baseball-sized hailstone flies past O'Neill's cheek)</i>
<p><i>(Jodie running over to Mack, looking worried as hell. Upchuck lands
nearby and spits on her, the velocity knocking her to the ground. Mack
and Upchuck start going at it with fists. The latter is a decent fighter
given his height/weight disadvantage, any problems from what looks like
The Man With The Golden Gun school of martial arts being more than compensated
for by his whiplash tongue and raw eagerness. Finally Mack gets a lucky
cross in and Upchuck is off for long enough for him to check on Jodie --
she's fine. Then Upchuck's tongue is around his leg.)</i>
<p><i>(Door between auditorium and back hallway -- some moron's managed
to get it shut, and it gets ripped off its hinges by the flying body of
"Wolverine". He/she picks him/herself back up, and rushes back forward
into the fray.)</i>
<p><i>(O'Neill, getting down off stage to where Daria and Tom are, stopping
near the Mack/Upchuck fight. The occasional hailstone, varying in size
from ping-pong ball to Slim Dusty CD box set. Then one of the smaller ones
hits Mack in the head -- Jane cringes and stops the rain -- giving Upchuck
time to leap up to crush Mack like he did the security guards. He gets
up to the rafters and nods to O'Neill. Daria and Tom look on in horror.)</i>
<p><i>(Amy's convertible pulling into the LHS parking lot -- Anyone that
could escape has and it's surprisingly empty. Squad cars follow.)</i>
<p><i>(DeMartino's leg, now almost completely healed, swinging back around
towards "Wolverine"'s. One set of Wolverine's claws striking down to DeM's
arm, almost cutting it off. The second set follows, raking out fairly deep
wounds across half of his chest. He collapses, having trouble breathing.)</i>
<p><i>(Upchuck, springing down, tongue rolled out for show. Zoom down with
the camera closer and closer to Mack's semi-conscious but terrified face
-- and freeze it at about two metres above.)</i>
<p><i>(Jodie, having been rolled out of the way, one leg pinned to the
ground by Upchuck's spit, concentrating <b>hard</b> on something.)</i>
<p><i>(Upchuck, suspended neatly above Mack, his tongue looped onto his
back. He's slowly floating down and away from his intended crush victim...
until he suddenly hits the floor nearby. Jodie is utterly exhausted, almost
ready to pass out.)</i>
<p><i>(Upchuck, going up for a second shot at Mack, flying down...)</i>
<p><i>(... and Mack gets shoved out of the drop zone by one of "Wolverine"'s
feet. Upchuck lands heavily, but gets back to his feet and faces off with
Wolverine. He spits. It gets caught around one of the sets of claws...
and smashed to a pale chlorine-gas-coloured fog by the other set coming
in between at speed.)</i>
<p><i>(DeMartino, getting up and ready to have another shot at 
"Wolverine".)</i>
<p><i>(Mack, getting up and having a shot at DeMartino. The blast adds
to the gore, knocks him out and blows him into the milling students, who
either go down like bowling pins or explode out in a terrified mass around
him.)</i>
<p><i>("Wolverine" and Upchuck fighting. The former uses his/her claws
to full effect, keeping Upchuck on the back foot with forceful, regular
swings. Upchuck jumps up and over, and lashes out with his tongue -- a
miss.)</i>
<p><i>(A space has been cleared around DeMartino ... he slowly pulls himself
up, and trudges toward the fight, bleeding and a little unsteady ... and
hits the floor again, unconscious, with a <b>THUMP</b>, shaking the 
ground.)</i>
<p><i>(Jane sees Jodie half-conscious and rushes over to help. Upchuck
falls in front of her on the thump, Jane runs up and takes a long jump,
using him as the board. He springs up, looking angrily at Jane, and then
snaps round to duck another swipe from "Wolverine".)</i>
<p><i>(Upchuck ducks and weaves more of the claws, then slips out his tongue
and loops it around "Wolverine"'s leg, jerking her up and down a few times
until she's knocked out and possibly dead. He turns and sees Jane leaning
over Jodie, and leaps up to the rafters... Daria and Tom shout out a warning.
Jane looks up and sees Upchuck grinning down at her, ready to strike. Music
stops.)</i>
<p>JANE: (smirking) You know what happens when a slimy little bastard like
you gets struck by lightning?
<p><i>(Upchuck can't hear her, and gets ready to jump...)</i>
<p><i>(f/x: <b>CRASH</b>!)</i>
<p><i>(Jane rolls Jodie away with her as a burnt, steaming and wounded
Upchuck, bleeding some putrid green substance, hits the floor where they
were, followed by a few pieces of roofing.)</i>
<p>JANE: <i>(surprised, impressed)</i> Wow.
<p><i>(O'Neill, looks around, resigned and tired. He hears the ceiling
crack -- it's not stable. He shakes his head, and dashes over to DeMartino,
helping him up. Neither is in much condition to fight. A nod of the head
from the Marshmallow of Magnetism, and the metal falls away from the doors,
unblocking them.)</i>
<p><i>(Cut to: Outside the auditorium. Music: "Teenage Angst", Placebo.
The students who were milling around in panic near the doors earlier are
now milling around in shock around the assorted emergency-service vehicles.
We see Mack and Jodie are getting loaded into ambulances. Jane watches
it all, expressionless. Ms Li is shouting at a police officer. Tom and
Daria are giving another one a statement, and a third is trying in vain
to get a comprehensible one from Jesse. Amy looks around, giving a nod
to an ambulance officer as they load "Wolverine" into a stretcher. She
wheels herself to the side of the building and sees O'Neill and DeMartino
carrying the unconscious forms of Upchuck and Ms Morris respectively out
the back with them, in the direction of one of the other school buildings.
She looks... thoughtful is the best word to describe it.)</i>
<p><i>(Cut to: Daria and Tom, getting into the newer rustbucket he got
in IIFY. Music continues. Both look tired, but fairly happy considering.)</i>
<p>TOM: And here I was thinking tonight would be boring. <i>(shuts his
door, pulls on a seat belt)</i>
<p>DARIA: If it were a TV series, it would be. <i>(shuts her door)</i>
This is pretty tame, nobody died. As far as we know. <i>(seat belt)</i>
And the whole mutants-on-the-rampage thing's getting kinda old now.
<p>TOM: <i>(starting the car)</i> And kinda illegal.
<p>DARIA: Depends on how the Supreme Court sees it. <i>(yawns)</i>
<p>TOM: True. <i>(pulls out of the car park)</i> What time are your parents
expecting you?
<p>DARIA: They're asleep, Tom. Dad told me to come back whenever I wanted.
I think they're so glad I'm finally reaching out to someone that they don't
really care how <b>much</b> I reach out.
<p><i>(long pause, the car turns a corner)</i>
<p>TOM: But after everything that just happened... I'm exhausted. Let's
just get back to our houses and crash, okay?
<p>DARIA: Please.
<p><i>(Another long pause, Tom pulls the car over, shuts it off and in
crudest terms, they leap into each other's arms and start trading saliva.
Tom's jacket comes off, followed quickly by her jacket and his shirt. He
reaches under her top... and they freeze in place, blood vessels becoming
visible on the exposed skin. Daria pulls herself off of him in desperation,
the vessels disappearing, and sees that he's fallen unconscious.)</i>
<p>DARIA: Oh, Jesus... <b>Tom</b>...
<p><i>(She finds his jacket and pulls out a mobile phone, bludgeoning in
9-1-1.)</i>
<p>DARIA: <i>(into phone)</i> Hello? Yes, something's... he's unconscious...
my boyfriend... I don't know... (cranes her neck to read a street sign)

Miss Friedman still swears blind she's not a sex fiend, and we <i>all</i>
believe her... OK, you're right, this is getting kinda old. Last time,
I promise. Be aware I'm not great at keeping promises, unfortunately.
<p><i><b>DARIA: And the ability to pull a Matilda at a hundred feet is
in no way a comic-book super power. :</b> Matilda</i>? Roald Dahl? Ah,
go read a book. <b><i>And as much as I'd like to see LHS turn into the
ending of </i>Carrie... :</b> Book by Steven King, or more specifically
the movie made out of it. Similar ref found in J Osako's fic <i>Blood &amp;
Irony</i>.
<p><b><i>DARIA: Since when do you care about the maintenance of school
buildings? : </i></b>Thanks to medea42 for pointing this out and inadvertently
suggesting an excuse...
<p><b><i>JANE: ...I've got a 20'-square canvas in there I haven't finished...
: </i></b>...and to Lew Richardson, whose epic fic <i>Heroes...</i> added
a little more colour to said excuse.
<p><b><i>JEFFY: Yeah! Go Lions!</i></b> "Tribute" to Kevin's poetry reading
in Milo Minderbinder's <i>A Bouquet for the Brain.</i>
<p><b><i>LI: And now, I welcome the president of Lawndale High Student
Council, Dean Bradfield McBale... :</i></b> The name and basic idea for
Dean McBale borrowed from Kara Wild's classic <i>Outvoted.</i> Middle name
is mine (couldn't resist the MSP refcrime), as is the added character 
development.
You'll probably be seeing more of this guy.
<p><b><i>One of his teammates... has a red NY Yankees cap on backwards,
let's call him... Fred, say... : </i></b>Talkin' 'bout my generation...
don't we <i>suck?</i>
<p><b><i>... Amy Charlotte Barksdale reveals herself from the driver's
side in a wheelchair... :</i></b> "Charlotte" is a nod to Professor Charles
Xavier, from the comic book and movie I'm ripping off here, as is the 
wheelchair.
<p><b><i>LI: Paul Hanson. He's-- / HANSON: A... partly-retired senatorial
aide. I also do work ... for One Humanity -- you've heard of them? : </i></b>If
you don't get this, be thankful. If you do, be thankful it's all over.
<p><b><i>MACK: Do you consider mutation a crime, Mr Hanson? / HANSON: Of
course not! / MACK: Then how can someone be accused of it? : </i></b>Dialogue
bearing a hell of a resemblance to a passage in Yui Daoren's <i>Out On
Vacation.</i> Credit where credit's due, his idea first.
<p><b><i>MACK: ... the "potential Rhodes scholar" you were talking to Ms
Barch about a month ago? : </i></b>Another piece of "inspiration" from
another fic, this one being Michelle Klein-H&agrave;ss's <i>Clothes 
Make The Manson.</i>
<p><b><i>LI: (changing subjects with a large, heavy, blunt object) :
</i></b>Because Canadibrit was already using the sledgehammer.
<p><b><i>DARIA: Any bright ideas for excuses to keep Hell's guard dogs,
occasionally known as my parents, down? : </i></b>Yet more "inspiration"
from Lew's <i>Heroes...</i> .
<p><b><i>DARIA: Made my cousin's wedding tolerable, hard as that is to
believe... :</i></b> Yeah, yeah, "I Don't", yada yada...
<p><b><i>DARIA: Yes. I know all about you and the Mob, the cops are on
their way. : </i></b>Loosely inspired (there's that word again) by Canadibrit
and Ben Yee's 272K-when-saved-as-plain-text epic <i>Tour of Duty</i>.
<p><b><i>DARIA: And come dressed as anything from Rocky Horror and I gut
you. : </i></b>Jill Friedman's RHPS-featuring fics <i>Virgin Sacrifice</i>
and <i>Chelsea Hotel</i>, though I don't think Tom's <i>that</i> much of
a bastard... moron, perhaps, but not bastard...
<p><b><i>ANDREW: ...and she knows I've already paid Reinhardt more than
she ever could.</i></b> Judge Cornelius J. Reinhardt "borrowed" from CE
Forman's continuum, hope he doesn't mind.
<p><b><i>JODIE: Robin Hood won't work with sunglasses. : </i></b>Most of
the dance-related scenes take from other fanfics... well, more so than
the rest of this fic, anyway. For example, Mack and Jodie were Robin and
Marian in Canadibrit's <i>Trick-or-Trent.</i>
<p><i><b>... Quinn, in some kind of lavender fairy outfit with matching
wings, antennae and Doc Martens... :</b> </i>Yes, you can get them in that
colour, yes, they'd work with the costume, and yes, Quinn would wear them.
Based on Kemical Reaxion's comments on the PPMB awhile ago and real-life
observations. There are more poseurs per capita at my school than anywhere
in the country, though to be fair they're a little more diverse than the
FC's.
<p><b><i>... Moshing to a recording in formal wear -- only in Lawndale.
And the ARIA Awards... : </i></b>The ARIA (<a 
href="http://www.aria.com.au/">Australian
Recording Industry Association</a>) awards are mooted as "the Australian
equivalent of the Grammies", with the difference being that having Radiohead
playing at the ARIAs would actually improve ratings. Yes, there used to
be people attempting to most in relatively formal wear, though that stopped
this year -- everyone was wearing Coca-Cola T-shirts instead.
<p><b><i>MS LI: Six inches! :</i></b>Can't have the students engaging in
the saliva trade on school property now, can we?
<p><b><i>Daria looks like a modern-day version of Hela, the Norse goddess
of death... top half is a formal navy blue gown, bottom half is rags over
pants of the exact colour and apparent texture of a three-days-dead corpse. :
</i></b>More commonly spelt Hel, alternative used to avoid any possible
puncrimes. Your gratitude is implied. "Modern day version" used 
because I wasn't
exactly sure of what legend normally had her as. The thing about the 
internet as
a research tool is that it makes you really appreciate a good local library,
and the thing about my local library as a research tool is that it makes
you really appreciate having the internet. Got the idea reading Thomas
Mikkelsen's fic <i>Self Less</i>, and later on someone else pointed it
out in a review on FFN.
<p><b><i>DARIA: I've paid the entry fee, dressed up like an idiot like
you asked, and got a rich kid along to see just how bad LHS is so maybe
he'll still make a donation out of sheer pity. Can we get out of here early?
Now, for instance? : </i></b>Expanded version of a line in Canadibrit's
<i>Kiss &amp; Tell.</i>
<p><b><i>MS LI: No, no-one is permitted to leave befoooorre midnight. For
security reasons. : </i></b>A rule put to good use in Acrobat's <i>Three
Prommed Attack</i> sequel.
<p><b><i>... Jane, dressed like Spike from Buffy the Vampire Slayer --
in other words, her usual gear with black jeans instead of shorts and a
floor-length black duster... : </i></b>Watch the Buffy ep "School Hard",
the resemblance is striking with that large, heavy blunt object Ms Li was
using earlier. Joss Whedon (or someone in costuming at least) has obviously
caught the odd <i>Daria</i> episode...
<p><b><i>... works about as well as the idea of a sex scandal involving
John Howard... : </i></b>I'm sorry. Really.
<p><b><i>... knocks him out and blows him into the milling students, who
either go down like bowling pins or explode out in a terrified mass around
him. :</i></b> More "inspiration"... Geoffrey Roberts's <i>A Night On 
The Lame</i> this time.
<p><b><i>JANE: You know what happens when a slimy little bastard like you
gets struck by lightning? :</i></b> Based on the one line from the movie too
out-and-out awful <i>not</i> to try and do something about.
