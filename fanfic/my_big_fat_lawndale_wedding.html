style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I guess you would say that this
story begins several years before the actual events it chronicles. Back when I
was a sophomore in college, my cousin Erin--who had finally dumped her loser
first husband about six months previously--announced that she was once again
engaged. As anyone related to the Barksdale clan would have seen coming, our
mutual grandmother wanted to throw her a lavish gala on par with her first.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was to everyone's surprise,
however, when Erin declined. "I've had my one big wedding," she told
Grandmother Barksdale, "Why don't you save your money until Daria and Quinn get
married? I'm sure they would appreciate some help with their wedding expenses."
We were all shocked that Erin, who had always been Grandmother's favorite, had
noticed the inequity and even more so that Grandmother agreed to that plan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fast forward almost two years, to
November of my senior year. I came home for Thanksgiving the Wednesday before
the holiday. As great as college is, I was realizing just how much truth there
was in the old clich&eacute; "there's no place like home." My room was exactly the way
I'd left it, and there were already phone messages from Stacy, Tiffany and
Jeffy on the answering machine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Within
two hours of my arrival, I had plans to meet my high school guy friends for
dinner that evening, go shopping with Stacy on Friday and get pedicures with
Tiffany and Sandi on Saturday. Add to that a quiet dinner with my parents on
Thursday and my whirlwind weekend was complete.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Plans easily go wrong in the
Morgendorffer household, and that weekend was no exception. Everything went to
hell in a handbasket when we received a phone call around noon on Thursday. As
I was closest to the phone, I quickly answered it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span

around?"<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"Hi Daria! Yeah, she's here, but
she's a bit busy. She's trying to keep Dad from making his famous 'stuffing a
la Jake.'"<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span

safety, I definitely don't want to disturb</i> that <i>task. Can you just do me
a favor and ask her if there will be room for two more people at the dinner
table?"<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"Hold on a minute." </span></i><span
style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I put the phone down and
hurried to the kitchen. "Mom?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mom looked up from where she was
fiddling with a can of cranberry sauce. "What <i>is</i> it, Quinn? I'm way
behind schedule and I have to have those rolls in the oven before that
conference call in 10 min."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"Do we have enough food for two more
people for dinner?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mom sighed as she gave up on the can
and started pulling apart frozen roll dough and setting it on a cookie sheet.
"I thought we went over this when you were in high school. Tiffany and Stacy
have their own families and need to celebrate...."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I rolled my eyes. "Muh-om! It's
Daria. I guess she and her friend decided to come home to Lawndale for some
turkey."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"Daria? There's always room for her
and Jane at our table."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Back up the stairs to the waiting
phone. <i>"Sorry that took so long. Mom says there's plenty of room for you and
your friend at the table." <o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>A crash from the kitchen was followed by mom's
irritated voice. "Dammit, Jake! What did I tell you about that stuffing!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I sighed. <i>"Daria, I have to go. Mom could really
use my help in the kitchen."<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>"All right. We'll arrive by 4. See you, Quinn."<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><i><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>"Bye, Daria."<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Things were not any better around 3:30 when Daria's
hand-me-down Lexus pulled in the driveway. Dad was sulking in the living room,
his third martini in hand. Mom was fuming because her conference call had run
long and the rolls were burnt. I was doing damage control by toasting some
white bread and buttering the results.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The front door creaked and two pairs of feet came in.
Mom and I paused. "Daria?" she called.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>"Yes, Mom."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>We hurried out to join her in the foyer but stopped
in our tracks when we saw Daria. She looked so different than the last time we
had seen her, at her graduation from Raft. Her hair had grown longer and was
pulled back into a slick, low ponytail. She wore an emerald green turtleneck
sweater over an ankle-length black skirt. But the most surprising part wasn't
her attire...but her accessory. Standing beside her, with his arm around her
waist, was a blast from the past.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>"Tom? Tom Sloane?" Mom said, her shock evident in her
voice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was obviously having a
difficult time composing herself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>"Surprised, Mom?" Daria asked with a smirk. She
turned to me. "You can pick your jaw off the floor now."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Tom grinned and pulled Daria closer. "Hello, Mrs.
Morgendorffer, Quinn. It's been a very long time."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Somehow--I can't remember how--Mom and I pulled
ourselves together and started putting dinner got on the table. We'd left Daria
and Tom with Dad in the living room. Half-drunk and his regular clueless self,
Dad was ranting on about Thanksgivings of the past and had no idea that we even
had a guest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>As we put out wineglasses and napkins, Mom leaned
over to me. "Do you think they're a couple again?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>"I think so, Mom. He was holding Daria really close
and she looked pretty happy."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Mom glanced to the living room, where Daria was
refilling Dad's martini glass. "I wonder how long this has been going on."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I simply shrugged.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>We didn't get any answers until dinner was finished
and dessert lay on our plates, but it had been unanimously decided that we
weren't ready to eat it. Dad was reading the paper. Daria was picking at the
remains of a piece of toast. Mom cleared her throat. "So, Daria, Tom...how
long...uh...how long have..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>"Have we been reacquainted, Mom?" Daria finished the
question lightly. "We stayed in contact when we went off to school, so we were
never really unacquainted. However, we've been a couple again since last
April."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Tom picked up the story from there. "I'd never really
gotten over Daria in the four years we were apart. During all that time, I
tried to be content with "just being friends" but it didn't work. So when I
realized that college was coming to an end and Daria and I could end up on
different sides of the country, I let her know how I felt. I figured it
couldn't hurt." He reached over and squeezed Daria's hand. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I glanced at Mom--we were both surprised by how
comfortable Daria was with this display of affection. Dad, of course, was still
half cocked. He was eating his apple pie and still reading a newspaper,
oblivious to the conversation going on around him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>"When Tom made his announcement, I realized just how
much I'd miss him if he went to work at the San Francisco branch of Grace,
Sloane and Page. Even though we were separated all through school, once a month
Jane and I had gone down to Newtown or Tom had visited us in Boston. That
wasn't going to work anymore if I was tied to work in New York and he was busy
on the West Coast." She squeezed Tom's hand back and gave a half smile. "He's
working in New York now also, so we see each other quite often."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Mom smiled. "Well, sweetie, I can see you are happy,
so I'm happy for you. I think this calls for a toast."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>"Wait, Mom." Daria stood up. "Before you break out
the wine again, we have one more piece of news you should hear." She pulled Tom
up with her. He looked nervously at Mom and Dad in turn. "We've decided to get
married."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Once again Mom found herself totally unable to react.
I, on the other hand, had no such problem. "Oh my gosh, Daria! Can I see your
ring?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Daria smirked. "I knew that would be the first thing
out of your mouth, Quinn." She pulled a chain out of her sweater and displayed
a small ring with a tiny diamond. "I'm not used to wearing it, so it gave me a
rash. I'll put it back on my finger in a couple days," she added, half
self-consciously, as I gazed at the delicate piece.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>"It's absolutely gorgeous. It shows very good, classy
taste."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Tom nodded. "I wanted to get something larger, but
Daria insisted that she didn't want me to spend my parents' money on her."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>"That doesn't sound like something I'd say. I'm all
for spending other people's money," Daria said. She turned to our mother. "Mom?
Are you okay with this?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Mom visibly shook herself. "I just can't believe it.
My little girl...why, you're nothing more than a baby. Are you sure you're ready
for this? You're not even twenty three yet, Daria."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Tom spoke up now. "Don't worry, Mrs. Morgendorffer.
We haven't even set a date yet. The wedding won't be for quite a while. Daria
and I want to get settled in our jobs before we get married."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>This pacified Mom for now. "Tom, please, call me
Helen. If we're going to be family, there's no need for all this formality.
Now, let's have that toast." She filled our wineglasses. "To Tom and Daria--may
they have many years of happiness!" The clink of glasses filled the room and we
drank up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>As mom and I began to clear the table, Daria and Tom
went into the other room to make a few phone calls. Dad looked up from his

12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Daria and Tom left early Friday morning to visit
Tom's family at the cove, and the rest of the vacation passed as planned. I
went back to Middleton and final exams. No mention was made of my sister's
engagement again until Christmas. That's when--<i>shudder&#173;--</i>Aunt Rita decided
it would be a good idea for all of the Barksdale kin to be in the same place
for the holidays. Dad always has a problem at the holidays with the ghost of
his father, and Christmas with Mom and her feuding sisters wasn't what the
doctor ordered. Mom resorted to the old standard of bribery: she agreed that,
next year, he could make his stuffing at Thanksgiving. She also promised that
we would spend fewer than 48 hours with Rita and her latest squeeze, an
architect named Yan.<o:p></o:p></span></h1>

12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Daria and Tom decided to attend because it was the
easiest way to share their engagement with the whole family at once. They'd
already informed all of Tom's relatives, and they'd been thrilled. Apparently,
Tom's parents had already offered to help offset the costs of the wedding. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>This last piece of information set me to thinking
about what kind of wedding Daria would be having, anyway. She had never done
things the normal way and it was hard for me to imagine that she was interested
in a traditional, flowery wedding, wearing a long white dress and followed by
half a dozen bridesmaids. Honestly, it was hard enough to realize that Daria
had gotten engaged before I had.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The five of us had agreed to ride together in Mom's
SUV; by the time we arrived, we were all on edge. Dad had finally taken notice
of Daria and Tom's situation, and he ranted during half the ride that no one
ever tells him anything. He and Mom had argued about his refusal to pay
attention during important conversations. At one point, Daria leaned over to
Tom and said, "Are you sure you want to be a part of this family?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Aunt Rita greeted us at the door. "Helen, Jake! So
good to see you. Hello, Daria. Quinn! You get more beautiful each time I see
you. That shade of yellow suits you very well. And who's this handsome young
man? Has Quinn finally found herself a boyfriend?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Mom was still upset over her tiff with Dad in the
car, and her long-running rivalry with her sister made her edgy. "Rita. This is

Rita."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:

you do, Rita?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:

was dragged into a discussion with Yan and Erin's husband Alex, whose main
interests were coin collecting, golf and the stability of Rita's house. Mom and
Aunt Rita bickered about every detail, with Grandmother Barksdale barking
orders and continually siding with Rita. Dad wished he had an escape route.
Daria disappeared with Aunt Amy and I was left alone with a very pregnant Erin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I sat down beside her. "I <i>know</i>. She seems so

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>After a dinner lovingly prepared by Aunt Rita's cook,
Grandmother Barksdale stood before us all and tapped her water goblet. We
looked at her expectantly. "My dear family," she began, "It makes my heart glad
to see you all here in one place. How lucky we all are to have survived another
year and be able to come together as we haven't done in so many years." There
was a general mumbling of approval.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:

Tom."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Daria looked up in surprise. Her expression clearly
read, <i>How did she know we were engaged? </i>Tom put his arm around her.<i> </i>"My
granddaughters are the next generation of Barksdale women," Grandmother
continued, "and I want to see them start their new lives happy. I helped Erin
with her wedding, and her baby already has a nice trust fund beginning. Now, it
is time for Daria to start her new life, and I also want to help. I'm willing
to pay all expenses on a wedding as lavish and beautiful as Erin's first
nuptials."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>With this proclamation, the older generation sprang
noisily into action. Mom and Dad thanked Grandmother, while Aunt Amy was
congratulating the happy couple. Aunt Rita disappeared and returned a moment
later with a large book. "Daria, I want you to have this. Erin and I compiled
it when she got married. I hope it will make your wedding as beautiful as hers
was."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Daria looked nervously at the huge scrapbook.
"Thanks..." she said as she took it in her arms. She opened to the first page and
her eyes widened as she realized just how much information was it contained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>"Daria, dear, have you set a date yet?" Grandmother

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Aunt Rita waved his answer away. "Of course, you'll
want to get married when the weather is nice. You wouldn't want there to be a
sudden snow storm, tornado or hurricane on your wedding day."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Mom frowned. "Rita, you can't control whether there's
a hurricane on your wedding day, especially when you pick a date so far in
advance."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Grandmother disagreed. "But you shouldn't pick a date
that's likely to cause bad weather. December, January and February aren't good
months, especially since flowers must be imported for weddings in the winter. I
personally think May is a good time for a wedding."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>"What about fall? Chrysanthemums would be beautiful

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>"Good thinking, Rita. My friend's granddaughter had a
beautiful wedding in a glass room looking out at a Vermont skyline in October.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Daria shook her head. "I'm sorry to disappoint you
all, but we were hoping for a small ceremony. Just those of us here, some of
Tom's family and a few friends. We weren't even sure we would have bridesmaids
and everything."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Grandmother frowned. "Nonsense,
Daria. Getting married is a very important event and should be shared with lots
of people. Now, Rita, where do you think the wedding should be held?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Daria's voice contained a hint of fond exasperation. She turned back to her
fianc&eacute;. "Maybe you're right." She let him pull her into his arms, and he
nuzzled his chin on the top of her head. "I just wonder one thing," she said,
pressing her cheek against his shirt and tie, "How did Grandmother find out we
were engaged?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span

shuddered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

at me. "It's all right, Quinn. I guess that in the end, you did us a service.
We got to avoid a big 'we're engaged' speech." She took Tom by the arm and led
him toward the front door. "Come on," she said, "Let's look at the stars."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

all together again had less to do with Daria than with me. Family members
gathered at the gymnasium of Middleton College to watch me graduate with a BA
in finance. Those festivities had barely ended when Mom got a crazy idea. While
Grandmother and my aunts were still in town, she would invite the Sloanes over
for a barbecue so that our families could get to know each other. Tom's parents
thought that was a fabulous idea, so they arrived that warm Saturday in May,
dragging their daughter Elsie.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a couple minutes until Daria and Tom came back out from inside the house. It
was quite apparent that they were trying to avoid the cluster of females at the
picnic table. "Any ideas what they're talking about now?" my sister wanted to
know. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Elsie and me. "I'm glad we brought you two here. Aunt Rita and Grandmother have

job search, and I plowed headfirst into them. By the time August came around, I
had accepted a position at the Baltimore branch of Grace, Sloane and Page,
thanks to glowing recommendations from my future brother-in-law and his big

she would be, but it came in a different way than either of us suspected. When

her living room, where Tom's mother joined Grandmother and Rita.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I stored my bags and became a member
of the group crowded into the cramped apartment. Mrs. Sloane was thumbing
through a bridal magazine while Aunt Rita and Grandmother Barksdale compared
swatches of fabric.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span

you can talk some sense into Mother," Aunt Rita said, grabbing my arm. "Do you
think the bridesmaids dresses should be this shade of pink, or a slightly
darker, rosy color?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Daria's eyes flashed at me, and I
could read the panic in her expression. "Umm...Do you have any shades that <i>aren't</i>
pink? I've decided it doesn't go well with my hair." I picked up a swatch of
sky blue taffeta. "Maybe something close to this color, but a different
material? I'd have to see the dress design to know what's best."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Aunt Rita produced a couple of

between attending orientation meetings and being dragged to every floral shop
in New York. Grandmother thought we should order the flowers from New York and
have them delivered; Mrs. Sloane thought a florist in Baltimore or DC would
provide fresher blooms. Every time I thought an issue was settled, one of the
three would come up with a different idea and the debate would start fresh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the apartment as possible. She told Grandmother that she was very busy at work,
but I suspect she escaped to Tom's. The future groom himself only appeared
twice, and both times he just nodded as his mother told him how the wedding
plans were coming along. "Don't worry," he reminded Daria as they viewed
drawings of the bridesmaids' dresses and floral arrangements, "The important
part of the marriage is what comes after the wedding." <o:p></o:p></span></p>

job and living on my own. I found I enjoyed my newfound independence and I
decided to spend my first Thanksgiving as an adult alone in my apartment,
relishing the quiet. Christmas came quickly afterward and I obliged my mother
by putting on an appearance at the Morgendorffer homestead during the holidays.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Not to be outdone by Aunt Rita, Mom
had invited the Barksdale clan to join us for Christmas dinner. I arrived on
Christmas Eve to find Mom and Dad in a tizzy. Mom wanted every inch of the
house spotless. Dad wasn't helping this any. He had started assembling the
ingredients for "Jake's world famous stuffing" and had turned the kitchen
upside down looking for his prepackaged breadcrumbs--which were already sitting
on the shelf next to the other necessities. Attempting to make peace, I made
Dad a martini and then vacuumed the bedrooms and dusted the living room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By the time Daria and Tom arrived an
hour later, the house was relatively calm. Dad was happily combining
ingredients and Mom and I had collapsed onto the couch with a glass of wine
each. Daria observed the latter with amusement. "Visits with the Barksdales
certainly bring out the alcoholic tendencies of this family," she mused.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"Daria! I'm just relaxing. Rita is <i>not

"How are you both? How are the wedding plans?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tom groaned and Daria blanched.
"You've hit the sore spot," she said, sitting on the other couch and patting
the seat next to her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Her fianc&eacute; took the invitation and
put his arm around her. "My mother brought one of the bridesmaids' dresses up
for us to see last weekend. It was completely different from what Quinn had
managed to salvage for us back in August."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"What!" I sat up and put down my
wine. "Your mom changed it after I managed to get all three of them to settle
on <i>one pattern, color and material</i>!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"Not exactly," Tom looked as if the
whole situation was actually a bit amusing. "It seems as if your
grandmother--your mother, Helen--decided the dresses were too short and too low
cut. She had the dressmaker adjust the pattern. They're nice, but not what any
of us had agreed on."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Daria sighed. "That's the story of
the whole wedding."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I went into the kitchen and returned
with two more wineglasses. "I think you too need this more than we do," I said

style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Daria accepted the glass and took a
sip. "I just don't know what to do. We never should have let everyone else take
over the planning. We were thinking a small wedding in the city--thirty people
or so. At last count, I think there was closer to four hundred invited. We
wanted something simple and it's turned into a fiasco. And I think it's too
late to tell everyone to back off."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

interrupted by a crash in the kitchen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"Gah dammit!" Dad screamed. Mom
rushed into the kitchen to see what had him so riled up, leaving me alone with
a morose Daria and Tom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We sat sipping our wine. "You know
what I think would help?" I asked after a minute. "If you two took control of
at least one aspect of the wedding. It's too late to change the number of
invitations, or the bridesmaids' dresses..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span

style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tom looked thoughtful, but Daria
didn't seem cheered. "I don't know, Quinn." She put her glass down. "Jane told
me this would happen. She told me I shouldn't have told my family about the
wedding because of how they act. She said they'd take over. Now it seems like
most of the wedding has already been planned without us."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the disaster that was Dad's cooking. "Tom? Girls? It looks like dinner is a

day. After Daria's sarcastic comment the day before, Mom hid all the alcohol

style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We actually managed to avoid wedding
talk until after dinner was through and people were starting to leave.
Grandmother had her coat on and was just about to walk out the door when she
stopped. "Oh, Daria, I nearly forgot. I scheduled a fitting for your dress for
early next week. Here's the time and address of the dressmaker. You're going to
love the dress Kay and I picked out for you."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tom and I both turned to Daria, who
was obviously biting back her temper. After the door closed behind Grandmother
and Rita, Tom grabbed her by the shoulders. "Let it out," he said, "It will be
good for you." Daria let loose an inaudible scream. "Better?" he asked. She
nodded, and he pulled her close. "Listen, Daria. This is not the end of the
world. First, there's three full months until the wedding. If you see the dress
and you really don't like it, it can probably be changed. And if it can't,
we'll make a game out of avoiding the photographers at the weddings."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"It would, but just imagine the
leagues of angry relatives knocking down our door, brandishing torches. It
could get ugly...and we'd have to live with it until we die." Tom made a face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

loomed in front of us. Daria and her intended each took that week off of work,
at the insistence of Grandmother and Mrs. Sloane. Both the Barksdale matriarch
and her eldest daughter had been camped out in casa de Morgendorffer for almost
a week before I arrived with T minus three days and counting. Erin, Alex and
little Drew were expected the next day, and Aunt Amy was due to arrive the
night before the wedding. Needless to say, the house was expected to be crowded
during the day. For Dad's sanity, Daria had insisted that all relatives stay at
a hotel, and for once, they had all listened to her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because of the large number of
guests attending the nuptials, it was decided that no rehearsal dinner would be
held. Instead, the bridal party would just go to the country club chapel the
day prior to the ceremony and run through things several times. Grandmother had
arranged for a minister, and he was expected to meet us there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The man was late, and Daria and we
bridesmaids were standing by the stained glass windows while we waited. Jane
had arrived the other day and was staying with her brother Breeze or Wind or
something like that in Oakwood. As a form of protest for a fancy, frilly
wedding, she was dressed in what was probably the messiest outfit she could
find: paint covered longjohn bottoms under a pair of grubby jean shorts, paired
with a dingy orange and green polo shirt. Her old shoes were losing the soles.
She caught me staring at the ensemble. "Thinking of giving me a makeover?" she
asked, a twinkle in her eye.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"No...I think I see the humor in this

style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At that moment, Mrs. Sloane entered
the room with the clergyman. Daria and I gaped. "Not you!" I shrieked. Daria's
back was rigid. She moved over to the minister and began a conversation, but I
wasn't close enough to hear it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span

style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"<i>That </i>is the minister who hit
on me during Erin's wedding." Jane, having obviously heard the story before,
nodded and continued to watch Daria. Elsie, on the other hand, couldn't contain
herself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span

practices, we were all confident for the next day's ceremony. Mrs. Sloane tried
to usher Tom home with her to make sure that he and Daria didn't see each other
before the wedding. Tom managed to shake her off, promising he'd leave his
fianc&eacute;e by midnight. Daria, Tom, Jane and I rode back to the Morgendorffer

things are going with the wedding. But I have a suggestion for you for
this."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He led them upstairs. Jane
followed them absently. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A couple minutes later, Dad returned
with Jane, who had her car keys in hand. "I can't believe they liked my idea!"
He bubbled, then paused. "Are you sure they didn't just say that to make me
feel good?" <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jane looked at him. "No, Mr.
Morgendorffer. I think they really liked it."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"Please, call me Jake. You've been a
friend of this family long enough and you're not a kid anymore." For the first
time, Dad really got a look at Jane's outfit. He did a double take.
"Uh...Jane-o...you're not going to be wearing that during the wedding tomorrow, are
you?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jane caught my gaze and rolled her
eyes briefly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"No, Jake, I'm a
bridesmaid so I have a dress I have to wear."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"Attagirl. We'll see you tomorrow,
then." He turned to me as the door shut behind Jane. "This is going to be a
great wedding, Quinn. I just wish that my mother was here to see it." Dad
paused, thinking about Grandma Ruth, who had died my senior year of high
school. Then his face darkened, and he turned his face to the ceiling. "You'd
better be taking good care of her, old man!" He yelled at his long-dead father.
"I'm a much better dad then you ever were. And tomorrow I'm going to walk my
little girl down the aisle, instead of going to the dog groomers like you did
on my wedding day!" Dad shook his fist. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"Uh, Dad?" I said, "Why don't you go
make Mom a snack? I don't think she had any dinner." Dad brightened and walked
off into the kitchen. I rolled my eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I thought I might take a hot relaxing bath, so I
headed to the bathroom. I passed Daria's old bedroom. She and Tom were inside
with the door slightly ajar. As I walked past, I heard a snippet of their
conversation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"Do you really think we'll get away
with it?" Tom asked, uncertain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Daria seemed secure in her answer.
"No one would stop us. All we need now is a sword..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I moseyed on, into my old room. I
chuckled when I thought about what I had overheard. What were they planning? It
sounded like they were going to skewer Grandmother or Aunt Rita for the fiasco
their wedding had become. My old nose for gossip had my imagination running
wild. I shook myself and let it all go. Looking around my room, I found a book
I had read in high school--<i>Tina and the Tennis Pro</i>. It sounded like just
the thing one needed when she wanted to relax and forget about the world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>By the time I had dried myself off after a long soak,
Tom had gone home and Daria's bedroom door was closed and her light was off. I
stood outside the door for a moment, thinking. This was the last night that the
four of us would sleep together under the same roof like this; the last night
our family unit was intact. Tomorrow, Daria would be getting a new identity and
a new family. She and Tom had decided that she would be called Daria Morgendorffer
Sloane, which was a bit reassuring to me. No matter where Daria lived or how
much of a family she and Tom created together, she would always be a
Morgendorffer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Aunt Rita woke me up the next morning by throwing
open the curtains and announcing, "Just six hours until the wedding!" I sat up
and rubbed my eyes sleepily, trying to think of a nasty response. By the time I
was lucid enough that one came to me, she was already out the door. I could
hear relatives--lots of them--scurrying around the first floor doing last minute
preparations. Dad ran by me, already dressed in his tux, his bow tie trailing.
Even a glance at him made his tension apparent. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I dressed in the jeans I had worn yesterday and a
button down shirt. In 90 minutes, all of the womenfolk in the house were to
meet half a dozen Sloane ladies at a spa, where we would be manicured and have
our hair fixed. Daria was <i>not</i> looking forward to this, but held her
tongue for Mom's sake. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The bride-to-be was sitting at the table, a bowl of
cereal turning soggy in front of her. Erin was offering Daria various foods,
but my sister shook her head at each of them. She looked paler than usual and
was visibly anxious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Jane arrived a couple of minutes later, still half
asleep and apparently, half dressed--she was barefoot. She sat down next to
Daria at the table. "Yo," she said weakly, then plopped her head down on the
table. Daria offered the mushy cereal to her. Jane lifted her head just long
enough to devour the mix.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Aunt Rita moved over to Mom. "<i>That</i> is the maid
of honor?" she hissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>By the time we left for the spa, Jane was somewhat
more awake, thanks to four cups of coffee. She had found a pair of boots
somewhere and was in a chipper mood. Her cheerfulness had not rubbed off on
Daria, though. If anything, my sister was more nervous than before. She had
shredded several napkins before we had left, and she'd been unusually quiet all
morning. Everyone told me that it was just bridal jitters--she'd be fine once
the ceremony was over.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>I forgot all about Daria's problems when we arrived
at the spa. I spotted Elsie out front--she appeared to be waiting for me. She
and her mother had brought my bridesmaid's dress and Jane's, and I was
desperate to see the finished version.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Elsie told me that the dresses were still in the car,
but oh, were they beautiful. "They're the most gorgeous shade when you get them
in the sunlight--we'll <i>all</i> look great in that color. And even though your
grandmother messed with the pattern, they're still a nice shape and very
fashionable right now." I thought briefly of Daria's dress, which had arrived
yesterday. We'd all seen pictures of the pattern, but the finished product was
sealed in Daria's closet; she didn't want anyone to see it before she put it
on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Elsie and I stuck together during
our manicures, chatting about the wedding and what we would do with our free
time after it was over. Elsie was graduating from Bromwell in another month and
wasn't sure what she wanted to do with herself afterward. Her parents were
pressuring her to join the family company, but Elsie wanted a fresh start in
life. We discussed what it was like working at Grace, Sloane and Page while we
were having our hair done.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally the beauty regimen concluded
and we rushed outside to the Sloane's fancy old car. "Here they are!" Elsie
announced, holding up a garment back and unzipping it. Inside were two
slate-blue dresses, exactly the shade of Elsie's eyes. I gawked at them. We'd
seen the dresses before at the fitting, but now with the wedding so close, they
seemed even more beautiful, with choker necklines and a long, slim look. "We
are going to look <i>fabulous</i>," Elsie grinned, handing the bag over.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Daria and Jane had already left by
the time I got the dresses back to the convoy of vehicles. Grandmother laid the
garment bag carefully across the back seat of one car and threatened to hurt
anyone who wrinkled the contents. We quickly arranged ourselves in the cars to
prevent mashing our hair.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Daria had already holed herself up
in her bedroom by the time we arrived home. Jane was inside with her, and I
could hear the two of them debating makeup for the situation. I knocked on the
door, and Jane opened it a crack. "I have your dress," I said in my perkiest
voice--the excitement of the day was getting to me. "I'm going to hang it in my
closet." Jane nodded and began to close the door. "Wait." I said, stopping it
with my hand. I couldn't see my sister, but I spoke to her anyway. "Daria? I
just wanted to remind you, this will all be over in another four hours."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I could hear Daria exhale. "Thanks,
Quinn," she said as the door closed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next couple hours went by in a
rush--and a panic. Dad spilled half of his lunch on his tuxedo...which led to an
argument between him and Mom, who had told him not to put it on until just
before we left. Erin's babysitter cancelled and she was on the phone with
everyone that I knew, looking for <i>anybody</i> willing to watch Drew during
the nuptials. The bouquets hadn't arrived yet, so Grandmother was in a foul
mood. Aunt Rita's date--a burly contractor named Pete--had forgotten his dress
shoes at the hotel. Unable to deal with all the Barksdale closeness, Aunt Amy
escaped for an hour, returning with a plate of cheese fries. She spent fifteen
minutes trying to persuade Daria to eat them, but the bride-to-be wouldn't even
open the door. Amy finally gave in and ate the greasy potatoes herself, sitting
on the floor outside Daria's bedroom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As is often the case, everything
came reasonably together in the end. By one o'clock--one hour before the
ceremony--everyone was dressed and ready to ride to the country club. The
flowers had been delivered and quickly distributed, and Jane's niece Courtney
had agreed to watch the baby. A limo was waiting out front to take the bridal
party members to the church.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mom stood at the bottom of the
stairs, tapping her foot impatiently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She was elegantly attired in a cream colored version of her normal suit
and her hair had soft wave to it. "Daria!" she called. "Everyone else is ready
to go. We're waiting for you."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The door opened upstairs, and then
Daria appeared. Mom and I stopped breathing. Daria's hair was done in a simple
knot at the back of her head, artfully arranged so that her veil--which Jane was
holding in the limo--could sit easily on top. Jane had done a fabulous job on my
sister's makeup; her features were gently accentuated in a very natural way.
There had been a quarrel about the appropriate shoes; Daria had wanted to wear
her boots, while Aunt Rita had insisted on heels. As a compromise, Daria now wore
a pair of dainty ballet slippers. But the crowning glory of the ensemble was
the dress. It had an ivory silk bodice, with four layers of swishy ankle-length
skirt and long lacy sleeves. Grandmother and Aunt Rita had, once again, done a
fabulous job. There were no beads, bows or bobbles anywhere in sight, for which
I was relieved. The way Daria held herself indicated that she was nervous about
her appearance, and I smiled, hoping to help her relax.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dad walked into the hall then with
his camera. "Helen, do you think Daria will let me get a picture be--" He
spotted his elder daughter and stopped. "Oh!" Words seemed to fail Dad. He held
up the camera.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Much like teenage Daria would have,
the bride glared. Mom looked at her imploringly. "Just one?" she pleaded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Daria gave in, just like she had
done so many times over the past sixteen months. "Okay, just one."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dad found his voice. "All right! I
want a picture of all my girls together. Mom and I surrounded Daria, and we
both put on our best picture grins. Even Daria managed a little smile.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the ceremony. The chapel was already teeming with friends, family and well
wishers. Dad asked for my help in practicing his part of the ceremony in the
hallway behind the gathered. He'd begged off the rehearsal the night before but
had promised Daria that he would get it right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

right thing, I left Dad to practice alone and went in search of the other
bridesmaids. Before I found either Jane or Elsie, I ran into Grandmother pacing
at the other end of the hall and ringing her hands. Tom, heading my way,
spotted her the same time I did, and we both rushed to find out why she was
upset.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Afraid that she might
hyperventilate, Tom led Grandmother over to a chair. She pulled a hanky out of
her purse and dabbed her eyes with it. "The minister isn't here yet," she said
when I asked what was wrong.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tom relaxed a little but gave a
nervous chuckle. "Mrs. Barksdale, Daria and I decided that the minister wasn't
quite...us. We found a justice of the peace who was more to our liking." Tom
pointed to a portly man chatting jovially with Mr. Sloane. "See, that's him
over there."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Grandmother glanced over the justice
and then looked at Tom as if he had two heads, but any comment she had planned
died at her lips. She put out her hand and he helped her up. As he let go, she
pointed to his hip and asked, "What is that?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I followed Grandmother's finger.
Around his waist Tom wore a large sheath containing a fancy, decorated sword.
"Oh, that?" Tom said with another nervous titter. "It's an old Sloane tradition
for the groom to wear a sword at his wedding. Dates back to the Middle Ages.
Didn't my mother mention it?" Before Grandmother could reply, he looked at his
watch. "I'd better get in place," he said, hurrying away. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

trouble Daria was planning were forgotten in the nervousness of the moment.
Jane and Tom's friend Adam from Bromwell were in the lead. Elsie and I
followed, each on the arm of one of the Sloane cousins. Daria, gripping on
Dad's arm for dear life, brought up the rear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of pews. Instead, I concentrated on the Sloane I was walking with; the entire
time we were walking, I could hear him murmuring, "Left, together, right,
together," in time to the music. By the time we reached the altar, I was glad
to let go of his arm and stand next to Jane. Elsie joined us a moment later,

at Tom, whose eyes were popping out of his head. He had obviously never seen
Daria looking like this. Dad brought Daria to the altar, placed her hand in
Tom's and took a seat next to Mom. I was surprised to note that both of my

style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The organ stopped, and the guests
were quiet. The justice of the peace cleared his throat. "We are gathered here
today, in the eyes of God and the state of Maryland, to witness the union of
Daria Barksdale Morgendorffer to Thomas Angier James Sloane. Let the ceremony
begin!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Daria and Tom moved to the left side
of the altar, while the justice of the peace moved to the right. Tom reached
into his sheath and removed the sword, which he laid in front of him on the
floor. The justice held a Bible in front of him, propping up a small piece of
paper. "Daria and Tom have chosen to be married in a medieval soldier's
ceremony." He cleared his throat, then read from the paper, "Leap, knave, and
jump, whore/and married be forever more."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Everyone in the chapel was silent,
many with their mouths wide open. Grandmother looked as if she'd seen a ghost,
while Mrs. Sloane had her hands over her face. Tom took Daria's hand, and she
gathered up her long skirt. The two of them looked at each other, then jumped
over the sword.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"I pronounce that these two are now
wed." The justice turned to Tom. "You may now kiss the bride," he said.
Ignoring the stunned reaction of people around them, Daria and Tom turned to
each other. He tenderly lifted her veil and placed it behind her head, and they
kissed for just a moment. The organist, who, like the rest of us, sat in shock,
didn't realize that the ceremony was over, so Tom took his new wife by the arm and
they sauntered down the aisle. Haltingly, the rest of the bridal party
followed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I walked down the path through the golf course. We were supposed to meet in

your brother and sister displaying the you-ness inside them." She chuckled. "I
can't believe Daria had the guts to go through with something like that in
front of that many people. I guess she and Tom just wanted to do something that
would shock a lot of people."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

looks the two of you had. You looked as if you wanted to crawl behind the
podium and Quinn here went very white." Jane mused over that for a second. "I
hope someone got a picture of the bridal party while the justice was talking.
I'd love to paint it."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By the time we reached the clubhouse
even Jane was in hysterics. I was laughing so hard that I had tears in my eyes.
"You know the funniest part of all this?" I asked, wiping my face gently with a
tissue, trying not to smear my makeup. "I'm the one who told Daria that she and
Tom should take control of part of the wedding."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mom and Dad, who arrived several
moments later with the Sloanes, obviously didn't the ceremony as funny as we
did. Mom was fuming silently, and Dad was in the middle of a speed rant about
ungrateful children and wasting parents' money. Every time he paused, Tom's
father would add, "Quite right," or, "I agree." Mrs. Sloane was doing her best
to hold back her tears.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mom spotted us bridesmaids and
accosted us. "Did any of you know about this?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>We all tried to compose ourselves, but the efforts
were mostly in vain. Elsie answered Mom without looking at her. "No, Mrs.
Morgendorffer, we didn't know anything. We were just as surprised as you were."
This pronouncement was followed by stifled snickers from Jane and a cough from
me. Mom looked at us sideways and then walked away. Elsie released a breath and
I giggled as Mom moved out of earshot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>"D'ya think she bought that?" Jane asked, one eyebrow
raised and a smirk on her lips.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>"No way. She's not a lawyer for nothing," I said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Any further conversation down that line was cut off
when another golf cart arrived, this one carrying several Sloanes elders and a
very put-out looking Grandmother Barksdale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The photographer with all his supplies quickly followed. The best man
and groomsmen were walking over a hill by the same route we had taken. Bits of
conversations wafted across the golf course:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>"I can't believe the nerve..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>"...insensitive, ungrateful..."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>"...most horrible ceremony I've ever seen!"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Finally, the couple of the hour reappeared and the
chatter on the green halted. Everyone but the photographer stopped and watched.
Tom had ditched the sword and sheath somewhere and his bow tie was coming
loose. He had Daria by the hand; her veil was fluttering behind her in the
wind. Both looked a little flushed, as if they had run all the way here from
the chapel. Tom was the first to speak. "Uh, hi?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Mrs. Sloane stood up front, and Mom stepped forward
next to her. Both crossed their arms and looked furious. "Don't play, Tom," his
mother chided. "What do the two of you think that was back at the chapel?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Daria dropped Tom's hand and clenched her fists.
After a moment, she released them. "I call that a wedding, Tom and Daria
style." Tom looked at her and nodded. "For the past eighteen months, everyone
in this family has been involved in planning this wedding--except Tom and me."
This elicited Looks from several family members, most notably Grandmother and
Mrs. Sloane. "You might have asked for our opinion, but our requests were
largely ignored. The wedding you planned was beautiful, and would have been
perfect--if it were for you. Tom and I wanted something very different."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Tom picked up the story. "We know that you all wanted
the best for us, and we appreciate it, but a wedding that defies all our wishes
can hardly be described as in our best interest." He put an arm around Daria's
waist. "Now, we know that you want pictures, and we're willing to pose as long
as no one mentions how unhappy they are with what happened today. The same goes
for the reception. One negative word and we leave. Everyone got it?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Everyone got it, and although most of them didn't
agree, no one said anything. We got through the pictures quickly and relatively
painlessly. The photos turned out to be a bust, though. Most of our relations
were so angry or confused that almost nobody smiled. There was one particularly
interesting photo of three generations of Barksdale women. Mom looks like she
wanted to strangle somebody; just before the camera had flashed, Aunt Amy
leaned over to Mother and, with a smirk, said, "Oh, Helen, it was such a lovely
ceremony." The only decent poses involved just the newlyweds--in addition to one
of Daria surrounded by her still giddy bridesmaids.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Spirits flagged as the reception began. Many of the
guests seemed tired and some were still riled up from the earlier festivities.
The head table was too quiet during dinner. I found myself toying with my dry
chicken and wishing that everyone would hurry and finish eating. Mom was trying
very hard to avoid the alcohol, while Dad drank several martinis during the
meal. Mr. and Mrs. Sloane had regained their composure and repressed most of
their feelings, putting on fake smiles that clashed with the somber mood of the
room. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relief was apparent on many faces
when the plates were cleared. People began to mingle, and the mood lifted.
Several of Tom's young cousins repeatedly clicked their glasses, urging Daria
and Tom to kiss. Elsie and I flitted from table to table, introducing each
other and catching up on gossip. After a time, the best man, Adam, called
everyone's attention, and we returned to our seats<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"I'm not much for speeches, so I'll
keep it very short. I met Tom six years ago when we shared a tiny, cramped dorm
room at Bromwell. Ever since then, he's constantly surprised me. The one thing
that has remained constant, however, through all the years, was his love for
Daria." He raised his glass. "A toast to my best friend and his wife. May they
always be as happy as they are today." We all raised our glasses and drank to
the toast, but I couldn't help but wonder about Adam's choice of words. Today
didn't seem to have been, from certain perspectives, very successful and I was
hoping they would certainly have better days than this one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The band, which had been playing
soft music throughout the reception, took a break. As the walked out, Adam
announced that the couple would have their first dance. As Tom dragged Daria
onto the dance floor, a familiar song burst from the DJ's booth. As they began
to dance, I left my seat and stood behind Mom and Dad. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

series sixteen years after this story lets off. One of the planned installments
will hopefully answer that question. So watch this space...<o:p></o:p></span></p>
