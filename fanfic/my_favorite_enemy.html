<div align="CENTER"><b>My Favorite Enemy</b><p></div>
<div>Daria Morgendorffer could feel the heat of the sun on her shoulders as she
climbed the hill to her dorm.  It was a comfortable, relaxing feeling, but she
had another reason to relax as well: the last final of her junior year of
college was behind her.  Anticipation of a busy summer ahead quickened her step.
She still had to pack, and she wasn't expected at work until Monday, four days
away, but mentally she'd already left school.<p>The temperature dropped as she
swung onto the tree-lined path between the dorms, and the earthy smell of spring
growth teased her.  Perhaps the packing could wait. This would be a perfect
afternoon to take the laptop out under the trees and write something.  After a
semester when writing had largely meant papers for class, the lure of writing
for fun was strong.<p>She'd managed to publish several short stories over the
last three years, as well as a regular column of film criticism for the school
paper, but her writing had taken second-place to an increasingly busy school
schedule for the last few months. The school had accepted her as an English
major, but she'd chosen that course of study mainly because it left room in her
schedule for other classes.  So far she'd taken introductory courses in the
sciences, business, and humanities, as well as a variety of European languages. 
Her faculty adviser, when he wasn't telling her how crazy she was, had taken to
referring to her as his renaissance woman.  This semester she'd outdone herself,
adding an advanced anthropology class and fourth-semester Russian to her three
required classes, none of which were easy.  She'd always done well at academic
subjects, but it was clear that next year she'd have to take it slightly easier
if she wanted to maintain her honors standing.  There was just so much to learn,
and all of it potentially relevant to her chosen profession.<p>Returning to the
agency for the summer would be a vacation compared to school.  She'd be working
mainly in the analysis section, but she was scheduled for a two-week trip to
several European cities in late August.  It was partly orientation--first-hand
knowledge was the foundation of good analysis--but it was also a recruiting
trip.  The agency had identified several likely candidates in each city, and she
was to make contact with them and determine if they had what it took to be
useful and productive information sources.  If so, she'd provide them with basic
training and codes, and arrange for a local case officer to supervise them.
Except for her near-accidental involvement in a terrorist plot in high school,
this would be her first real field mission.<p>She exited the shaded path onto
the sidewalk in front of the dorm.  Her car, a deceptively decrepit dark green
Honda del Sol two-seater, was parked just ahead.  It was dusty from a week's
inactivity, and leaves were blown into piles against the wheels.  As she passed,
she took note of the small stick she'd jammed in the hood when she'd parked the
car last; it remained undisturbed.  Not that she expected anyone to tamper with
it, but good tradecraft came from making such precautions a habit, and not
simply a skill used against a known threat.<p>Walking by another car, she
caught a glimpse of her reflection in its window.  Although she would never have
her sister Quinn's slim elegance, a last minute growth spurt had added several
inches to her height, and a few understated curves.  With the muscle that came
from regular martial arts practice her build was stocky, and at five-six in her
boots she didn't exactly tower over others, but she walked with a poise born of
self-confidence, and the end result was quite effective, if she did say so
herself.  There had been several brief romances that supported her opinion, but
none had lasted.<p>She sighed, wondering if she'd see Tom this summer.  They'd
broken up after high school when they each went off to separate schools.  His
was on the west coast, but his father was back from the protective custody he'd
been held in since the terrorist incident, so Tom was likely to spend the summer
with his family.  She and Tom had remained friends after their breakup, although
distant ones.  They swapped email every few months, when something worth writing
about happened, but she hadn't talked to him since Christmas, when they'd bumped
into each other at a party at Jodie's house.  The knowledge that Daria was
partly responsible for his father being in jail hadn't helped, but their
relationship had deteriorated more from simple absence than anything
else.<p>
Entering the dorm, she waved to Kim, a Residential Assistant sitting at
the security desk.  Kim looked up from a stack of Chemistry texts, blankly at
first. Then she realized who Daria was and beckoned her over.  Daria altered
course, wondering what she wanted.  Kim wasn't someone she talked to often.
Although pleasant, she was too busy with her own life for Daria to consider her
a friend.<p>
"Daria. I was wondering where you were."<p>
"Anthro final," she
replied. "My last one.  I'm outta here."<p>
Kim grimaced. "I wish I could say
the same, but I've got Organic tomorrow morning.  Anyway, you've got a visitor
waiting in the lounge.  A real hunk.  Were you expecting him?"<p>
Daria thought:
whom did she know that Kim would consider a hunk?  Kim tended to date jocks, a
species that had never appealed to Daria.  Silent alarms at the anomaly went off
in the back of her head. Her training said to run, or to confront the person
prepared for a fight.  Common sense said her training was overreacting, and that
no one would be foolish enough to try something in the common lounge of a dorm,
especially after the security camera on the front door had caught them entering.
Besides, she wasn't ready to leave yet.  All of these thoughts chased through
her head in an instant, and she replied to Kim with a barely perceptible pause
for thought.<p>
"I don't think so.  What's he look like?"<p>"Blond.  Looks sort
of Scandinavian, but he's shorter than you, and muscles to die for."<p>Daria
didn't know anyone on campus who fit that description, but there was someone... 
She wondered if it could be him, after all this time.<p>Taking her leave of
Kim, Daria walked into the lounge.  She adjusted her hand on the strap of the
backpack over her left shoulder.  Filled with notebooks, it was heavy enough to
use as a weapon in a pinch.  She could see a blond head above the back of a
chair over by the window, where he could watch the path to the main campus. 
He'd already know she was approaching.  In fact, he could probably see her
reflection in the glass, although she couldn't make out his face.  She walked
directly up to him, stopping about five feet away.  Yes, it was
Alexei.<p>"Alex," she said. "What brings you out to the hinterlands?"<p>Alexei
Ivanov, a Major in the Russian Army and at last report still a military attache
at the Russian embassy in Washington, stood with a smooth grace.  Although he
wasn't in uniform, his haircut and posture screamed soldier to anyone with eyes.
Daria knew he could play the role of student with conviction, so the omission
was surprising.  She hadn't seen him since the end of the terrorist incident,
although she'd kept up with reports on his progress, including his recent
promotion to major. It was always good to know the enemy agents working your
area, although her opinion of Alexei went a ways beyond simple respect for an
"honorable enemy".<p>Alexei smiled--she'd forgotten the effect of that
grin--and held out his hands. "Daria," he said, "it's good to see you
again."<p>She dropped her pack absently, and took his hands, but kept him at
arms length through an effort of will. "Likewise, Alex.  But I'm surprised to
see you so far from home.  What's up?"<p>His grin slipped slightly, and she
could see tension behind it. "I need to look up an old friend of ours, and I
thought you might have her number.  Do you remember Melody, from the Model
Congress party?"<p>Daria felt a chill at the mention of her cover name, and the
incident that had brought them together, briefly on the same side of the war
against terrorism.<p>"Yes, of course.  I've got her number in my address book. 
Come on up to my room, and you can tell me what you've been up to for the last
couple of years while I dig it out."<p>She let go of his hands and picked up
her pack, leading the way to the stairs.  Kim watched them go, silently
abandoning her hopes of getting to know the mysterious Alex.  From their body
language, neither was going to look at anyone else while the other was around. 
She was surprised.  Although she didn't know Daria that well, she would have
expected her to mention a boyfriend.<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>Daria led Alexei to her room on the fourth floor without encountering
anyone.  The dorm was nearly empty, and the few remaining students were either
at exams or locked away somewhere studying for them.  Her roommate, Janice, had
left two days ago.  With Janice's posters and possessions removed the room
seemed incomplete.  Daria's Kafka poster was the sole decoration, other than a
well-stocked bookshelf.  A clock radio was the only accessory; Daria's schedule
left no time for television.<p>Daria turned the radio on softly to mask their
conversation.  These days sophisticated digital processing could deal with such
ruses, but not everyone had ready access to that kind of technology so the
practice was still taught in basic training.  She waved Alexei to a seat on the
lower bunk; the closest the room came to a couch, and sat down at her
desk.<p>"So, Alexei, it has been three years, what suddenly motivated you to
come visit?" she asked in passable, if stilted, Russian.<p>"Ah, you speak it
well," he replied in the same language, "but you have a noticeable accent, and
your word choice is too academic."<p>"I know, but they do not teach native
usage in college classes.  I will need to take an advanced class, or visit some
Russians. But you are avoiding the question."<p>"Yes, I am.  The reason I'm
here is that I need your help.  One of our operations went badly wrong." He
fidgeted on the edge of the bed, as if making the admission
reluctantly.<p>"Alexei, in case you have forgotten, I work for the U.S.
Government.  Why should I help you with a failed mission, especially in my own
country?"<p>He looked up at her, with an intent expression, and spoke in a more
serious manner: "Well, actually, we'd like the help of your whole organization. 
I came to you because you're the only member of it I know by name.  And there is
a good reason you'll help us."<p>"I am listening."<p>He sighed, looking down
at his feet. "I had an agent.  A particularly greedy one, as it turns out.  He
was acting as a bagman, collecting a disk that contained information taken from
one of your secret cyberwar research labs.  He decided that he could sell it to
the Chinese, and managed to get himself killed.  Now they have your information,
and I have a potential scandal that could result in my superiors exiling me to
somewhere even less hospitable than Moscow in the winter, if they don't just
shoot me for incompetence."<p>"Oh, God," said Daria, lapsing back into English.
"That's certainly a mess, but why tell me?  You'll only compromise your source,
and we'll prevent you from making another try for the information. Your
superiors won't like that."<p>"Because this goes beyond merely my mistake. We'd
rather lose this opportunity than see the Chinese use your weapon against us. 
Tensions over our border have been high lately, and there have been a number of
clashes we've covered up.  A limited war is very possible, and if they had a way
to paralyze our entire command and control system, it might not be so
limited."<p>"Alexei, I'm no hacker, but even I know enough about computers to
know that such weapons only work on systems people haven't bothered to secure. 
While that's unfortunately true of most business computers, it can hardly apply
to your strategic command systems."<p>"You'd think so, wouldn't you?  But we
have it on good authority that your weapon was developed with inside information
on our systems, and has a very high probability of paralyzing them for several
hours.  That's long enough to give an army the size of China's a strategic
advantage they may be unwilling to pass up.  While the Independent States are
inclined to let Russia go to hell, they can't afford to have the Chinese take
possession of our Siberian nuclear arsenal, which means that if it's war, the
whole Federation will be in on it, and given the sorry state of our army after
Chechnya, it will probably go nuclear in a matter of hours.  Battlefield nukes
at first, but that will likely escalate to strategic weapons. I suspect your
government has an interest in preventing this, don't you?"<p>"I think that's
likely, yeah," said a stunned Daria, pausing to consider the probable
consequences of such a war.  "So, where's the disk, and how do we get it back?"
she asked, finally.<p>"I don't know.  I have some leads, which I'll turn over
to your people.  In return, I want to be in on the hunt, and I want the man who
killed my agent."<p>
"You're in no position to negotiate."<p>
"No, but neither
are you.  Do you really think any of us will survive a nuclear winter,
regardless of where the bombs fall?"<p>
"No," she said. "Not enough of us to
mean anything, anyway.  It will be the end of civilization, probably for
centuries." She took a deep breath, and exhaled.  "Okay, I need to clear it with
my superiors, but I expect they'll agree.  I was headed back to Lawndale
tomorrow. I'll leave tonight instead.  Take a hotel room there, and leave a
message with my parents telling me where you are.  I'll contact my people on the
drive, and be in touch with you first thing in the morning.  Okay?"<p>"Yes. 
More than okay, thank you. Here, take this, it contains the information I have."
He handed her a solid-state memory card.<p>"My superiors haven't agreed to your
terms yet," she said, refusing the card.<p>"I know. I'll take that risk.  It's
better if your people have this as soon as possible.  I think they'll still
decide I'm more useful helping you than acting on my own. And again,
thanks."<p>She took the card. "Don't thank me just yet.  If we fumble this, and
it ends in a nuclear war, I'll shoot you for incompetence myself."<p>"If this
ends in war, that would be a mercy.  I've seen death by starvation, and I don't
even want to think about it on a global scale."<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>Slamming the trunk of her car shut with a solid thunk, Daria walked around
to the side, and took a last look around the dorms.  It was odd to see them
without the frames of her glasses in the way, but she preferred contacts for
driving, even if they did tend to irritate her eyes after prolonged use.<p>Her
packing had gone quickly, once she decided that most of her possessions could
remain in storage over the summer.  The trunk held two boxes. Everything else
had gone into the storeroom in the dorm basement, and thanks to an impromptu
beer and pizza party she'd organized for several of the larger male residents of
the dorm, she hadn't even had to carry it there.<p>The party was still going
on, and even seemed to be growing judging by the noise coming from the open
lounge windows.  She'd always made it a point to avoid dorm parties, so there
was some kind of justice in missing her own party.  Nonetheless, she wished she
could have stayed for this one.  She'd been living with some of these people for
three years now, and she realized with surprise that she was actually going to
miss them.  But duty called.<p>She unlocked the door of her two-seater, and
climbed in, deciding to leave the removable hardtop on for now, despite the
beautiful weather.  The car started easily. <p>Although it looked from the
outside like a typical student rust-bucket, her car was anything but.  The
agency's technical section had taken a slightly used vehicle and aged the
exterior at the same time they worked their magic on its systems and structure. 
The engine, transmission, and suspension were a far cry from the original
factory equipment, and the body and windows had been armored as well.  The car
could outrun most other street-legal vehicles, and absorb an amazing amount of
damage while doing so.  She felt secure and in control behind the wheel as she
pulled away from the curb.<p>Before leaving, she'd passed Alexei's information
to headquarters.  She'd used a blind drop to an apparently innocuous web server,
one of identical thousands in a commercial hosting center somewhere on the west
coast. It had been encoded and buried in a copy of one of her stories; to the
curious reader, it would appear to be unused font information appended to the
file by an inefficient word processor.  By the time she arrived it would have
been collected, decoded, and fed to the analysis section.<p>As she pulled onto
the street, she clipped on a headset for her cell phone and hit the auto-dial
button.  At the prompt, she spoke the keyword for the operations desk's 800
number. An operator picked up, she asked to speak to the Colonel, and was
immediately patched through.  There was some benefit to being a former Director,
even if her tenure had been barely two months.<p>"Cynic.  I didn't expect to
hear from you until Monday.  What's the matter, can't wait to get to work?"  The
crisp voice of Colonel Ryan, Angela's replacement, crackled in her ear.  He
always sounded as if he was standing on a parade ground, barking orders.  But he
was an experienced field man, not a parade-ground soldier, and he'd put the
agency back together in the three years since Angela's arrest.<p>"Hello
Colonel.  I'm afraid we've got a little bit of a problem."  She proceeded to
fill him in on the details.<p>The Colonel agreed with her that working with
Alexei was preferable to having him working on his own and possibly interfering
with the recovery of the data.  He did have some reservations, which Daria
shared.  There was nothing to say that Alexei wouldn't try to take the data and
run with it, once it was recovered.  But that was a problem they could deal with
later.  Recovering the data was their priority.  They agreed to meet first thing
in the morning.  By then the analysis section should be able to provide an
estimate of both the accuracy of the information, and potential areas of
investigation based on that estimate.<p>After she and the Colonel were done,
Daria turned her attention back to the drive. It really was a beautiful
afternoon.  She thought about taking the hardtop off the car now that her call
was over, but decided to wait until she stopped for coffee on the
interstate.<p>She downshifted as she turned onto the state highway, and
accelerated smoothly into traffic.  The next few miles were an unbroken sequence
of strip malls and fast-food restaurants, punctuated by traffic lights every few
hundred feet.  She hated this part of the drive.  It lacked both the interesting
curves of a rural road, and the exhilaration of driving at speed on the open
highway.<p>Suddenly, her side window starred with cracks, accompanied by a loud
crash.  She braked in reflex, and saw the shooter in the back seat of a beige
sedan turning for a follow-up shot.  He was only armed with a handgun, but
several shots would eventually break the laminated glass and plastic forming the
bulletproof window.  She accelerated, swerving to the right to confuse his
aim.<p>Traffic was stopped up ahead at an intersection.  To avoid it, she
turned abruptly into the entrance of a strip-mall parking lot.  In the rear-view
mirror she could see the sedan cutting across the road, heading for the next
entrance and scattering cars in its wake.  She accelerated towards the far end
of the parking lot.  If she could get back out on the road, she could outrun
them.  But she needed to avoid flattening any shoppers first.<p>She flew
through the parking lot with a careful eye for pedestrians.  Off to the side,
she could see the other car approaching.  They were driving with less caution,
and slowly gaining on her, but they'd stopped shooting.  Maybe they realized how
likely they'd be to hit bystanders, or perhaps they'd just realized how futile a
handgun was against armor.<p>She exited the parking lot onto a side street and
turned right, away from the highway.  There were other roads paralleling it
behind the stores, and she was less likely to get caught at a traffic light back
there.  The roads were dotted with stop signs, which was why she normally
avoided them, but traffic was light enough that she wouldn't have to pay
attention to them today.  As she accelerated, the tires shrieked: the asphalt
here was dusted with sand from an adjacent construction site, preventing the
tires from gripping as well as they should. Behind her, the pursuing car slid
out onto the road, nearly climbing onto the opposite sidewalk before turning to
follow.  Watching it gave her an idea.<p>She kept her car at a reasonable
speed--although the local police wouldn't have agreed with that
assessment--allowing the beige sedan to overtake her car.  She'd been trained in
high-risk driving maneuvers for situations exactly like this, although, along
with the diplomatic chauffeurs in her class, she'd never expected to put those
skills to use in the real world.  Still, with the poor traction, she thought she
could maneuver the other car into hitting some solid obstacle, such as a
telephone pole, that would end their pursuit.<p>Ahead, the road made a sharp
left, and she slowed and hugged the left curb.  As she'd hoped, the sedan pulled
up on her right, the gunman trying to get a shot out the back window.  With all
that gunfire in an enclosed space, the driver must be deaf by now, but it didn't
seem to affect his driving.  Just before the curve she slammed her car into the
front corner of the other vehicle, pushing it towards the sidewalk, then swung
away and pulled the emergency brake, turning the wheel as she gunned the motor,
swinging the tail of her car around and negotiating the corner with inches to
spare.  <p>Behind her, the sedan had less room to maneuver, and failed to
recover from the shove she'd given it in time to turn. It slammed into the curb
at speed.  From her view of the sharply angled tire, it looked like they'd
snapped the axel on the right front wheel.  That would end any hopes they had of
pursuit.  This far from the mall it would take them too long to steal another
car. Even if they knew where she was headed she'd leave them far behind.<p>She
phoned the operations desk as she drove back to the highway, so they could call
in an anonymous tip to the local police. Coming so soon after Alexei's visit,
this couldn't be a coincidence, especially since, as far as she knew, no
outsiders other than he were aware of her connection with the agency.  Even Tom
and her parents believed that she had an internship with the FBI during her
summers.<p>But her pursuers hadn't been Asian.  In fact, they'd looked
remarkably like the kind of muscle the Russians tended to employ for embassy
security.  Tall, wide, and dense as rock, which seemed a fitting description,
given their comical attempt at killing her.  They hadn't even brought a decent
weapon.  Perhaps this was a spur of the moment attempt.  If they'd been
following Alexei, and had seen her as a target of opportunity, that could
explain it.  But why would his own people follow Alexei, a trusted senior
intelligence agent?  And why would they consider her a target just for talking
to him? There was something here she was missing.  But what?<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>Daria pulled off the Interstate into Lawndale several hours past midnight.
Her eyes burned from a combination of lack of sleep and irritation from her
contacts.  Soon she would arrive at agency headquarters, and be able to remove
the contacts and sleep for a few hours before the meeting in the
morning.<p>Lawndale was a ghost town at this hour, especially this far from the
center of town.  The few traffic lights she encountered had been set to blinking
yellow or red. She passed the mall, where even the parking lot lights had been
turned off for the night, without ever seeing another vehicle.  <p>The mall had
expanded two years ago, adding new anchor stores and a six-level parking garage
to handle the anticipated Christmas crowds.  The garage, due to an odd height
limit in a zoning ordinance, had four underground levels in addition to the two
above ground.  The mall owners had put up a token fight, as underground
construction cost more than adding levels above ground, but to the surprise of
most townspeople they had accepted the extra cost of the largely unused parking
spaces in the end.  Daria was one of the few people in town not surprised, as
she'd been involved in the early planning of the expansion of the
agency.<p>Turning down a deserted side street, she approached one of the many
exits of the mall's new garage, which was closed with steel shutters.  As her
car approached, a transponder under the hood was recognized, and the shutters
slid up on a well-oiled track.  She drove down the ramp to the seldom-used
bottom level, and around a corner into a cul-de-sac, where the solid cement wall
also slid quietly aside to provide access to the agency's garage.<p>The old
agency headquarters under Lawndale High was still in place. The exits had been
relocated and were seldom used, and most of the old staff had been reassigned or
retired.  The changes should fool Moscow into believing that the facility had
been shut down after Angela's status as a double agent became known.  In truth,
the expansion space under the parking garage had been built in anticipation of
growth, as well as to provide a secure entrance.  A small shuttle subway linked
the two locations underground. Already the staff was larger than it had been
when Daria was recruited, and more growth was expected in the next few
years.<p>She parked her car, and went to an unmarked steel door that opened as
she approached.  Inside, she walked down a hallway lined with shuttered gun
ports.  Passing through another door, she paused at a security desk for an ID
check.  Security had been substantially improved since the days when she'd
walked into the old headquarters by accident one day.  She handed the guard her
ID, which appeared to be a photo-id credit card issued in her cover name, and he
slid it through a reader to verify it, consulting a computer screen.<p>The
guard handed her ID back and smiled.  "Go on in, agent Powers, room 216 is all
yours.  You have a meeting scheduled for 9 AM in the Colonel's office."<p>She
nodded her thanks, too tired to even speak, and walked through yet another
security door.<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>In the morning, after a quick shower that almost woke her up, and a bite to
eat in the commissary, she reported to the Colonel's office.  His secretary, a
polite young man named Michael whom Daria knew from previous summers, greeted
her. <p>"Good morning, Cynic.  The Colonel's on the phone with Washington, but
he said for you to go on in and have a seat.  There's a folder with the analysis
report you were waiting for on the table."<p>"Thanks, Michael.  How's the
family?" Michael's wife had been expecting their first child the last time she'd
seen him. Presumably he was a father now.<p>"Oh, that's right, you haven't seen
the baby yet."  He pulled out his wallet and extracted a photo.  His wife,
Trish, held a blanket-wrapped bundle that could have been a football for all
Daria could see of it on the much-handled photo.  "Little Todd, just look at him
grin." Michael was grinning himself, so Daria made appropriate agreement noises
until he put the photo back.  She liked Michael.  He was competent, cheerful,
and one of the few people in the facility she could talk to freely; his
clearance was at least as high as hers, probably higher now.<p>She reflected on
the summer, three years ago, when she'd first met him.  Angela had just been
arrested, and as her assistant she'd been asked to run the agency until a
successor could be found.  Michael had been one of the first new people sent out
to help clean house, as they tried to determine what agents Angela hadn't
compromised.  He'd shown skill with the records systems.  Largely because of his
work, they'd managed to preserve nearly ten percent of the field agents.  When
Colonel Ryan had arrived, Daria had recommended Michael as his administrative
assistant.  Michael had been surprised, and grateful.<p>She made it a point to
chat with Michael whenever she visited the facility.  Her cynical side said that
this was because he was a useful friend.  In her more honest moments, she
admitted that he was a friend, and she had few enough friends who knew her as
well, and only one who knew her better.<p>"Oh, Michael," she said as she turned
to enter the Colonel's office, "the car got a bit banged up on the drive last
night, could you have technical fix it up?"<p>"I saw it when I came in this
morning.  What did you do, cut off a taxi?" he said, with a smile.<p>"No, just
some Russian thugs, out joyriding."<p>"Yeah, I heard about them.  They were
gone before the police got to the accident scene.  Anyway, the techies have your
car already.  They said it would be a couple of days, they have to custom-make a
few parts."<p>"Faster than I expected.  Thanks.  And tell the techies thanks
for me, too."<p>"Will do," he said, returning to the paperwork on his
desk.<p>She walked into the Colonel's office, closing the door behind her
softly.  Colonel Ryan was on the phone, using a headset to keep his conversation
private and both hands free for his computer.  From the sound of the half of the
conversation she could hear, he was explaining to someone how their cyberwar
files had been lost, and why they had better ensure that it didn't happen again
if they wanted to keep their job.  Daria thought, not for the first time, that
she didn't ever want to give the Colonel reason to be mad at her. His ability to
make listeners feel they'd been yelled at, without ever raising his voice, was a
skill she'd love to learn.<p>She sat down in a comfortable chair next to a
coffee table.  The table bore a bright red envelope covered with dire warnings
about unauthorized reading and sealed with a strip of tamper-evident security
tape across the flap.  She sliced the tape with a blunt fingernail, and flipped
the envelope open casually.  After that summer doing cleanup, she was cleared
for anything the agency did, although lack of need-to-know kept her ignorant of
most projects started since then.  But this was her project, and no amount of
tape, red or otherwise, would keep her from reading this report.<p>The report
was disappointingly brief.  It summarized Alexei's information, which she'd
already read in full, and concurred with his conclusions: if the Chinese
received the information, the probability of an escalating war in Siberia was
high.  Alexei's agent, the late Nikolai Abramov, had met with Arthur Chang, a
known Chinese agent, and shortly afterward taken a fifteen-story swan dive onto
a parking lot.  The report included some gruesome confirming photos taken from
an FBI report on the death. Nikolai had diplomatic credentials, so his death had
immediately drawn their attention. But that was where the trail ended. Arthur
had been under surveillance, and his meeting with Nikolai photographed, but
nothing had changed hands. Unfortunately the surveillance on Chang had not
included a microphone. It wasn't clear if Nikolai had told the agent where to
find the disk, or the information from it, but Arthur had not made any move to
collect it if he had. Perhaps he was waiting for something, or perhaps the
information had never been transferred, and was now lost. However it would be
foolish to assume so, when the price for being wrong was so high.<p>Daria
returned the report to the envelope, and sat back, staring at the painted
concrete ceiling.  What would she have done if she'd been a Russian traitor,
trying to sell immensely valuable information to an enemy, and wanting to
survive the reaction of her former employers when they discovered her treason? 
She'd have wanted a means of escape, and she'd have held onto the information
until both that and her payment was certain.  Nikolai must have met with the
Chinese agent to set up the deal, or perhaps to provide some surety that he had
the information. But he wouldn't have brought the information itself with him,
which explained why it hadn't been found on his body. So, where was it?<p>While
she was thinking, the Colonel had finished his call.  Now he sat down in the
chair opposite her, taking the report she'd set down and skimming it quickly.
"So, where's the disk?" he asked.<p>She sat up straighter, meeting his eyes.
"That's the question, all right. I wish I knew the answer."<p>"Well, we know
from the information Alexei passed us where Nikolai started from, and when. 
There are only so many places he could have gone in the two hours before he met
with Chang.  I already have teams walking the possible routes.  If he cached the
disk somewhere, we have a chance of finding it that way."<p>"Hmph," Daria
snorted, unimpressed. "A city's a big place, and Nikolai may have been a
traitor, but he was also an experienced agent.  In two hours he could go nearly
anywhere on public transportation, without leaving a trace. He won't have left
it in an obvious location."<p>"No, probably not," he agreed, with a wry grin. 
"What would you have done with it?"<p>"What would <i>you</i> have done with it?
You've got years more field experience than me."<p>"Yes, but you have the most
twisted imagination of any operative I ever met.  If anyone can second-guess a
Russian traitor, it's you.  How about it?"<p>She smiled.  "I'm going to assume
that was a compliment.  Hmm." She paused, briefly. "The obvious trick is the old
'mail-it-to-yourself' ploy, but he wouldn't do that. It would be far too easy
for someone else to intercept it."<p>"We're checking all the mail collected in
that part of the city, but I agree, it's too obvious for a pro if he thought
someone was on his tail, and since he'd just betrayed his boss, he'd have to
assume he would be followed shortly."<p>"He'd leave it somewhere neutral, where
he could easily recover it," she said. "Taped to the bottom of a bench, behind
some books on a library shelf, somewhere like that. And not on any route between
where he started and the meeting, he'd go in another direction."<p>"Agreed, not
that it helps us much.  As you said, it's a big city and he could have taken
public transportation nearly anywhere."<p>"Well, we can reduce it somewhat. 
He'd only use somewhere that he knows well enough to be sure that it would
remain undisturbed.  I presume we have reports of his normal movements before
this?"<p>"Yes."  The Colonel rose and walked to his desk, placing a call and
giving terse directions to the ops supervisor to start another hunt.<p>Daria
leaned back, continuing to mull over the facts.  There was something bothering
her, something that didn't add up.  She sat up abruptly, drawing the Colonel's
attention as she pulled the report from the envelope to check her
suspicion.<p>"Something?" he asked, as she dropped the report back on the
table.<p>"Maybe.  Do you have the full surveillance report of the
meeting?"<p>He pulled a folder from his desk drawer and handed it to her.  She
flipped quickly through the contents. "Okay, after he left, Arthur was observed
to remain at the cafe drinking coffee until after Nikolai took his dive.  So who
killed him?"<p>"Presumably one of Arthur's henchmen, trying to get the disk for
free."<p>
"But who told them to do that?  Arthur didn't talk to anyone after the
meeting.  They wouldn't shake Nikolai down without orders, and even if they had
been told to do so in advance, they'd never kill him until they had it in their
hands."<p>
Colonel Ryan sat on the corner of his desk, a pensive look on his
face. "Perhaps it was those two bully-boys who took a shot at you
yesterday?"<p>"It certainly displays the same degree of finesse," she agreed,
flashing a quick grin at the Colonel.  "But who are they?  If they're Russian
security, Alexei should have mentioned them, and why try to kill me?"<p>"Maybe
they're not Russian.  Maybe they're someone else's muscle.  Could Nikolai have
been stupid enough to try selling the disk twice?"<p>"Well, if you're going to
double-cross your friends, what's to stop you from double-crossing your
enemies?" she observed.  "It seems like a reasonable explanation."<p>"Yes," the
Colonel nodded.  "Okay, you meet with Alexei and try to find out who else he
thinks might be involved.  I'll talk to the analysts and have them make some
guesses of our own."<p>"This still doesn't help us recover the disk.  If they
had it, they wouldn't be killing people looking for it."<p>"Probably not, but
it's a lead.  We'll chase it until we think of something better."  The Colonel
turned abruptly to face Daria. "By the way, draw a gun and a vest before you
meet Alexei.  I don't want you getting killed if those thugs make a second
attempt."<p>"I thought you didn't approve of arming operatives?" Angela had
preferred her people armed when she ran the agency. Colonel Ryan did not, and
normally Daria agreed with him.  This time she objected for form's sake,
although privately she agreed with his advice; staying alive appealed to her.
<p>"I don't, normally.  A smart agent fears and avoids trouble, and a gun can
dull your fear. But you may not have the option of running, and you've never
showed any tendency to think with your gun.  Besides, you're an officer, not a
field agent. I trust you're smart enough to run if you can."<p>"Oh, yes. 
Running away is something I think I can manage even carrying two extra pounds of
steel."  She rose. "I'll contact Alexei immediately.  My parents aren't
expecting me until this afternoon."<p>"Good.  Your sister's due in this
afternoon also.  Team up with her once she's back. Two operatives are safer than
one, and she should have more reason than most to watch your back."<p>Daria
started, surprised at the suggestion.  Quinn had been recruited a year ago, and
had spent most of that summer in training.  Daria hadn't expected to see her
this summer either, much less to team with her on a mission.  She covered her
surprise with a quip: "You never had any siblings, did you?  You wouldn't say
that if you did."<p>The Colonel chuckled.  "Two older brothers, and I see your
point, but team with her anyway.  She's good."<p>That was interesting, Daria
thought.  The Colonel was sparing with praise.  Quinn must have done something
impressive to warrant such a statement after only one year.  "Okay, I
will."<p>"Good." The Colonel returned to his desk, and the large pile of
paperwork on it.  <p>Daria turned, and quickly left the room, eager to be doing
something.  She'd collect the equipment needed before she left, but she'd have
to get rid of it for the visit home.  A bulletproof vest would be rather obvious
when her parent's hugged her, and very difficult to explain, even as part of her
FBI internship.<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>Daria pulled out of the parking garage in a nondescript sedan she'd
borrowed from the agency motor pool.  It wasn't in the same class as her car by
any means, it wasn't even armored, but it would get her around town, and for the
rest, well, she'd just have to watch out for homicidal thugs.<p>She'd phoned
her father before leaving the agency to find out where Alexei was staying, and
at the same time planted the idea that her car was in a body shop because
someone had dented it in the school parking lot.  Jake had, predictably, started
ranting about inconsiderate college drivers, forgetting that his daughter was
still in college herself.  She'd diverted him by asking about Quinn, and was
able to hang up after letting him know to expect her in a couple of hours. Some
things never changed, she thought, as a wistful smile played across her face. 
It would be good to see Jake, and even her mother, in person again. The last
time they'd all been together was Christmas, although she'd seen her parents at
spring break. Jake and Helen really were nice people, taken in small,
well-spaced, doses.<p>She hadn't liked lying about the car, but she needed to
explain the loaner somehow.  It was even a true statement, in a way.  Daria
hated lying, especially to people who were important to her, so she'd kept as
close to the truth as she could.<p>Daria smiled, as she drove towards the motel
where Alexei was staying.  She wished she could have Quinn along for backup, but
her sister's plane wasn't due in until later.  The thought of working with Quinn
was strange, but also satisfying.  It would be good to know she had someone at
her back she could trust absolutely.<p>She pulled into the motel parking lot,
parking the car on the far side of the building from Alexei's room.  The motel,
a generic two-story building, featured rooms on both sides backing up against
each other, their doors facing outward.  The second story doors led out onto a
wooden walkway, with stairs at either end of the building.  A short hallway led
though the building in the center, with a laundry room and some vending machines
adjoining it. By approaching from this side the car would be close by, but
anyone watching his room wouldn't have seen her arrive.<p>She exited the car,
and walked slowly towards the building.  As she walked, she checked the gun
riding in a shoulder holster under her left arm to be sure that she could reach
it easily.  She didn't need to check it; she'd practiced draws with a similar
holster in training, and tried this one when she put it on, but carrying a gun
made her nervous. She didn't like guns, and the thought of actually using it
left a hollow sensation in her stomach, but that was preferable to dying.  She
thought she could bring herself to fire it if necessary.  She hoped it wouldn't
be necessary.<p>Just inside the glass door on the far side of the building she
paused to look over the parking lot. There were several vehicles with tinted
windows that could hide watchers, but none between her and Alexei's room, so if
they were going to do more than watch she'd have some warning.  She took a
breath, and pushed through the doors onto the sidewalk.<p>As she walked
alongside the building, a woman came out of one of the rooms beyond Alexei's and
started walking towards her.  She was a tall blonde, in her mid-twenties,
carrying an infant in a sling across her chest.  Daria couldn't see the child,
but she could hear it making happy noises as the woman tickled it with one of
her fingers.  Daria relaxed, and looked around.  Still no motion from any of the
parked cars.  It wasn't likely Alexei had been spotted--he was too good an agent
for that--but in this business, taking things for granted was a good way to get
dead.<p>Daria smiled at the woman with the baby as she walked past, and only
realized that the sling on the woman's chest did not hold a real baby as the
blonde drew a handgun from it and pointed it at her face. Disconcertingly, happy
gurgling sounds continued to come from the depths of the now-empty
sling.<p>"Please do not move, agent Powers. I don't want to shoot you, but I
will if you force me."  The woman spoke with a faint upper class British accent.
An anonymous accent, really, one encountered all over the world.  Something
about the way she spoke convinced Daria that English was not her native
language.<p>A bluff was unlikely to work, but worth a try.  She affected a
frightened look.  "Uh, look, I don't have much money, but it's all yours, just
don't shoot me, okay?" she asked plaintively.<p>"Cut it, and get in there," the
woman said, gesturing with the gun towards Alexei's door.  "Now!"  <p>Her
finger tightened on the trigger, and Daria could see that the safety was already
off.  With the barrel pointed at her face, the bulletproof vest wasn't going to
do her much good.  Daria turned, and opened the door.<p>Stepping into the dark
room, her attempt to dodge to one side was blocked when the blonde grabbed her
shoulder with an iron grip.  She was stronger than she appeared. The woman
pushed her forward, and kicked the door closed after entering.  Daria landed on
an unmade bed, and rolled over to look up at the barrel of the gun once
again.<p>"Okay, we're here, now what do you want?" Daria supposed that wasn't
the best tack to take when someone was pointing a gun at you, but she'd always
had a problem with arbitrary authority, and this was about as arbitrary as it
came.<p>"Where's Ivanov?"<p>"How the hell should I know?"<p>"We know he was
meeting you here.  Where is he?"<p>"Look, I don't know where he is.  Maybe he
saw you coming and ran.  Do you want to look in my pockets?" Daria sat up. "Who
the hell are you, anyway?"<p>The woman looked at her, coldly.  The gun never
wavered. "I am Captain Anastasia Penkovskya, SVR. We know Major Ivanov is a
mole, working for you, agent Powers. His usefulness to you is over, so you may
as well tell me where to find him."<p>Daria couldn't help herself.  Seeing the
serious, self-righteous look in the woman's eyes, she burst out laughing. She
fell back on the bed, laughing until tears came. Finally, she sat up, removing
her glasses briefly to wipe away the moisture.  Donning them, she looked at the
Russian.  The SVR, or Foreign Intelligence Service, formerly the First
Directorate of the KGB, was Russia's equivalent of the CIA.  It was also
responsible for embassy security.  This explained the gorillas she'd played tag
with yesterday.<p>"What on earth makes you think Alexei works for me?  Until
yesterday I hadn't seen him in three years."<p>The captain seemed less sure of
herself, but kept the gun pointed at Daria. "He left the embassy yesterday with
another man, who was killed.  Instead of reporting this, he fled to the
countryside to meet with you, an FBI agent, and you arranged to rendezvous here.
You have to admit, this is not the behavior of a typical bureaucrat."<p>"He's
one of your own damn agents, why would you expect him to act like a
bureaucrat?"<p>"Because," said a third voice from the darkened doorway of the
bathroom, "she didn't know I was an agent.  Put the gun down, Stasi, I have you
covered." Alexei stepped into the room, pointing a gun at the captain.  She
looked blankly at him, and then dropped her weapon.<p>"Nice entrance, Alexei,"
Daria observed. "Are you folks always this disorganized?"<p>"Not usually, but
the turf wars between the SVR and the GRU can get fairly interesting.  I'm GRU,
Military Intelligence, in case you didn't know."<p>"I'd assumed that, but
hadn't been able to confirm it.  So your girlfriend here didn't know you were an
agent." Daria looked at the blonde. "Captain Penkovskya, were those your thugs
who tried to kill me yesterday, or are even more people involved?"<p>The
captain had the grace to look abashed. "They were only supposed to question you,
not start a gun battle in the middle of a city."  She glared at Alexei. "Well,
Major Ivanov, if you are indeed GRU, why are you cooperating with the
FBI?"<p>"Melody's not FBI, that's just her cover."<p>"Gee, thanks Alexei,
remind me not to tell you any secrets."<p>"It's hardly a secret. If the captain
had bothered to read the real background material on known agents in the
Washington area, rather than what we give the embassy staff, she'd know who you
work for.  I reported your identity three years ago."<p>Daria knew that. She'd
read the Russian's background material that Captain Penkovskya had obviously
failed to read. She also knew it only mentioned her cover identity, and not her
real one even though Alexei knew who she was. She owed him for that. But she
couldn't let Alexei know their files had been compromised, so she scowled at
him.  Then she turned to the captain. "What kind of agent are you, anyway? Even
a novice knows to familiarize themselves with the enemy."<p>The woman's mouth
worked, her expression indignant, but no words came out.  Alexei spoke into the
silence: "A new one, she just joined the staff last week.  Apparently she's so
busy trying to make a name for herself by discovering a traitor, that she hasn't
had time to deal with the orientation material."<p>"I haven't read it," she
huffed, "because it's locked up in Colonel Barakov's safe, and he's in Moscow
for three weeks.  And you still haven't answered my question: whether she's FBI
or something else, why are you consorting with an American agent?"<p>"Am I
consorting with you, Melody?  That sounds like fun."<p>"Put a sock in it,
Alexei, and tell her what's going on.  We don't have time for your petty
internal politics."<p>"Oh, very well."  He put his weapon away.  "Pick up your
gun, Stasi, we're all on the same side here.  Let me explain what's going
on..."<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>Captain Penkovskya looked even less happy with Alexei when he finished his
explanation than she had before he began.  Daria thought for a moment that the
captain was going to attack Alexei, but instead she settled for verbally abusing
him.<p>"Ivanov, you uncultured incompetent," the captain spat in Russian,
"you've put the motherland at risk, and now you bring in an American instead of
reporting to your superiors.  I'll see you brought up on treason charges for
this!"<p>He replied in the same language: "My dear Stasi, do whatever you
please once this emergency is over, but for now Melody is our best hope to
resolve the situation.  If I wait for Moscow to react, the Chinese will have the
disk back in Beijing before we start looking for it."<p>"This girl?" the
captain asked. "She's barely an adult.  What can she do?"<p>"Among other
things," Daria said in English, "I can speak Russian.  I can also tell you that
the Chinese do not yet have the disk, although we're still working on exactly
what happened to it.  I don't believe you'd have figured that out on your own
this quickly, would you?"<p>The captain, embarrassed, shook her head.  "I
didn't mean anything personally.  But this is a Russian problem, we should not
depend on an American to solve it for us."<p>"Fallout doesn't pay much
attention to borders, and it's our disk anyway," Daria replied.  "Besides, at
this point you no longer have the option of working on this alone.  You can
cooperate, or I'll have you deported by this evening.  You may as well accept
it."<p>"I should mention," Alexei added, "that I met Melody three years ago
when she was a high school student.  At the time she was foiling an attempt by
some Russian terrorists to blow up Washington with a nuclear device.  Don't
underestimate her because of her age."<p>"As I recall, it was a team effort,"
Daria said.<p>"True, but you only needed me for the mopping up.  You found and
disarmed the bomb on your own."<p>"Regardless," said the captain, interrupting
the mutual admiration session, "I agree, we need to work together now.  What can
you tell us, and what can we do?"<p>"Well, I can't go into details, but we know
Nikolai's contact never received the disk, and he's under very close
observation, so if he attempts to collect it from somewhere we'll have it. 
Right now, we're looking for where Nikolai might have stashed it while he met
his contact.  If you can provide any information about his usual methods of
work, his habits, where he liked to eat lunch, and so forth, maybe we can narrow
our search area."<p>"If I go back to the city," Alexei said, "I can search his
room at the embassy for any clues he might have left.  It's a long shot, but
it's worth trying.  Beyond that, I expect your people know his habits better
than I would." He turned to the captain. "Do you have your pair of goons in
town?"<p>"They are not goons," she replied indignantly. "They are simply
enthusiastic, and inexperienced."<p>"And not likely to get much more
experienced," Daria said, "if they go around trying to kill every foreign agent
they meet."<p>"I told you, we thought you were a controller for a mole in our
embassy.  Trying to kill you was excessive, but it would have been an effective
way to limit our damage."<p>"I'll keep that in mind the next time I'm on the
opposite end of the gun from a Russian agent," Daria said with some
heat.<p>"Ladies, please," said Alexei. "Can we argue later?  Right now, I think
it would be best if Stasi sends her enthusiastic agents back with me, and if the
two of you stay together.  We need to make sure our two groups stay in close
communication."<p>Daria scowled at Alexei, but his suggestions made sense. 
Once he left, she'd have trouble contacting him in a hurry, but she had no doubt
his fellow agent could do so with ease.<p>"Works for me," she said. "But you'll
need to take a short break, Captain Penkovskya.  I have to deal with something
else for a couple of hours, and meet up with my partner.  Then we can get back
together and compare notes.  Shall we meet here at three PM?"<p>"That's fine by
me, agent Powers, and please call me Stasi."<p>"Okay, as long as you don't
start talking about color coordination."<p>"Huh?"<p>"Never mind. And call me
Melody."<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>"It's so good to have the both of you home again," Helen, her mother, said
to Daria and her sister Quinn.  The three of them plus her father Jake sat
around the living room coffee table. Helen turned to Daria and continued, "How
was your trip back from school, sweetie?"<p>Well Mom, Daria thought to herself,
except for the Russian thugs who tried to kill me it was a pleasant ride.  No,
that wouldn't be a good conversational gambit. "It was a nice day for a drive,"
she said.<p>"And how was your flight, Quinn?" her mother continued, turning her
attention to her sister.  <p>Daria smiled inwardly, but was careful not to let
it show. Helen was in top interested-parent form today, and apparently trying to
ration her conversation evenly between her two daughters.  It was amusing, and
she could tell from the glint in Quinn's eye that her sister had picked up on it
as well.<p>"Well, you know Mom, it was a plane.  They took off late, served
food I wouldn't feed to a stray dog, and then they landed and parked on the
taxiway for a half-hour," Quinn replied.  "The way I see it, as long as there
aren't any psychos trying to prove to everyone how important they are by acting
like spoiled five-year-olds, and the plane actually manages to land at the right
airport and in one piece, it's a successful flight."<p>"So, was it a successful
flight?" asked Daria, mischievously, as Helen tried to think of an upbeat
response.<p>"Yeah, but I think I'll take the train next time.  It can't be any
worse."<p>"Don't count on it, Quinn," said their father.  "When I was in
college, I took the train home every holiday, and it always seemed to stop in
the middle of nowhere for hours at a time." His voice had begun to rise, and his
face was becoming red.  "Then I'd arrive at the station, and my father would
have given up and gone home, and I'd have to walk five miles to the house, the
damn thoughtless bastard!"<p>"Jake!" Helen cut in. "For God's sake, leave your
father out of this.  We're supposed to be enjoying a happy afternoon together as
a family."<p>"I never had a family!  All I had was that evil old man..."<p>Ah,
the sounds of home.  Daria relaxed back into the couch, sharing an amused grin
with Quinn, as their parents quarrel washed back and forth over the two of them.
Some things never changed, and that was good.  Jake wouldn't be the father she
remembered if he ever stopped living in the shadow of his own father.  And Helen
wouldn't be the same if she ever realized that she was a better mother when she
wasn't trying so hard.  Daria waited for a lull before interrupting them:
"Anyway, I was thinking that we could all go out for a late lunch.  I haven't
eaten yet, and I'm sure Quinn's starved even if she ate the airplane
food."<p>"Oh, but I thought you were meeting your friend Alex for dinner
tonight. You don't want to spoil your appetite, do you?" Helen replied.<p>Quinn
perked up.  "Alex?  Who's this Alex?  Have you got a boyfriend now?"<p>"No,
Quinn," Daria responded. "He's just a friend I met on that trip to DC at the end
of senior year.  He's in town on business, and we're getting together for
dinner, that's all." She turned to her mother.  "We'll probably go to a movie or
something first, so dinner will be fairly late.  I'm going to need to eat
something to tide me over until then."<p>Quinn hadn't met Alexei last time, but
Daria had eventually been able to fill her in on the trip, so she picked up on
the word "business" and quickly changed the subject. "Oh, okay, but yeah, I am
starved.  Why don't we go to Chez Pierre?  I haven't been there since I
graduated."<p>The family squabbled good-naturedly over Quinn's choice of
restaurant, but eventually agreed.  They set out in two cars, so Daria could go
straight from the restaurant to her date.  This also gave Daria an opportunity
to ride with Quinn and brief her on the situation.  Quinn's annoyance at having
her evening's plans disrupted was quickly banished by eagerness for the mission.
They agreed to meet at headquarters before Daria returned to meet Stasi, as
Quinn could convince her parents to drop her off at the mall for an evening's
shopping after Daria left the restaurant.<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>Quinn turned the agency car into the motel parking lot at Daria's
direction.  They'd both changed clothes at headquarters, and Daria had returned
the gun and vest.  She wouldn't need them now that the would-be assassins had
been sent home. Quinn was wearing an elegant business pantsuit with a jacket,
rather than her usual jeans and tee.  She wasn't armed, but her handbag held a
variety of communications gear and other gadgets supplied by the technical
section.  Daria was dressed more casually, but still better than her usual
student clothing.  Her jacket, green of course, held her own radio in an inner
pocket, and her slacks and sensible shoes were more suited for running or
hand-to-hand combat than her usual skirt and boots. Both of them were dressed to
blend into the background in a variety of environments; a good agent was an
inconspicuous one.<p>"Daria," Quinn said.  "I'm nervous.  Are you sure she'll
be there?  How are we going to find this disk, anyway?"<p>"Relax, Quinn.  We'll
manage.  And if she hasn't waited for us, we'll do it without her.  And my
name's Melody, remember?  We need to live our covers.  What is yours,
anyway?"<p>"Anne Corday, codename Fashion."<p>"Anne Corday? Where'd that come
from, some fashion designer?"<p>"It's from Marie-Anne Charlotte Corday
d'Armont.  She was a French patriot and assassin."<p>"Assassin?  Quinn, is this
something I should know about?"<p>"Nah.  I just picked the name because I liked
it.  I'm only dressed to kill in a figurative sense."<p>"Okay.  Remember what I
said about living your cover?"<p>"Yeah."<p>"Well, don't get carried away,"
Daria said, with a grin.<p>Quinn laughed as she parked in front of Alexei's
room, then became serious as the two of them stepped from the car.  Daria was
glad to see Quinn checking out the other cars in the parking lot, as she herself
had just done.  Nothing was moving anywhere, and nobody else was in
sight.<p>Daria knocked on the door of the motel room.  After a brief wait,
Captain Penkovskya opened the door.  Daria entered, followed by Quinn, and the
captain closed the door.<p>"Anne, allow me to introduce Captain Anastasia
Penkovskya.  Captain, this is my partner, Anne Corday."<p>"Pleased to meet you,
Ms. Corday," the captain said with a smile, offering her hand.  "And please call
me Stasi."<p>"Only if you'll call me Anne," Quinn said, shaking her hand.  "So,
where do we go from here?"<p>"The city," said Daria. "I have a helicopter
waiting at the airport." She turned to the Russian. "Have you heard anything
from Major Ivanov?"<p>"Just that he'd arrived and was about to begin searching
Nikolai's room.  I expect he'll call back in an hour or so."<p>"Okay.  If we
hurry, we can be in the city by then.<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>The late Nikolai Abramov had terrible taste, Daria thought to herself as
she walked out of yet another tacky suburban chain restaurant.  Alexei hadn't
turned up anything at the Russian embassy yet, but the Colonel had called to ask
them to check out a list of Nikolai's known eating spots.  All shared a certain
plastic sameness, even though they tried to distinguish themselves with
different themes.  She'd never thought of herself as a food snob, but was a
little originality too much to ask?<p>Armed with photographs that Captain
Penkovskya provided, the three women split the list of eateries, hoping that a
waiter or waitress would remember that he had a favorite table.  Or that someone
would remember finding a computer disk when cleaning.  Or something; they were
grasping at straws, and she knew it. So far, Daria had looked under more tables
and seat cushions than she could count, discovering enough about restaurant
hygiene in the process to put her off eating out for life.  And that was still
better than the men's rooms she'd had to check (after having a waiter clear them
of patrons).  Why the board of health didn't close some of these places was
beyond her, but she suspected bribery was involved.<p>Two hours of this, and
all she had was a strong desire to wash her hands.  Repeatedly.  She sighed as
she walked back to the sidewalk to await Quinn, who was driving the rental car
they'd picked up at the airport.  The car pulled up five minutes later and she
climbed in the back. Stasi was already seated up front.<p>"Anything," she
asked, not expecting results.<p>"No," and "Nothing," the two up front
chorused.<p>"Well, there's a surprise.  There's only two more on the list,
let's search both of them as a team.  Stasi and I can check under tables, and
Anne can search the men's rooms."<p>"Why me?" asked Quinn.<p>"Because I'm your
boss, remember?" and because I'd rather have Stasi where I can see her, Daria
didn't add.  For all she knew Stasi had found the disk an hour ago and was just
playing along.  She'd have to find some excuse to search her before they parted.
She really should have thought of that before they split up to search.  Damn
hindsight.<p>"Damn Alexei", she said.  "How long can it take to search a
bedroom and an office?"<p>"Oh, sorry," said Stasi.  "He called while I was at
the last place.  I have a list of stores plus a movie theatre that we can check,
all at a mall on the other side of DC.  Alexei found Nikolai's credit card
bill."<p>"Well, that's a change from restaurants anyway.  We'll go over there
after we finish these last two, unless the Colonel has another team
closer."<p>"I called ops, there isn't," said Quinn.  "They're all tied up
walking possible routes through the city while we still have daylight for
outdoor searches."<p>"Great.  They get clean sunshine and we get a grand tour
of mold colonies.  Wait 'till I get my hands on the ops supervisor..."<p>"But
Melody," Quinn protested, "you don't like sunshine.  You're always telling me
I'm going to get skin cancer from working on my tan."<p>"I can buy sun block
and a hat, but if I walked into a restaurant wearing a biohazard suit I'd
attract too much attention," Daria replied, mock seriously.<p>"You Americans,"
Stasi said, getting into the spirit.  "You think this is bad?  Nobody is
shooting at us."<p>"Not today," Daria interjected.<p>"Well, nobody's shot at
me anyway," Stasi replied with a smile.<p>Daria grinned back, despite herself. 
Stasi had an infectious grin, and an upbeat spirit.  It was difficult to
remember that they were only allies by convenience.<p>"All right, I admit
defeat.  Let's finish these two off and then we can go to the mall."<p>"Yeah! 
I haven't gone shopping since I got back from school," Quinn said.<p>"I meant,
we'll go check the stores where Nikolai shopped," Daria replied.<p>
"Well, yeah,
but we can do some shopping too, can't we?" her sister asked, with a look of
longing.<p>
"I swear, Anne, I know you like to shop, but we have this little
impending nuclear war to deal with, remember?"<p>
"I know, but can a half an
hour looking at clothes really hurt?"<p>
Stasi seemed to be suppressing a fit of
giggles, and Daria found herself smiling.  It was hard to be sure, but she
thought Quinn was joking.  She hoped Quinn was joking.<p>
"No, but you've never
spent just a half-hour looking at clothes in your life.  The shopping trip will
have to wait until after we save the world, okay?"<p>
"Deal," Quinn said, with a
quick grin at the rear-view mirror.  She had been joking then.  "I'm looking
forward to going shopping with you."<p>
"Huh?" said Daria, caught off guard.  "I
never agreed to go with you."<p>"Oh come on, you'll enjoy it.  And I'm sure you
need new clothes.  You were wearing that outfit last summer."<p>"Yes, Melody,
why don't the three of us go shopping after we save the world," Stasi said. 
"I've been waiting years to see the decadent West for myself.  You can show me
Capitalism in action."  She grinned.<p>"Okay, okay.  Save the world first, shop
later.  All in a day's work for the modern espionage superwoman.  Mom would
approve."  Daria leaned forward and banged her forehead off the back of the
seat.  "Maybe if I'm lucky the bombs will fall here before I have to go through
with this."<p>Laughter from the front seat was the only response.<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>They arrived at the mall to find the parking lot jammed with cars,
apparently the result of some promotional event being hosted by a local radio
station.  The remaining restaurants had held no surprises, but served to delay
them until the evening commuter rush was in full swing.  The drive around the
beltway to the far side of town, although barely fifteen miles, had taken over
an hour in traffic.  Quinn's composure had worn thin, and she'd been cursing the
other drivers on the road for the past twenty minutes.  Daria wondered where her
sister had picked up some of her vocabulary, but decided that she was better off
not knowing.  Stasi was also impressed, commenting that even if they weren't
accomplishing their mission, her grasp of American slang was benefiting from the
trip.<p>Daria directed Quinn to the valet parking stand.  It was a violation of
normal procedure to let their vehicle out of their control, but she wanted ready
access to the car if something came up elsewhere.  Besides, walking from the far
edge of the parking lot was not in keeping with their cover as three
office-workers on a post-work shopping trip, and she was impatient to finish
their search.  Excuses, she reflected, were easily made.<p>Inside, the mall was
a large two-story affair, decorated in neon, steel and frosted glass, and styled
like a Victorian fancy interpreted by Hollywood, with steel beams arching
overhead in graceful curves and interior lighting disguised as gaslight street
lamps.  Merchandise in racks stood outside the stores and signs advertised a
mall-wide sidewalk sale. Scattered down the center of the hallway between the
stores were roofed pushcart kiosks selling an amazing variety of things normally
seen only on late-night television.  Trees in planters reached their tops nearly
to the glass skylights overhead, and crowds jostled in the limited space
remaining.  Above, the second-story balconies lacked the trees, but appeared
even more crowded, with pushcarts and merchandise crowding the already narrow
aisles.<p>Daria turned to her companions.  "Well Captain Penkovskya, you wanted
decadent Capitalism, and I think we've delivered.  What do you think?"<p>"If it
were any more decadent, I'd expect Caligula to ride through in a sedan chair,"
she replied.<p>"They probably do that every hour on the hour," Quinn chimed
in.<p>Daria smiled. "Well, now that we've seen what we're fighting to save,
let's be about our business."<p>They consulted a map of the mall, and headed
for the nearest store on the list, a luggage store.  Approaching it, Stasi
abruptly pushed them behind a planter in the middle of the corridor, out of
sight of the store.<p>"What the hell!" exclaimed Daria.<p>"Look at the man
talking to the clerk in there," Stasi whispered.<p>Daria peered carefully
around the planter, trying not to look like someone hiding behind a tree.  She
considered her attempt a miserable failure.  Inside the store, a middle-aged
executive in a suit was examining a briefcase and talking to the store clerk, a
teenaged boy.<p>Turning back to Stasi, irritated by the apparently pointless
melodrama, she said: "So, there's a guy looking at luggage in a luggage store. 
You break his neck, while I interrogate the clerk."<p>Stasi returned her glare
calmly. "The 'guy', as you call him, is Nigel Thorpe, British SIS station chief
for the Washington area.  Weren't you the one telling me to keep up with local
agents?"<p>Abashed, Daria looked back at the store, where the executive
continued to talk to the clerk.  "Damn, he is?  He's new. Whatever happened to
MI 6's old chief?"<p>"Rotated to Italy two months ago.  I guess you need to
catch up with recent events." Daria could hear the satisfaction in Stasi's
voice.<p>
"Dammit, I had finals, okay?  Anyway, maybe he's just shopping.  We
only found out about this place two hours ago.  How could he know?"<p>
"Perhaps
they've bugged the embassy.  Alexei said he was calling from Nikolai's
office."<p>
Daria looked shocked. "Wait, he called you?  On a cell phone?  Hell,
every agent in town must know by now."<p>
"Relax, my phone has a scrambler. 
Unless they've broken the code, it should be secure."<p>
"Well, either they
broke the code, or there was a bug in Nikolai's office, because I don't believe
this is a coincidence.  Anyway, let's hit store number two.  Anne, wait up
ahead, and if he comes out, call and warn me.  Stasi, come with me, I'll need
you to check for other new agents."  Daria set off at a brisk walk for the next
store.<p>
As the two agents walked through the mall, Daria noticed many of the
female shoppers carrying small yellow bags. They were made of stiff, coated
paper, and looked like ones given out by makeup counters and upscale shops,
although she didn't recognize the brand.  Up ahead she could hear the booming of
a PA system, the words incoherent at this distance, just a bass rumble like
distant surf on a shore. She turned to Stasi, who shrugged a shoulder in
response.  Before they reached the source of the sound, they arrived at the
store, a chain outlet for video games and computer software.<p>
"Well, this
would be a good choice for a hiding place.  I wonder if Nikolai ever read The
Purloined Letter?" Daria said.<p>
"Poe?  I doubt it.  From what I know of him,
he wasn't likely to read anything in Russian that wasn't required.  I can't see
him reading English-language fiction."<p>
In the store, one of the employees
recognized Nikolai's photo.  The clerk remembered him because he'd been looking
for a game that would run on a computer several years behind the current models,
and they had gone through a dozen titles before finding one that was compatible.
Daria asked the clerk if anyone had found a computer disk, and after showing her
FBI badge the clerks searched under the counter, finding nothing.  As they
finished, Quinn's voice cracked in her ear, carried by the bone-conduction
receiver in the frame of her glasses.<p>
"Melody, he's on the move in your
direction."<p>
"Roger that, Anne," she said, apparently to empty space, drawing
a puzzled look from the clerks.  "Follow him, but remember he's a professional. 
We're leaving now."  She turned back to the clerks. "Okay, thanks for your help.
And if anyone comes in asking similar questions, answer them, in fact take lots
of time answering them very thoroughly, but don't let them know anyone else has
been asking. It's a matter of national security."<p>
The clerks, apparently
impressed, nodded and assured her of their support.  She turned and walked out,
followed by Stasi.  Once outside, carefully not looking back to see how close
the British agent was, the two rode up an escalator to the second level.  The
next store was nearly above the one they'd just left, but out of sight.<p>
As
they approached, two men walked out of the store.  Daria's breath caught in her
throat: she knew them, French DGSE agents. She quickly turned to a kiosk selling
southwestern pottery and fake Indian artifacts.  The bored clerk, seeing a
potential sale, bounced up, and launched into an elaborate, and in Daria's
opinion incorrect, explanation of a ghost-catcher hanging from the kiosk's roof.
Daria turned to her with forced enthusiasm.  The two French agents walked past
and went down the escalator, apparently without recognizing her or
Stasi.<p>
"I'll take it," she said to the clerk, to shut off the endless stream
of misinformation.  Turning to Stasi, she said for Quinn's benefit: "Anne, did
you see those two Frenchmen, I'd swear I've seen them before."<p>
"Oh God,
weren't they dreamy!" the clerk enthused.  "I just love foreigners.  They're so,
you know..."<p>
"Foreign?" Daria asked, wondering if Brittany had had facial
surgery since the last time they'd met.<p>"Yeah!" the clerk replied, without
any of Brittany's trademark squeak, but otherwise sounding terribly familiar. 
Daria decided that all airheads must just sound alike, probably due to internal
echoes.<p>"I see the French guys," Quinn's voice rang in her ears.  "They're
headed into the software store, and the other guy's still in there.  Whoops,
they must have seen him.  They just bounced out and are hiding behind a rack of
leather coats in front of the store across the way.  For professionals, they're
pretty obvious about it."<p>Daria took the bag with her purchase and turned to
the captain.  "C'mon Stasi, let's head for the next store."<p>Behind her she
could hear a plaintive query from the clerk.  "But isn't her name Anne?"  She
ignored it and kept on walking.<p>Quinn's voice murmured in her ear, she
thought her sister must have been whispering. "Da... I mean Melody, the English
guy is going further down the main level and one of the French guys is following
him while the other goes in the computer store.  I'm going to follow the English
guy."<p>"Roger, Anne.  And remember they're both pros, even if they aren't
acting it.  Stay well back and be inconspicuous."<p>"I'm on it."<p>Daria and
the Stasi stopped outside the third store: a cutlery store with a display of
knives in the window that had no place in a kitchen.  The captain just
stared.<p>"My God, you sell commando knives in shopping malls?  What kind of a
country is this?"<p>"One based on control by an armed and informed citizenry,"
Daria replied, with more than a touch of irony.<p>"Armed,
certainly."<p>"Relax, most of the people who buy such things either use them to
open boxes, or barely know which end is sharp, and only want one as a kind of
macho pose."<p>"So much for an informed citizenry," Stasi replied with one of
her grins.<p>"Yeah, well, every political system has its flaws, but I seem to
recall encountering a couple of gorillas the other day who weren't any better.
At least our idiots are civilians, or politicians."<p>"Touche.  I won't make
snide comments about your country, if you'll stop reminding me that my guys
tried to kill you.  I'm not likely to forget it, anyway.  When Colonel Barakov
gets back I'm going to be roasted for letting them make such a scene. 
Deal?"<p>"Yeah, okay, deal," said Daria. She'd been getting tired of tweaking
Stasi on that subject anyway.  It seemed obvious that the two goons are been
trying to think for themselves, and failing.  Stasi was no fool; if she had
wanted Daria dead they'd have been carrying heavier weapons.<p>Daria walked
into the store, and went through her routine.  The store manager and his
assistant didn't recall Nikolai, but a quick search of receipts turned up his
name on a knife order.  With that, the assistant remembered him.  The knife he'd
special ordered, a wicked ceramic-bladed thing that folded into a titanium
handle, had arrived and he'd been trying to reach Nikolai by phone for two days.
That was a fairly clear indication that he hadn't returned to this store
yesterday.  <p>Stasi paid the remaining balance on the knife and pocketed it,
telling the manager that Nikolai worked for her, and that she'd see he received
it. Daria shuddered, and hoped she didn't mean it.  That would be just a little
too macabre for her.<p>They were walking towards the next store, when Quinn
called again.  "Melody, the English guy just went into a bookstore, is that on
our list?  Oh, the French guy is following him."<p>Daria repeated the
information to Stasi, who confirmed that the name of the store matched one on
their list.  Daria told Quinn to keep the store in sight, and let her know when
anyone left.  The two of them rode down an escalator, and aimed for Quinn's
location.<p>"Melody," Quinn's voice said.  "I just saw a Japanese woman I
recognize go into the store.  She's a clerk in their embassy, and a suspected
covert MITI agent."<p>"Huh?  MITI has covert agents?  Since when?  They're an
economic policy agency."<p>"You really should keep up with the briefings. 
There was a heads-up about that last month.  We're not sure they have them, but
it's probable," Quinn replied.<p>"What's this about MITI?" Stasi
asked.<p>Daria explained.<p>"I hadn't heard of covert MITI agents," Stasi
said, "but it's possible, and the Japanese would certainly have an interest in
anything that could affect our strategic systems.  We've been feuding over some
of the Kuril Islands between Hokkaido and the Kamchatka peninsula since the
Second World War.  The disk would be a powerful negotiating tool."<p>"Well
that's just wonderful.  Does every agent in the city know about this? I wonder
who else is running around this damn mall." Daria thought she was getting close
to whining, but couldn't stop herself.  This was just too ridiculous for words. 
How had all of these people learned about the missing disk?<p>"What do you want
me to do, Melody?" asked Quinn.<p>Tell me something that makes sense of all
this, she thought, but said "Go in the store and shop, see if you can find out
what they are all after, and whether they're working together. Stasi and I will
wait outside when we get there."<p>Their attempt to join Quinn was thwarted, at
least temporarily, by a logjam of spectators around a large yellow-draped stage
in the center courtyard of the mall.  The PA wasn't much clearer up close, but
from what Daria could make out, it appeared to be a cosmetics company touting
their wares and giving away samples.  That would explain the little yellow bags
she'd seen.<p>As the two of them were trying to find a way through the crush,
someone grabbed her left shoulder from behind. She spun, breaking her
assailant's grip, and burying her right fist in his belly.  Only then did she
recognize him; it was that annoying DJ she'd encountered back in high school. 
She remembered he was named for some kitchen implement, but couldn't recall
what.  As he gasped and folded onto the ground, she remembered: it was the
Spatula Man, and his sidekick Bing, or was it the other way around?  Anyway, the
thin one was on the ground, and the annoying fat one was standing in front of
her with a microphone in his hand.<p>The remaining DJ, apparently oblivious to
his friend's injury, shoved the microphone in her face. This must be the event
they'd seen signs for outside the mall, the one a radio station was
promoting.<p>"Welcome to the cosmetithon, little lady!" he yelled over the
noise of the crowd. "Have you picked up your free samples yet?"<p>Daria
cringed.  Assaulting a radio personality was no way to remain inconspicuous, nor
was appearing on-air.  Well, it was too late to back out now.<p>"No," she
bellowed back.  "I'm just here to shop."  It was the wrong response, and she
knew it the moment she said the words.  These guys liked nothing more than a
challenge.<p>"You have to try these!" he yelled.  "They're our sponsor's new
fall line, and they're completely free of rainforest products and developed
without animal testing of any sort."<p>Maybe she could scare him off. "Oh," she
said, "so you mean they're formed completely of non-natural chemicals, and have
never had their safety for human use validated by scientific testing?"  She saw
him wince.  Below she could detect the other DJ trying to rise to his feet. 
Without looking down, she kicked him, hard, and he stopped, apparently deciding
that the floor was a fine place to remain.  She felt briefly sorry, but
reflected that anyone who went around physically assaulting strangers didn't
deserve much sympathy, and she had to keep the two DJ's separated.  Together
they could flank her, and might be able to delay her for ages, but one alone was
easy game.<p>She smiled.  It was a smile that had more in common with a hungry
tiger than friendship.  The fat DJ seemed to know that the predator-prey
relationship had turned, and she could see him looking for a way to end the
conversation without simply cutting to a commercial. She decided to encourage a
rapid end to it. <p>"Do the cosmetics have a warranty that covers medical
expenses due to allergic reactions, or does the company just put their money
into a large team of lawyers to defend against wrongful injury suits?" she
asked, innocently.<p>"They... They're perfectly safe," he protested.  "Millions
of dollars have been spent on computer models of their interaction with the
human body.  There's absolutely no risk."<p>"No risk if your body is as perfect
as a computer model, but what about the rest of us?" she asked, this time
without the innocent act.  His face went white, no doubt realizing that a
product that depended on undermining the self-image of its users couldn't stand
up to that kind of doubt.  Why anyone should think an animal's physiology was a
better model for human skin than a computer model based on human skin was, of
course, too deep an issue for a radio sound bite.<p>"Th... Thank you for your
interest, but that's all the time we have now, back to you in the studio Mike." 
He fled into the crowd, abandoning his co-host on the ground.<p>The press of
people had thinned during the conversation, as the crowd moved to the stage. 
Daria and Stasi stepped over the other DJ, who appeared to be trying to crawl
for cover under a bench, and made their way past the stage. When they were far
enough beyond the crowd that they could talk without shouting, Stasi turned to
Daria.<p>"I know I promised no more snide comments, but whatever happened to
freedom of the press?  That poor fellow will be traumatized for life."<p>"Huh?
I didn't hit him that hard, and he grabbed my arm first.  That's assault any way
you look at it, and not even freedom of the press allows that."<p>"I didn't
mean the thin one, he got what he deserved.  I meant the poor fellow who only
wanted to ask you some questions.  He's going to be afraid to hand the
microphone to anyone now."  Even though Stasi wasn't grinning, Daria could hear
the amusement in her voice.<p>"Trust me, radio personalities have thick skins,
and the attention span of a two-year-old, he'll be questioning housewives
without a care in ten minutes."<p>"Hey, where are you guys?" queried Quinn in
Daria's ear.<p>"Trying to get past the cosmetics show," replied
Daria.<p>"Well, hurry it up.  The British guy just picked up a disk from the
clerk here, and both the French guy and the Japanese girl saw him do it.  I'm
outside, looking through the window, so they don't know I'm here."<p>"Oh Hell!"
snarled Daria.  "Watch where he puts it, and stay on him, we're coming."  She
turned to Stasi. "Nigel has the disk."<p>The captain nodded, and started
elbowing her way through the crowd, drawing protests, but moving at a faster
pace than Daria could have maintained.  She followed, pulling out her cell phone
and calling the ops desk.<p>"It's Cynic," she said when they answered.  "Put me
through to the Colonel, priority."<p>The phone line clicked and within a few
seconds the Colonels voice came through. "What have you got Cynic?"<p>"Nigel
Thorpe of SIS just picked up something that looks like our disk.  We're moving
to engage, but we've got competition from two known DGSE agents and a probable
MITI agent.  We could use some backup here."<p>"Our nearest people are at least
ten minutes away, but we'll get them moving in your direction.  We'll also brief
the local police that you're there on official business, just in case something
goes public.  Good hunting, Cynic.  Colonel Out."  The line went dead, and Daria
put the phone away.<p>Daria reached into her pocket and pulled out a clip-on
combination microphone and earpiece, looking like the kind worn by many cell
phone users, except that it had no cord.  She tapped Stasi on the shoulder,
handing it to her when she turned.<p>"Here, put this on, it's on the scrambled
frequency Anne and I are using.  It's voice activated, just talk when you need
to.  As soon as we're out of this crowd, you take the left side of the hallway
and I'll take the right, with Anne we can box Nigel in and watch out for the
others.  Are you armed?"<p>"Thanks," the captain said, clipping the microphone
on.  "No, I'm not armed, except for that knife I bought earlier. I sent the gun
back with my agents.  For some reason I thought this was going to be a simple
investigation, not a free-for-all."<p>"Hey Stasi, good to hear your voice,"
Quinn said.  "He's headed back your way, with the French guy following, and the
girl following him.  I'm behind the three of them."<p>"Got it.  Where's the
disk?" Daria asked.<p>"Left outside jacket pocket.  Looks like the French guy
is making a move.... Yep, picked his pocket clean, Frenchie has the disk, and
the Brit never noticed.  Smooth."<p>"I told you they were professionals.  Any
sign of the second Frenchman?"<p>"No, he's probably somewhere behind you,
because I can see you up ahead."<p>Daria looked up, realizing that she was
almost on top of the British agent.  The Frenchman was lagging behind, looking
in a store window.  Thorpe saw her, and reacted.  Damn, he must be up to date on
his briefings.  Unconsciously he checked his pocket: poor tradecraft, as it
would have told her he had something if she hadn't already known.  Finding
nothing he stopped in shock, and looked back, just as the Frenchman looked up
and their eyes locked. The French agent turned and ran, and Thorpe took off
after him.<p>"Goddamn amateurs!" Daria yelled, drawing the attention of mall
patrons for some distance.  "Anne," she said in a lower voice, "stop the French
guy, and watch out for Nigel. Stasi, stay on your side and watch my back in case
the other one shows up."  She took off after Thorpe, any pretense at cover
abandoned.<p>Up ahead the Frenchman ran towards Quinn, glancing back over his
shoulder frequently.  Quinn ran to meet him, dropping to one side and kicking
his feet out from under him with a beautiful leg sweep from the side.  Quinn was
atop the French agent and pinning him before he could recover.  But the disk had
skittered away when he fell, and the MITI agent picked it up and ran.  Various
curiosity-seekers started to crowd around Quinn as she was binding the agent's
arms with a nylon cable-tie restraint she pulled from her handbag.<p>Daria
pulled her badge and yelled: "FBI, gangway!" as she ran past Quinn, scattering
the bystanders.  Off to her left she could see Stasi pacing her, and looking
backwards.<p>Stasi's voice crackled in her ear: "Melody, no sign of the other
French guy, but Thorpe's following you."<p>"Right.  Anne, finish securing your
man, then follow Thorpe and keep him off my back."<p>"Roger, Melody, I'm on
it."<p>Up ahead the supposed MITI agent ran up a down escalator, dodging around
irate shoppers.  Daria followed, gaining slowly and waving her badge.  She
didn't have the breath for yelling, but the badge seemed to work its magic, with
people scattering and diving to the floor when they saw her.  She supposed a
regular diet of television cop shows had them expecting her to open fire
indiscriminately.  Not that she would have in an environment this tightly packed
with civilians, even if she had been armed; any shot would be likely to hit a
bystander. <p>At the top of the escalator the MITI agent turned, heading back
towards the center of the mall.  Daria paused for one "FBI, you're under arrest,
stop where you are!" which had no effect other than to draw attention, before
setting out in pursuit.  Stasi, now on her right, had gained the top of her
escalator slightly earlier, and was already running down the far balcony, trying
to get ahead of the girl. Daria saw a mall security guard up ahead, and gathered
her breath for one last shout.<p>"FBI!  Stop that girl!  She's wanted on felony
charges!"<p>The rent-a-cop seemed to be confused, and just blinked as the girl
ran past him.  As Daria approached, waving her badge, he stepped in front of
her, yelling: "Hold it!  No running in the mall, miss!"<p>There wasn't room to
dodge, so Daria braced herself and body-slammed him into a display of scented
candles, which scattered everywhere, tripping passing shoppers.  Daria recovered
her feet and jumped over the mess, yelling, "What part of 'FBI' didn't you
understand?" as she passed the moaning guard.  The MITI agent had gained a
substantial lead, so Daria stopped yelling and concentrated on
running.<p>"Melody," she heard Stasi say, "I see the other DGSE agent up ahead
moving to intercept the girl.  I can't get there in time, there's no
cross-bridge near them."<p>"Roger," she gasped, "get beyond them and cut off
his escape.  Anne, where the hell are you and Thorpe?"<p>"I'm about fifty feet
behind you, and he's kissing a light post a ways back.  I didn't stop to tie him
up, though; I figured you'd want backup."<p>"Right.  I'll take the DGSE agent.
Make sure the girl doesn't get past you.  I've lost track of who has the disk,"
Daria said.<p>Ahead, the crowd parted to reveal the Japanese girl lying on the
floor, the second Frenchman bending over her.  He looked up and saw Daria,
looked back and saw Stasi, and bolted into the store next to him.<p>She charged
in behind, in time to see him duck through a door marked "Employees" at the back
of what turned out to be a shoe store.  She croaked out a feeble "FBI, everyone
down!" as she followed him, clerks and patrons staring at her in surprise.  She
wished she'd kept the gun, as she ran to the door and kicked it open.  But there
was only an empty stockroom, with an open door onto a service hallway at the
back.  She ran through the door, seeing him off to the right.<p>They ran down
the hall for a short distance, before he turned down a stairwell.  She followed,
gaining on him as he stopped to open a door leading back toward the main part of
the mall.  Going through it, she could see that they were behind the yellow
cosmetics pavilion.  Ahead, he stopped for some reason, and she tackled him. 
The two of them flew though a black curtain, bringing it down on top of
themselves like a collapsing tent.<p>She made sure she had him pinned before
pulling the curtain off, and looked up to see a large crowd seated in chairs in
front of her.  To her left the two DJ's looked at her in shock, to the right a
model stood, a makeup brush of some kind forgotten in her hand.  Daria pulled
out her badge.  "FBI."  She turned to the Frenchman under her: "You're under
arrest."  The audience burst into applause.<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>"Wow, I've never met a real FBI agent before.  It's an honor ma'am," the
mall security guard said.<p>Standing in the security command post, Daria wasn't
sure which was more unreal: a man at least five years older than her calling her
"ma'am", or the concept that someone could be honored to meet her.  But mere
unreality wouldn't stop her from using it to her advantage.<p>"Thank you Mr.
Wilkins.  If you'd be so kind as to secure these four," she said, waving to the
foreign agents Quinn had trussed up like Thanksgiving turkeys, all in a row
against the wall, "we'll have someone come by and collect them
shortly."<p>"We'd be glad to, Ma'am, and it's Commander.  Security Commander
James Wilkins."<p>"Of course, Commander Wilkins."  She wasn't quite sure how
she kept a straight face at such an overblown title for a shift supervisor. 
However, she reflected, one of the things she'd finally learned about dealing
with people was that they often took pride in seemingly little things, and
undercutting that was no way to win cooperation.<p>"My colleagues and I need to
report to our own supervisor now that our sting is concluded."<p>"Ma'am, are
these folks really secret agents?  They don't much look like 'em."<p>If only
you knew.  "We prefer the term 'foreign intelligence operatives', but yes.  Most
governments operate dozens of agents like these in the guise of economic
development departments or similar covers.  They look for equipment available on
the open market that could have military uses back home, such as advanced video
game machines that can be used as guidance computers."  Much more of this bull
and she was going to have to buy a pair of hip waders, but the look of outrage
on Thorpe's face was worth it.  Besides, if they thought it had been
intentional, rather than the complete screw-up that it was, so much the better.
She smiled sweetly at Thorpe.  "Of course, they don't use real agents for such
work, and that's why it's so easy for a sting like ours to catch them.  Just one
little hint of something new at a video-game store, and they're on it like flies
on, well you know..."  If Thorpe turned any darker a shade of red, she was going
to have to call an ambulance.<p>"I can see what you mean about amateurs, Ma'am.
No real secret agent would start a chase through a crowded mall.  Think of all
the shoppers who could get hurt."<p>Ouch.  That observation hit too close to
home.  Time to wrap this up and get out of here with the disk.<p>"Precisely.
Anyway, as long as you leave them tied up, they shouldn't cause any trouble. 
Our backup team will be here in less than a half-hour to collect them."<p>"You
can count on us ma'am."<p>"I'm sure I can Commander, and thank you.  I'll be
sure to mention your cooperation in my report."  <p>From the smile on Wilkins'
face, she could see he was dreaming of better things than being a mall guard. 
She felt slightly guilty at using him like this, even if she was just asking him
to watch some harmless prisoners.  She still had problems lying to people, which
was a definite disadvantage in a field agent.<p>She shook his hand, and he
escorted her out of the command post.  Quinn and Stasi were waiting outside. 
The three of them walked down the service hallway, not talking until he was out
of sight.<p>"Now what?" asked Stasi.<p>"Now I need to get this," Daria said,
tapping the inside pocket of her jacket where the disk resided, "back to
someplace secure.  After that, I think I'll be writing the report on this
operation for a few days.  But if you and Anne still want to go shopping, I
guess I'll be free for a few hours after I turn the disk over."<p>"Yeah!"
enthused Quinn.<p>Stasi smiled.  "I have a similar report to write, only mine's
going to have more things to explain.  My lack of control over the behavior of
my own field agents, how news of this disk leaked from our own embassy, none of
these are going to be pleasant to describe.  But I think I could be free
tonight.  How about if you two pick me up at the embassy around
eight?"<p>"Eight it is."<p>"Should I invite Alexei?"<p>"No, let's make it a
girls' night out.  But speaking of Alexei, where is he?  Even with the traffic
he should have been here by now."<p>"I am here," came a voice from behind
them.<p>Daria turned, but the smile on her face was wiped away when she saw he
was holding a gun on her.  Beside her, Quinn and Stasi also turned. 
Surprisingly, Stasi seemed as shocked as she was.<p>"What the Hell, Alexei?"
Daria exclaimed.<p>"Yes, Major Ivanov," said Stasi. "What do you think you are
doing?"<p>"Recovering the disk.  As long as you Americans have something like
this, the Motherland isn't safe.  If we have it, we can figure out how to
protect ourselves. Giving me the disk will be far more effective at preventing
future nuclear wars than merely disassembling some missiles.  Please hand it
over quietly, I'd hate to have to shoot a friend."<p>"But you would, wouldn't
you?" said Daria, softly.<p>Alexei frowned. "Of course, this is more important
than friendship."<p>Daria sighed.  He was right; a weapon like this was a
threat to world peace.  But that was the same argument turncoats had used in the
fifties to justify handing over the secrets of nuclear weapons to the Russians,
and who was to say that hadn't been even more destabilizing.  In any case, it
was her duty to stop him, although she wasn't sure how to do so.  She reached
into her pocket for the disk.<p>"Careful," said Alexei, his attention focused
on her hand.  "I wouldn't want you to draw your gun by mistake."<p>Obviously,
he didn't know she was unarmed. Daria smiled grimly. Even if she'd been armed,
there was no way she could outdraw someone who already had a pistol aimed at
her.  But she still wished she'd kept the gun.  It might have given her more
options.  Next time, she wouldn't let her scruples prevent her from having a
tool she might need. <p>She grasped the disk, and slowly pulled it out. Holding
it out to him, she looked for an opening.  But Alexei was too well trained, and
the gun never wavered from her heart.  She wished she had kept the bulletproof
vest too, although it would have been rather obvious under her shopping
clothes.<p>As he took the disk, and she cursed silently to herself in impotent
fury, Captain Penkovskya's foot flashed upwards, knocking the gun from Alexi's
hand.  It went off with a deafening crash as his finger jerked from the trigger,
and Daria could swear she felt the wind from the passing bullet.  She ducked
reflexively, pulling back the disk, as Quinn launched herself at Alexei.  He
went down, and Quinn pinned him, seemingly without effort.  Daria thought she
understood now why the Colonel was so impressed with her sister, she'd never
seen such a natural at unarmed combat.<p>Stasi recovered Alexei's gun, and
Daria motioned Quinn to let him up.<p>"Thanks, Stasi, but why?" she
asked.<p>"Regardless of the truth of what Major Ivanov says about possession of
this disk, we gave our word to work together.  Perhaps it's naive of an agent to
think of honor, but I was an officer before I was an agent."<p>"Honor is a
luxury we can't afford," snarled Alexei.<p>"Perhaps to you," replied Stasi
disdainfully, "but for me it's a necessity I can't live without."<p>"You two
can discuss philosophy later, we need to get out of here before those
rent-a-cops come looking for the source of that gunshot," Daria
observed.<p>"What about him?" Quinn asked.<p>"Let him go.  Unarmed, against
three of us, he's no threat."<p>"But he tried to shoot you!" Quinn's outrage
was plain.<p>"Occupational hazard. Besides, I'd probably have done the same in
his place.  He's right, there's nothing honorable about our profession. 
'Gentlemen don't read each other's mail.'"<p>She turned to Stasi.  "But that
doesn't mean I don't appreciate honor when I see it.  Thank you."<p>Stasi
shrugged, and pocketed Alexei's gun.  The four rapidly exited the service
hallway into the mall, and were out of sight before a dozen trembling mall
guards, armed only with hand-radios, converged on the corridor.  To their
relief, they found nothing except a spent pistol cartridge bearing Russian
lettering across the base.  Commander Wilkins turned to the others.<p>"Well
boys, she wasn't kidding.  Imagine: Russkie agents are after our video games. 
We're going to have to put a continuous guard on that store."  A couple of the
younger agents grinned; that sounded like fun.<p></div>
<div align="CENTER">*<p></div>
<div>The black Mercedes Guard S500 sedan, borrowed from the DC FBI office,
pulled into the courtyard of the Russian embassy.  Daria and Quinn stepped out,
leaving their chauffer to watch the car, and walked up to the
sentries.<p>"We're here to see Captain Penkovskya," Daria announced in
Russian.<p>The senior of the two guards, a Lieutenant, nodded. "You're
expected, Ma'am.  Go right in to the receptionist, and he'll page her."<p>Daria
returned his nod, and walked in, followed by her sister.  As she waited for the
captain, she noticed a familiar figure in the shadows of a far corner of the
foyer.  Leaving Quinn practicing her Russian on the receptionist, she walked
over.<p>"Hello, Alexei. Any more tricks up your sleeve?"<p>He smiled, somewhat
ruefully, and replied: "No.  I'm sorry for nearly shooting you.  I only meant it
as a threat. I hadn't counted on Stasi's idealism."<p>"Yes, well you know what
they say.  Only point a gun if you mean to use it."<p>"That's why you never
draw yours, isn't it?"<p>"I seem to recall pointing mine at you once upon a
time," she smiled at the memory of the two of them ambushing each other at the
Lincoln Center.  "But you're right, I'm very careful not to use a weapon without
need.  You rely too much on violence, and look where it gets you."<p>
"Well, I
didn't get the disk, but it's safely back in your hands, so it's something of a
draw."<p>
"I wasn't talking about the disk.  I was talking about your murdering
Nikolai," she said, in a flat tone that carried no emotion.<p>
He looked at her
without speaking for a long time, then nodded.  "You always were too damn sharp.
So, is Stasi coming to arrest me?"<p>
"No, I haven't told anyone." She looked
sharply at him.  "And before you get any ideas, I'm not about to."<p>"Why not?"
he asked, with genuine puzzlement.<p>"Because, regardless of what I said to
Stasi, I do believe in honor.  If one of my people betrayed me like that, I
don't think I'd kill them.  But I understand the temptation. And that idiot did
nearly start a war, so I'm not going to waste any sympathy on him. Besides, I
know that you never reported my real name to your superiors.  I owed you for
that." She paused.  "But we're even now."<p>"Thank you," Alexei said. "If it
helps any, it was an accident.  I had cornered him on the roof of a nearby
building, after he met the Chinese agent.  He tripped over the cornice at the
edge of the roof trying to dodge me. I would much rather have had him alive for
questioning."<p>"Yes, that helps.  I didn't want to think of you as a
murderer."<p>She turned to rejoin Quinn, and then turned back.  "It was you who
leaked the disk's location to the other agents, wasn't it?"<p>He nodded. "Yes,
although I only suspected it was in the mall, I wasn't sure.  I was actually
watching you the whole time, hoping you'd find it.  I planted a bug on Stasi
back at the motel in Lawndale.  I'd hoped to recover the disk in the confusion,
but the crowds prevented me from getting close enough.  You're not too upset
with me, are you?  It was rather amusing from where I was standing, but it
couldn't have been pleasant for you."<p>"Oh, I don't know.  It has enough
amusement value as a story to tell other agents that I don't think I'll hold it
against you.  Just don't do it again." She smiled.  Looking back, the
afternoon's exploits had been rather exciting, and definitely had potential as a
tale to tell around the water cooler at work.<p>"Deal," he said, also smiling. 
That smile.  This time Daria gave in to temptation, and leaned forward to kiss
him.  After a long moment, she stepped back.<p>"Ah Alexei, you really are my
favorite enemy."<p>"Never your enemy, Daria. I'm merely a rival in the greatest
sport of all.  That doesn't mean we can't be friends 'off the court', so to
speak."<p>"No, it doesn't.  Call me when you aren't trying to avert Armageddon,
and we'll have lunch or something," she said, her face lit by a warm
smile.<p>"It's a date," he said, drifting back into the shadows.<p>She
rejoined her sister, who looked up from where she leaned on the receptionist's
counter.<p>"What are you so happy about?" Quinn asked.<p>"Oh, I'm just looking
forward to going to a mall without anyone shooting at me," she
replied.<p>"Right.  You're happy about going shopping.  That'll be the
day."<p>They were still bickering good-naturedly when Stasi joined
them.<p></div>

			<hr>

		</div>
		<div><b>Author's Notes:</b><p>This story is a classic example of how not to
write fiction.  I usually outline a story first, but following the advice of a
textbook, this time I tried a less structured approach. I started it immediately
after finishing the final chapter of True Cynicism, in part because I didn't
want to abandon the characters, and I had some ideas about where they were going
to be in three years.  I didn't have a plot, or even a full cast in mind, and
just started brainstorming as I went.  While this produced some nice touches
(the climactic mall chase, in particular), it also led to me abandoning the
story for weeks at a time when ideas dried up, and the story as a whole feels
uneven to me, even after a couple of revision passes to tighten it up.  I didn't
know how it ended until the weekend I wrote the mall chase (nearly a third of
the story in three evenings, once I knew what I wanted), four months after
starting the damn thing.  Moral: have some idea of what the story is, and how to
end it, before starting.  Making up the details as you go is fine, but you need
something as a guide. At least, I do.  Your mileage may vary.<p>The Car - James
Bond has his Aston-Martin (or Lotus, or BMW, or even a SAAB in a couple of John
Gardner's stories), so I wanted to give Daria a high-performance sports car. 
But I wanted something in keeping with her cover as a college student.  The del
Sol seemed to fit the bill.  They only made them for a few years (at least in
the U.S.) and you can still find them used, but they were never very expensive,
and a heavily-used one is easily within the budget of a college student, even
one with only a part-time job.  Oddly, while I hadn't seen one in years, a few
weeks after I included it, I saw five different del Sols in a week (all
different colors, including a dark green amazingly like Daria's jacket).  Since
then I've seen at least two a month, although I suspect I'm seeing the same ones
over and over.  They're actually fairly decent sports cars, with the right
engine and some tweaks, according to some magazines I found.<p>The Mall - This
isn't based on any particular mall in the DC area, but rather is a composite of
several I've been in over the years around the country.  Many of these seem to
have been designed by the same architect, so if it seems familiar, that's
probably why.<p>The Sequel - Will there be one?  Almost certainly.  I've got
more ideas, and I like these characters.  But this time I'll wait until I have a
plot before starting, and right now one eludes me.  Besides, I have other Daria
stories to write.<p>Other stuff:<p>"She'd managed to publish several short
stories over the last three years, as well as a regular column of film criticism
for the school paper..." - The late Graham Green, who served as a British
Intelligence agent during World War II, and later wrote several novels with an
espionage background, as well as the screenplay for The Third Man, wrote a
regular column of film criticism for many years.  I thought it made a nice
parallel given our Heroine's predilection for writing.<p>"She'd passed Alexei's
information along before packing her laptop, through a blind drop to an
apparently innocuous web server" - After writing this, I read a news article
about terrorists hiding communications in images on web servers, because the
number of downloads made tracking them very difficult.  Truth is always stranger
than fiction.<p>"Colonel Ryan, Angela's replacement" - Angela Li, former
Director of the Agency, was arrested at the end of True Cynicism.  The Colonel's
name is a tip of the hat to the hero of several Tom Clancy novels, but no other
tie is intended (Clancy's Ryan is an analyst, not a soldier; Daria's character
owes more to him than does the Colonel's).<p>"... advanced video game machines
that can be used as guidance computers" - Sony's Playstation 2 briefly fell
afoul of a Japanese law prohibiting its export because of the advanced graphics
processor chip.  This is similar to the problems Apple initially had exporting
computers using Motorola's G4 processor.  Both are examples of how the computer
industry advances faster than laws can change, but also of how things formerly
considered weapons-grade can become commercially prevalent.  That doesn't stop
them from being militarily useful, but when such as system can be bought in any
department store and smuggled out in a tourist's luggage, it does make trying to
control the technology rather pointless.  I rather doubt spies haunt mall
videogame stores looking for exploitable technology, but who
knows?<p>"Gentlemen don't read each other's mail" is a famous quote from an
American Secretary of State, Henry Stimson, who essentially disbanded all U.S.
codebreaking activities in 1929.  These later resumed, apparently without the
knowledge of the Executive branch at first.  See Body of Secrets, by James
Bamford (Doubleday, 2001) for a post-WWII history of U.S. efforts in this
area.<p>The Kuril Islands are a chain north of the northernmost Japanese island
of Hokkaido. Several were originally Japanese territory, but have been occupied
by Russian (and before them, Soviet) forces since the Second World War.<p>"The
black Mercedes Guard S500 sedan" - is their factory-armored model.  Check out
the specs at <a href="http://www.mercedes.com">www.mercedes.com</a>, it's quite
the car.  I based some of the description of Daria's del Sol on it.<p></div>
