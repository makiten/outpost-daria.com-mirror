<p>My Night at Tom's
<br><br>
by Thessalian
<br><br>
Tom Sloane began lighting the candles around his room, humming quietly to 
himself. He didn't want this to be just any old night. He wanted it to be 
<i>special</i>. On his bed lay a bouquet of red roses. It would prove he 
cared. He hoped.
<br><br>
He <i>did</i> care for Daria, deeply. Fine, things hadn't always gone 
smoothly, but it was a damn sight better than the way things had been 
going with Jane, toward the end.
<br><br>
The gummy bear episode had been particularly not fun.
<br><br>
But that was all behind him now. Jane, while fun and impulsive, wasn't
quite the kind of impulsive he'd been secretly hoping she'd be. And there
was no intellectual link to make up for that. And he'd been drawn to 
Daria. And, even though he'd been perfectly prepared to accept Daria's 
decision about not being ready for sex, he was a lot <i>more</i> prepared 
to accept her sudden change of heart.
<br><br>
Okay, so she'd seemed tense.
<br><br>
All right, downright reluctant.
<br><br>
-shouldn't that be telling you something, casanova?-
<br><br>
<i>Great</i>, he sighed. <i>Here comes my conscience. Look, she 
<b>said</b> she was ready...</i>
<br><br>
-and you believed her? every single time she put things off?-
<br><br>
<i>She didn't the <b>last</b> time.</i>
<br><br>
-why aren't you thinking about her mot...-
<br><br>
He choked the voice off and kept lighting the candles. After a moment, he 
started humming again. He wanted everything to be perfect.
<br><br>
*          *          *
<br><br>
The room was full of the smell of burning wax and roses. Eight o'clock 
had come and gone five minutes before. And still no Daria.
<br><br>
<i>She's probably just late,</i> he told himself, undaunted. <i>Her 
parents probably kept her in, or she was in the middle of writing 
something and couldn't leave it there...</i>
<br><br>
-or she's sitting in her room, reading, looking at the clock every five 
seconds and praying you don't call so she doesn't have to explain 
anything to you.-
<br><br>
He told himself it could be worse. He could actually be <i>seeing</i> 
Jiminy Cricket sitting on his shoulder, telling him to let his conscience 
be his guide.
<br><br>
-you screwed it up, tom. you screwed it up when you mentioned the condom 
in your wallet...-
<br><br>
<i>Neon? Where'd she get the idea it was <b>neon</b>, anyway?</i>
<br><br>
-you screwed it up when you didn't let <i>her</i> pick the time and
place... you screwed it up when you didn't actually mention it again 
until just tonight. you let her stew over it, and not only are you not 
going to get any tonight, you're probably never going to see her again.-
<br><br>
<i>No way. Daria stands by her opinions, holds to her promises. She said 
she'll be here and she'll be here.</i> Then it occurred to him what that 
aggravating voice at the back of his head was saying. </i>And I 
<b>don't</b> just care about 'getting any'!</i>
<br><br>
-is that true? really? what about your breakup with jane? you got bored 
with her. and she never put out. is that what's going to happen with 
daria too? if she doesn't show tonight and the relationship does 
continue, will you get 'bored' with her too?-
<br><br>
<i>No. It isn't like that. I care about her a lot. I'm doing this because 
she said she was ready and it might make her happy. It's not like I want 
to make her do...</i>
<br><br>
-anything she doesn't want to do? isn't that kind of what you're doing? 
you pushed her for an answer down in that living room a few days ago. you 
<i>know</i> how she gets when you push her. was she being honest about 
being ready? ask yourself.-
<br><br>
Tom asked himself. And time ticked onward.
<br><br>
*          *          *
<br><br>
8:30 PM. The candles burned on - the room was warming up. The flowers 
were starting to look a little bit wilted, and he wondered if he should 
get some water for them.
<br><br>
Daria hadn't even called.
<br><br>
Tom sat on his bed, still waiting. Daria was a busy girl, for all she 
wasn't as activity-conscious as Jodie Landon. Between homework and her 
own writing, she might have clear forgotten the time. He remembered Jane 
- and the gummy bear incident. She'd been like a tiger when he'd 
accidentally messed up her art project plans by eating the finishing 
touch. If he called Daria now, and she was in the middle of an important 
essay (or worse, a short story), he'd meet the same fate. It wasn't 
something he wanted to repeat.
<br><br>
-you're afraid.-
<br><br>
<i>Oh, will you go away?</i>
<br><br>
-you're afraid to call her because she might be there. because she might 
tell you 'no' and hang up. or you'll get jake or helen or worse, quinn. 
they're not going to be very happy with you after last week.-
<br><br>
<i>Oh, crap.</i>
<br><br>
-so you're going to sit there hoping that she'll show and fearing that 
she won't and what will you say if she shows up right now?-
<br><br>
<i>I'll invite her in, make her comfortable...</i>
<br><br>
-you think she's going to be comfortable </i>here</i>? with <i>this</i> 
agenda? you're fooling yourself.-
<br><br>
<i>She <b>said</b> she was ready. I'm going to take her at her word!</i>
<br><br>
-why?-
<br><br>
There was silence. People who meditate say that the hardest thing to do 
is think of absolutely nothing, and Tom wasn't, but there was nothing 
verbal about his thoughts for a second. He was seeing Daria peeling off 
her jacket, her shirt, revealling a plain white bra that he'd only felt, 
never seen...
<br><br>
And then he saw her eyes. Without the glasses, in his mind he was looking 
deep into her eyes. And the sight he saw there gave him his answer.
<br><br>
<i>Because I trust her. And if she can't ... doesn't feel she's ready ... 
I'll accept it and deal with it tomorrow.</i>
<br><br>
-no disappointment? <i>none</i>?-
<br><br>
*          *          *
<br><br>
At around nine o'clock, Tom hung up the phone.
<br><br>
-no disappointment at all?-
<br><br>
<i>I never said <b>that</b>.</i>
<br><br>
"Dammit."
<br><br>
And the flowers, a little more wilted now, landed in his wastepaper 
basket with a crackling thump.
<br><br>
THE END.
<br><br>
This was just for fun. MTV, don't sue me please.
