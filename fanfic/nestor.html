--Anyone, on what day was the Gettysburg Address delivered? <BR>A
classroom of hands shoot up. <BR>--November 19th, 1863. <BR>--Correct.
You, contextualize this address. <BR>--It was an oration delivered in
the aftermath of the Battle of Gettysburg, now considered to be the
turning point of the American Civil War. <BR>--Correct. You, what is
the draft manuscript of the Gettysburg Address known as? <BR>--The
Hay Draft. <BR>--Good. Very good&hellip; <BR><BR>Too good to be true.
A delusion&mdash;a fantasy. This is not the place to be hopeful.
Intelligent classes must exist somewhere, just not here. Unable to
read my thought process, the class sat blankly. Time to take the
educational initiative. <BR><BR>Standing in a brightly lit room,
Daria phrased her words slowly, already anticipating the apathetic
response she would surely receive from the students before her.
<BR><BR>--Now, who can tell me about Abraham Lincoln? <BR><BR>Light
continued shining; a fly flew slowly around a bulb. These and other
details moved on with their normal rhythms, unbroken. All part of the
picture; silence. A silence that is broken only with reluctance.
<BR><BR>--Uh, wasn&rsquo;t he a President? <BR>--During a war. <BR>--Oh
yeah, he got shot! <BR><BR>Three J&rsquo;s all groping towards their
own version of the truth through mere fragments. If combined you
would have a solid answer, or its beginning. Better respond;
<BR><BR>--Partial credit, all of you. Abraham Lincoln was our
sixteenth president. Now, what is his best known speech? <BR><BR>More
silence. The fly buzzes again, and its languorous movement surely
suits the scene. Getting bogged down in detail; should give a hint.
<BR>--It starts with &lsquo;Gettysburg&rsquo; and ends with
&lsquo;Address&rsquo;. <BR><BR>For a class given the answer, they
took a long, tediously long time to respond. After looking and
judging that it had been long enough (Probably to avoid accusations
of resembling a &lsquo;brain&rsquo;. The disguise of the self to suit
others. Conformity.) Sister Quinn stated the obvious; <BR>--The
Gettysburg Address. <BR><BR>A speech made for the president, by the
president and now of the president. These words linger into an
unknown future, words the world remembered. At least when reminded
forcefully enough. <BR><BR>--&ldquo;Four score and seven years ago.&rdquo;
What is Lincoln referring to here? <BR>The answer comes quickly, but
shows not an inkling of consideration or thought. It comes from that
intellectual giant Kevin. <BR>--Uh, it was a long time ago! <BR><BR>With
a sigh I respond. <BR>--How long ago, Kevin? <BR>--I don&rsquo;t
know! Um, four touchdowns are twenty points, so twenty plus seven is&hellip;
Um&hellip; Kevin stammered. <BR>--Nevermind. No wonder Mr. DeMartino
lost his patience with these alumni. Teaching them must have been a
vain struggle. A nightmare from which he is trying to awake, or so he
said. <BR>--Four score and seven is eighty-seven. What happened
eighty-seven years before the Gettysburg Address? <BR><BR>Thankfully,
Jamie remembers this one. <BR><BR>-Oh! Independence&hellip; For the
USA. <BR><BR>Maybe I should encourage him, as hard as that is.
<BR><BR>--Very&hellip; good. Now, back to the speech. Why is the line
&lsquo;all men are created equal&rsquo; important? <BR><BR>Because
it&rsquo;s the one everyone remembers. Damnit Daria, this isn&rsquo;t
a question for you to answer. Relax a little Morgendorffer, some
poetry will help; <BR><BR><I>One shade the more, one ray the less,
<BR>Had half impair&rsquo;d the nameless grace <BR>Which waves in
every raven tress, <BR>Or softly lightens o&rsquo;er her face; <BR>Where
thoughts serenely sweet express <BR>How pure, how dear their
dwelling-place <BR><BR>And on that cheek, and o&rsquo;er that brow,
<BR>So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,</I> <BR><BR>Lilting, ebbing&hellip;
Just wait for an answer. It&rsquo;s bound to come soon&hellip; Or by
the end of semester. Jeffy shoots up a hand. <BR><BR>--Because
they&rsquo;re equal? <BR><BR>--That&rsquo;s a tautology, but thank
you for responding. Think of what was happening at the time. <BR><BR>This
time, Stacy answers. <BR><BR>--Slavery? Oh no, I&rsquo;m sor&mdash;
<BR><BR>--No, you&rsquo;re right. Slave-owners suggested that slaves
did not deserve equal rights, but should rather be owned like
property. Just think, backbreaking labor with almost no prospect of
freedom. <BR><BR>--Almost like school, Quinn says. <BR><BR>I attempt
to respond, but too quickly the whole class begins to laugh. High
school is certainly peculiar, but it isn&rsquo;t quite the peculiar
institution. Waving to the board I direct the class to answer
questions from the textbook. They can hardly do worse than their
efforts with the Socratic Method. There they sit, working toward
their answers, this day, May 16th. How did they end here in this
class, when so many other possibilities offered themselves? Their
composition is a coincidence. If Kevin hadn&rsquo;t repeated the
twelfth grade, if Quinn was born a few months&rsquo; later, if other
students hadn&rsquo;t left amid the ebb and flow of teenage life?
Their selves are also the product of innumerable incomprehensible
experiences each received in their own minds, forming and being
formed by the stimuli around them. Chance. Whether they perceive this
is another question&mdash; <BR><BR>Daria&rsquo;s meditation was then
broken by the ringing of the bell, its mechanical echo resounding
into the distance. Students flowed out of the room into the hallways,
on their way to the basketball court. Physical Education. The old
nemesis. Yet my students appear to anticipate the prospect. What a
surprise. Yet one student remains at her desk. It is Tiffany.
<BR><BR>--Daria&hellip; I need help. . . With the questions.
<BR><BR>Reluctantly, I agree to assist. After all, the school must be
paying me for something, and I doubt it is the pleasure of my
company. But where to begin? <BR><BR>Tiffany touched the edges of the
book. She saw it and knew nothing. Searching for the heart of
ignorance, finding futility&mdash; <BR><BR>--What is&hellip;the
answer? <BR><BR>-- To which question? <BR><BR>-- The first one&hellip;
<BR><BR>-- OK. <BR><BR>-- And the rest. <BR><BR>-- Could you start
from the beginning? <BR><BR>-- Who was&hellip; Frederick Douglass?
<BR><BR>This could take a while. The facing page of her exercise book
is a void of white, without answer or reason. Tiffany&rsquo;s problem
is not only intellectual, I hypothesize; it is also a product of low
confidence, hesitant to respond for fear of being deemed a fool. But
how can I instill conviction after all her experiences? Low test
scores, demanding parents, valuing appearances over depth. It is easy
to imagine these pasts, for the dead generations fulfill the image
before me. Yet they may too deceive, and her heritage may differ
utterly from what I imagine. Past experiences do not irrevocably
create the present; they merely guide our responses to new
situations. No chance to enquire more deeply into the matter, a
question needs to be answered. Have wasted enough time already.
<BR><BR>--Frederick Douglass was a slave who escaped to the Union and
joined the abolitionist movement. <BR><BR>--Abolitionist? <BR><BR>--
They didn&rsquo;t like slavery. <BR><BR>-- Oh&hellip; Those guys.
<BR><BR>-- Tiffany, do you remember? <BR><BR>-- I think so&hellip;
<BR><BR>She hesitates. Sapere aude! I want to yell, but realize a
calmer approach is more appropriate. And may actually be understood.
<BR><BR>-- Well, why don&rsquo;t you tell me what you think is the
answer? <BR><BR>-- OK&hellip; He wrote a book, about what happened to
him, and spoke to a lot of other people. <BR><BR>-- That&rsquo;s
right, Tiffany. <BR><BR>She smiles, slightly. <BR><BR>-- Thank you.
<BR><BR>-- Now then, let&rsquo;s try the next question. <BR><BR>Sitting
at her side Daria helped solve the problem. She proves by arithmetic
that Leopold is Joyce&rsquo;s father. <BR><BR>-- Do you understand?
<BR><BR>-- Yes. <BR><BR>Tiffany stared ahead in the hope of further
enlightenment. I respond with my own eyes trying to give reassurance
yet all too certain that such a thing is not possible, not now. She
should head off with classmates, lest she too face the wrath of
Morris. And that is not something I wish to inflict upon someone who
has not even graduated high school. <BR><BR>-- Go on Tiffany, join
your friends. <BR><BR>-- I will, Daria. <BR><BR>Tiffany turned and
left the room, strolling down the hallway to her destination. I too
was like her, once. Demanding education but only receiving shallow
superficialities. Yet I made the step onward, and whether she too
makes it is a question I&rsquo;d rather not face. Better focus on the
walk I soon must take. Through the shadow of the vallli of death to
the Principal&rsquo;s office, receiving my payment. Li lurking in the
distance. <BR><BR>Walking straight ahead with barely a glance to
either side, Daria soon covered the distance, standing outside a door
with the title (Ms. Li) emblazoned on its window for the benefit of
its occupant. (Ms. Li) <BR><BR>Knock <BR><BR>Knock. The door rattles
under the impact. <BR><BR>-- Come in, Daria. <BR><BR>The headmaster
ritual. I enter and see again the surroundings of a compact office I
know all too well. The cluttered desk, the hidden compartments, and
Li standing there near the drawers. She knows the purpose of my
visit, but still feels the need to make theatre of it. <BR><BR>--Hello!
<BR><BR>--Hi. <BR><BR>--And how are you on this fine morning? Li
asked. I smell alcohol on her breath. <BR><BR>--I&rsquo;m fine.
<BR><BR>-Well that&rsquo;s good! exclaimed Li. <BR><BR>-- I&rsquo;m
here for my payment. <BR><BR>--Oh, the financial settlement. How
quickly did your class learn? <BR><BR>-Glacially. <BR><BR>--Well&hellip;
That&rsquo;s certainly, methodical. <BR><BR>In the meantime Li has
withdrawn the money from one of her many hidden compartments, the
counting of which would surely take days. Squirreled away, just like
nuts. A nutty nutty office. <BR><BR>-Here you go. <BR><BR>Two bills
were thrust into Daria&rsquo;s hand. <BR><BR>--I trust this is
satisfactory, Ms. Morgendorffer? <BR><BR>--It&rsquo;ll cover certain
expenses. <BR><BR>--Use it wisely. <BR><BR>Mom, sixty dollars, two
pairs of socks, one shirt, replacement bookshelf. T. Lane, ten
dollars. Amy, replacement copy of <I>The Sound and the Fury</I>
(Signifying debt.) Tom Sloane, fifty dollars. Raft, too much to think
about now. Greentree, one quarter. Moore, seven dollars. Myerson,
twenty dollars. Macgillicutty, scissors. Jane, sixteen dollars, two
pizza dinners. This cash is useless. Maybe those teachers were onto
something when they went on strike. <BR><BR>-- I always paid my way,
in every situation, I always paid my way. I brought the same skill to
the administration of Lawndale High. You know what they say, Daria.
You save one dollar, it&rsquo;s a triumph, you save ten thousand,
it&rsquo;s a statistic. <BR><BR>--I fear those words, Daria said,
that make people so unhappy. <BR><BR>-They certainly made me happy,
said Li. <BR><BR>The tumult of physical education again roars through
the walls. Students clashing on courts designed only to test their
physical prowess, Morris chewing out undeserving (occasionally)
victims. The whistle is blowing, the volleyball must be flying.
<BR><BR>--And what does not, Li continued, <BR><BR>--Could be
endless, Daria remarked. <BR><BR>--Let me finish. When I became
principal of this school, I had a vision of a glorious school,
equipped with all the latest in securi&hellip;.educational
facilities. But that vision has been thwarted. If I had my way,
Laaawndale High would not just be marching towards perfection; it
would be already there. If not for certain elements&mdash;
<BR><BR>--Certain elements? Daria queried. <BR><BR>--You should know,
Daaria. One of them is your own mother. Oh yes, when you volunteered
to enter that art contest&hellip; She had to undermine not only my
authority, but the school&rsquo;s authority. A lawyer brought discord
into this school, and that can never be forgiven. What are civil
liberties anyway? Being civil to others? I have more important things
to worry about&mdash;like the fate of this school. <BR><BR><I>The
lawyer&rsquo;s cry from street to street, <BR>Shall weave old
Lawndale&rsquo;s winding sheet.</I> <BR><BR>--But the lawyers, said
Li, they&rsquo;re not the only ones. My school is being
undermined&mdash;from within. Yes, It&rsquo;s all in the hands of the
stu-- <BR><BR>--Excuse me? Said Daria. <BR><BR>--Students. <BR><BR>--The
press is in the hands of the students. <BR><BR>--You mean the student
newspaper? <BR><BR>--You may laugh, Daria, but did you know that the
newspaper is the #2 source of information within the school? The only
one I cannot control, for it was there before I arrived. I never had
a chance. A moment of weakness in the past let them in. One that
cannot be easily fixed. <BR><BR>The past, it echoes immutably in our
minds. <BR><BR>-History, Daria said, is a nightmare from which I am
trying to awake. <BR><BR>--Yes, Li responded, History is yet another
problem&hellip; That DeMartino, trying to gouge money out of the
school coffers. He has also continued to rebel. If only I had been
able to afford those tracking devices after all, but alas. <BR><BR>--Oh
well, said Daria. That&rsquo;ll always be the dream. <BR><BR>--Do I
detect sarcasm, Ms. Morgendorffer? <BR><BR>--Congratulations, said
Daria. Your powers of detection have not weakened. <BR><BR>--You may
question me Daria, but the real truth is that you were never born, to
be a teacher. Teachers teach; you only question. <BR><BR>--You say
that as if it&rsquo;s a bad thing, said Daria. Well, this has been
&lsquo;enlightening&rsquo;, but I must leave. <BR><BR>--Very well,
Daria. <BR><BR>--Um, bye. <BR><BR>That torment over (The second in an
hour, and more are bound to come), I turn and head toward the door,
only to be called back. <BR><BR>-Daria? Called Li. <BR><BR>--What?
<BR><BR>--You know that Laawndale High is not the first school I have
been principal of. Why Oakdale High also received my fine
supervision. They had no problems. They had no unruly elements, and
you know what that is? <BR><BR>--Do tell, Daria sardonically sighed.
<BR><BR>--Because she never let them in; she never let them in&hellip;
<BR><BR>On her efficient figure through the panels of frosted glass
the light shone artificial rays, burning further dreams securely into
her mind.
