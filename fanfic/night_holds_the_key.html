looked fondly upon the snoring figure splayed across the couch.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The sight was simultaneously familiar
and strange.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Trent, wearing only a
pair of badly ripped jeans: fast asleep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>That was about right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That
it was ten thirty at night was another thing altogether.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Night holds the key," he once told
her, ages ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither of them had
been entirely sure what he meant at the time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
supposed he had enough of keys for today, or any other day for that
matter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The stint at the KeyOsk
was supposed to be temporary, but "temporary" wound up being a little longer
than expected. At least the key duplication business wasn't exactly
thriving.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He remained prolific a
songwriter as ever, writing lyrics between serving customers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was a lousy minimum wage job, but it
was a job, and jobs were scarce for those who <i>had</i></span><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'> college degrees, let alone those who
didn't.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was a start.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For the first time in
his life, Trent was taking initiative.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Daria only wished it could have been under different, better
circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She made a brief
mental note to tell him later about the "help wanted" sign she'd seen posted in
the window of the little music store on the corner of Fremont and Main, earlier
that day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She supposed it probably
wouldn't pay any better than the KeyOsk job, but at least it would suit him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
tiptoed into the kitchen and opened the cupboard, wincing at every squeak of
the hinge and every light scrape and bang as she retrieved their smallest metal
pot and placed it as quietly (not quietly enough) as she could on the
burner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She opened the frig,
checked the date on the milk, sniffed the carton just to be sure, and poured
the last of its contents into the pot. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"Can't

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Startled,
Daria dropped the empty milk carton onto the floor.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She whirled around to face him.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"Jesus, Trent, you almost gave me a heart attack.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I thought you were asleep," she hissed,
before regaining composure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"I
was," he said, as he bent over and picked up the carton.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I woke up when I heard you moving
around, in here."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"Oh,
sorry," she replied, contritely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"Nah,
it's okay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Still getting used to
it all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Working regular
hours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sleeping at night."<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria took the carton from Trent and
proceeded to fold it before putting it in the trashcan.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"My turn to drive Janie to physical
therapy tomorrow, right?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Daria
bit her lip and nodded then looked down at the floor. Trent traced an index
finger along the side of her face, starting from her temple and ending just
beneath her chin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She looked so
small and tired.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And sad.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He tilted her face upward so that she
met his gaze.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"You
know Janie.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She'll bounce back,"
he promised.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Hard
to picture her bouncing back when you've seen her with her legs pinned between
a car and a newsstand,</i></span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>
Daria thought in reply.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her
expression contorted with the agonizing memory of that night and immediately
Trent wished he had not said anything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"It'll

style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"I'd
like to believe that," she mumbled, jerking away.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She fiddled with the knob and set the burner on medium, then
grabbed a wooden ladle from the oversized mug on the counter and began to stir.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"Doc

nodded gravely and paused before sharply changing the subject.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I saw a help wanted sign up at the
music store on Fremont.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You should
apply."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>"Already

</span>"They were looking for a cashier, but I overheard the manager of the
place yelling on the phone to someone about their guitar teacher quitting on
them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Guy moved to New York or
something.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I have an interview day
after tomorrow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For the guitar
teacher position, I mean."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>"That's
great," Daria said, trying with difficulty to sound enthusiastic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>"Mm."
Trent regarded her silently, his expression unreadable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Daria
tugged at the hem of her worn Mark Twain nightshirt, thinking of something else
to say.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Your futon ought to be
here tomorrow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I moved Jane's big
easel out of the studio-office and into the storage closet of our covered
parking space... just until we can... um, figure something out.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I might need help moving my desk out
here, though."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

leave it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'll push it against the
other wall so you can still have your office.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>If you want.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
don't mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'll mostly just be
