<p class=MsoNormal>The sky was already turning pink in the east as Mystik
Spiral stumbled out the back door - the musician's door - of the club,
instruments in hand, their feet barely leaving the ground as they trudged
forward.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Trent and Jessie carried
their guitars, while Max hauled his drumkit behind them on a cart, which looked
to be the only thing holding him upright.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nick was walking beside him, bass in hand, while the two discussed their
mutual performances that night in voices low from fatigue but no less
vitriolic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Trent did his best not
to notice, not to think about what they were saying, or what it meant.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Tank was waiting for them; Trent
hauled open the back door and they tossed in their guitars, then helped Max break
down and store the drums.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No words
were exchanged save what were necessary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When they were finished, Jessie and Max headed inside the van, but Nick
stopped Trent before he could make it to the driver's seat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Listen, man," he started in a no-nonsense tone, "I've
enjoyed being part of the band and all, but I don't know how much longer I can
stand to play with a drummer who couldn't keep a steady rhythm with a
pacemaker."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Hey, dude," Trent replied; he'd known this conversation was
coming for some time now, and he'd been dreading it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"It's just Max, man.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He does okay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He works for
our sound."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"He sucks!" Nick replied.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"He's holding us back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>How are we supposed to get any decent gigs if our drummer can't hold us
all together?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And I really need some
good-paying jobs soon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've got a
daughter to support, y'know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She's
starting kindergarten and I can't even afford to pay for her school supplies.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If we don't start making some real
money soon, the kind we talked about making when we first started out, then I'm
going to have to find something better."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trent winced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He knew that ultimatum; ironically enough, Max had given him a similar
one not too long before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He didn't
have a kid, but he had bills, and couldn't take much more of Nick's nagging either.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Trent wondered if Max could hear them
through the Tank's metal walls.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"We're making progress," Trent told him.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Look at us; we're over a hundred miles
from Lawndale right now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Word
about the Spiral is getting out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It won't be too long before some record exec hears about us and wants to
sign the next big thing."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Next big thing?" Nick said incredulously.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"We don't sound like N'Sync or
Creed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't think any record
company is going to want us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Trent, I think I'll be leaving the band soon.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I'll stay until we've played all the dates we have lined up
right now, and if I can, I'll stick around until you can find a new bassist,
but after that I'm gone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I just
can't live on your dreams anymore."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nick turned, walked around the side of the van, and got in.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Trent hopped into the driver's seat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Inside, Jessie and Max were already dozing in the back,
Jessie against the wall, Max leaning on his bass drum.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nick took a quick seat, as far away
from Max as he could get, and quickly drifted off.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Trent was virtually alone as he cranked up the ancient van
and, with a belch of black smoke behind them, set off along the vacant highway
into the rising sun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He turned on the radio, but all he could find were country
stations, which he loathed, and oldies stations, which he loathed but a little
less.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since he hated driving in
complete silence, he left the tuner on the oldies station, volume just high
enough so that he could notice the sound, but could ignore what he was actually
hearing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The mumbled sounds blended
well with the dawn-lit, barren landscape passing by the windows.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trent had known for a long time that this day was coming;
Nick and Max had never gotten along, and things had just gotten worse as time
had progressed but the band had not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The big dreams they had had as kids putting together their first real
band, listening to Nirvana and thinking that they too could make it to that
level, had never materialized.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They had never progressed beyond playing local clubs, and though he had
told Nick that this gig meant the start of something big for them, he knew it
wasn't true.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It had just been an
act of desperation on the part of the bar's owner when his regular band had
cancelled at the last minute and the Spiral was the only band who could make
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Which in itself was
pathetic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now Nick was leaving,
and probably Max as well, soon enough.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then it would just be Jessie and him, and Trent didn't know what they
would do then.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Janey's going off to college soon, too.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She thinks she needs it to be an
artist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But that's not for me,
man.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've got to be free to follow
my own muse.</i><span style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But how free was he, when he couldn't get to where he wanted
to go?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What if he really did end
up playing covers in some sad bar band for the rest of his life?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria, the smartest person he had ever
known, had once told him that it took guts to pursue a dream, and that at least
for right now he was doing exactly what he wanted to do.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><i>But that's not how I want to
end up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I won't be doing exactly
what I want to do then.</i><span style='font-style:normal'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Trent couldn't see any life, any
future, ahead of him without music, but music didn't seem to be giving him the
life and the future that he wanted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></span><i>How am I supposed to say something to the world if the world
isn't listening?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Perfect three-part harmonies suddenly emanated from the
speakers, a sound head and shoulders better than they sappy Fabian song they
had been playing a moment before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Trent soaked it in, both the music and the lyrics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1>He's a real nowhere man</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Sitting in his nowhere land<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Making all his nowhere plans<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>For nobody<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Is that what I am, a nowhere man?</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> Trent thought as the chiming guitars entered and
took the song to a new level, blending beautifully with John, Paul, and
George's voices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><i>What if
I really am in a nowhere land, making nowhere plans?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Is that where I'm going to end up?</i><span
style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
looked back at the three guys sleeping behind him, their faces in repose,
emptied of the worries that troubled him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></span><i>They</i><span style='font-style:normal'> didn't look lost; at
least, no more than normal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
then, Nick was moving on, and probably so was Max, and Jessie didn't really
have a destination to begin with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He wasn't making his plans for them, but he wasn't sure any more if his
plans were any good for himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>So maybe his plans really were for nobody.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><i>Doesn't have a point of view<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><i>Knows not where he's going to<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><i>Isn't he a bit like you and me?<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Yep, a bit like me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I'm like this road.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I keep
on driving and driving down it, but it doesn't look any different.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I know where I'm going on this road,
but where will I go after that?</i><span style='font-style:normal'><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Janey had already suggested he move
with her to Boston, start up a band there.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But he wouldn't be any better there, and while the Spiral
was the big cheese in Lawndale, because there really wasn't hardly anyone else,
he'd be nothing in Boston.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><i>Maybe
I should go anyway. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>For
Janey.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She needs me.</i><span
style='font-style:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But he
knew he was just fooling himself there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She didn't need him anymore, hadn't needed him for years.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That couldn't be his road any longer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1>Nowhere man, please listen</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>You don't know what you're missing<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Nowhere man, the world is at your command.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maybe that was it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The world was at his command.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>All he had to do was take it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He could join the wandering Lanes, visit faraway spots where he could
reinvent his music, come back the sage traveler and impart his wisdom in
song.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As the guitar solo
crescendoed, his mood followed suit; he knew what he would do.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He would shake the dust of this little
town off his feet and see the world, leave all these little people, all the
ones with the lack of vision, behind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He could see himself sitting on mountaintops, discussing deep thoughts
with Buddhist monks, or on the road with gypsies, learning their wild
songs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What kept him here anymore?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1>He's as blind as he can be</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Just sees what he wants to see<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Nowhere man, can you see me at all?<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Except that the whole reason he wasn't a wandering Lane is
because that lifestyle didn't appeal to him at all.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He liked his comforts, sleeping whenever he wanted in his
nice warm bed, and then out playing music at all hours of the night, maybe
slipping in a joint here and there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He had enjoyed that life, and even if things were changing, he didn't
want the life his family had chosen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As the lyrics repeated and then faded out, Trent found himself right
back where he had started; the life he had known for so long was ending, but he
wasn't sure what there was to replace it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The sun was above the horizon now, and though it was still
pretty red, Trent squinted when he had to look directly at it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It obscured his view, confused his
eyes; he could see the road right ahead of him, but no further.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Tank rattled on, his hands steady
at the helm, towards Lawndale and the next morning, and the mornings after
that.</p>
