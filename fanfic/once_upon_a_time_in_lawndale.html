<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Author's Note: This
story is largely based on the movie <I>C'era una volta il West</I>
(in English, <I>Once Upon a Time in the West</I>), Directed by Sergio
Leone, and written by Dario Argento, Bernardo Bertolucci, and Sergio
Leone. Though the identity of the Red-Haired Woman should be fairly
obvious, the name is omitted in the same way Harmonica was never
identified in the movie. Ryan Mickelson is my avatar, and I figured
he deserved a bit of abuse.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter
One</FONT>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Timothy O"Neill
was in charge of a lonely train depot in the middle of the Texas
wastelands, and he"d tell you he did a darn good job of it
because of his positive attitude. (Granted, he might be the only one
who"d use those words.) On this day, he wasn"t expecting
too much trouble. A train would come through in 15 minutes, one which
usually just delivered mail and maybe a passenger or two, and he"d
take in the mail and watch for potential customers for later trains.
Some days, the only person he"d see all day would be the
cleaning woman, a Native who rarely spoke with him, despite (or
possibly because of) his attempts to "build team unity"
and "establish a better manager/employee bond".


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He realized, however,
that that today would be different when the door to the station house
creaked open. A tall man with short blonde hair stood there. His
name, Jamie, was unknown to most, a fact he strove to correct in the
near future. His black hat and yellow duster were almost as
eye-catching as the sawed-off Winchester rifle in his belt holster.
Two other doors opened, with two similarly attired men revealed in
their doorway. One man with black hair, named Joey, and one with
light brown hair, named Jeffy, spread out their dusters to reveal the
pistols they carried in their holsters. They walked inside the
station house, and though the woman tried to leave, Jamie stopped
her. Timothy was not worried about the guns &ndash; after all,
everyone had those scary things around these parts &ndash; but didn"t
like these men inside when they should be outside. "Um, excuse
me, but if you wish to purchase tickets, you"ll have to..."
Joey looked him dead in the eye. "Um, have to go around to the
front of...oh, well I guess it"ll be all right." He
retreated behind his desk, as Jeffy fussed over the bird in a cage,
which promptly bit his finger as he tried to pet it, causing him to
yell in pain.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Timothy turned to Joey,
who was right across the desk from him now. "Three of you,
right?" Joey didn"t move a muscle, but continued to stare
at him coolly. Timothy took what he thought was the hint, and handed
the man three tickets. He took them, and held them up, looking at
them curiously. Timothy smiled. "That"ll be seven
dollars..." Joey let go of the tickets, letting them fly
away in the breeze. "And, um, and fifty cents..."
The man grabbed Timothy by his neck and dragged him into a nearby
locker, locking him inside. At the same time, the cleaning woman ran
away, muttering things that, although nobody in earshot could
understand them, were crystal clear from her inflection.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three men took up
positions around the platform to await the train"s arrival.
Jeffy went to the left, checking for anyone who may be hiding. All he
found was a stray dog that mistook his leg for a tree. Jamie went to
the right, wrapped his duster around his horse's saddle, and waited
under a water mill that he soon discovered had sprung a slow leak. He
had taken off his hat to fan his face when the first drop fell on his
head. He was upset, but then got the idea to replace his hat on his
head. However, he put it on upside down under the leak to catch the
water.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Joey, the default
leader of the group, relaxed on a bench. The heat he could stand, but
the telegraph machine that started transmitting once he sat down was
a different matter. Seeking to silence it, he pulled a wire out of
it. He relaxed, but it started up again, as he had apparently pulled
the wrong wire. He then pulled all the wires out, waited a moment,
heard nothing, then nodded at it in triumph before resuming his rest.
However, soon a persistent fly started to annoy him. It landed on his
face, which was full of stubble and sweat, and kept coming back. He
tried blowing and shaking it off. He waved his hand, and it flew to a
wall. He decided to pull out his gun, and watched the fly until it
finally rested on the wall, near his hand. He moved calmly, and then
trapped the fly in the gun barrel. Unfortunately, the fly had been
over his hand as the gun came down, and Joey cried out as the barrel
slammed into his hand. Still, the fly was trapped.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sound of a train
came from off to the left, and the men walked into position. Jamie
took off his hat, still balanced upside down, and drank the water
that had gathered. Unfortunately, the water had mixed with the hair,
dead skin, and other grime that had accumulated in the hat, and he
promptly spit it out. Joey took his hand off the gun barrel and let
the fly escape, cursing it for what happened to his hand.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The train arrived at
the station, and the three men were ready. When a door slid open, all
went for their guns, but only a porter dropping off mail was seen.
This was not the man they were after, so they left their guns in
their holsters. The door closed, and after a minute, the train
started leaving. The men gathered in the center of the platform and
got ready to leave. However, as the last train cars passed by, all
three men heard a harmonica playing over the train"s noise and
turned back around.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the other side of
the track, a woman with long strawberry-blonde hair stood, playing an
old beat-up harmonica. Her simple blouse and vest and utilitarian
pants stood in defiance to the beautifully made-up face that
accompanied them. She held a bundle in her right hand even as she
played the harmonica with her left. She stopped playing, and let the
harmonica hang from the tether around her neck. "Hi boys! It's
great to meet you here, but, um, you're obviously not the girl I was
supposed to meet." Her voice was enthusiastic, but seemed
artificially so.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Joey smiled. "Um,
yeah; she sent us."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman looked over
at the horses stabled near the station house and smirked. "Gee,
that's soooo nice of her. Did you remember to bring a horse for me?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Joey turned to look, as
if he didn"t know there were only three horses. "Oops,
um, actually, it looks like we"re one short." All three
men laughed, though Jamie wasn't exactly sure why he was laughing.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman shook her
head slowly, grinning as she rolled her eyes. "I guess you
weren't hired for your math skills. I see two too many."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Joey and Jeffy lost the
smiles on their faces upon hearing that remark. So did Jamie, though
he took a few seconds longer to figure out what she meant. All three
got ready to draw their weapons.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jeffy reached for his
pistol, which led to all four drawing their weapons. However, as the
lady"s pistol was hidden atop her bundle, all she had to do was
grab it and drop the bundle, which she"d been practicing all
trip. The extra second was enough for her to shoot all three before
any of them had the chance to shoot. Joey and Jeffy dropped
immediately, but the shot on Jamie had been made in haste, and he
still had enough time to raise his rifle and fire, hitting the
woman's torso, before he dropped at the same time she did. Time
passed, and nobody moved.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly, after a few
seconds had passed, the woman opened her eyes and sat up. She took
stock of the situation. All three guys now lay on the ground,
motionless. She looked at the new hole in her left shoulder. Her
shoulder stung, and her arm wouldn't be moving much on its own for a
while, but she would live. She buttoned up her vest so that her arm
could be held in place. Finally, she stared at the bullet hole.
"Dammit, I just bought this blouse, too."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter
Two</FONT>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amanda Lane looked down
the sight of her shotgun. Her targets were in sight, so she pulled
the trigger. Hearing the sound of the report, the targets flew up and
out of the tall grass, except for the one hit. Amanda raised her
sights and fired a second shot, which found its target. The second
pheasant dropped to the ground.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amanda"s 8-year
old daughter, Jane, ran up to the fallen bird. Picking it up by its
feet, she raised the bird up and called out, "Hey mom, look!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amanda smiled at her
daughter. "That"s enough for now. It's getting late, come
on home." These two pheasants would be plenty for the four of
them after the celebration was over.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane walked back, and
spied a couple more pheasants in the brush. She smiled, crept up to
them, and jumped to startle them. As they flew up, she pretended to
shoot at them, making boisterous gun noises with her mouth. "Bang,
bang, boom and stuff! Pew-pew!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amanda frowned. "Jane!"
The girl turned around, looked at her mother, grabbed the other bird,
and ran towards home. Amanda didn"t like shooting animals,
unless it was necessary to survive. The last few years on the farm
had made it necessary, but that was all to change in the weeks to
come.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane ran up to her
brother at the table outside the house. He was supposed to be slicing
a loaf of bread for the meal to come, but was actually sleeping,
standing up, with the loaf and a knife in his hand. "Trent,
look!" she said, showing her brother the pheasants.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The 13-year old boy
woke up, looked at his sister and smiled, before continuing slicing.
Jane, noticing her brother"s apparent disinterest, grabbed a
bit of food from the table. Trent, suddenly interested, grumbled,
"Hey," causing Jane to drop the food.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just then, the cicadas
that had been chirping loudly all around them stopped suddenly. All
three stopped what they were doing and looked around. Nobody seemed
to be coming, even though the cicadas remained silent. After about 15
seconds that seemed to stretch into hours, the cicadas resumed their
song, to the relief of Amanda. "Jane, what are you doing? Go
inside quick and get washed." Jane rushed to do so.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trent called after
Jane. "And don't touch the apple pie or the roast."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amanda turned to Trent.
"I suppose Wind"s already left for the station."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trent thought for a
moment. "I thought there was something I was supposed to remind
him about."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amanda rolled her eyes.
"Dammit Wind, hurry up!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A young man"s
voice from inside the house yelled, "Coming Mom!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amanda turned to her
youngest son and half-snapped at him. "Fatten those slices,
Trent. We're having a party, aren't we?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trent looked at the
slices he"d made so far, which were about a half-inch thick.
"But these are the same slices as usual."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amanda looked at Trent
again, then at the slices, and sighed. "Yes, as usual."
She walked over to Trent and put her arm around his shoulders. "I"m
sorry Trent, but soon you'll be able to cut those slices as thick as
a door if you want. I'll be able to get you that new guitar you've
been asking for. None of us will have to work any more."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trent smiled at his
mother, half skeptical, but the other half really wanting to believe
her. "We're going to be rich, Mom?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amanda thought about
her plan, and about what could happen to ruin the whole thing. She
also thought about how happy it would make her once she saw it
through. "Who knows? Our fates are cast to the wind."
Hearing herself, she turned to the house, and towards the boy who
still hadn't left. "Wind!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wind Lane ran out and
started running for their horse-drawn wagon. Amanda saw this and
stopped him. "Wait a moment. Look at the dust on those boots.
Clean them." Wind started running back into the house,
remembered the cleaning towel in his coat pocket, and rushed over to
a bench to wipe off his shoes. Amanda sighed. "The train will
come in, and nobody will be there to meet your father."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wind looked up at
Amanda. "My father died six years ago."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amanda scowled at Wind,
then looked up into the air, thoughtful. "Hmm, I thought your
father ran off to be in the traveling medicine show."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trent corrected her.
"That was Janey"s and my father. Vincent was Wind's
father."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amanda looked sad.
"That's right. He was so convinced that Popocatepetl's eruption
would stay still long enough to develop a photograph."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wind started crying.
"And now he's gone, just like Katie!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trent rolled his eyes.
"You only went out with her for a month last year, and you've
been crying ever since. Move on, man."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amanda looked to her
oldest surviving child. "Wind, if you hold a butterfly tightly
in your hand, it will die. You have to..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trent interrupted.
"That"s what you said about Penny. Maybe holding her
tighter would have kept her from that band of Mexican Bandits."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amanda stopped the
fight before it escalated any further. "Wind, go now. If you
wait, you'll be late."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wind wiped off his
tears with his boot towel and ran to the wagon. He stopped as he got
to it and turned towards his mother. "Wait a minute, Mom; how
am I going to recognize him?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amanda smiled. "Oh,
you can't make any mistake, Wind. He's young, tall, strong, and he's
a gentleman..." She trailed off as she pulled out a letter from
the man. "'For traveling, I'll be wearing my black dress shirt
and the same...straw hat I was wearing when we met..." She
trailed off, remembering that day.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her two children in
earshot went back to their duties, not wanting to think about what
happened that day. Amanda noticed how uncomfortable her two sons
were, and said, "Um, I'm going to get some fresh water from the
well."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trent sang as he
worked. "Oh Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling."
He hummed the bits he had forgotten as Amanda started to draw up the
water bucket. "The summer's gone, and all the roses fall..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trent had stopped
singing because the cicadas stopped singing again. He looked up and
around; as did Amanda who had just raised a pail of water. A flock of
pheasants bolted and flew up, and Trent smiled and watched them fly
away.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A shotgun blast was
heard, and Amanda looked to the sky, but no birds fell. <I>That's
odd,</I> thought Amanda, <I>usually the people hunting on our land
can hit one on their first shot.</I> Then she looked over at her son
Trent, who staggered, then fell to the ground.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amanda realized where
that shot had landed, and cried out, "TRENT!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amanda ran to her
fallen son, but was shot before she could make it halfway. She
continued running, not being incapacitated by the first shot, but was
dropped with the second.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wind saw the commotion,
and tried to get off of the wagon he had just mounted, but was hit
and knocked clean off the wagon, dead.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amanda crawled over to
her chair, where her pistol hung on its belt, but just as she reached
it, one more bullet ended her struggle.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane ran down from the
kitchen, carrying the bottle of sarsaparilla she had been drinking
from. As she reached the porch, she saw her mother and Trent lying on
the ground by the table she had left them at. She turned to the
wagon, and Wind was lying there, too. None of them were moving, and
Jane started to feel very scared. She couldn't cry, couldn't run,
couldn't do anything but look at the carnage in front of her.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From out of the brush,
a group of bandits walked slowly towards the house. All five of them,
three women and two men, wore different-colored dusters: the men in
yellow, the women in brown. The brown-haired, blue-eyed woman in the
middle walked up to the girl. Her flowing locks of auburn hair were
restrained only by the brown hat on her head and the fur-lined collar
of her matching duster. The brunette chewed on cedar gum and smiled
at the little girl in front of her.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the men at her
side said, "What are we going to do with this one, Stacy?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The smile ran off the
brunette's face, as she rolled her eyes and spit to the side of her,
towards (and probably at) the man who spoke. "Well, genius, now
that you've called me by name..." She slowly took out her
pistol, cocked it, and pointed it at Jane, as the smile returned to
her face.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jane stood there,
looking into Stacy's blue eyes, knowing she couldn't get away, and
thought, <I>dammit, I knew I should have taken some of that pie</I>,
just as Stacy pulled the trigger.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter
Three</FONT>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom Sloane stepped off
the train that had taken him to Flagstone. True to his letter, he
wore his black dress shirt and a small straw hat, along with tan
pants. He smiled in anticipation, as he had been looking forward to
meeting with his bride since the day she left New Orleans, one month
ago.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom looked around for
the escort he had been expecting. Amanda had said that if she wasn"t
there, one of her kids would be. Nobody matching Wind"s
description was anywhere to be seen. As a matter of fact, within a
couple minutes, the only people around the train were a few older
men, a group of migrant workers, and the railroad staff. Discouraged,
but figuring they were just late, he went to the nearby office and
hired a coach to take him to his destination.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After they had rode
out, the driver, an older man who looked quite tense, turned to his
passenger. "Where did you say you wanted to go?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Without turning, Tom
said, "Lawndale." The driver grunted, signaling that he
was not aware of such a place, so Tom turned to the man and said,
"Amanda Lane"s farm."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The driver turned back
to his horses. "LANE? Sure, sure; that stubborn GYPSY woman
tilling SAND for YEARS out there. LAWNDALE? HA! Only a LOONY like
LANE would call that hunk of desert LAWNDALE! WHERE does she expect
the lawns to GROW, on the ROOFTOP?" The driver continued to
laugh as he barreled on through a group of railroad workers, looking
to extend the railroad on to the west coast. Tom thought, <I>maybe
this trip wasn"t worth it after all.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A bit later, the wagon
came to a stop at a trading post in seemingly the middle of nowhere.
Tom was confused. "Why are we stopping? I told you I needed to
get to the Lane farm as quickly as possible!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The driver scowled at
his passenger. "Oh, I"m SORRY, sir. I didn"t
realize you wanted me to DIE of THIRST before we got there! Doesn"t
the TRAIN stop?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom said nothing, so as
not to anger the man any further. After he was certain that the man
had gotten inside, and realizing that time in the shade was better
than time out in the sun, he climbed out of the wagon and walked into
the building.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The store was sparsely
populated with a variety of people, each off on their own business.
In one corner a woman with dark hair and heavy eye makeup was washing
off her legs from a long, dusty trail ride. A man in the corner was
slowly drinking his way into oblivion. Behind the counter, a
strong-looking woman with short brown hair was busy attending to her
customers, with a weak, henpecked male assistant trying to help her
and stay out of the way as much as possible. The woman brought a
large bottle to the counter in front of the driver, and took away an
empty, similar-looking bottle next to it. She then walked down to the
counter where Tom had stopped. "What do you want, you MAN?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom, who was startled
at hearing his gender spoken with such derision, said, "Um, I
would like some water, please."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman smirked.
"Water, eh? Well that word"s poison around these parts
since the great flood."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom snorted. "You
mean you never bathe?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman frowned. "Of
course we bathe!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Well, then I
want to use the same facilities you do."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Fine; we just
happen to have a full tub in the back, and you"re lucky! Only
three women used it today."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom smirked at that.
"Used it one at a time, or all together?


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For that the woman
slapped him in the face. Tom, expecting it, didn"t flinch, but
tipped his hat after it landed. The woman smiled at the man before
her. "I can tell you"re accustomed to fine living. I bet
you come from one of those big Eastern cities."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom shrugged. "New
Orleans."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman seemed to get
excited at that. "New Orleans?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"You"ve
been there?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"No, but that"s
where that lying, cheating ex-husband of mine said he ran off to,
leaving me here at this dump. How am I...?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman trailed off
as a sound of horses coming up to the building filled the room. Soon
a horse whinnying joined the cacophony, followed by a series of
gunshots. Everyone in the room stopped what they were doing,
including the woman washing her leg, known as Andrea, who dropped her
soap into the basin below as the gunshots rang out.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To the front door came
a woman with long brown hair. Her clothes, which at one point had
looked quite stylish, were now dusty and partly torn. Her appearance
was haggard, as she had just outrun and outshot a posse trying to
take her in. She walked over to the counter near where Tom was
standing and asked for a bottle of some sort of alcohol. As she drank
from the bottle, it became obvious that her wrists were still
handcuffed together.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From the far corner of
the room, a harmonica rang out, catching the attention of the woman.
It was too dark to see in that corner, so the woman in handcuffs
walked over to a lamp on a chain and swung it over towards the
corner, illuminating the red-haired woman playing the harmonica. The
brunette walked over to the redhead and put her hand on the harmonica
player"s gun, which was sitting on the counter upon which she
was sitting. She pushed the gun to the other end of the counter and
said, "Like, do you only know how to play, or do you know how
to...shoot?" and pushed the gun across the counter,
stopping at the redhead"s feet. "You know how to blow
music from that? Pick it up." She stopped playing her
harmonica, grabbed the gun, and held it upside down, but so that the
barrel pointed away from herself.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redhead continued
to play, and the brunette started walking back towards her. As she
did, Andrea started reaching for her pistol. Just as she was about to
reach her gun, the brunette turned, and pointed her gun at Andrea,
saying "You!" This caused her to slowly move her hand
back away from her gun. "You don"t know how to play."
She walked over to the redhead, and picked up her gun, putting her
own gun back into its holster. She then walked over to the woman in
black and smiled. "Try this one," she said, pointing her
gun at the woman and using her other hand to pull the woman to her
feet. Andrea hesitated, her eyes darting between the brunette"s
face, the gun in her holster, and the gun in her hand. "Come
on, take it already," goaded the brunette. Slowly, Andrea
reached for the gun in the holster, and pulled it out. As she did,
the brunette spread out her arms, so that the chain was taut and
vertical. Andrea cocked the hammer of the pistol, and her eyes darted
from the man, the two guns, and her target.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, she fired, and
the bullet broke the chain before burying itself harmlessly in some
wood. The brunette smiled, took the gun back, and said. "About
damn time."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the building, a
clatter of hooves brought the brunette to attention. In walked five
men wearing yellow dusters and hats. The men saw the brunette, and
first stopped, then smiled as she put away her guns. As two watched
the door, the other three walked up to the brunette. The middle one
spoke. "Sandi, we thought we'd never make it!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi smiled at her
men. "That's all right. You're just in time..." Her lip
curled into a sneer as she turned back to her alcohol. "...to
bury my freaking escort. If I'd waited for you losers I'd be in jail
by now." She took a look Tom, who had been at the bar a few
feet down from her bottle. <I>Not bad. A bit dopey, but he looks like
he's got some money at least.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Sandi put on the
duster the men had brought, getting ready to leave. The redhead
walked over. "Um, hellooooo?" The men and Sandi turned
around. The redhead smiled, walked over to Sandi's bottle, poured
herself a cup, and said. "The gun, remember?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi smirked, and
handed the woman's gun to one of her men to give back. The man
crossed over to the woman, who took the gun, but then grabbed the
man's duster and examined the cloth. Sandi's smirk grew. "Interested
in high fashion, Harmonica?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redhead smiled.
"You might say it's a calling. These are really nice dusters,
Sandi, as long as you can accessorize them properly."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi snorted. "Like,
what do you mean?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Well, a short
time ago, I saw three of these dusters waiting for a train. Of
course, inside those dusters were three cute guys."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Well, of
course."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redhead sipped her
drink. "But then inside those guys were three bullets. Such a
fashion don"t."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The smirk on Sandi's
face disappeared at that moment, to reappear later. "Heh,
that's, like, a nice story, and some junk, but there are two big
problems with that. Number one: nobody dares to wear those dusters
except Sandi's men, and number two: Sandi's men don't get killed.
Does that surprise you?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redhead got a
bemused smirk on her face. "Yes." She set down her cup,
then flashed a bigger smile. "You must be such a good leader,
Sandi. I mean, you know fashion, you know music, and you can count;
all the way up to two."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi let out a forced
chuckle, then took out her gun and spun the chamber. "All the
way up to six if I have to. And maybe faster than you." She
emphasized her point by tracing the bullet hole on the redhead's
blouse with her gun barrel. The redhead returned to playing, while
Sandi laughed. "Yeah, play Harmonica. Play so you can't
bulls***. Only, if I were you, I'd watch those false notes."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Sandi turned around
to leave again, Harmonica played a purposeful off-key note, which
stopped them in their tracks. "Oh, do you mean like that?"
She returned to her playing.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi said only, "Um,
yeah," and left with her group.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The commotion over
with, the woman behind the bar continued to talk with Tom.
"Twenty-two years I spent washing his clothes, cooking his
meals, slaughtering his damn pigs so that he could drive cattle up to
Kansas, and what thanks do I get? A set of divorce papers, this damn
tavern, and a good swift kick to my rear end. Then last year he has
the bright idea that I'd like to join him in New Orleans so I could
replay the same imprisonment he's forced onto me in a new location? I
said..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom could tell that it
would be a while before he got his bath, assuming he escaped with his
life. <I>Forget the trip; maybe being born wasn't worth it.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter
Four</FONT>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Tom Sloane's wagon
approached the Lane Farmstead, he surveyed the scene before him. Just
like he had envisioned, several tables of food had been lain out, and
what looked to him to be about fifty people gathered around the far
tables wearing their Sunday best.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, as the wagon
approached, Tom could sense that something was awry. The mood of the
gathered crowd was one of solemnity and gravity, not the gaiety of a
wedding. Men took off their hats as he passed, and the women eyed him
warily.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only when he reached
the tables did he realize what had caused the mood. There lay Amanda
Lane, the woman he had met in New Orleans a month ago, along with two
sons and a daughter, whom Tom remembered Amanda describing. All four
were laying motionless, and though their wounds had been well
cleaned, it was easy to discern the bullet holes in their bodies. Tom
descended the wagon on his own, though another man moved to help him
down, and looked over all four bodies. It was all he could do to keep
his composure, especially when he came to little Jane's body.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he moved his hand
over the little girl's body, he said, "It's Jane."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An older woman near
Jane's body said, "Yes. Dear God. On the day..." She
paused to gather herself before continuing. "On the very day of
your wedding. Now she'll forever be a Lane."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom, his voice dead,
responded, "She's already a Sloane."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman looked around
in shock. "What? But we all...we thought..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom nodded. "I
know. She wanted it to be a surprise today, but Amanda Lane and I
were married...a month ago...in New Orleans." With that, he
finally lost his composure and gave into the tears welling in his
eyes.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six pallbearers
lowered Amanda Lane's coffin into the freshly dug grave, and dropped
the ropes, which they had used to lower it, into the grave with it.
The priest read from his bible, but Tom couldn't hear a word of it.
When the holy man stopped talking, he threw a handful of dirt onto
the coffin, as was customary to symbolize "Ashes to ashes, dust
to dust."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the service came to
a conclusion, a man rode up on horseback from the farmhouse. He
dismounted and handed a piece of fabric to Nicholas Campbell, the
local blacksmith who'd been leading the proceedings, saying, "I
found this collar on a nail by the door."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nick took the collar
and turned to Tom. "You have no way of knowing this, but this
is as good as a signature."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ryan Mickelson, a
rotund man who ran the local laundry, took one look at the collar and
sneered. "Sandi's entourage."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom looked first at
Ryan, then back to Nick. "But why?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nick, who looked ready
to exact justice, replied, "Don't worry, Mr. Sloane. We'll make
her tell us before we hang her. Let's get moving!" With that,
he led the majority of the men and women gathered out of the area, on
the trail of the woman they believed responsible.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The driver of Tom's
coach, who'd been hanging back to show respect for both the fallen
family and the widowed man he'd driven, walked up to Tom and said,
"Come on, let's go back to Flagstone."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom shook his head
slowly. "No, Anthony; you go back."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anthony was insistent.
"Be REAsonable, Mr. Sloane. You don't want to stay out HERE
alone."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom looked out over the
property that, by law, now belonged to him. "Why not? This is
my home now."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom feverishly
ransacked every room in the house. Finding nothing in the kitchen,
parlor, or the other bedrooms, he had saved his own bedroom for last.
He found Amanda's wedding dress, still hanging in the closet. He
found the corsage she was going to wear to the ceremony. He found
plenty of handmade costume jewelry and pictures of likely relatives.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, as he spread
out across the bed he planned to share with his now-buried wife, the
one thing he didn't find was his second most important reason to come
to the Lane farm. <I>Almost no money,</I> he thought. <I>No gold. No
oil. Not even blackmail on a major lawman. All there is here is this
piece of land. Why did Amanda think we were going to be rich?</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter
Five</FONT>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ryan crept down the
stairs at his laundry as quietly as possible (though far from
silently) to try to keep from waking the migrants and other workers
who lived in the basement. However, as he peaked around the door with
his lantern, he was startled to see a hand grab for the lantern. He
was even more surprised to see the woman to whom the hand was
attached.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Having that knowledge,
however, he was less surprised when that woman snuffed the lantern
and pushed him back against the steps in one move.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redheaded woman
picked up the lantern, hung it on a nearby hook, and relit it. By
this point, the workers were all awake, watching the goings-on out of
a combination of fear and curiosity. The woman took no interest in
the workers; her intentions settled on the man behind the door.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the woman opened the
door, she saw Ryan, still lying on the stairs. He started to get up,
and the woman took little care in helping him to his feet. "Hi
there, Ryan," she said as she grabbed his necktie, using it to
lead him into the room.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ryan allowed himself to
be led a few steps then stopped. The woman noticed, turned around,
and pulled the man towards her by the tie. She then threw him around
(granted, this wasn"t the strongest man she"d dealt with)
into a bucket of water, which spilled all over him. She then threw
him into a laundry press, and threaded his tie through the rollers.
She cranked the rollers, and soon Ryan could feel the tie
constricting around his neck.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ryan fought for
breath, the woman sweetly said, "You know, Ryan, I'm kinda mad
at you."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ryan, barely able to
talk, replied, "I hadn"t noticed."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman cranked
again. "Stacy wasn't there. She sent three of her hunks."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ryan, trying to escape
the situation with his life, decided that since lying got him into
the situation, only lying would get him out. "I don't know
anything about that, I swear! I only arranged the meeting, the way
you wanted it. I don't know why she wasn't there. I swear..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman smiled.
"Silly boy, I know why she wasn't there. She was at the
Lane's."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ryan attempted to shake
his head, and realized this was not prudent or, indeed, likely in his
current position. "That's not true! Sandi did that job.
Everyone knows that. We've got proof!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman shook her
head. "That was always a Stacy trademark: faking evidence;
trying to look as innocent as possible." She cranked the press
as hard as she could.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ryan was starting to
feel light-headed, and knew he was running out of oxygen. "Look,
I don't know anything! I swear! I only arranged the meeting..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman, not
necessarily trusting the man, but knowing he wouldn't say anything
else, cranked the press back the other way, loosening Ryan from his
precarious position. <I>If you won"t tell me to my face, I"ll
have to find another way.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the Lane house, just
before bedtime, Tom Sloane was putting away some clothing when he
found a box containing a number of model houses. <I>These are pretty
good. She really had a knack for these things.</I> One building he
picked up had a little curved hanging sign reading "Station".
The attention to detail made the model quite lifelike. <I>Maybe this
was her plan to get rich. I guess I've had women tell me worse plans
for striking it rich. </I>He walked over to the dresser, where
pictures of Amanda and her children, including two with her first
husband, sat. <I>At least you"ll all be together, wherever you
are.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, he heard a
harmonica playing outside his window. Tom blew out the lantern and
grabbed a nearby shotgun. He opened the window and looked out onto
the blackness of night. The sound was coming from just beyond the
house. He called out, "Who's there?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In response, the
harmonica playing ceased, and a match, about ten feet before him,
sparked to life. Tom fired his gun over where he assumed the figure's
head would be, and the match dropped to the ground. It did not ease
Tom's mind when he heard the harmonica start playing again.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter
Six</FONT>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The morning came all
too soon for Tom, and he walked over to the window he had been at
last night. There were no signs of life, other than the sound of a
rooster crowing. He walked over to a nearby mirror and looked himself
in the face. <I>So this is it. A nice family to settle down with,
killed before I come here. A promised fortune, which turned out to be
nothing more than wishes and hopes. The life I always wanted, and
it's all a lie. Well, that's what I get for trusting a Gypsy.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He licked his fingers
to wipe away some dirt on his face, and pulled out a comb to
straighten his bangs. Deeming himself presentable, he walked over to
the front door and grabbed his traveling case. <I>Well, at least I
can't say I never left New Orleans.</I> He opened the door, and
immediately dropped his case.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Before him stood Sandi
Griffin and her entourage. Sandi's scowl never left her face as Tom
stepped backwards, allowing Sandi to walk inside and close the door.
"Like, did you make coffee?" asked Sandi. Tom made no
motion to respond, only stood firm as he took in the bandit before
him. Seeing a response was not forthcoming, Sandi continued, "Make
some."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi walked into the
room and set her duster down on a table. "Didn't sleep a wink
last night. A group of the most unfashionable losers in black rode
herd on me all night. I didn"t think you could make black look
ugly until I saw them. Well, maybe leaving them out in the desert
will improve their common sense as well as their fashion sense. With
any luck they should be back in a few days." Tom didn't
respond. He just tried to set up the fire, which was never his strong
point. Sandi saw this and walked over to him. "Oh for crying
out loud, I'll get the fire. You just make the coffee."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Tom walked over to
the coffee pot, Sandi continued. "They want to hang me, those
losers. Morons, all of them. I mean, sure; I'll kill anything, but
never a freaking kid. It'd be like killing a kitten or something.
Yeah, there are a lot of people that want to kill Sandi Griffin."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom walked over to the
utensil drawer for a spoon and, upon opening it, saw a butcher's
knife. He contemplated using it on the woman before him. <I>Sandi
Griffin! That's who they said killed Amanda and the kids! One little
distraction...</I> "You see," continued Sandi, "I'm
not the bitch that people say I am. Of course, if someone were to try
to kill me, that could fire me up. And a fired-up Sandi Griffin..."
Sandi blew on the fire before her, and the flames grew from the added
oxygen. "That's not a nice thing to see, especially for a guy."
Tom realized that Sandi was aware of his idea. He also realized that
it would only bring the rest of the entourage inside. <I>Hell, maybe
she'll let me live if I just play along.</I> He shut the drawer, and
Sandi walked over to him. "But then, you're too smart to make
her mad."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi walked away as
Tom saw to the coffee. "So, this is where I was supposed to do
all that killing yesterday? Hmmph. Doesn't seem like this place is
worth a s***. Now, if someone goes dressing up like me, trying to
hang this on my neck, it does not please me in the least, but I can
understand it. After all, who wouldn't want to look like me? The part
I can't seem to find is the why."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom glared daggers at
Sandi. "Neither can I."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi then realized the
state of the house, and why it had looked like a tornado had come
through it. "Well it looks like I'm not the only one looking
for the why. Maybe there's a whole bunch of whys. You know the ones:
round, yellow, and when you rap them on a stone, they make that
dinging sound."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom, catching the
drift, turned back to Sandi, who had grabbed a leftover plate of
food, and said, "Maybe, but I sure didn't find them."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi took that at face
value. <I>Either he's telling the truth, or he's smart enough to know
how to lie. </I>"By the way, have you heard anything about a
chick going around playing a harmonica?" Tom dropped the lid
onto the kettle where the coffee was brewing after hearing the word
"harmonica". Seeing recognition, Sandi continued. "She's
pretty hard to forget. When she should talk, she plays, and when she
better play, she talks. You know, when you've killed four, it's
pretty easy to make it five."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom turned quickly to
Sandi. "Sure," he said with a sneer, "you're an
expert."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi set her plate
down forcefully. "Um, guy, or whatever, I don't think you've
been hearing what I'm trying to tell you."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom scowled and grabbed
the coffee as he walked over to Sandi. "I'm pretty sure I have.
I'm here alone in the hands of a bandit who smelled money, and if you
want to, you could lay me over the table and amuse yourself. Hell,
call in your friends outside. Well, no man's ever died from that.
When you're done with me, all I'll need is a tub of boiling water,
and I'll be right back to what I was before, with another lousy
stinking memory!" He put the coffee down onto the table
forcefully.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi saw that Tom was
way off regarding her intentions. <I>Geez, all these guys think about
is sex, sex, sex.</I> "Are you at least any good at making
coffee?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Not bad,"
said Tiffany Blum-Deckler from behind her desk in her private car.
"But, um, did you have to kill all of them? I only wanted you
to scare them."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy, seated across
the desk, shrugged. "People scare pretty easy when they're
dying."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany rolled her
eyes. "Well, what good did killing them do? Now this Tom Sloane
guy comes to town, and turns out to be Mr. Amanda Lane."
Tiffany struggled to get up to her feet.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy nodded. "Well,
I didn't expect that, but that happens in business. This is something
we didn't plan on, nothing more."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany got onto her
crutches and hobbled over past Stacy. "I don't really have time
for surprises. You know that, Stacy. Before I got on this train, I
saw my face in the Atlantic Ocean..." She paused at a painting
of waves on the ocean. She then turned it around and gazed into the
mirror on the other side, seemingly forgetting everything else around
her.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy rolled her eyes.
"And before your eyes rot you want to see the Pacific. I know.
I mean, I was there too, remember? You hired me to 'remove small
obstacles from the track.'" Stacy pulled the cord to signify
the train could depart. "Well, there were a few..." Stacy
paused while the train started and the horn bellowed. "But
we've come a long way anyway, and pretty damn fast too."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany shook her head
as she lowered a series of rails from the ceiling, which she could
use for support much more safely than her crutches while the train
was moving. "Even Tubercol...Tubilica...Tubercon...Even Pott's
Disease travels fast."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy smiled, and sat
down in Tiffany's chair behind her desk. "Oh, don't play the
sick woman with me. I knew you when you just had that cute little
limp. You got a few guys playing that one out. Now, watching that dry
rot creep up a little more each day..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany wrinkled her
nose. "Stacy, ewwwww"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy stifled a laugh.
"Well, a normal person would have swallowed a bottle of pills,
but you? You just got a little more hasty. Otherwise, you're still
the same girl I met back in Baltimore."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany, climbing
across the now-lowered bars like monkey bars on a playground,
countered with, "Maybe, but you"re really different. You
used to take care of certain things personally. Now, you're keeping
in the background. Pretty soon you'll be giving orders."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy smiled as she
picked up the glass of brandy she had just poured. "That's
because now I don't want to leave you alone too much. You're going to
need someone to stand by you more and more each day. You know, like a
friend."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany knew what Stacy
meant. "Or like a partner? How does it feel sitting behind that
desk, Stacy?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy traced her finger
along the trim of the desk. "It's just like holding a gun, only
much more powerful." She set down her now-empty glass and stood
once Tiffany had made her way back to sit in her chair. "I
mean, being here with you, I'm starting to think big too. This Lane
business is giving me ideas."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany watched Stacy
walk back to her original chair and shook her head. "I'm so
sorry, Stacy. I mean, you're trying your best, but you'll never
succeed in becoming like me."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy snickered at
that. "And why is that?" She turned her back to Tiffany
to gather her belongings.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany continued,
"Because there are many things you'll never understand."
Tiffany opened a drawer, and the sound made Stacy instinctively whirl
around and draw her pistol. Tiffany merely smiled and slowly pulled
out a stack of money. "Especially this. There are lots of
different weapons, and the only one that can stop that is this."
She put the stack away as the train siren blew and the train came to
a halt. A group of Stacy's riders rode up to the train as it stopped.
"Now, back to our little problem."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy smiled as he
looked out over his men. "My weapons may seem simple to you,
Tiff, but they can still shoot holes big enough for our little
problems. Pretty soon, Tom Sloane-Lane or whatever won't be a problem
for us."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom paced around the
main room of the house he now owned. "You wake up one morning
and say, 'Hey, World! I know you, and from now on, there are no more
surprises.' Then you meet a woman like this. Clear blue eyes,
beautiful hands, and she wants to marry you. That doesn't happen
often. She says she's rich too, which never hurts. So you say, 'To
hell with New Orleans. Let's go out to the country. I wouldn't mind
raising her kids, even give her a few more if she wants. Take care of
the house, make an honest living, whatever.'" Tom drained the
last of his cup of coffee. "Well, God rest your soul Amanda
Lane, even if He has a hell of a time pulling you out of the devil's
grip."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi took her last sip
of coffee, then turned around a photograph of Amanda Lane to look at.
<I>Not bad. Could have given me a run for my money if she were born
twenty years later.</I> "Still, I can't believe she didn't
leave money around here someplace."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom shook his head.
"Well, if you find any, you're welcome to it. Tom Sloane-Lane
goes back to civilization today: minus a wife, and plus a great
future." Tom's emphasis on great lent a certain sarcasm to the
comment.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi, struck by the
situation, said, "You deserve better," as she stood up,
grabbed her hat and duster, and walked to the door.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom stopped her by
saying, "The last woman to tell me that is buried out there."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi stopped with the
door open. "You know, Tom; you remind me of my father: the
biggest man-whore in Alameda, and the nicest guy you'd ever meet. My
mother was the meanest woman I've ever seen, but for however long she
was with him &ndash; for an hour or a month &ndash; she must have
been a happy woman." She smiled, then closed the door and
walked to her horse.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter
Seven</FONT>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom watched Sandi and
her entourage leave, and then grabbed his bag and walked out to the
stable. He put his bag onto the wagon and prepared to mount it. He
stopped himself when he heard a familiar sound.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom turned in the
direction of the harmonica playing, and saw a woman in the loft on
the other side of the stable, her identity obscured by shadow. The
woman walked over to him, and he noticed her long red hair. Tom,
paralyzed by fear, asked, "What do you want?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman smiled.
"Sandi's right, you know. Once you've killed four, it's easy to
make it five." The woman crossed over to Tom, who made for the
wagon. The woman stopped him by grabbing his arm and saying, "Oh
come on; this is no time to leave." Tom backed away, scared for
his life, and the woman followed him. She grabbed his shirt and
ripped it open, exposing his firm chest. He kept backing away until
he backed into a workbench and fell back onto it. He tried to
scramble up but the woman held him down. She moved to pin his arms.
Twice he wriggled out of her grasp, and twice she pushed him down
onto the bench roughly. Finally, after making sure Tom wasn't
concealing anything in his shirt other than his body, she let him up
and told him, "Get me some water."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom complied, going
over towards a storage tank in the corner. <I>God, get me coffee, get
me water, got anything to eat? At least in New Orleans I could tell
the women what to get every now and then.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman let him get
to the end of her reach, but then pulled him back. "Not there,
silly: from the well. I like my water fresh." Tom, not sure
what the woman was driving at but not really one to argue, nodded and
led him out to the well.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the high ground
outside the Lane farm, a man and a woman were making out; well, as
much as they could from atop their horses. The blonde woman saw the
red-haired woman and the man they had been looking for exit the
stable. She broke the kiss to say, "Kevvy, I think that"s
the guy we"re supposed to kill."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kevvy, as the blonde
had called him, turned around and saw the pair approach the well.
"Aww man! And I was about to get to second base!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blonde put her
hands on her hips. "Kevin, there"ll be plenty of time for
that after our job is done. Besides, like we could get to second base
on these horses."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kevin looked confused.
"But Brittany, babe, what about last Wednesday?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Brittany was
infuriated. "On Wednesday, Sandi had me out harassing some
farmers alone. Where were you on Wednesday?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kevin, realizing he had
been caught, scrambled. "Um, we really should get going after
them, before they escape and stuff."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Brittany fumed.
"Oooooh! Fine, but after this, you"ll have some
explaining to do!" They both raised their shotguns and started
riding down the hill.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-haired woman
grabbed the dipper cup from the well and filled it with the fresh
water. She raised it to her lips, watching the riders approach, and
said, "When you hear a strange sound, I recommend you drop to
the ground."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom, confused as he had
been since he got to the farm, said, "A sound? Like what?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At that moment, the
sound of the hammer of a rifle being pulled back could be heard. The
woman dropped the cup she had drunk from into the well. "Like
that."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom dove for the
ground. The woman picked up her hat, which had been laying on the
edge of the well, and grabbed the gun she had hidden underneath. She
fired twice, each time dropping one of the approaching riders to the
ground.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Across the way, Sandi
un-cocked her rifle and smirked. "She not only plays, she can
shoot, too."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the town laundry,
Ryan surveyed his employees. Most of the immigrants he hired were
glumly, but efficiently, working away, washing the clothes that
earned everybody's salary. <I>Well, my salary. I could cover their
wages only being open once a week.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ryan was surprised to
see the Lane widower enter his shop, especially the work area marked
employees only, but was always happy to meet a new customer. "Good
morning Mr. Lane, or Sloane, or whatever you're going by now."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom coldly nodded,
saying only, "Good morning," before walking past him.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ryan followed. "Maybe
you don't remember me, but I was there yesterday when..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom cut him off without
turning to face him. "I remember very well."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ryan stopped. "Ah.
Well, is there anything I can do for you?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom finally turned to
him. "Yes. See Stacy, and tell her I know everything." He
walked to the door.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ryan's eyes went wide
as he followed Tom. "Why does everybody hassle me about this
chick Stacy? I've never met her! I just want to be left alone in
peace! Is that so much to ask?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom turned around.
"Tell Stacy I want to negotiate with her, personally!" He
slammed the door behind him, leaving Ryan standing with his mouth
wide open.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom walked across the
street and to the nearby saloon, where he nodded towards his
accomplice, who watched Ryan leave for the train station with a
smile.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter
Eight</FONT>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany appraised the
man who stood before her. <I>Hmm, he's not cute, he's not much of a
brain if he came here, and he's way too fat to be a hired gun. I
guess he must have money. Otherwise, he wouldn't be Stacy's, would
he? </I>"Um, I thought I told you not to come here. Whatever
you're doing with Stacy, I don't want it coming back to here."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ryan stumbled for
words. "Um, Yes, Ms. Blum-Deckler; I know. But you see, when
that woman said that she knew everything, I figured the important
thing was to come over here and tell you about it."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy, thumbing through
a book to make herself look busy, replied, "And you didn't
think it might be a trick?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ryan, eager to show his
boss he knew what he was doing, answered, "Of course, but you
know how careful I am, Stacy. Nobody could have followed me here.
That's the first thing I learned working for you: to listen unseen,
and to watch unheard."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy, looking out the
window, noticed a shadow on the ground, giving away the position of
an uninvited passenger on the roof of the car. <I>Apparently I didn't
teach you well enough.</I> Tiffany's response, "You should
learn to live as if you didn't exist," made Stacy think, <I>Oh,
that can be arranged.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ryan turned to his
boss. "Stacy, you've known me for a long time, since high
school. I even helped you with your arithmetic homework. You know you
can trust me."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy walked over to
the man who had betrayed his position, accidentally or otherwise, to
a potential enemy and shook her head. "Ryan..." She
appraised his apparel. The brown pants and tweed shirt were fashion
don'ts enough, but his choice of accessories disappointed her most.
"How can I trust a man who wears both a belt and suspenders? He
can't even trust his own pants!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ryan shrugged. "I
just clean clothes; I don"t try to set trends like you do. The
last time I picked out an outfit on my own, I almost got shot,
remember?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy walked over to a
pull cord and pulled it. "It's a good thing I didn't hire you
as a fashion consultant. I may have to have a new set of clothes
picked out for you later." <I>A nice suit for your coffin.
</I>"Right now, we need to get going."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The train started up,
startling the red-haired passenger on the roof. She braced herself
for the coming ride, and while she hoped she hadn't been spotted, she
knew she'd get what she wanted one way or another.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-haired woman
felt the train coming to a stop after a few minutes. The area where
it stopped was a rather nondescript piece of desert. In fact, the
only real landmark of note was the approaching group of riders on
horseback.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing these riders,
she knew her best bet was to get off the train as quickly as
possible, hoping they wouldn't see her. However, as she reached the
bottom of the ladder, she found a gun in her face. Behind the gun was
another face; one the redhead remembered from her youth. "I'm
sorry ma"am, but this is the end of the line."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redhead stared into
Stacy's eyes. "Yeah, I guess it is."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy calmly reached
for the red-haired woman's gun, removed it, and threw it to one of
the riders who'd made it to the train. "Let's get her inside,
boys." Stacy walked back inside, went over to the near main
door and opened it, allowing the riders to accompany the redhead
inside. "Tie her up," commanded Stacy. "And not
spread-eagle this time!" <I>Stupid guys</I>, Stacy thought, as
the riders tied the woman to a support post. She turned her attention
to her other male associate. "So, what you were saying about
nobody following you?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ryan backed up away
from Stacy. "I...but she didn't follow me! Nobody followed me!
She must have been here before I got here!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy shook her head as
she walked towards Ryan. "So this is how you try to gain my
trust?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ryan held up his hands,
as he backed up to the far door, which had been swung open. "You've
gotta believe me! It"ll never happen again, I swear!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy shook her head.
<I>You"re right about that.</I> "Get out."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ryan shook his head.
"No, please, no..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy grabbed a rail
above her, swung her body forward, yelled, "Get out!" and
kicked Ryan square in the stomach, causing him to fall backwards out
of the car and onto the dirt outside.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ryan slowly sat back
up, his back creaking as he got his upper body vertical. Looking
towards the train, he saw there was another trespasser riding below
the car. The freeloader gestured for Ryan to keep quiet. <I>There's
my chance! If I can point her out, she might not kill me!</I> He
stood up quickly. "Stacy, wait..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His words were cut off
by the sound of Stacy's gun. Her first shot tore through his right
suspender, as well as his pectoral muscle. The second shot did the
same with his left suspender and pec. The final shot went right
through his cheap belt buckle and into his gut, and this bullet
finally brought Ryan to the ground for good.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Stacy twirled her
gun and set it into its holster, the freeloader below the train car
shook her head and whispered, "Like, I told you to keep quiet,
loser."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy walked back over
to his posse and the red-haired woman. She noticed two glaring
absences. "Where are Kevin and Brittany? Did they take care of
that guy?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearest man shook
his head. "Someone took care of them. We found them out by the
Lane place, stone dead. The guy was gone."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redhead, who"d
been watching the goings-on dispassionately, spoke up. "Gee
Stacy, people sure seem to die quickly around you; first the three
guys, then those two."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy looked over the
woman before her, taking off her hat. "So you're the one who's
always making appointments."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redhead nodded.
"And you're the one that never keeps them."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy wasn't sure to
make of the strong-willed woman before her. "What do you want,
and who are you, anyway?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redhead smiled.
"Lynn Cullen."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy knew the name,
and also knew that it didn't match the face before her. "Lynn
Cullen's been dead a long time."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redhead shrugged.
"Danielle Todds."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy looked at the
woman skeptically. "What's your name? Danielle's dead too."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redhead continued
smiling. "You ought to know better than anyone, Stacy. You
killed them, after all."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy slapped the woman
before her in the face three times quickly, and the woman just stood
there, unmoved by the sudden violence. "What's your name? Who
are you?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany saw Stacy
drawing back to punch the woman. "Stacy! Remember? That guy?
We're losing time."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy calmed down and
grabbed her duster. "All right, this time I'll take care of him
myself."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redhead's smile
never left, even through the slaps. "Yeah, I've been told you
really know how to take care of a guy."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy rolled her eyes.
"Keep her warm for me, guys. If she gives you any trouble, hit
her, but not in the mouth. She'll have to talk, and plenty."
She walked off the train and onto her horse, and took aside one of
the three associates that would be staying behind. "Meet me at
the Navajo Cliff. By the way, I want you to keep an eye on that
cripple on the train at all times, understand?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The man nodded. "Sure
Stacy." The man climbed onto the train, closing the door behind
him, while Stacy and her men went their separate ways to their
missions.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-haired woman
sighed as she lay back against the pole she was tied to. <I>Damn,
Stacy's grown up well. She"s practically a rival for my looks.
It might be harder than I thought breaking her hold on these three
guys, assuming they wake up, of course.</I> She then saw a familiar
sight out of the far window. <I>Then again, maybe I won't have to.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the window just
behind one of the guards sleeping in a chair, Sandi had lowered
herself to the point where just her head and arms were visible in the
window. Since the redhead was the only one who'd noticed her, she
carefully smiled at the redhead and tapped on the window. The
sleeping guard woke up, and looked around, seeing nothing. Tiffany
too had heard it, but thought nothing of it. Sandi tapped again, and
the man spun his chair around. By the time he saw the woman out the
window, it was too late.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bullet broke
through the glass and entered the man"s face. The other two
guards sprung up and got into position as Sandi raised herself back
onto the roof of the train. The two guards opened the window and
looked out, but couldn't see anyone. Then again, they had expected to
see someone riding by lucky to get a shot on the other man.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They didn't see Sandi
walk in the far doorway, but a smiling redhead did. Tiffany did too,
and she swiveled her chair around for a shield. At that moment, the
two men saw Sandi, but Sandi's draw ensured that one of the men
wouldn't have the chance to fire back. The other man took cover
behind a chair and started returning fire. Sandi, not being in an
advantageous position, darted for the lavatory to her right, put one
boot on the windowsill, one on the pullcord for the water closet, and
hoisted herself back onto the roof. <I>And they said all that time in
the bathroom wouldn't pay off.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The lone guard
remaining saw that Sandi had scaled to the roof, but could hear the
woman walking on the roof of the car. He followed the sound, gun
drawn, to the other end of the car, and back to the end with the
lavatory. At the last window, he saw the woman's boot come down,
seemingly looking for a windowsill for support. The guard smiled as
he crept up to the boot. He stepped right in front of it to get a
good shot on the woman, and was fatally surprised when a bullet tore
through the boot's toe and entered his eye socket.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi pulled up her
boot and retrieved her gun from inside of it. <I>At least these
weren't this season"s boots.</I> She pulled on the boot and
made her way back to the lavatory, the flush from the water closet
(having again used the pull cord as a foothold) announcing her
presence.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redhead looked at
Sandi and smiled. "Like, do you only know how to shoot, or do
you know how to cut, too?" She turned away and made an effort
to display her tied hands behind her back.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi rolled her eyes,
produced her jackknife, and started cutting the ropes binding the
redhead's arms and legs. At the same time, Tiffany tried to make a
quiet escape: something that proved next to impossible to do on
crutches. Sandi saw her trying to leave. "Um, excuse me, Little
Miss Choo-Choo, or whatever? Would you please turn around so we can
look at you, or something?" Tiffany turned around, and Sandi
smiled. "Hmph, I guess I don't really need to kill you now or
anything. I mean, if I ever need to find you, I can just follow these
rails right up to your hideout, bitch."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redhead
interjected, "There's another bitch, and not that I would tell
you what to do, but she's getting further away every minute."
With that she pulled the brake cord to bring their train ride to a
sudden stop.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Michael Mackenzie, son
of a freed slave who had moved west to own the biggest lumber yard in
the area, looked over the mass of goods he'd just finished delivering
to the Lane Farmstead when Tom Sloane arrived. "There it is,
sir; exactly what your wife ordered from us. Since she paid cash on
the barrelhead, I figure it all belongs to you now. Oak planks,
beech, pine &ndash; all first-grade lumber &ndash; then there's beams
and foundation pilings, ten kegs of nails, 20 barrels of tar, and all
these tools." He gestured to each pile as he mentioned them.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom shrugged as he
looked over the piles of wood and supplies. "Maybe she wanted
to enlarge the farmhouse or something."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anthony DeMartino,
Tom's driver from earlier and one of the men who had helped deliver
the goods, didn't believe that. "Enlarge the FARMHOUSE? I'd bet
she could build at least EIGHT of them with all this stuff."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Michael continued. "One
more thing, sir. She also told me to make this." He picked up a
large wooden sign off of a pile of wood. It was unfinished, but the
rectangular frame encircled a curved portion that reminded Michael of
a rainbow. "The trouble is, she never got around to telling me
what she wanted printed on it. If you happen to know, I'd be happy to
finish it off."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom looked at the sign.
<I>I've seen this sign before. Oh yes, it was on that model of the...</I>
His thoughts trailed off as he made the connection between the
models, the lumber, and the stories Amanda Lane had told him about
her impending wealth. At that moment, Tom knew only one word would
fit on that sign. "Station."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Michael heard Tom say
the word, but while he was certain he heard it correctly, a part of
him realized the implications if he'd heard what he thought he heard.
"How's that again?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom couldn't help but
smile in triumph. "I said, print Station!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter
Nine</FONT>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom rifled through the
drawer in which the models had been kept. <I>It's got to be in here
somewhere. I've found the bank, the stable, the blacksmith, the
saloon, the nail salon; they're all here except for the...</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He looked up, and that
thought process ceased as he saw the station model he'd been looking
for suspended in front of his face. Holding the model in place was a
hand, and attached to that hand was the arm that led to the body of
Stacy Rowe. She smiled as she saw the look of fear in Tom's eyes.
"Looking for this?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany and Stacy met
up at the Navajo Cliff, where they had arranged to meet after Stacy
had finished her job. Tiffany was upset with Stacy, knowing that
while Stacy hadn't killed Amanda Lane's heir, he hadn't exactly
negotiated a peaceful agreement. Plus, the disease that made her legs
merely decorative hadn"t been kind to her in recent days. "Um,
Stacy? I'm getting tired of these unnecessary killings. I just want
to make a deal and pay what the land is worth. Trying to take the
land is taking too much time."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy popped in a new
piece of cedar gum, the acquisition of which was part of the reason
she wanted to meet at the Navajo Cliffs. She smirked at her boss.
"Tiffany, you may have the clothes to go out in public in
style, but you just look silly out here. You look like a turtle out
of its shell."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany thought about
the comment, and her reaction was, "Turtles are pretty; kind of
weird though."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy rolled her eyes.
"Oh Tiffany. You're just a poor cripple talking big so nobody
notices how scared you are, aren"t you?" She took a swig
out of a clay jug.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany frowned at that
comment. "I'm here to make a deal, Stacy. I don't exactly have
the time to compete with you."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy finished her
drink and stopped herself from laughing at the comment. "Compete?
How exactly did you expect to compete with me? You can't even stand
up on your own." To prove it, she kicked out the crutch that
had been supporting Tiffany"s meager weight. Without the
support, Tiffany fell down, not even able to hold onto the other
crutch.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany tried to prop
herself up on her arms, to ensure at least her face wasn't in the
dirt. "Do you feel better now? Are you done?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy shook her head,
not to answer, but out of pity for the wretch she saw before her. "I
could squash you like a wormy apple right now."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany grimaced at
that. "Ewwwww, worms! It's not like you'll do it anyway. It's
not to your advat...your advent...it doesn"t help
you."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy considered that,
and concluded she was right. "Who knows how far those legs
could have gone in working condition?" She called out to her
men back at the train. "Help her back onto the train, and keep
an eye on her." She went to put her jug back where it belonged,
and continued talking to Tiffany. "Oh, by the way Tiff, don't
worry about the land. If you want to buy it, I"ll make sure to
let you make an offer. I'm sure you won't mind dealing with a new
owner."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi picked up a spare
railroad tie she'd found out near the Lane Farm. Her gloved hand
moved away the loose sand that covered a set of railroad tracks and
tapped both the rail and the wood to make sure it was real.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of her posse called
out to her from amongst the piles of wood in front of the farm house.
"Hey Sandi, there's a square staked out here. It says 'Water
Tank'."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another man stood up
and yelled, "Over here too, only it says 'Post Office'."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A woman called out,
"This one says 'Corral'."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another woman yelled,
"This one's 'Church'."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy yelled out, "All
right, I get it already, jeez! What the hell is all of this?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-haired woman
amongst the piles made her presence known. "Oh Sandi, I thought
you'd figured that out by now. It's a station, and all around it a
town; Amanda Lane's town."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi laughed out loud.
"Out here? Was she crazy or what?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redhead shrugged.
"Yeah, but in a special kind of way. She was a gypsy looking to
settle down. Pretty rare thing, but when it happens, watch out. She
knew the railroad would be going west of Flagstone one of these days,
so she looked all over and found this hunk of desert." She
drove in a stake with a hammer from the stack of tools. "Nobody
wanted it. Can't really be surprised; it's not very fashionable. But
she bought it anyway." She walked off paces to measure distance
to the next stake position. "Then she started saving her money
and she waited for the last few years."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi didn't really get
it. "Waited for what, exactly?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redhead hammered in
the second stake. "For the railroad to reach this point."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi shook her head.
"Well, how exactly would she know the train would come through
here? I mean, it's not like a secluded mountain pass or anything."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-haired woman
continued her work, as if nobody else were there. "Well, steam
engines can't really work without water, and the only water for fifty
miles west of Flagstone is right here under our feet."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi understood. "Ah,
so our dead friend was no dummy after all. She was about to sell this
property for its weight in gold; maybe more."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other woman walked
off another side to be staked off. "Oh Sandi, you don't sell
the dream of a lifetime. Amanda wanted this station, and she got the
rights to build it."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi thought it was
making a little too much sense right now. "So, um, how exactly
do you know all this? Are you like some kind of telepathic brain or
something?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redhead drove in
the last corner stake. "I saw the document. It's all there;
seals, signatures, totally legal. It"s one of the benefits of
having a mother who was a lawyer. In fact, that led me to find the
one part that might be a problem. In very tiny print, like almost as
tiny as those cute little pores of yours, there was a clause stating
that Amanda Lane and her heirs lose all rights to the station if it's
not built before the railroad reaches here."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi nodded as she
grabbed rope to tie to the stakes. "Makes sense. Speaking of
railroads, I notice that the..." She forced one of her posse to
take their foot off of the stake it had been resting on. "The
rail gang's already behind those hills, so they'll be here pretty
quick."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman nodded
grimly. "Yeah, I noticed them too."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi walked over to
the harmonica player. "Listen, um, Harmonica, or whatever? With
a town built on a railroad, you could make a fortune; hundreds of
thousands of dollars. Maybe even more than that; maybe thousands of
thousands."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redhead smiled.
"They call them millions."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi considered that.
"Hmm, I like that. Millions; it has a nice ring to it. You
know, I always figured I could make a deal with a smart gentleman.
All I'd have to do is..." She stopped as she noticed her posse
standing around doing nothing. "Hey, do I pay you to stand
around and do nothing?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the men shook
his head swiftly. "Um, no ma"am, but what do you want us
to do?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi flipped her hair
back. "What do you think I want you to do? Build a Station! And
Robert, stop calling me ma"am!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The man who"d
spoken before bowed his head. "Yes, ma"am."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi turned back to
the redhead. "I figure it won't look like much, but it'll be
the first thing he sees when he gets back."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The smile left the
redhead's face. "You mean, <I>if</I> he gets back."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom looked deep into
the eyes of Stacy Rowe. It wasn't that he wanted to look into the
eyes of the woman he knew had killed his family. It wasn't that he
felt compelled to look out of respect, fear, or hatred.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was because, while
she had him pinned to her bed, there really wasn't anywhere else to
look.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy undid the buttons
on Tom's shirt. He helped her as she shimmied it off of his torso.
Stacy started kissing Tom along his chest. Her mouth made her way up
his neck to his lips, and they shared a deep, satisfying (to Stacy,
anyway) kiss. Stacy raised her head above Tom, letting her hands roam
around his body as he did the same to hers. By this point, Tom had
disassociated his mind from what he was doing, as he had many times
before. It was a bit harder to pretend that the woman on top of him
was just another nobody when she spoke to him. "I think..."
Tom ran his hands along her sides, trying to throw her off. It didn't
last long. "I think I'm going to be a little bit sorry killing
you. You like being alive, don't you? I can see you also like to have
a woman's hands all over you, even if they belong to the woman who
killed your wife."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom pulled Stacy's head
down to meet his lips. He didn't want to hear about his late wife,
and Stacy reminded him with every breath she took.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy finally broke the
kiss. "You're..." She stopped to gather herself. "You're
a little..." She felt the front of his pants. "Well, a
big tramp, aren't you? Is there anything you won't do to save your
hide?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom's face became as
blank as he could muster. "Nothing, Stacy."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy moved to undo the
fly on his trousers, and as she slid them off, Tom rolled over onto
his back. Stacy was pleased with what she saw. "Now I think I
understand why they miss you so much back in New Orleans. You know,
the telegraph is a cool little invention."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She then made noises
approximating the long and short signals from a telegraph while
tapping the code out on Tom's back. She stopped after a bit. "Tom?
Tom Sloane? Why all the customers back at the most elegant all-male
whorehouse on Bourbon Street have been weeping ever since he left!"
Stacy ran her fingers through Tom's hair. "I gotta ask, did
Amanda Lane know?" She didn't give him a chance to answer.
"Yeah, I bet she did. She's just the type to marry a
man-whore." She gently led his head to face hers. "Hey,
now that's an idea. I could marry you, and then the land becomes mine
automatically. Who knows; maybe you'd be a perfect husband."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy lay on her back,
and Tom held his nearly naked body next to her almost fully clothed
body. Stacy continued, "Ah, but then I'm no good as a wife. I
mean, can you see me slaving over a hot stove with a bunch of rugrats
crawling around? Forget it. I guess we'll have to think of another
solution. Something simpler. Something quicker."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom, fearing that she
meant death, decided that now was the time to act, and kissed her
passionately on the lips. Stacy hadn't meant that at all, but she was
in no mood to argue.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter
Ten</FONT>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Angela Li, the town
sheriff, sat at the main table in Flagstone's Town Hall. It was
customary for the sheriff to act as the auctioneer for any property
auction. She couldn't help but think it was a shame she would be
unable to bid on the large piece of property being offered. Still,
from the whispers coming through town, and from the group of
rough-looking bandits who"d made their presence at the auction
known, she had a feeling bidding on the land would be nothing but
trouble.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"As sheriff of
this county," began Sheriff Li, "I've been asked to
preside over the sale by auction of all property belonging to Mr. Tom
Sloane-Lane, here present. This parcel of land includes 320 acres and
it's free of all encumbrances, liens and mortgages. This property and
all it contains, lock, stock and barrel, will be turned over to the
lucky purchaser at the time of sale. All the contents therein are
listed by number on the inventory sheets &ndash; oh, blah blah blah,
I'm sure you've seen them floating around. Let's get to the money for
me, that is, for Mr. Sloane-Lane. I declare the auction open!"
She banged her gavel to mark the beginning of the auction. "All
right, now who will give the first bid for the glory of Fllllagstone
County?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sheriff Li was
surprised that the only sound that followed her announcement were the
scattered murmurs between the assembled well-to-do townsfolk. The
likely bandits remained silent. "Excuse me, I said who's going
to make the first bid for this excellent property?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A woman with bright red
hair wearing an ankh necklace raised a hand. "Two hundred
dollars!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Sheriff Li announced
the high bid of $200, one of the female riders, a brunette with a
very small nose walked over to the scarlet-haired townswoman and
whispered into her ear. "That stinking piece of land isn't
worth it you wanna-be goth." To emphasize her point, she put
her hand on the girl's face and pushed against her nose, cutting off
her breathing for a moment.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sheriff Li, not
noticing the assault, continued. "Come on people; the livestock
alone is worth twice that much! All right, who's going to say three
hundred dollars?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A girl with
dishwater-blonde hair was smoking a pipe, and decided to make her
move. However, as she raised the hand holding the match she had just
lit her pipe with, a rider with long blonde hair grabbed that hand
and used it to light her own pipe. When the rider put her hand on the
other woman's shoulder, she knew this, in fact, was not a good place
to make any move.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sheriff Li, oblivious
to what was going on around her, continued talking up the land.
"What's wrong with you people? I realize I'm not offering
California, but $200 is a damn shame for a piece of land like that!"
She realized she wasn't getting anywhere and turned to the man on her
left. "Well, nobody's going to bid it up. Are you sure you
don't want to set a minimum price? I wish I were wrong, but you're
looking at selling this land for a plate of beans. Of course, that
would mean I, that is, the county would end up with 10% of a plate of
beans, so if you'd like to set the price higher..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom shook his head. He
knew this was all part of the plot, and he had to play his part. "All
I want is to sell."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany looked out the
window of her train car. Until recently it had been her mobile
palace, allowing her to get virtually anywhere she needed. Now,
however, it had turned into the most luxurious prison on wheels. Out
her window, she saw nothing but desert, mountains, and the few
patches of grass that sprung up around the stream nearby.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She walked over to what
she really wanted to see, herself. She gazed into her mirror, but
still didn't really feel happy. Before today, she saw herself as the
queen of the railroads; the top boss for anyone that mattered to her.
Now she knew that it was all a show. She knew that Stacy had stolen
her position out from under her, and she was left impotent. What was
worse, she felt death coming a little faster every day. As
unfashionable as it was to have the Tuberculosis she had, the fact
that it was killing her was slightly worse.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She turned the mirror
over, and on its back was the painting of waves on the sea she had
picked up back east. She always loved the water. It was so calm and
peaceful, even when the sea was crashing all around. If the water was
slow enough, well, then she could see herself, just like in the
mirror. She had heard the water on the West Coast was that peaceful.
That's why they called it the Pacific. She knew she had to get there,
if it was the last thing she did.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She turned around when
she heard what sounded like one of the boys guarding her talking
about her. It turned out they were just playing cards to pass the
time. The stakes were small, but then Stacy never really had to pay
the boys much to get her way. Seizing on an idea, she walked over to
their table, which happened to be her desk, and asked, "Um, can
I play a hand?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The man sitting in
Tiffany's chair looked at Tiffany for a moment, shrugged, and put
down a couple bills. "I bet fifteen." One by one, the
other men folded their hands, allowing him to take the pot. He smiled
and looked back up at the woman he was told to keep prisoner, knowing
she was bound to have the stakes to play, but not necessarily the
smarts to win. "Sure, sit down!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany maneuvered into
the chair they offered her. When the man in her normal chair started
shuffling the cards, she asked, "Um, can I deal?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The man eyed her
warily, disbelieving that she knew how to play poker, never mind
deal, but decided to hand her the deck. "Sure, why not?"
He was surprised when she put the deck onto the table without
shuffling, but not as surprised as he was when she took out a stack
of $100 bills and shuffled them instead. She dealt them out, five to
each man, while the men sat in awe of the stack of money placed
before each of them. The same man who handed her the cards now
checked the bills before him and asked, "So, um, how do you
play this game, Ms. Blum-Deckler?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany smiled. "It's
really easy. As long as you use your head, you never lose."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the riders
raised his hand, smiled, and said, "Five hundred dollars."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the county clerk
took down the bid, Sheriff Li realized what was going on. "Hmm.
Five hundred dollars." The rider nodded. "Are there any
other bids?" asked Sheriff Li.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rider, cocky for
being the one to place the bid, said, "I don't think so."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sheriff Li couldn't
argue with that statement, and turned to Tom. "I'm afraid I'm
going to have to knock down on that bid, Mr. Sloane-Lane." All
Tom could do was nod. Sheriff Li turned back to the rest of the room.
"Five hundred once. Five hundred dollars twice. Five hundred
dollars..."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Five thousand
dollars," said a female voice from the back of the room.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone turned to see
who had just bid. Townsfolk murmured amongst themselves. Riders,
fearing their easy job had just gone south, tried to figure out who
they might have to kill next. Sheriff Li looked to find the source of
the voice. Tom, too, looked for the speaker; not because he didn't
know who spoke, but because he did know.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A red-haired woman
walked down the stairs and stopped at the landing halfway down. Her
face betrayed no emotion, even though she felt a rush from making
such a grand entrance.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sheriff Li, whose face
was lit up in expectation, asked, "Did you say five thoooousand
dollars?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redhead shrugged
nonchalantly. "It's on its way." With that she pulled out
her pistol and aimed it upstairs.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From the top of the
stairs walked Sandi, dragging her feet with a scowl on her face. This
brought continued rumblings from the crowd. The redhead continued.
"Now, if I remember correctly, this woman's reward is five
thousand dollars, right?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi turned to her
captor. "Judas was satisfied with four thousand, nine hundred,
and seventy dollars less."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-haired woman
looked confused. "Sandi, they didn"t have dollars in
those days."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi stopped on one of
the stairs. "But bitches, yeah."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At Tiffany's train car,
one of her former captors mounted one of the remaining horses tied up
outside the train, untied it, and rode it into town.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Sandi was being led
by Sheriff Li and a handful of other lawmen, she stopped. "Um,
excuse me? I believe the jail is back that way."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sheriff Li smiled.
"That's absolutely correct, Sandi. You, however, are going to
the railroad station. I'm sending you to Yuma, Sandi." Sandi's
face fell. "You see, they've got a brand new jail there; the
kind I plan to build around here. They've got more walls, more bars,
and even more guards! Now don't be glum Ms. Griffin; I'm sure you'll
come to like it &ndash; in twenty years. You'll see."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With that, Sheriff Li
left Sandi in the capable hands of two of her deputies. They walked
Sandi over to the train. On the way, two young men saw Sandi walk by.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blond-haired man
said to the other, "Hey Butthead; it's Sandi. Heh heh. I think
she's getting on the train rather than going to that jail we were
supposed to break her out of."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The brown-haired man
saw. "Shut up, Beavis. I see where she"s going. I think
they're trying to, um, railroad her or something."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Beavis smiled. "Oh,
heh heh. So, um, I was thinking we should, like, get on the train
with her. I mean, it looks like she needs help, and maybe she'll let
us touch her thingies if we save her."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Butthead laughed.
"Huh-huh, yeah. She might even let us score."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Beavis was excited by
this prospect. "Whoa, seriously? That would rule!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Butthead smiled. "Yeah,
we're going to score."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Beavis turned to the
cashier's window. "Um, I think you should give us two tickets
to the next station, so that we can make sure that, um, you don't get
shot by us and stuff."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Butthead slapped the
back of Beavis's head, causing him to scream in pain. "Shut up,
dumbass. Uh, we're here to make sure the train stays on the tracks,
and, uh, the guy from the last station said, uh, just go onto the
train, but the buttmunch on the platform said we needed to get a new
ticket."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The man, who up until
now hadn't been paying much attention, said, "Well, I guess
that's all right. I don't want to see what happened last week. A bull
got onto the tracks as the train was a-comin' and darn near wrecked
'em."<BR><BR>Beavis chuckled. "Heh heh, you said
'rectum'."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom held up his glass
and toasted the red-haired woman. "Well, here's to you.
Congratulations." He swallowed the contents of his glass. "You
got yourself a good deal."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-haired woman
smiled when she realized what Tom had meant. "Oh, that auction
thing. Forget it. Investing in land is so Pre-War of Northern
Aggression."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom stood up and walked
over to the bottle on the bar in the saloon both stood in. "You
don't look like the defender of poor, defenseless widowers." He
filled his glass from the bottle. "But then again, I don't look
like a poor, defenseless widower." He swallowed half the
contents of the glass, and made a face known to all who have drunk
cheap whiskey.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redhead smiled.
"Sandi's right: you're a remarkable guy."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom turned to her,
downed the glass, and frowned. "And you're a remarkable gal,
but you've got something on your mind."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redhead smiled. "It
sounds like you've got something on your mind."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom waggled his
eyebrows before saying, "Hot water. Specifically a bathtub full
of it."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom turned around and
froze when he saw the entrance to the saloon, specifically who was
standing there. The red-haired woman noticed this, turned around, and
found herself gazing directly on the woman for whom she had searched
for years.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom said, "I
think I had better fill that bathtub right about now," before
crossing the saloon to the stairs leading to living quarters.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy walked in,
looking angrier than she would if someone told her that her clothes
had gone out of fashion last month. She sat down at a table near the
doors of the saloon and asked, "Who are you?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redhead walked over
towards Stacy. "Forbes Carlyle. Renee Andrews."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy rolled her eyes.
"Come on; more dead women?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redhead smiled
slyly. "Well, they <I>were</I> alive before they met you."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy decided to get
down to business. "Look, you paid $5,000 for something that
belongs to me." She pulled out a bundle of cash. "Five
thousand dollars..." she set it on the table and pulled out a
large silver coin, "plus one." She flipped the coin onto
the table. "I mean, you've got the right to make a profit,
after all."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-haired woman
would have been insulted by the offer, had she not expected something
of equal insult to be offered. After all, the first time the two had
met had resulted in a very unfair forced trade; one that could never
be taken back.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy pulled out a
piece of cedar gum and started chewing. "You know, if I were
you, I wouldn't take too long deciding. You've gotten yourself into
something much bigger than you are, and I'm offering the chance to
get out easy. Not that I would tell you what to do, of course, but
I"d say you"d better take it."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redhead was resting
on the saloon doors, watching the people outside. "You're
beginning to sound like a real businesswoman, Stacy. I guess being
with that Ms. Blum-Deckler has done a lot of good." She saw out
of the corner of her eye a woman with a rifle, leaning against a
building. "I see you've learned some new methods." She
then saw a man on a horse riding up, gaining the attention of not
only that woman, but the woman on the balcony above her, and the two
men where the horseman had stopped. "But then, you haven't
given up on the old ones either."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy was losing her
patience. "Pick any method you like; just make the deal."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The smile fell from the
redhead's face. "Which deal, Stacy?" Stacy turned to look
at the redhead, who was still looking out at the town. "We had
more than one deal on the table."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy, not certain what
other deal or deals she meant, but not looking for any issues if she
could avoid them, said, "Well, I guess we could just put them
all together into one package and settle all of them right now. How
does that sound?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redhead shook her
head. "Easy, Stacy. You should really learn not to push things.
I mean, taking it easy is probably the first thing a businesswoman
should do, right?" She watched as the gunwoman on the balcony
jumped down to meet up with the rest of the group gathered around the
horseman. The redhead then turned and walked over to Stacy's table.
"Something tells me Ms. Blum-Deckler could teach you even more
than she has already." She took a small glass of whiskey
sitting on Frank's table and drained it, not wincing from the taste.
"Hey bartender, how much do I owe you for this?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The man wiping off one
of the tables answered, "One dollar."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To that, the red-haired
woman took the silver dollar on the table, made a show of dropping it
into the glass, and finally set the glass down and walked over to the
stairs, leaving the stack of bills on the table. Stacy, not really
surprised that the Blum-Deckler way hadn't worked, gathered her money
and headed outside the saloon. She looked to the places she expected
to see her men and women, only to see those positions empty. <I>Well,
this isn't good.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-haired woman
walked to the hall window on the second floor, but saw that it not
only didn't open, but didn't give the view she needed. She needed to
get into the next room over, but the door was locked. Knowing she
didn't have much time, she kicked open the door.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom nearly jumped out
of his bathtub when the door opened, revealing the redhead. He wasn't
sure what was going to happen. On the one hand, she didn't look like
she was going to go after him, and she had stopped momentarily when
she noticed he was there. On the other hand, he didn't know what she
was after. He reached for his backscrubber, but so did she, and she
handed it to him. What he certainly didn't expect was for her to
throw open the sash on the window behind him.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She looked out the open
window, and saw Stacy under the overhang of the watchmaker's shop.
Just beyond the shop was her horse, but getting on the horse would
expose her to anyone who might have a clear shot at her. Stacy looked
somewhat skittish; she was keeping together very well for most
people, but she was not at all pleased that her entourage had
deserted her. She worried that they may have found someone else to
follow; someone who wanted her dead.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-haired woman
scanned the buildings around her for anyone who might be aiming for
Stacy. Finally, she saw it: the barrel of a rifle sticking out of a
small hole in a cloth sign advertising the local theater.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy finally decided
she couldn't just wait there forever, and started to walk over to her
horse.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom said, "It's
funny. I could swear I was about to hear that strange sound again."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redhead smiled.
"You will, right now." With that, she fired several
pistol shots at the sign.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy heard the shots
and pulled back against the wall of the watchmaker's shop, looking up
at the woman who had fired. She heard a tearing sound, and turned to
the source in time to see a woman from her entourage fall through the
sign and onto the ground. <I>I don't understand it. She just saved my
life. Why?</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy didn't have time
to think about it now. She walked towards her horse, and one of her
former associates walked out, aiming his gun at her. Stacy shot him
with ease, as did she the other man who jumped out with his gun drawn
at her. Stacy relaxed a bit, but knew there was another woman she
came to town with.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redhead climbed out
onto the balcony from a side window. As Stacy came back to the other
side of the building, she saw the redhead and drew her gun at her,
only putting it away when she saw that the redhead's hands were both
on the railing. From her vantage point, the red-haired woman saw the
last woman, a blonde, jumping onto the roof of the next shop over,
finally coming to the top of the watchmaker's store. She hid behind
the large picture of a pocket watch at the peak of the building and
got her rifle in position.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redhead called out
to Stacy, "Gee Stacy, time sure flies when you're having fun. I
mean, it's already past noon."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy took a second to
determine what she meant, remembered the watch painted above her, and
turned around. Just as the blonde brought her head over the roof to
aim, Stacy pulled her trigger, sending the blonde tumbling down the
roof and through an overhang over a porch on the next building over.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy looked over at
the red-haired woman, but not wanting to look a gift horse in the
mouth, she nodded, walked over to her horse, mounted it, and rode
off.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom watched the last
bit of action from the window, wrapped in a towel. When the redhead
came back in, he said, "But...but they were her entourage."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She nodded. "That
they were."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom continued. "And
they tried to kill her!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman shrugged. "I
guess they found someone who pays better."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom then got mad. "And
you! You saved her life!"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman stopped, took
a deep breath, and turned around. "I didn't let them kill her,
and that's not the same thing."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom nodded, still
angry, trying to figure out the woman's words. "Sure, it's not
the same thing."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman looked deeply
into the man's eyes. "Come on; get dressed. It's time to go
home."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Stacy approached
Tiffany"s train, the first thing she noticed were the dead
bodies lying on the ground around it. The second thing she noticed
was that some of them were hers, and some of them weren"t.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy checked the
engine, the passenger car, and Tiffany"s car, the only cars on
the train, and found all of her men and women dead, as well as half a
dozen others. Some of them she recognized, but even if she hadn"t,
the yellow dusters were a dead giveaway as to who had been there
before her. Taking in all the dead bodies, she had expected to see
two others. The woman responsible for the dusters might have escaped,
but the other woman wouldn"t have gotten far.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy looked behind the
train and saw something that made her smile. Tiffany Blum-Deckler was
face down in the dirt, crawling for a small pond of water. Stacy
couldn"t tell whether Tiffany had been shot, but she was
showing signs of dehydration, and her tuberculosis practically
paralyzed her below the waist. Tiffany used the strength she had left
to turn towards Stacy, who drew her gun. Tiffany"s arm holding
her up collapsed, and she fell into the dirt. She resumed crawling
over to the pond, inch by inch. Stacy, realizing that she wouldn"t
have to do anything to Tiffany, put away her gun and walked back to
the train to prepare for her return trip.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiffany continued her
crawl. <I>I may not make it to the Pacific, but I"ll make it to
this water.</I> She gave one last push, and her eyes were finally
over the pond. She smiled weakly. <I>There. Even dying I still look
so pretty.</I> She collapsed, and her final breath escaped into the
dust just inches before the water.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=5>Chapter
Twelve</FONT>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi rode slowly back
into the partially-built town, passing the men and women working on
the railroad as she went. On her way in, she saw a familiar,
red-haired figure, leaning on a post and whittling a piece of wood.
She stopped and nodded her recognition, as did the woman Sandi knew
only as "Harmonica". Sandi started to say something,
thought better of it, and continued on her way.



<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She rode until she got
to Tom's house. She entered and shut the door seconds before Tom had
shut the door he entered from. Tom jumped, then sighed and smiled
when he figured out who had entered. "Like, did you make
coffee?" Sandi asked.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"This time I
did," Tom replied, and went to pour Sandi a cup.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi took it and
sipped. "Good," Sandi said, almost hesitantly. "My
mother used to make coffee this way. Hot and strong enough to wake
the dead." Sandi poured a basin of cold water while Tom went to
the window, seeing the red-haired woman.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom asked, "Sandi,
what's she waiting for out there? What's she doing?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi splashed the cold
water onto her face. "She's whittling on a piece of wood; don"t
ask me why. I've got a feeling when she stops whittling, something's
gonna happen."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At that moment, Stacy
came riding in from the east. Harmonica threw down her wood and knife
as she approached.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Surprised to see
me here?" Stacy asked.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Nah, I knew
you'd come." the red-haired woman replied as Sandi dismounted.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"You know,
Tiffany once told me I could never be like her. Now I understand
why," Stacy said, coming within a few feet of Harmonica. "I
mean, it wouldn't have bothered her knowing you were out there
somewhere, alive."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"So you found out
you're not a businesswoman after all?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Nah; just a
woman."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"An ancient race.
Other Tiffany's will be along, and they'll kill it off."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"That"s
kind of a weird way to put it, but it doesn"t matter. Nothing
matters now; not the land, not the money, not the guy. I came to see
you, because I know that now you'll tell me what you're after."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Harmonica got up. "Of
course, but only at the point of dying."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy nodded. "I
know."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom walked up behind
Sandi. "I heated some water for you, and I also found the
makeup in your pack."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">"Uh, put it there
please," Sandi said, as she pointed to a nearby table and took
off her riding gloves. "So that I can watch the railroad move
up while I clean up." Sandi looked out at the scene unfolding
before her. "Like, if I was you, I'd go down there and give
those girls a drink. You can't imagine how happy it makes a woman,
and some of the guys I guess, to see a guy like you; just to look at
him. And, you know, if one of them should grab your tush, just
pretend it's nothing. They've earned it." Tom looked sideways
at Sandi as she said the last bit, while Sandi began to apply her
makeup.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Harmonica and Stacy
moved a respectful distance apart. They stared each other down, and
Stacy let her duster fall to the ground, giving her freedom of
movement when the time came. Harmonica watched her with a leg up on a
stump as Stacy found her place. Harmonica then walked towards Stacy
until they were about ten feet apart, and pushed back her duster so
that it was behind her holster. The smile on Harmonica's face had
melted into a steely glare. She remembered back to the first day they
had met, on distinctly unfriendly terms.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On that day, Stacy had
walked up and taken a harmonica out of her pocket before pushing it
into a 12-year-old red-haired girl's mouth, saying "Keep your
loving sister happy." The girl had been standing, with her arms
tied behind her back. Standing on her shoulders was her older sister,
a slightly shorter girl with auburn hair and large glasses. Her arms
were also tied behind her back and a noose wrapped around her neck.
The noose was tied to an archway, one too broad to use as leverage.
While Stacy and her three goons watched, the girl"s strength
started to fade. The older sister screamed, "You bastard!"
at Stacy, then looked down at her sister. "Sis, this isn"t
your fault; it"s mine as much as it is hers. Never forget that
I love you, Qui-"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her last word was cut
off, as that girl had finally collapsed from the weight, allowing
Daria to hang. Stacy and her goons took off, leaving the girl with
the harmonica, her sister's body still swaying in the breeze above
her.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Almost as one,
Harmonica and Stacy drew their guns to fire. Even though Stacy had
started moving an instant earlier, Harmonica's gun fired first. The
bullet hit Stacy in the chest, making her miss the red-haired woman.
The impact spun Stacy around 180 degrees.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Inside the farmhouse,
Tom gasped from the window. The noise had made Sandi mess up her
lipstick and she grimaced when she saw that she would have to reapply
it. <I>Oh well, at least I wasn"t putting on mascara.</I>


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy attempted to put
her gun away, missing the holster and dropping the gun. She staggered
and finally fell. Harmonica walked up to her fallen adversary.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stacy gasped, "Who
are you?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To answer, the woman
grabbed her harmonica, yanked it off the band that kept it around her
neck, and placed it into Stacy's mouth. Realization flooded into
Stacy's head, and just as quickly, life left her as she collapsed
into the dirt.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">---


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom walked over to
Sandi, who'd finished making up her face. "Hey, you're sort of
a cute lady."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi looked into Tom's
eyes. "But I'm not the right lady." Tom's eyes darted
away in the direction of the gunfight and the red-haired woman. "And
she definitely isn"t," finished Sandi.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom smiled. "Maybe
not, but I"ve made worse decisions in dating." Tom put
away the basin.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi followed after.
"Like, you don't understand, Tom. People like that have
something inside; something to do with death or something. Now that
she"s taken care of that other woman, she'll come in that door,
pick up her stuff and say ciao." Sandi looked out the window
and sighed. "I guess it would be nice to see this town grow."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just then, the
red-haired woman walked up to the front door and entered. Tom smiled
to see her, as did Sandi. However, when Tom saw her stone face, his
smile left his face. Harmonica picked up her bag and said "Well,
I guess I"ve got to go now." Tom frowned and silently
cursed Sandi for being right. The woman looked out the door at the
men and women working on the railroad. "It's going to be a
really pretty town, Lawndale."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom responded "I
hope you'll come back someday." Both of them gazed deeply into
each others eyes.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redhead looked out
the door again and said, "Maybe someday," before leaving.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Behind Tom, Sandi spoke
up. "Yeah, I got to freaking go too." Sandi walked over
to Tom, who was still gazing after the red-haired woman, and grabbed
his right butt cheek, getting his attention. "Like I said,
pretend it's nothing." She let him go and left, while stared
after both women as they left.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi and the redhead
rode out past the workers and down into a small valley. Harmonica
kept going, but Sandi got off her horse and knelt down groaning. The
redhead noticed Sandi's actions and turned back to her, dismounting
as she arrived.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi was clutching her
abdomen. "Sorry Harmonica, I got to stay here."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The redhead knelt by
Sandi as she trembled, and examined her bullet wound. "Ewwwww!
Who did this to you, Sandi?"


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sandi chuckled once and
grimaced. "I ran into Little Miss Choo-Choo. I didn't count on
that half-woman from the train. I guess she got scared. Ahhh."
She winced in pain. "You know, Harmonica; when they do you in,
pray it's someone who knows where to freaking shoot. This is worse
than wearing a canary tube top with indigo culottes." She
spasmed and groaned. "Go away, leave me alone! I don't want you
to see me die. It"s so unfashionable."


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-haired woman
thought it over, and then walked back to her horse about 15 feet
away. Sandi groaned, grimaced, and breathed her last before
collapsing on the ground. The redhead slowly turned around and looked
at her fallen compatriot. She picked up Sandi"s body to put it
on her horse. As she did, she heard the sound of an incoming train
engine, coming up near the partially-built town of Lawndale.


<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tom came out to give
the workers refreshment from their labors. Soon the railroad would be
complete, and this part of the west would be tamed. The town of
Lawndale would become one of the main hubs of the railroad in this
part of Texas. A prosperous city would grow as settlers started
streaming in. The future was bright for Lawndale. Today, however, was
just another day: a day to work, a day to plan, a day to live, and,
for some, a day to die.
