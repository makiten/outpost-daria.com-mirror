<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“<span style='font-family:Computer'>Jane
Lane was in pain, Jane Lane couldn’t complain, Jane Lane had to explain that it
was her time of the - drat</span>!”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Jane Lane pushed away the keyboard
of her word processor in disgust. “This story is my worst one yet! It’s worse
then one of Summer’s child-catching stories!” </p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Jane was angry and couldn't even
explain the reason why. It all started a couple of days ago at the Zon. She and
Daria were in audience of a band called “Art an’ Miss”, somewhat like the
Harpies, but beefed-up. The band’s singer was a girl named Beth, dressed in
sleeveless with a lot of tattoos, and with a buzz cut similar to Daria’s gym
teacher back in Highland. For some reason, though, Jane was impressed with
them. “You got to admit,” she told Daria later, “those gals did handle Upchuck
the horny toad pretty well. Got to give them kudos for it.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Gals?” Daria incredibly replied.
“Jane, since when do you sound so camp?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Excuse me?” Jane repeated
incredulously. “Camp? Me?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Yeah,” Daria shrugged. “For some
reason, your vocabulary, it… didn’t benefit from your <i>camping</i>
experience, I believe.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“This is about that summer camp –
hey, now you got <i>me</i> saying this! For the last time, Daria, it was an art
colony, and would you leave me alone with it?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Daria shrugged. “I’m just curious
to hear the tale of the girl who got fresh with you,” she shrugged. </p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Right,” Jane snorted. “I bet Tom
is somewhere in the wings, waiting eagerly for my tale.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Jane, this is sick. We really do
need to get a life – and not use Tom to accomplish that goal,” Daria sighed. </p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“What good <i>is </i>he, then?”
Jane snorted, amusingly. </p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Daria shook her head. “At any rate,
we’re getting distracted. Jane, so what <i>did</i> happen at the art colony?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“I met a bunch of interesting
people.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“And one of them got fresh with
you.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“That was sarcasm.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“You said it wasn't.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“I was letting you on?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“You didn't look very convincing.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“And how would you know that?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“I’m a master at reading human
feelings, emotions, facial expressions, and vocal timbres,” Daria said matter-of-factly.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Jane stared. “Say what? Please
don't tell me – you’re a test tube baby and can shoot laser blasts with your
eyes – that’s why you need your glasses.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“I wore lenses.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Once. And looked extremely
uncomfortable while doing this.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“I then went completely cold turkey
– no lenses or glasses or anything.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“And looked extremely scared while
doing that.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“So? If you were to go cold turkey
from painting and sculpting, you’d look extremely scared too.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Jane’s eyes narrowed. “Let’s make
it a bet. I <i>can</i> go cold turkey from painting and sculpting <i>barring</i>
Ms. DeFoe’s class for – a week. And if I don’t do so, I'll tell you the truth.
But if I do, well, then, you’ll wear lenses for a week. Deal?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Daria paused. “You know, maybe we
can have a simultaneous run. See if we can do that thing at the same time.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Jane looked thoughtful. “Think
Lawndale High will be able to handle both of us acting weird?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Let’s wait and see if it’ll tilt
or whirl,” Daria said.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>And so, the bet was made. And now,
to Jane’s greater irritation, she discovered that she was struggling already to
keep to her end of the bet. “Damn it,” she muttered. “When Daria is writing
something in <i>her</i> room, it all seems so easy! Damn it! Am I no better
than Trent?” she yelled drastically and froze. “Speaking of the devil, just
where is he?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Trent Lane sat near the Zon,
smoking like some Billy Idol wannabe. He knew that, and he didn't care. He was
just too unsettled. In less than a year, Janey would be gone, and he, well,
will remain here. In Lawndale. </p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Or won't he? The gang – excluding
Nick, but he was easily goaded-in by Max – were all for leaving Lawndale
whenever that subject got raised, so all matters were settled – in theory. In
reality… In reality, when they tried one of their bi-annual road trips, they
got into yet another one of their bi-annual messes. It was always like that. If
not police tickets, then getting lost. If not getting lost, then forgetting or
breaking or mixing-up of the music equipment. If not-</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Hey, Trent,” Monique sat down next
to him. “What’s up? Jesse told Effïndïe who told me that you looked depressed
lately, and I came to see for myself.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Janey’s leaving,” Trent
drawled-out. “Both she and her friend Daria are leaving.” He paused and added:
“for Boston.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“And here I was, thinking that we
were a pair,” Monique said crossly. </p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Trent looked at Monique, looking a
bit cross himself. “We are, aren't we?” he spoke. “For this week.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Monique glared. “Trent, why are you
so upset that your sister and her friend are leaving for college? I mean, it
does make the house all to your and Mystik Spiral, no? I mean, no bothers or
interruptions-“</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“I don't know if that is such a
good idea, Mon,” Trent shook his head. “This house – it is major materialism.
It may keep us on the ground.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Does the rest of the band see it
in such a fashion?” Monique spoke with a rather shrewd look in her eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“I don't know,” Trent shrugged
semi-thoughtfully. “But that major materialism bit – it was Max’s.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“And others?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Jesse like the governmental senate
– keeps minding his own business, mostly, and Nick – well, Nick is always
opposing Max – do the math yourself.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“So it all comes down to you,
then?” Monique said, snuggling closer to him.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Well, yeah. Hey – did we make-up
already?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Can we not talk about that?” Monique
said crossly in her turn. </p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Oh? What’s wrong?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Calais. Remember, I told you that
Jesse spoke to Effïndïe?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Yeah?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Well, Calais dropped-in, and they
got into an argument, and I kind-off got dragged-in.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Oh yeah. Calais is your friend?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Well, the same way Effïndïe is my
sister’s, but you know her-“</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Yeah, I do,” Trent nodded. Calais
was pretty much the quintessential Harpy of the band – ragged and free like the
wind, and also quite cold like the wind. He always wondered how she was-</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Trent,” Monique purred
dangerously. “Can you please listen to me?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Sorry, got lost in my head.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“And here I was worrying that you
were off to Morpheus’ clutches.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“I never sleep on the street,”
Trent shook his head. “That’s why we’ve got Max’s van, remember?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Yeah.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“So.. what was the argument’s
about?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“A certain clock – it’s a female
thing.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Oh. Right,” Trent spoke slowly.
“So is there anyway I can help?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“I don’t know,” Monique said with
such a misery that Trent was surprised. “I’m so confused Trent, and worried. I
mean – why did we start to go out and all?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“I was approved by your sister?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Thanks for reminding me,” Monique
replied in a fashion that Trent was reminded of Daria. “Just what I wanted to
hear.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“You know, you just sound like
Janey’s friend – Daria,” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Monique gave him a baleful look.
“What with you and her?” she asked. “You like her or something?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Well, maybe… Look, she’s leaving
and I’m staying.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Yeah. With me.” Monique spoke-up.
“Ain't I special.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Trent gave Monique another look.
She was acting like Daria again, and as Janey told him, Daria behaved that way-
“Oh. You sort-of feel like me, too, hah?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Yeah. I mean, I’m not a yo-yo or a
billiard ball, you know? I mean, you at least got a family-“</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Please,” Trent spoke with some
importance. “I’m thinking.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Oh?” Monique looked with some
surprise at Trent but said nothing more. This went-on for some time, and then
Trent started speaking once again.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“You know,” he carefully said, “I
could try and get a part-time job, if you want to move with me or something.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Monique eyed Trent carefully.
“Where did that come from?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Isn't it a solution to our
problem?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“<i>Our </i>problem?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Well, problems, but they look
similar and all. Right?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Well, when you put this way,”
Monique carefully said, “I suppose we can try and do that.” She paused. “So,
what do we do now?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Buggered if I know,” Trent
shrugged. “I don’t want to go home just yet – Janey’s there and in a bad mood.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Well, let’s go inside,” Monique
then shrugged. “I think it’s starting to rain.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>They walked inside, arms
intervened.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Charles Ruttheimer the III was
nervous though he didn't show it; <i>Upchuck</i>, on the other hand, looked
nervous as Hell.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“S-So Charles where are we going?”
his date spoke nervously from the seat next to him.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“It’s a surprise, my sweet,” he was
impressed how confidently he managed to drawl that out. “A very great
surprise.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Really, Ch-Charles? It won't be
anything unpleasant or t-tacky?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Tacky, my dear? When in our
relationship was I to show tacky so far?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“W-Well, you’ve got a point. You
never were what was considered <i>tacky</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Exactly,” he nodded. “Some music,
perhaps?” he pressed a button on his machine’s panel, and instantly a song by
Queen began to play:</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“The show must go on<br>
The show must go on, yeah<br>
Inside my heart is breaking<br>
My make-up may be flaking<br>
But my smile still stays on.”<br>
Charles felt like would almost blush in embarrassment – if he still could. So
much for a romantic mood. But to his surprise his date prevented him from doing
that. “You – you also like Queen?” she asked.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“You – you like it too?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>She nodded. “Yeah. Others at the FC
think it’s… unfashionable, but I can relate to it. You?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Pretty much so, only I don't have
fashion-conscious friends to think that it’s unfashionable, or any other type
of friend for that matter.”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Um, want me to be your friend?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Uh, let’s first see how the date
works out?” Charles said, feeling odd – for himself. He stopped the vehicle.
His date reached to unbuckle her belt. He briskly raced around the vehicle and
opened the door. “<i>S’il-vous-plait</i>,” he spoke in a very good French
(certainly a better one than what was taught in Lawndale High.)</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Why, Charles, I didn't know that
you could speak real French!” Stacy Rowe exclaimed.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>Charles beamed. He was impressing
her – in a good way. That was obviously good. “But of course I do! Now shall we
go? Our dining awaits!”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>The rifle range of Lawndale was
rarely closed after sunrise, and only on weekends – like Sunday. That wasn’t
the case tonight, since it was Friday. And Basil, the owner of the range, was
eagerly rubbing his hands for the arrival of his usually Friday-night’s
customers – and they came – right on time and, as Basil knew, they would leave
right on time too. </p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Welcome,” he spoke cheerfully in
his casual Hungarian range. “The rifle range of Lawndale welcomes the
Lawndale’s Businesswoman Association. Your usual?”</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='tab-stops:36.0pt'>“Yes,” Linda Griffin growled,
pressed by her girl-friends behind her. “And no delays, I hope?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“None whatsoever,” Basil nodded emphatically, as she and the
others followed inside. When faced with a steady income on one hand, and the
combined wrath of many tired, stressed, burned-out businesswomen of Lawndale,
it’s easy to make the correct choice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“And folks used to say that establishing a rifle range here
was a bad idea,” Basil inwardly smirked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You know,” Tom muttered, feeling a cross between confusion
and bemusion, “I thought that it was <i>my</i> parents who were supposed to be
easy with my cash flow.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That’s because you’ve been dating the wrong sister,” Daria
smirked. “Quinn can get a wad of cash or a banking card any time she wants –
well, almost. My immediate presence usually puts a damper on that thing. But,”
she added, looking slightly worried, “tonight was different.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I'll say! You look-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Please,” Daria groaned. “It’s all a bet with that damn
Jane.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hey! I thought you were upset when Jane-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“This is <i>me</i> doing it, it’s different,” Daria
shrugged. “Just call me a canting hypocrite and be done with it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Oh, how ‘bout-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Don't finish that sentence, Tom,” Daria said frankly.
“After all, this is for a week tops – or sooner, if Jane cracks.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What is she supposed to do? Wear your glasses?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No, do anything else but art.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“You realize that that’s a very loose term-“</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Me and Jane understand it enough, thanks,” Daria said. “Seriously
though – hey, isn’t it Upchuck?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Who?” Tom turned around and whistled. “Well, I'll be a
cabin boy on a pirate schooner, Charley did get himself a girlfriend?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Charley?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yeah. You know, the town’s boy who’s acting like a
love-child between Roman Faunus and Marilyn Manson?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria rolled her eyes. “Are you on a Greek fad? First you compare
me to a Eumonide, now him… well, the description’s pretty accurate, especially
the first part. And speaking of the girlfriend – I think it’s one of Quinn’s
fashion-conscious friends, hmm…”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Going to tell her?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No,” Daria shook her head. “I doubt that Upchuck will be
foolish enough to try anything – criminal.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“True. And he is a nice guy – if you're not a girl, that
is.” Tom paused. “Or anything of the female gender. Or my mom.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hah?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mom spoke one to him when he tried his moves on Elsie – and
he never bothered neither Elsie nor mom ever since.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Wow. I got to talk to her.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Maybe – ah, here’s dinner!” Tom emphatically said. “Shall
we dine, Miss Morgendorffer?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Absolutely, Mr. Sloane, dine we shall!”</p>
