One Night In Lawndale

I always dreamed of parodying One Night In Bangkok sung by Murray Head for the
Daria universe, so here it is:


Daria:
Lawndale--cartoon city setting
and the city don't know what the city is getting

Jane:
The creme de la creme of MTV's toons
with Aeon Flux,and Bevis and Butt Head,
those goons


Brittany:
Kevvy's a football playin' sweetie
even if we fight,with or without a
treaty


Sandi:
I am,The Fashion Club head honcho
and I only enlist members if they've
got a muslin poncho


Joey:
It's The Pizza King.....

Jeff:
....or Chez Pierre....

Jamie:
....or The Mall Of The Millennnium....


Quinn:
....or....or that place....!!


Chorus:
One night in Lawndale and Ms. Li's on the loose
inventing charities for you and me
While Upchuck's chasin' babes just like a wild goose
The Fashion Club goes on a shopping spree


Kevin:
I can feel that Brittany tryin' to attack me

Helen:
One laywer's sort of like another,
after all,I am one of them,brother


Trent,Jesse,Max & Nick:
It's a drag,it's a bore,it's truly such a pity
to be playin' Dega Street than the rest
of the city


Jake:
What do you mean?!? You've seen one
avarage tri county cartoon big city....


Ms.Barch:
All males in Lawndale--Lawndale
Oughta be tarred and feathered without fail


Stacy:
I just love to cry my eyes out
when it comes to lots of problems
and other stuff,no doubt



Ms.Defoe:
I get my kicks with Jane's art--she's smart....



Chorus:
One night in Lawndale and 'ol DeMartino
pops out his bloodshot eye for you and me
Amanda Lane likes to drink vintage vino
when working on her favorite pottery



Mack:
It just sucks when Kevin calls me Mack Daddy



Solo



Quinn:
Lawndale's going to be the witness
when The Fashion Club and I do
our power yoga fitness



Jodie:
It's too late to repent
now that I am the school
president


Mr. De Martino:
And THANK God MTV's
RUNNIN" the show,and
CONTROLLING it....!!



Tiffany:
I don't see you complaning
how slow I am in contemplating


Upchuck:
I'd let you watch,I would invite you
But even Lawndale's babes wouldn't
entice you


Ms.Li:
So you better go back to Laaaawnndale
High,Jane Lane's house,and Daria's home....



Chorus:
One night in Lawndale and Mystik Sprial is playing
trying to make some Lawndale history
Tom Slone came here once and it's here he is staying
dating Daria for the fans to see


Mr.'O Neill:
I know Janet Barch's trying to date me


Chorus:
One night in Lawndale and it's cancellation
for poor Daria and her company
After five seasons of cartoon elation,
it's time to end the Daria industry


Daria:
Time to say farewell to good 'ol MTV
