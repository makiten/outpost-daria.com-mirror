<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>It was a Friday afternoon,
and both Jane and Daria were full of plans for the weekend, especially Daria,
whose external stoic stoneniness just belied the raging storm of emotions
within her – well, according to Mr. O’Neal anyways. Those who knew both Daria <i>and</i>
Mr. O’Neal better, could clearly see that Daria was bored almost out of her
skull. “So what are the plans for this weekend, amigo?” Jane finally said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Not one flicker of emotion
clouded Daria’s face. “Do homework,” she said in her habitual monotone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Anything else?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Daria shrugged. “Get bribed
by Quinn to do hers.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“That’s it?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Get bribed by parents to
double-cross Quinn and let her do her own homework.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“That’s all?” Jane persisted.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Got any better ideas?” Daria
asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Watch the all-weekend spy
movie marathon at my place?” Jane suggested slyly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Daria grimaced. Ever since
Monique had moved-in into the Lane house, Jane’s subtle (from a Lane’s point of
view) moves of getting Trent and Daria together seemed to have got their second
wind. “We’ll see,” Daria said evasively, unwilling to touch that sensible
topic. “My parents – they seem to have planned something big for tomorrow and
Sunday.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“What, take you on a fishing
expedition to the Atlantic coast?” Jane snorted. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Given dad’s luck, we would
probably catch a seal and get arrested for poaching,” Daria shrugged. “Look,
I'll call you back later.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Sure,” Jane replied, feeling
oddly depressed. While she was no longer jealous over Daria and Tom, Trent and
Monique’s latest actions made her extra restless than usual – so restless, in
fact, that it made Jane wish that it would be college time yet. But it wasn’t. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>And so, Daria and Jane said
good-bye to each other and went their separate ways.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>As soon as Daria had entered
their house, she knew that something was afoot – besides Jake and Helen, who
were darting and running around the house like a pair of roaches O.D. on vodka.
Daria wasn't the one to procrastinate on asking any questions that she was
interesting in knowing the answers to, and so she said: “Mom, dad, just what
are you doing?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“We're going camping!” Jake
said in his trademark excitement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“And we’re taking guide books
with us, too!” Helen added, less so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Does Quinn know about this?”
Daria finally asked after a pause – calculated exactly to the moment when Quinn
herself<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>had entered the house after
waving good-bye to her F.C. friends. “Know about what?” she innocently asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Helen and Jake exchanged
guilty looks, but answered firmly enough: “We're going camping!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The next moment, Quinn
Morgendorffer’s anguished scream had shuddered the entire neighbourhood. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>It was much later in time,
and much closer to the nightfall; in fact, it could be almost considered night
fall, only no one in the Morgendorffer household could go to sleep for one
reason or another. In Daria’s case, it was because she was talking to Jane.
“We're going camping. Again,” she told flatly her best friend, who couldn’t
quite keep irritation from her voice either:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Damn it girl! Didn't your
ancestors get O.D. on some berries and almost died?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“And this is why they’re
taking me along and not letting me watch the movie marathon with you. Oh sure,
they spewed some things about me getting fresh air and exercise, but Quinn
ruined all pretty much, so I’m getting shanghaied into this as plain as
cheese,” Daria truthfully said. But Jane’s next words surprised even her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Hey, do not diss the cheese!
Sometimes it can be quite fancy!” Jane said. Poor Jane! She didn’t that a,
Daria couldn't be outshocked, and b, certain events at the Morgendorffer household
had left Daria with a quite stable opinion – on the same ‘cheesy’ topic, as she
produced and demonstrated to the shocked Jane just then. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“No, Jane,” Daria said. “The
shapes of certain fungi and plant roots are fancy; the shape of cheese is
always plain: a wheel, a sphere, a gourd – or an isosceles triangular slice. Or
is it a cone?.. Hmmm…”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>There was pause as all that
Daria said had finally sunk-in into Jane’s skull. “Daria, since when are you so
interested in cheese?” The Lane girl finally asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Even through the phone, Jane
could ‘Daria’s mental shrug. “Ever since mom won this Madison divorce case –
we’ve been getting cheese, butter, other milk-related products by the package.
Currently, I’m having my lately-regular evening dose of curdled milk with
sucrose in this really genuine-looking clay pot, see?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Upon hearing the magic words,
Jane’s eyes bulged. “Did you say – a clay pot?” she asked. “Can I have it
Daria, please? I've been learning this neat clay-glazing technique, and-“<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Now it was Daria’s turn to
pause. “Jane, maybe I should ask mom to stem some of her gains in your way –
you’ve clearly been lacking vitamins or nutrients or something!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Jane shook her head. “Nah.
Ever since we had this bet – you no glasses, me no art – Trent and Monique had been
kind of on my case a little…” Jane paused and pried deeper. “Daria, did you
just hear what I've said?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Daria mentally sighed. She
was over Trent now for good, and never really had anything against Monique
ever. As for Jane’s insistence... “As long as it’s not about Allison, I’m not
interested. Quinn, on the other hand, might. Want to talk about her?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Jane blinked. Ever since she
had told Daria about her summer art camp experience, she was getting a lot of
that later – and not all of it from just Daria. “So will I be getting my little
clay pot any time lately?” she subtly changed the topic of discussion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Next Monday, sorry, not
earlier,” Daria casually said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Whatever,” was Jane’s
equally casual reply.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The rest of the
Friday-to-Saturday night passed-on without any exciting events. True, Jane
spent most of it watching the spy movie marathon, and Daria spent it listening
to Quinn moan in her own room – Daria’s padded walls were nowhere as thick as
she wanted them to be – but it had passed-on as boringly as usual, and that was
what mattered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Then the morning dawned. Of
course, Daria couldn’t vouchsafe for Quinn or Jane, but for herself, she felt
the flame of her emotions awaken as soon as she was hustled – like a piece of
contraband over American-Mexican border – into the Morgendorffer family
vehicle. And the emotions that began to burn in that newly-kindled flames were
of a negative sort. Angrily (for her) she began to glare (in her style) around
the town, listening to Jake’s excited babble, feeling that she needed to do something
or she’d snap. And she found what she was looking for, soon enough. “Hey dad,
look at that blonde in a jogging suit!” she said excitedly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Where?” Jake in his
eagerness went not with <i>what</i> was sad, but with <i>how</i>. And
naturally, his reward was a brief glimpse of Ashley-Amber… and a rather angry
slap from Helen. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>…It was some time later
during the day. Jane was approaching the Morgendorffer house. Another person
was standing there already – a boy about their age, with his hair dyed piebald
– a mix of white and brown. “Is Daria home?” Jane asked politely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“No, they’re out,” the boy
said. “There’s a note on the door that they’ve left for the weekend.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Jane frowned. For some
reason, this didn’t seem right. “Isn't it Monday already?” she asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The boy just stared at her.
“No, it’s just Saturday still,” he said in a tone usually reserved for mentally
retarded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Boy, did I get my clock
confused or what!” Jane said trying to hide her embarrassment. She remembered
her sister Penny saying that the best defence was a good offence, and went with
the flow. “Hey, why are you here?” she asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The boy shrugged. “I was
thinking of meeting Daria, but they’ve left already.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>But Jane was not to be
put-off. “Say, how did you and Daria meet?” she asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The boy laughed in a weird
way. “It was in a little institution named Hell!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>And then he walked away, with
Jane just staring at his retreating back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>While such exciting things
were apparently happening to Jane, the Morgendorffers had their own type of fun.
Their new camping spot was on a little sylvan clearing near the Merrimack River
– something that Daria seemed to actually appreciate – and really too, for
once. Normally, such an event wouldn’t be left unnoticed by her mother’s
aquiline eye, but for the moment it was actually occupied by that great
pseudo-bouquet of sylvan vegetation that Jake had offered her as an apology
gift (for something that he had no idea about, as usual). “Here’s honey, a gift
from the forest to you!” Jake said proudly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Helen took one good look at
the verdant abundance before her, and blushed. “Jake, you shouldn’t!” she
playfully said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Meanwhile, Daria was making
herself comfortable on the river’s shore, but she did give a glance towards the
older generation. “Hey dad, your ‘forest theme’ idea was great,” she finally
gave <i>her</i> resume. “But poison oak’s the same as poison ivy – they both
make folks itch!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Upon hearing that Helen
dropped the plans and hit Jake again…<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>…Back in Lawndale, Jane was
walking home, deeply engrossed in her thoughts. It was just too bad that a
lamppost didn’t have enough good sense to step aside for her behalf…<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>BOOM!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Shortly after the
‘forest-plants’ fiasco, Jake was consoling himself. He was sitting on the
branches of a crab-apple tree, with Helen underneath it looking more steamed
than an average dragon. Quinn was staring at this landscape scene feeling
partly confused and partly incredulous. “Daria-“<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“No.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“But Daria-“<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Go and ask them yourself.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“No!” Quinn said quickly,
taking in the red faces of their mom and dad and abruptly changed the topic.
“What are <i>you </i>doing?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Daria just looked at her
fishing equipment and said in her trademark monotone: “Fishing.” And since she
was sitting with her back to her family, Quinn didn't see the intensely concentrated
<i>and</i> venturesome look on her sister’s face. She, however, realised
something else.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Are you allowed to do that?”
she asked, surprised.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Wordlessly, Daria produced
some sort of license out of a pocket of her coat, and began to read. “The owner
of this license is licensed to fish and hunt in the province of-“<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Enough,” Quinn interrupted,
and spoke rather helplessly: “So what am I to do? You're <i>fishing</i>, mom
and dad’s all weird…”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“You go and see what they
have in the car?” Daria said not unkindly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Quinn just shrugged. “Okay.
I've brought my phone with me anyways, so…”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Quinn? Go.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Jane Lane opened her eyes.
Judging from the lack-of-sky factor, and the excess of flames and brimstone,
she realized that she was no longer in Lawndale. “Where am I?” she meekly said.
She instantly regretted it, for a demonic creature, looking like a
leathery-winged rotting human corpse appeared and spoke: “In Hell!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“You’ve got to be kidding
me!” Jane’s mouth said before Jane’s brain could stop it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The creature just smiled and
morphed into Allison, still leathery-winged. “Kiss me Jane – you know you want
me!” Allison-monster said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“NO-O-O!” Jane yelled… and
awoke. She was sitting – or rather, reclining on the floor in the old Lane
living room, with her brother Trent sleeping – or rather, waking, on the couch
in the same place. “I see that you're awake,” Monique’s voice came from the
doorway.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Jane looked at the TV and
firmly shut it off. Sometimes, enough was enough.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Back at the Morgendorffer
camping site, things have changed little, or none at all. Jake was still in a
tree, only more sleepy-looking than before, Helen too was still underneath it,
doing some paperwork now, and Daria was still on the river bank, fishing, and
looking almost happy (for her). And of course, Quinn had to ruin that semi-idyllic
arrangement. “Dad, telephone!” her voice came from the tent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Jake, startled, and quite
sleepy, said “What?” and fell off the tree onto Helen. One good look into her
eyes, and Jake took-off running into the forest, almost faster than a wild turkey’s
flight speed. And he had a good reason to, for Helen followed him on an almost
equal speed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Where did our parents go?”
Quinn asked, getting out of the tent a short time later. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“I think they’re just being
themselves – their younger selves, that is,” Daria gave her sister her
explanation, keeping her sight – and attention – on the fishing line before
her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Eew!” Quinn spoke then
paused. “So how’s fishing going?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Got some lost some,” Daria
shrugged. “What are you doing?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Nothing…” Quinn admitted,
the noticed something. “Hey, why’s the line so tense?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“What?” Daria asked,
genuinely surprised, for once. She then looked in the direction that Quinn was
pointing at, and yelled:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Quinn, hold
me!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“What?” Quinn asked, grabbing
her sister around the waste.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Now!” Daria yelled, and
began to pull, as the line – and Daria’s arms – just tensed-up some more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The next moment some
monstrous force pulled the Morgendorffer sisters off their feet and into the
river, towing them through the river like a motorboat. Both Daria and Quinn <i>were</i>
yelling, of course, but Jake and Helen, finally finding some rest – and
seclusion in a totally different place of the woods, heard their cries very
faintly and indistinguishably, and soon began to ignore them altogether as they
faded away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Back in Lawndale, Jane was
staring very intensely and business-like at the Morgendorffer house. Upon
learning that it was still – or yet? – Saturday, she immediately proceeded to
the Morgendorffer house, intent on getting that little clay pot no matter what.
However, in all of her artistic determination, Jane had not yet lost enough
brains to brave the frontal assault – it was going to get her arrested in no
time, and that would be it. So, she bravely scaled the fence and found herself
in the Morgendorffer backyard, where she went immediately for the patio doors –
and unknown to her, she was being watched. And followed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Imagine a broad-leafed forest
as smooth as an on-wall tapestry with a river going through it like a shiny
blue rope, framed with a green of a different shade – and you’d have imagined
the forest in which the Morgendorffers were camping, And now imagine two girls
- Daria and Quinn - sitting on a river bank, breathing heavily, looking at
their catch. It’s a giant gar. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Now what, Einstein?” Quinn
heavily panted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Daria, true, wasn’t in the
best of shape either, but she wasn’t about to let Quinn know it. Besides, she <i>had</i>
a plan, which she shared immediately with her friend. “We go down the river,
searching for our camping spot. Unfortunately, it’s on the other side of the
river,” she explained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Quinn just looked at their
catch, imagined an entire river with fishes that big, and said her idea: “We’ll
have to find a wading spot somewhere.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Daria shook her head,
remembering the park’s map, and knowing that such a spot was a long way away in
either direction from their spot. “No,” she firmly said, unwilling though to
explain this to Quinn in detail. “Let’s first find our camping spot, and then
worry about getting across.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Well, all right. Let’s go,”
Quinn agreed, after thinking about their options for a while.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Daria was doing the same
thing, only more proactively, and so she motivated Quinn up, by saying: Let’s
hurry. It’s some time in the afternoon already, and I don’t want to wander
after dark.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“After… dark?” Quinn said in
a small voice. Daria just started walking, lugging their fish. Wordless – for
once – Quinn just followed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Meanwhile, while Daria and
Quinn were starting their trek back to camp, neither of their parents was
entertaining such thoughts. Both Jake and Helen lay in a tight embrace, doing
something… naughty, and no one noticed several pairs of non-human eyes watching
them from all places around them – and even if they did, so what? What harm can
a toad, a slowworm, a roach or a ground beetle do to two people? And so, Jake
and Helen just shagged-on, while the sun went lower to the ground, and all
around them, the shadows grew.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Jane Lane, on the other hand,
was in a city – more correctly, a town – and so was bothered none by such difficulties.
She was too busy struggling with the stubborn patio doors that refused to let
her in. “I’m getting myself that little clay pot, if it’s the last thing that I
do today!” Jane determinedly said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“You want help with that?”
somebody else spoke.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Instantly, Jane looked around
and saw a suspicious character of unidentifiable gender in military-type pants,
boots, and a leather jacket. “What if I do?” she finally said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Then let me try!” in a
masterful tone the stranger said, and sure enough, soon enough, they and Jane
were inside the Morgendorffer house. “I'm very impressed, really!” Jane said,
feeling more than just a bit awed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“It was nothing,” the
stranger said dismissively then paused. “Now why did we get in here?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“I've got to get something
from upstairs,” Jane said, unwilling to introduce her mysterious new aide to
the intricacies of her artistic mind. “You… can do whatever you want, just
don't stir things up, okay?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Got it,” the stranger nodded
gravely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Jane quickly runs upstairs,
to Daria’s room, and after a brief, but frantic search, she quickly found the
necessary piece of clay crockery. She took it excitedly, raised it to her eye
level… accidentally looked into the window… and quickly realized as to where
she was and with whom. Even quicker, she then ran downstairs. “Hey… ye!” she
said still on the stairs. “I've got my things, now let’s go!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Hold the horses there,
comrade,” the stranger said, emerging from the kitchen. “Can't a woman finish
her meal in piece?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Jane froze, not sure if she
did hear correctly. The stranger looked – to her – more manly and masculine
than most of the football players at LH, and was <i>female</i>? “Excuse me, but
what did you say?” Jane finally spoke. “What is your name, anyways?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The stranger chose that
moment to appear out of the kitchen, sans the jacket. Her torso only had the
pants’ suspenders and nothing else on it, showing definitely some curve. “Did I
forget to introduce myself? Sorry. I'm Audrey,” she said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Jane paused, staring at
Audrey’s physique that could do homage to many of the wrestlers that she’d seen
on TV. Heck, Jesse was even less manly than that, and he was a guy. “Aha, sure,
I'm Jane,” she finally said, unsure of what she was thinking. “Can we go now?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Audrey shook her head. “Not
until you try that cheese pizza thing Jane, it’s fantastic.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Jane just smiled weakly.
“Sure. Great.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Back at the camping spot,
Daria idly noticed, things haven't changed. Only mom and dad still haven’t
returned from their run. Daria, however, didn't mind. First the heart-wrenching
trek back to camp – on the <i>other</i> side of the river – that took a good
half an hour or so; and then a record swim across the river – but long enough
to get their clothing all wet. Now, though, their clothing was being dried – by
being positioned close to a makeshift fire-and-spit, upon which Daria’s catch
was being roasted. That did mean, of course, that both Daria and Quinn were naked,
but Daria still didn't see the reason why Quinn insisted on hiding in their
tent – there wasn’t anybody around for a really big distance… “Are they
dried-up yet?” Quinn spoke-up for an umpteenth time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“I don't think so,” Daria
casually said. “Why are you so meek anyways? It’s just us.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“It’s just so strange!” Quinn
protested. “I mean, I dreamt that I’d get naked for the first time-“<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Quinn, just be grateful,
that it’s just us - for the moment – and not mom and dad too. Can you imagine-“<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Is the fish ready yet?”
Quinn hurriedly interrupted her sister. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Daria jabbed the fish with a
makeshift turning fork. “No, I don’t think so,” she truthfully said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Oh damn!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Jane and Audrey were walking
silently through the Lawndale streets, each keeping her own council. For
herself, Jane had to admit, that she had certainly felt weird – well, not
weird-weird, but like all of her confusions that she had felt ever since that
summer art camp – and not about fauvism, Jane didn't want to talk about <i>that</i>
anytime soon – but about herself, her love life – or the lack of it hereabout.
She also wondered what did Audrey think-off, and whether her thoughts were
anywhere like Jane’s – or like Allison’s, for that matter. “I've been thinking,”
Jane decided to finally re-break the ice. “You're not from here, are you?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Nah, our folks have just
come here recently – we’re really from <i>Boston</i>,” Audrey shrugged.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>If Jane has had anything in
her mind, she’d have choked. Luckily for her, she didn’t. “You're kidding! I'm
going to Boston this fall!” she said, surprised.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>And Audrey too looked no less
surprised. “Cool! You’d like it there, I'm sure! Want me to write a letter to
my friends? I'm sure they’ll be happy to help you?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“We’ll see,” Jane said,
suddenly suspicious of Audrey’s enthusiasm yet unwilling to appear ungrateful
either.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Silence started again, and it
was Audrey that broke it. “So what are you going to do with that pot thingy?”
she asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Jane blinked. Truthfully,
she’d almost forgotten about it ever since she learned that Audrey was Audrey
and female. “Do some artwork on it – something for Trent to remember me by when
I leave,” she finally said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Your boyfriend?” Audrey said
casually.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Brother,” Jane sighed, “I'm
currently single.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Audrey’s face fell in honest
apology. “Oh. Well, I'm sure that you’ll find plenty of young men in Boston,
no?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Jane frowned, thinking.
“Yeah…” She paused. “Hey, can you tell me about that city of yours in general?
Where exactly are you from, anyways?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Dorchester,” Audrey said,
perking up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“So? Tell me more, woman!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Audrey smiled – a very nice
and bright smile, Jane noticed. “Well, comrade,” Audrey said cheerfully, “be
prepared to be <i>amazed</i>.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>It was some time later. Daria
and Quinn – now fully clothed – were finishing eating the fish, and idly
looking at the sky, where the sun was now most definitely going down. Daria
looked as she usually looked, but Quinn was apprehensive… <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Daria…”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“What?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Shouldn't we go and look for
mom and dad?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Daria sighed. “If my memory
serves me correctly, mom and dad had barged into this sylvan windfall with a
speed greater than that of an average pronghorn antelope, let alone a wild
turkey’s. Considering, that immediately after that we had a bit of a speed
adventure ourselves and completely lost their traces, we, Daria and Quinn, have
no chance of finding them now.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Two questions: what should
we do, and what’s a pronghorn?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“We’ll do what I did the last
time you three O.D. on “glitter-berries” – call for help, and as for your
second question, just think antelope.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Right. Sure,” Quinn paused.
“Where’s the cell phone – oh yeah, in the tent. I forgot. Silly me.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Just go and get it, would
you?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Shortly afterwards, Quinn was
listening, feeling just a bit awed, as Daria nonchalantly (for her monotone)
chatted with the local ranger station. “Hello, Mr. Smythe?” Daria was speaking
into the phone. “This is Daria Morgendorffer speaking. Yes, I <i>do</i> sound
familiar – I did call about a year or so ago when my family ate some
hallucinogenic berries. No, nothing like that – our parents are just lost.
Well, not exactly lost, but me and my sister haven't seen them since morning,
and now it’s almost sunset, and we’re worried, and aren't sure what to do- Oh,
you’ll <i>be</i> coming here? Groovy. Why? Rules? Okay, bye!” And Daria
hanged-up the cell phone. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Quinn stared at her. “Do you
know that you sound almost like mom?” she finally said. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Daria almost blushed. “I just
got a good memory, that’s all.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Yeah, but it was so long,
and-“<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“And you <i>did</i> eat the
hallucinogenic berries, remember?” Daria pointed-out, but not too unkindly.
“It’s all in the past Quinn, let it slide.” She paused. “What I’m interested
in, though, is where the Hell mom and dad are spending their time at? And why haven’t
anybody tried to contact them yet?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Quinn shrugged. “Long
distance phone bills. They can be murder on any kind of budget, believe me, I
know them. Probably, Eric is in some sort of a financial hock, and-“<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>From the river’s side there
was a splash. Quinn gulped and moved closer to Daria, quieting-down somewhat.
“What’s that?” she meekly asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Daria shrugged, but went and
got the flashlight out of the car – just in case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>While the Morgendorffer
sisters were preparing for the night’s advance, Jane Lane and her new
acquaintance Audrey Hessell, (all questions about her last name Audrey declines
to talk about, saying that even her parents don't know its’ origins, let alone
herself), were leaving Pizza Parlour. “Want me to walk you home?” Audrey asked
suddenly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Jane silently examined Audrey
all over, with the most peculiar expression on her face. “Eh, why not. Follow
me,” she said, and then started a new topic, by asking: “So will you be going
to Lawndale High?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Most likely. Why?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Then I’m going to pay you
back for all of your tall tales about Boston by giving you some stories about
LH.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Hey, all I told was the
truth!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Then so will this be.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Audrey shivered in mock fear.
“I think I'm going to like it here,” she said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Maybe,” Jane said with a
mock-nasty chuckle, “oh maybe!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Daria and Quinn were sitting
in their tent, looking at the river, the nocturnal sky, and the forest on the
shore through a relatively narrow slit. In the river, some fish were splashing,
possibly the relatives of the giant gar that the girls have caught earlier, and
various bats were skimming over the river, hunting gnats and mosquitoes. An
idyll, in other words, but for an owl’s hooting, that sent Quinn in spasms of
fear, to Daria’s greater amusement, as the older girl watched the constellations
materialize in the darkening sky. “By the lepolite, this is so beautiful!”
Daria finally spoke.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Quinn frowned. “I don't think
so. I mean, nature’s okay – in small, <i>small</i> doses, and this is definitely
an O.D. area. Next, aren’t you worried about mom and dad? In this thicket
that's around us, a <i>day-time</i> search would’ve not been a lark, and this
now, in the dark – I’d be rather fishing for another shark!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Excuse me?” Daria finally
stopped contemplating life on other planets, including Mars. “When did we fish
for a shark?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Well, what is that thing
anyways? If it isn’t a shark-“<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Think a really big pike
then. Or a barracuda. Not a shark.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Same difference. I once saw
that book of yours, ‘Monsters of the Sea’, and both sharks <i>and</i>
barracudas were there.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>A faint smile almost touched
Daria’s lips in the dark. “Ah, yes. ‘Monsters of the Sea’. My very first text
book.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Oh, come on! ‘Textbook’?
Half of the book consisted of photographs!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“It’s the content that
counts-“<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Excuse me,” a totally new,
strange voice spoke out of nowhere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Both Daria and Quinn eeked,
but Daria re-composed herself faster. “Mr. Smythe?” she finally asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Yes. Now tell me the events
of today starting with your arrival here on this morning in detail.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Daria and Quinn exchanged
glances with each other. “Well, okay,” Daria spoke. “But you won't get any
wealth of information – I was fishing.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“No problem,” Quinn quickly
said, smiling winsomely at the senior ranger’s assistant. “Well, Mr. Ranger,
sir, our arrival here today had been omened with a scandal…”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Jane and Audrey were standing
before the Lanes’ house, feeling somehow weird and awkward, without any
knowledge or understanding as to why. “See you tomorrow?” Audrey weakly said
(for her, anyways).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Sure,” Jane nodded, not
feeling too upbeat herself (for her, anyways).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The pause stretched. Neither
girl was somehow ready to terminate their day so… abruptly, when Monique
appeared in the doorway with a ladle in her hands. “Jane?” she said suddenly,
“who’s your young man, and why do you keep him outside? Say good-bye to him or
invite him, one of two!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Jane looked balefully in the
older female’s direction. “Monique,” she began, but before she could break-out
in her monologue, Audrey interrupted her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Your mom or whoever’s got a
point,” she suddenly said. “My folks <i>are</i> waiting for me, after all. Bye
Jane, see you tomorrow!” And she quickly walked away, dissolving in the dusky
twilight of the night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Jane just sighed, glared once
more at Monique, and went inside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“And all will return to the
old tracks,” Daria crooned, continuing to watch the stars in the nocturnal sky
(now over a literally-black forest, with one eye, and keeping the other orb
over Quinn, who was flirting with the younger ranger, with her usual scope of
Quinny success. All is missing now are mom and dad to-“<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>At that moment the doors to
the rangers’ station opened, and in struggled Helen and Jake, looking more
messed-up (and mussed-up) than two escaped convicts. The Morgendorffer adults
were covered in mud, twigs, leafy vegetation, and et cetera. Their clothing was
little bit better, looking more appropriate on a pair of human-sized hedgehogs,
porcupines, or spiny anteaters. Naturally, that upon the entrance of two such
‘Creatures’, silence fell in the station as all present there observed Helen
and Jake, who were flushing like mad now. And amongst all those stares, Daria
Morgendorffer, stiff and straight as an arrow of a beam of a stellar light,
stamped in a pseudo-military fashion over to her folks and asked:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>“Can we go home now?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Helen exhaled with a <i>sound</i>.
“Tomorrow,” she said. “We’ll go home the first thing tomorrow.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Jake merely nodded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Jane Lane was sitting in her
room, getting ready to bed. Only one last thing remained – her entry into her
computer diary (the last, but quite hardy, remnant of her bet with Daria). “</span><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Computer'>Dear Diary</span><span
style='font-size:13.5pt'>,” Jane was writing, “</span><span style='font-size:
13.5pt;font-family:Computer'>today was one of my strangest days in my life, and
it’s mostly because of Audrey. Are <i>all</i> people in Boston as strange as
her? According to her - yes. Just into <i>what</i> am I getting in this fall?
Daria too, of course, but she can obviously handle it better than me, Miss.
Monotone Girl... Anyways, I think this is going to be like one of those pop
songs: ‘And everything changes’... Look, I'm starting blub, so I'm tuning-out:
Cheers!</span><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Jane Lane turned-off the
electricity in her room and went to bed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The strange Saturday was
finally over. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
