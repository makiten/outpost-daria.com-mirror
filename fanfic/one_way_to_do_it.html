old Jeep.  Even my imaginary friend left me because of lack of funds and
material goods.  Bastard!!!</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This story is &copy; 2006 by TippedOver.  Stacy and her folks (?) are
owned by Mtv, a.k.a. Viacom, shareholders, and probably Rupert Murdock.  I
genuflect in your general direction for letting us have Daria... and curse your
name to the very depths of Hell for trying to take her away.  Daria on DVD!!!</span></span></p>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Stacy sat in the driver's seat of her fathers Crown Victoria, and tried
to stay calm.  She could feel the sweat starting to pop up to the surface
(Tiffany: Staaacccyyy!   Ewwwwww!) as she stretched the seat belt across
her chest and lap.  She tried not to look at the tester sitting in the
passenger seat, who was writing notes in the manila folder that had "Stacy
Rowe" and "Final Road Test" typewritten across the top.  She sighed, and
then looked out the side window at her mother, who was waiting on the bus
stop bench.  Her mother looked up at that moment, smiled and gave her a
thumbs-up.  She looked nervous, but what did SHE have to worry about,
thought Stacy.  'She HAS her license!'</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Stacy started running over what she had to do it in her head, like her
Dad told her at the kitchen table that morning; "First thing you do is greet
the instructor.  Make a good impression.  If you are a little nervous, that's
OK.  He or she probably sees a lot of that.  Listen to them.  Put your
seatbelt on!  Very important.  Next, check your mirrors.  Make sure that
nobody is around before you stamp on that old gas pedal and lay rubber
taking off."</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Stacy nodded quickly, and passed her Dad his coffee cup.  He took a
sip, and continued.  "Then, when you get to the first stop sign, stop
completely before the crosswalk.  You wanna make sure that there is
someone watching you when the car launches.  It is a great feeling when you
look over and see someone mouth the word 'WOW!' at you."  He paused for a
moment.  "Taking out a pedestrian is not a good thing, most of the time.
Most of the are law-abiding people, trying to get thru their lives with as
little muss and fuss as possible.  Of course, if you see someone give you a
dirty look AS you come up, then it's perfectly understandable.  After all," he
said with a grin, "Who's bigger, you or them?"</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Stacy smiled back at her father, and then turned her attention back
towards the eggs she was making.  She thought he might be making a joke,
but she wasn't sure.  He's had his license for a long time.  He knew what it
took.  'Daddy never lied to me before,' she thought, as she salt-and-peppered
his eggs.  'Hitting people?  That doesn't sound right.  Buuuttttt....'  Stacy
flipped the eggs out of the pan, and onto the plate to join the biscuit her
mother had made before she went in to take her shower.  She picked up two
pieces of greasy bacon from the rack, and deposited them on his plate.  She
picked it up, and then set it in front of him.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>"What about red lights?  They always seem to turn yellow so quickly
when I was practicing.  I was never sure when to stop."  Stacy continued her
questioning.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>"That's easy, honey."  Her father paused to tuck a piece of bacon in
his cheek.  He chewed for a minute, and then swallowed.  "Good bacon,
thanks."  He continued after picking up his coffee cup.  "It depends on the
actual <i>color</i> of the light.  There are the standard red, yellow, and green
lights.  You know that from the Driver's Ed book, and from your permit test.
There is one more color that they don't tell you about.  Any driver worth his
or her salt knows about it.  The color is <i>bright pink</i>."  He took a sip, and the
set the cup down.  </span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Stacy looked at him quizzically.  'Bright pink?' she thought.  'I never
heard of that.'  She kept quiet while her father ate a few bites of his egg,
and another bite of bacon.  She knew if she was quiet, he would continue.
After a moment, he did.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>"I'm not supposed to tell you this," her father said, as he took a quick
look toward the shower door, and then leaned forward so he could speak to
her in a quieter voice.  "Bright pink is the color <i>between</i> yellow and red.
Most people don't realize it, and the DMV tries to keep it a secret, but some
of us know about it.  This color means that you can still cross traffic, in the
second that the red light comes up.  If you get to a light, and the light turns
red at the <i>second</i> you reach it, hit the gas a little harder.  You'll fly across
the intersection, and everyone will still wait for you.  Besides," he said as he
picked up his cup again and grinned, "they got brakes too, don't they?"</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>"Sure." said Stacy.  She smiled at her father, and set her plate of
toast on the table.  She heard her mother coming in from the bathroom, and
then leaned across the table.  "I won't tell Mom." she whispered.  "I'll keep it
a secret about the lights and stuff when I get to the test.  Thank you,
Daddy!"</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Stacy finished her breakfast a few minutes later, and put her dishes
in the sink.  She headed toward her bedroom, to get ready for her test.
She passed her Mom in the hallway, who was on her way to the kitchen for
her own breakfast.  "Ready for the big day?" she asked her daughter
brightly.  "Sure, Mom.  I'm gonna take my shower and then we can go."  Stacy
continued to her bedroom, and shut the door.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Two hours later, standing out in the yard with one of the neighbors,
Stacy's Dad laughed.  Stacy and her mother had left almost and hour ago, to
meet the driving tester downtown.  "Yeah, I told her a bunch of nonsense.
You know, the bright pink light thing."  He paused while he and the neighbor
had a good chuckle.  "She's a smart girl, no matter what she acts like
sometimes.  I hope she got a good laugh out of it also, and it calmed her
down a little."</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the distance, they could hear the sound of sirens.</span></span></p>
<br>
<br>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">Well, there we go.  My first fanfic.....ever!!!  I have been reading a lot
of other people's work, and I thought I'd give it a shot.  I always liked Stacy,
and thought she should have punched Sandi in the schnozz at least once
during the Daria run, but it didn't happen.  It took me about 2 hours to write
this, I woke up with the idea in my head, and just couldn't shake it.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If you liked it, tolerated it, thought it would be a great thing to use in
