first two requests for this information crossed your desk two weeks ago, then
five days ago.&nbsp; Would you care to get on the phone with Mr. Howser and

remembered getting the second notice, and knew that if he checked his bulletin
board, there was a very strong likelihood he'd find a reminder to himself to get
the job taken care of.&nbsp; But, like everything else on his board, it had been
quickly covered by dozens of other, similar requests, some of which he couldn't
fill because the printing department wasn't churning out the necessary documents

be out of work now.&nbsp; His paycheck covered the mortgage and the car payment

bit.&nbsp; &quot;But, there are still the same problems we've been seeing all
along regarding her interaction with the other kids.&nbsp; She still won't play
at recess, or participate in group activities.&nbsp; She never raises her hand
in class even though she always knows the answers when called on.&nbsp; The
other children used to try to draw her out, but that's happening less and less.&nbsp;
I'm worried about the extent to which she's withdrawing.&nbsp; It might make it
even more difficult for her to be surrounded by older kids.&nbsp; While I don't
deny that she's academically ready for the second or even the third grade, I
don't think she's ready to take that step socially.&quot;<o:p>

was nothing new, of course.&nbsp; Daria had never played much, even as a baby.&nbsp;
Toys bought for someone her age level were quickly abandoned.&nbsp; Nothing
seemed to hold her interest until she discovered reading, and at first she and
Jake were thrilled to have such a precocious child, reading Dr. Seuss and
similar books at the age of three and a half, and chapter books halfway through
kindergarten.&nbsp; Daria started becoming more solitary right about when Quinn
was entering the terrible twos, and Helen had been relieved at first that she
could devote more attention to her youngest daughter, who seemed to need it more
than Daria ever had.<o:p>

Many children prefer more self-directed activities.&nbsp; My younger sister
always kept to herself, and she's doing just fine.&quot;<o:p>

&quot;Of course, some children will always be more inwardly focused than others.&nbsp;
All the same, there are degrees.&nbsp; Non-interaction with others can be a sign
of depression.&nbsp; The reason I called you here today is because I feel Daria
may need some counseling beyond that which the school can offer her.&nbsp; I can
only see her once every two weeks, and that's simply not enough time for me to
be able to reach her in the way she needs.&quot;<o:p>

to annoy her.&nbsp; Especially Quinn, once she came around.&nbsp; Quinn had been
another surprise, they had planned to stop with just one.&nbsp; Jake couldn't
remember why, it had something to do with their young ideas about not
contributing to overpopulation.&nbsp; He could hardly identify with that man he

trouble at school, and he had hollered and raved as if she were doing it to him
deliberately.&nbsp; It was when Helen had said she didn't know what to do; that
had hit hard.&nbsp; If Helen didn't know what to do, then how was <i>he</i>
