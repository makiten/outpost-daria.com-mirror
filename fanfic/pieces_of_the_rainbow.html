<p class=MsoPlainText>Pieces of the Rainbow<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The usual copyright blah, blah, blah.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Background:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Asperger's Syndrome is a form of autism, but it isn't the usual 'Rain
Man' form of autism (that is referred to as Kanner-type autism, and persons who
do not have significant learning disabilities associated with it, such as
Temple Grandin, are usually considered to have High Functioning Autism), but
instead persons with Asperger's usually have normal to above average
intelligence (one of the main diagnostic differences is that people with
Asperger's do not display a delay in language skill development [though there
are exceptions on both sides]), atypical sensory responses, and usually
impaired or atypical social development.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I have Asperger's Syndrome, and see many similar traits in the manner in
which Daria is presented to us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I began
to conceive this story shortly after &quot;Psycho Therapy&quot; aired, but my
pesky advisor wanted progress on my dissertation, so this idea stayed in the back
of my mind for a while.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When
&quot;Boxing Daria&quot; aired, the remark about Daria seeming more like a
miniature adult than a child (a remark that I heard many times, and one that is
quite typical for us &quot;little professors&quot; to receive) convinced me
that I had to actually write this story.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Then I got my first real teaching assignment, which added more delays,
to say nothing of that pesky little dissertation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But, finally, here it is.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Tuesday moring after the events in &quot;Psycho
Therapy&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the
Morgendorffer's house:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen Morgendorffer is sitting at the kitchen table,
sipping her coffee.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She looks up as she
hears footsteps approaching.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Good morning, sweetie.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria enters the kitchen, &quot;Hi, Mom.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Daria rummages through a cupboard, finally
extracting a box of toaster pastries.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Daria removes the last foil pack, puts the pastries in the toaster and
carefully breaks down the cardboard box and adds it to the recycling bin in the
corner.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Are you still planning to
go grocery shopping tonight?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, dear.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If there's anything you need, put it on the list.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria looks at the list, opens a drawer and frowns,
returns to the list and writes 'potato(e)s - russet' and 'toaster pastries -
apple cinnamon'.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Just as Daria puts the pencil back into its clip, the
phone rings and Daria's breakfast pops up.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Daria heads for her breakfast on the assumption that the call is for
Helen from Helen's boss, the hyperkinetic Eric Schrecter.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen, making the same assumption as to the source of the
call, gets up to get the phone, &quot;Helllloooooooo?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria has already begun to tune out the inevitable
sucking up to the boss that Helen is about to undergo when ....<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes ... this is Helen Morgendorffer.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is something wrong, Doctor?&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Helen's tone indicates that she was neither
expecting nor happy to receive this call.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>[perspective switch to split screen so that we can hear
both sides of the phone conversation]<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Doctor Bacon, recognizing the parental protection mode he
has triggered, puts forth his best soothing voice, &quot;No, Mrs.
Morgendorffer, there's nothing wrong.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But, I do wish to speak to you about conducting some further tests on
members of your family.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I'm afraid I don't understand, Doctor Bacon.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I thought your tests were complete.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The firm received the report.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Helen's tone turns conspiratorial as she adds
as she returns to her chair, &quot;And I'm very greatful for what it said about
me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Really?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I'll
never understand corporate culture.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But,
that isn't really the type of testing I'm talking about.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Again, I don't understand.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Switching now to lecture mode, Doctor Bacon continues,
&quot;Well, you see Mrs. Morgendorffer, The Retreat at Quiet Ivy performs a
wide array of services to our corporate clients, like the evaluations we
provide for your law firm.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We use the
money from those clients to fund our research, and most of our services, for
our primary clients.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most of us are
researchers in the field of cognitive development ... with a concentration on
autism research.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Autism?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Doctor, I admit that Jake and the girls may be a bit ... quirky, but
none of them are anything like that 'Rain Man' character Dustin Hoffman
played.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>[Daria sits at the table and is paying keen attention to
the conversation, such as she can hear of it]<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ah, yes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
standard media-induced oversimplification/misperception.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Tell me, Mrs. Morgendorffer, are you at all
familiar with Temple Grandin?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No, I don't ... wait, she's the cowpen lady, isn't
she?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, more or less.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Temple Grandin has a slight variation on the form of autism to which you
alluded, but without the mental retardation of the film character.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I see, and you think Jake or the girls have this
'variation'?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>[Daria is growing quite concerned at this statement]<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Your husband, perhaps.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As for your daughters, there was a general
consensus among those of us who interacted with them that each display signs of
a different type of autism, known as Asperger's Syndrome.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And how does this 'Asperger's Syndrome' differ from
regular autism?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, first off, Mrs. Morgendorffer, both the type
we were discussing earlier and Asperger's Syndrome are 'regular' autism.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But, they do have different manifestations,
some of which relate to behavior in childhood and some relating to behavior as
adults.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen's frown exceeds Daria's, &quot;And you think that
my girls have this?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, Mrs. Morgendorffer, I do.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is why we would like to have your family
come to The Retreat for more tests this weekend, to determine whether or not
your husband and daughters are, indeed, autistic.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I see.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To be
perfectly honest, Doctor, after the experience we had there last weekend, I'm
not sure we'd be very comfortable going back.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I can understand that, Mrs. Morgendorffer,
honestly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Frankly, I think most of the
people sent here by their employers feel that way.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But let me ask you this; if your daughters do
have Asperger's, do you want to delay their knowing how to cope with its
manifestations?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen's maternal guilt is starting to kick in and her
resistance is weakened by Doctor Bacon's argument, &quot;Well, I guess
not.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But, they both seem fine to me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Is that something that is going to
change?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Not in the sense you are thinking.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But, your elder daughter has been labeled as
being 'antisocial' and your younger daughter has demonstrated obsessive
behavior to the detriment of her academic pursuits. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Aren't both of those statements true?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And, would you not prefer it if those
statements weren't true?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Full maternal guilt mode, &quot;Well, yes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Are you saying those are related to
this?&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And the hope of redemption,
&quot;And that you can do something about it?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;More than that, I'm saying these things are caused
by Asperger's.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now, of course, there is
more testing to confirm the preliminary diagnosis, and then we'd want to teach
your family some recognition and adaptive strategies ....&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, I don't know. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>I'd really need to discuss this with my family
....&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I understand completely, Mrs. Morgendorffer.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I'd be willing to come to Lawndale this
afternoon or evening to discuss it with you and your family.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;That is a very kind offer, Dr. Bacon.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let me speak with my family this morning, and
I'll call you about coming here once I've spoken with everyone.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;That would be fine.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Do you still have our number, or did you burn our brochure as soon as
you got home Sunday?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Oh, Doctor Bacon, we wouldn't do anything like
that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>[switch back on perspective to the kitchen shot as Helen
hangs up the phone]<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;What was that all about, Mom?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;That was Doctor Bacon, dear.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From The Retreat at Quiet Ivy.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So I heard.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I also heard words like 'autism,' 'variations,' and 'cowpens.'<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While I'm all in favor of the lattermost for
Quinn and the Fashion Club, the others didn't sound good, especially when it
sounds like Doctor Bacon wants us to go back there.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Don't make fun of your sister, Daria,&quot; Helen
takes a deep breath before continuing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;Sweetie, how much do you know about autism?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria realizes what Helen is slowly working toward, and
the implications leave Daria unwilling to wait for Helen to finish dancing
around the issue, &quot;They think I'm autistic?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, dear.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You and Quinn both.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
'variation' was Doctor Bacon talking about the form of autism he thinks you two
have.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He also thinks your father also
has autism, but a different form.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I see.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And
so they want to have us go back there and undergo more tests?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And your answer?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I told the Doctor that I'd discuss it with the
family and get back to him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He offered
to come and explain it to all of us.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria's face takes on a look even more thoughtful than
her normal expression.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Dad
probably won't want to go back there, especially if he thinks something's wrong
with him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You'll have to package it
carefully if you don't want one of his rage storms.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But, if you package it properly, he'll be as
happy as a puppy to go.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Quinn won't want
to go, no matter how you package it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How
much is he going to charge us?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Oh, dear.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
didn't think to ask that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Mom, are you sure you're still a lawyer?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen puts a warning note in her voice, &quot;Daria
....&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Just checking.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I'll think about it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen, realizing that this is almost a 'freebie' from
Daria, and not entirely sure how to take either the conversation with Dr. Bacon
or with her daughter, simply answers, &quot;Thank you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;What was the name of the 'variation' they think
Quinn and I have?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ummm, I think Doctor Bacon said, 'Asperger
Syndrome.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>La Casa
Lane:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria rings the doorbell and wonders whether Jane will be
awake enough to discuss Doctor Bacon's request.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The door opens to reveal a seemingly wide-awake Trent.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hey, Daria.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Janey's still in the shower.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Come
on in.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Thanks.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Maybe, just maybe, Trent will be awake enough for one of his
moments.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Ummm, Trent?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yeah?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I have a ... well, it isn't a problem, more of a
quandry, something I know I should do, or at least I think I need to ....&quot;
and internally 'Stop babbling, Morgendorffer.'<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Daria, is something wrong?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ummm, I don't think so.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let me try a different approach.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if I could get a lot of answers to the
big questions about my life, but the price would be acknowledging that I am
fundamentally different from everyone else and that I'll always be
different?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Doesn't seem like a problem to me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You are different, and that is what makes you
far more cool than anyone -- Janey excepted -- your age that I've met.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria blushes, but does hear the answer to her own
question in his answer, and acknowledges it, &quot;Thanks, Trent.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe it is true about problems solving
themselves when you explain them to other people.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yeah, well, you seem to make pretty good
choices.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Janey's your best friend.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You are doing what you want to do.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That's better than most people can say.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well ....&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Trent doesn't quite understand the subject of Daria's
dilemma, but it doesn't matter for what he has to say.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;No, seriously.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A lot of people write Jane off because she
won't play by their rules.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She's got
talent for her paintings.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From what
little of it I've read, you've got talent for your writing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I respect that in each of you.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some people spend their whole lives trying to
figure out who and what they are.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you
can get that answer now, think how much it will help you develop your
talents.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria wonders whether Trent is supposed to be a
psychologist based on his ability to read people, merely blushes deeper.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Fortunately, Jane comes down the stairs at just this
moment, &quot;Talent?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Did someone evoke
my middle name?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hey, Janey.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria looks at Trent, then at Jane, knowing the moment is
gone, but reveling in the answers it provided while it lasted, acknowledges her
best friend, &quot;Morning.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So what was Trent trying to talk you into ... or
out of?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria knows that Jane is on the verge of full yenta mode,
and has more important things to do today,&quot;I asked for his hand in
marriage, but he isn't sure he's ready for the commitment.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Trent, knowing both that Daria had something of a crush
on him and Janey's hope that she could kickstart Daria into pursuing it,
desperately tries to suppress his smile as he watches Jane's face fault.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria continues, &quot;But seriously, I asked Trent his
advice about something important, and I will also want your advice so chug your
morning coffee and let's get on the highway to hell, a.k.a. Lawndale High
School.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location: Lawndale High School hallway, after first
period:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Umm, Daria ....&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, Quinn?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;We aren't going back there.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;_We_ haven't decided yet, though your reluctance
inclines me toward the affirmative.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Daria, please,&quot; Quinn wonders how much this is
going to cost and whether or not Daria has enough money to buy the whole
freakin' state of Montana, and not merely the cabin she talks about,&quot;I had
to tell Sandi that The Retreat was a spa ...&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria cuts her off, &quot;'Had to?'<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And just why, pray tell, did you have to lie
to Sandi about this?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And about me being
your sister?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Get lost.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And with that, Daria storms off to the
library to do some research.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Quinn mutters to herself, &quot;Good one,
Morgendorffer.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
Settlement, a restaurant near Helen's office:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Gee, Helen, we haven't had lunch together in a long
time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is a great idea!&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Thanks, honey.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I just wish work would let us do this more often ... and that I didn't
have something of an ulterior motive for talking to you one-on-one today.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jake thinks to himself, 'Stay calm, Jake.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You don't know that she's having an affair with
Eric.' &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, I got a phone call this morning from Dr.
Bacon.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Jake's fears about Helen having an affair are
forgotten, &quot;Dr. Bacon?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From The
Retreat?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What did he want?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lousy psychiatrist ....&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Jake, please.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This is important.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He thinks the
girls have a form of autism ....&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jake cuts her off, &quot;Autism?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What the hell does he know about
autism?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Aside from thirty years as a psychiatrist
specializing in autism research, two published books, twenty-one peer-reviewed
articles published in medical and psychological journals, the Distinguished
Service Award from the National Autism Society in England?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Just about everything there is to know about
it, based on the research Maryanne and I have been doing this morning.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now as I was saying, he thinks that the girls
have a form of autism called Asperger Syndrome.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Dammit, Helen!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There is nothing wrong with our girls!&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I agree, as does Dr. Bacon.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Just read this, it is something on his
website of resources for parents of autistic children.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Helen hands Jake a piece of paper.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>[perspective shift so that we can read over Jake's
shoulder]<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Dear Parent,<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Let me begin by reassuring you that there is nothing
wrong with your child just because that child is autistic.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Indeed, if you encounter a doctor or school
administrator who tries to tell you otherwise, they are in error.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You, no doubt, are familiar with the
statements about persons with disabilities to the effect that those persons are
not disabled, but instead are differently-abled.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is much more the truth for persons with
autism than for persons with most of the other non-typicalities.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Autistic people are capable of more than
merely living 'productive' lives, many times they are cabable of being the true
masters of their fields.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>This is not to say that there will not be great
challenges in raising a child with autism.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As suggested above, many schools will not wish to acknowledge or provide
support services for your child's special needs.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In many parts of the world (see _here_ for
requirements by state in the US, _here_ for the laws by country in the rest of
the world), there are strict requirments that public schools must meet in
assisting your child.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Demand your
child's rights to a full education.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Children with autism may seem withdrawn, antisocial,
etc.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To some degree, they _are_ apart
from the world around them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is
sometimes a result of the children trying to cope with an excess of
environmental stimulus.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What, to us, may
seem a cheery, bright room may seem, to the autistic child, a painful excess of
light ... and I mean 'painful' in the literal sense.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These children can be so sensitive to certain
stimuli that they feel physical pain from exesses of those stimuli.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These children may also focus on one or a
limited number of subjects to an extent that those who do not know better might
consider obsessive.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Alternately, some
children with autism are so able to sense the emotions of people around them
that they more resemble telepaths or empaths with their abilities to understand
or mimic individuals, and retreat to avoid sensing the pain of others.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>But, many of these children can adapt to the world around
them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They can learn to do incredible
things with their abilities to focus on a subject, to delve the depths of one
area or discipline, or to understand the people around them.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many become great scientists, mathematicians,
doctors, lawyers, politicians, and masters of other fields that require large
amounts of specialized data.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Your child IS different.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>With your help, patience, and encouragement, your child can use that
difference to his or advantage and happiness.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Dr. Richard C. Bacon&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>[perspective shift back]<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Wow.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That
stuff does sound like Daria.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I know, Jakey.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>And other parts sound like Quinn.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jake looks thoughtful, which Helen has learned usually
means that Jake is about to have one of his big insights.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jake slowly takes a long sip of his water,
then begins, &quot;And we have to go back for some tests to confirm it?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Quinn won't want anything to do with
this.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Daria might be interested, if it
is presented to her in the right way, or she'll lock herself into that shell of
hers and we'll be lucky if she talks to us for a week.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I'm guessing you already talked to Daria;
you'd handle it better than I would anyway.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We'll probably just have to put Quinn in the car and lock the doors
until we get there ....<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So which one of
us is the genetic source of this?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I spoke to both of them.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Daria is probably researching it to make up
her mind about it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Quinn didn't want
anything to do with it, but I didn't have time to argue this morning ....<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They're pretty sure you are also
autistic.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Me?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Dr. Bacon said there are multiple types of
autism.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He thinks the girls have a form
known as Asperger Syndrome and that you have a form known as Kanner-type.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So they'll want to test me, too?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, Jake.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I don't know, Helen.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I hated that place.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Dr. Bacon assured me that this is completely
different from what they do to their corporate clients.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I hope so.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>How much is this going to cost us?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen covers Jake's hand with her own and smiles,
&quot;Jakey, sometimes it amazes me how much Daria takes after you.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And I mean that in the good way.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lawndale
High School:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, I think you should do it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;It'll definitely annoy Quinn.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yeah.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;However much that is a generally good thing, this
should be about me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jane Lane shakes her head, &quot;No, Daria.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is about your whole family.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Despite how much you'd enjoy torturing Quinn,
she needs to undergo these tests, too.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>And she won't do it or will do it in a really bad way if she's
angry.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You already saw that this
morning.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Curse you Lanes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Trent appealed to my quest for knowledge and you appeal to my
not-quite-killed-off sense of protectiveness toward the little manne-Quinn ...
which, by the way, I re-learned from watching how Trent takes care of
you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;What I can say, hitting below the belt is the only
way to win some fights.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I'll remember that the next time we tangle.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the
Morgendorffer's hose, living room:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I think it is a good idea; we should go.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen blinks in surprise, &quot;Really?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Daria, seeing that Helen doesn't fully understand, explains.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Mom, I'm different from just about
every other child I've ever encountered.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I always have been.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You know
that, and no matter how much you've tried to hide it, you don't like it and
there are significant parts of me that you don't understand.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>People have put all sorts of labels on me,
from 'shy' to 'stupid' to 'stuck-up' and 'ugly' to 'uncoordinated' to
'unpopular.'<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now, Doctor Bacon is
offering me a definition of _why_ I'm different, and maybe giving me an
explanation to go with the label, instead of the misunderstanding or disdain
that usually goes with the labels other people put on me, as well as techniques
to help me recognize and use the differences.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Of course I want to do this.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen looks at her daughter in amazement, and starts to
choke up as she sees the far too rare hope and enthusiasm on Daria's face.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Oh, sweetie.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Of course we'll go!&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Muh-omm.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We
can't go there again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had to tell
Sandi that it was a spa, and she'll want to go if we go there again.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then Sandi will know what Quiet Ivy really
does and I'll be so ....&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen continues to face Daria, &quot;Quinn, we're going
and that's final.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;But, Muh-omm!&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen continues to watch Daria's face as the mask sinks
into a frown of resignation, a frown Helen recognises all too well as one she
wore after _her_ sister Rita whined, wheedled and won over their mother so many
times.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Realizing how she has slipped
into the same behavior pattern as that which she so hated about _her_ mother,
Helen Barksdale Morgendorffer vows in that moment that she would do better (and
admits that this is about the twentieth time she's made that vow).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She turns angrily to face her younger
daughter, &quot;Quinn.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What part of
'final' did you not understand?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We are
going.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And if I hear one more word out
of you on the subject you will be grounded.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Quinn, realizing only that Helen is taking Daria's side,
tries again, &quot;Muh-ommmmmmm!&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;One month, Quinn.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Care to try for two months' grounding?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Quinn is, for once, speechless.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No negotiation, no bribery, and, after seeing
the stern look on Jake's face, no ability to play parent off parent.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hold it, Mom.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You can't force Quinn to go.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen, Jake, and Quinn all look at Daria in shock and
simultaneously say, &quot;What?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I mean it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This has to be Quinn's choice.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If
she goes there only because we drag her kicking and screaming, do you think
she'll answer the questions honestly?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Helen, honey, I think we should listen to
Daria.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Thank you, Dad.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As I was saying, if Quinn wants to live in denial, that is her
choice.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If Quinn wants to be ignorant,
that is her choice.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If Quinn doesn't
want to learn how to use this to her advantage in school, that is her
choice.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If Quinn doesn't want to pick up
some of the tricks I figured out on my own, that is her choice.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen tries to maintain a straight face, and thinks to
herself, 'Of course if Daria looks up one thing related to psychology, she'll
look up half a hundred related things.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>And with the shock of Daria appearing to take Quinn's side, Quinn might
just fall for it.'<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;All right.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Quinn, you're not grounded, and you don't
have to go if you don't want to.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the
rest of us are going.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jake, not realizing the game being played by Daria and
Helen, nevertheless helps it, &quot;Come on, Quinn.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They promised that this will be nothing like
what we went through last time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even I'm
looking forward to going.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Whaddaya
say?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria, not quite sure as to whether Jake is aware of the
attempt at reverse psychology, &quot;Well, sure, Dad.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you can pick some of the empathy tricks,
you'll have your clients wrapped around your fingers.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But Quinn wouldn't want to be able to
manipulate or control anyone.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Fine, I'll go.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I don't know what I'm going to tell Sandi.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria gives Quinn a Mona Lisa smile, &quot;Maybe by
Monday, you will.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Friday<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
sidewalk outside Lawndale High School:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria and Quinn are walking home together, having been
excused from their afternoon classes to go to The Retreat.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ummm, Daria?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, Quinn?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ummm, I guess I kind of should thank you for
getting me ungrounded.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, you should.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Why did you do that?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You were mad at me earlier that day, but when
it happened, you defended me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Three reasons.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>One - us against the parents, or have you forgotten 'Family Court'?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Two - Jane had reminded me about my
responsibility for looking out for you as my little sister, even if you
desperately try to avoid acknowledging that relationship.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Three - there is anecdotal evidence that
suggests that telling obvious and ridiculous lies as a defense mechanism may be
a manifestation of the form of autism the folk from The Retreat think we have
and I was being sincere in trying to get you to come with us and get
tested.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Does it really annoy you that I don't acknowledge
you as my sister to anyone?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What
angers me is that you do it for a stupid reason.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Oh.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the
Morgendorffer's house, living room:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Helen, leave your cell phone here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;But, Jake, I'm not getting tested.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Daria's not the only one who can do a little
research.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are going to be all
sorts of questions about the girls and me that you are going to have to
answer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Heck, you may wind up being the
busiest one of all of us, because you are the one who can describe us to the
doctors.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Surely, there won't be that much ...&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;When I talked to Dr. Hinkel, she said you would
have to be in interviews from about an hour after the girls and I start until
the final group session on Sunday.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;You talked to Dr. Hinkel?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;My 4:00 meeting got cancelled on Tuesday, so I
called them to get more information.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Why didn't you tell me about that?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;When have we had ten minutes alone without Eric
calling you that we could talk about it before now?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, there was ... okay, I see your
point.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Helen starts to pick up her
phone, &quot;I will have to call Eric to tell him not to expect to reach
me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No, don't.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Helen, you do more work than any three other lawyers at that firm.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Except for Eric, all the partners are over
sixty, and Eric got his partnership because he's the son of a partner.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They're working you to death, when they
should be working themselves to death so that you can get the partnership
you're already overdue to receive.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe
Eric should try to do his own work for one day.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Oh, Jakey.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Thank you.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That may be the nicest
thing you've ever said about my work.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, one of the things I read about people with
autism is that we often forget to tell the people we care about that we care
about them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You deserve better than
you're getting from that firm ... lousy lawyers!&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Jake, I resemble that remark.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;What?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Oh,
sorry.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not you, of course.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The partners!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Lousy partners!&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen sighs, &quot;Honestly, Jake.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Just then, the door opens and Daria and Quinn enter.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Jake, still in extreme mode, &quot;Hi, girls, all ready
to go?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria, even more deadpan than her normal, &quot;Saddle
up, lock and load.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>As Jake's Lexus pulls into the driveway, &quot;Abandon
hope all ye who enter here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Daria, stop that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>After parking and getting their bags, the Morgendorffers
went to the lobby.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Dr. Jean-Michel Millipieds was waiting for them.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Good afternoon, everyone.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I want to thank you for coming back.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So, how is this going to work?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, Mrs. Morgendorffer, we have a fairly full
schedule.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But, let's show you to your
rooms and give you a little time to relax before we begin.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you'll follow me, please.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Doctor, I read a web translation of your article in
the French medical journal from last year, and I want to make sure I had an
accurate translation of one part ...&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Of course ... Daria, isn't it?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You had
talked about the &quot;Theory of Personality, and ...&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Dr. Millipieds cuts her off, &quot;No, bad
translation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Theory of Mind.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hmmmm.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You
didn't seem very impressed by it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
wonder if you could tell me why, the translation was less than sensical.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Are you familiar with the French idiom,
'merde'?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Oui.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Bon.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is
the quick summary of my opinion of the Theory of Mind.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As for the why, you need to understand the
Theory in order to see why it is wrong.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Okay, so what is the Theory of Mind.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Theory of mind refers to the notion that many
autistic individuals do not understand that other people have their own plans,
thoughts, and points of view. Furthermore, it appears that they have difficulty
understanding other people's beliefs, attitudes, and emotions.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>[nb, this is a quote from Dr. Stephen M.
Edelson, Center for the Study of Autism, Salem OR, USA]<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;You're joking, right?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No, I'm not.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That is the Theory.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Merde.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
why is obvious.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Agreed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Here
we are.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mr. and Mrs. Morgendorffer, you
will be in Room 212.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ms. and Ms.
Morgendorffer, Room 214.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Thanks.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Room 214<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hey, Daria?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria pauses her unpacking and looks at her younger
sister, &quot;Yes?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;That mind theory stuff, that's the empathy tricks,
right?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, it is a lot more complicated than that, but
it is part of it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Okay, explain it to me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;What?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ummm, please explain it to me?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria's right eyebrow raises fractionally,
&quot;Alright.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Theory of Mind says
that people with autism assume that everyone around them has the same reasons
for doing things, and the same knowledge as everyone around them.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well that's stupid.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You don't care about any of the things I do.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;True, but the idea is that people with autism can
learn how some individuals have different motivations if they spend time around
those individuals, but will assume that people in general have the same goals
they do.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Oh.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
suppose I do that sometimes.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Newsflash -- everyone does that sometimes, whether
they are autistic or not.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So what's the big deal?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Some researchers believe that autistic people do it
to everyone unless they learn an individual's differences.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;That's still nonsense.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are people who are like you, and there
are people like me, and there are people like Sandi, and ...&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Exactly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Just like everyone else, we learn to associate sets of motivations with
other people we know who display those motivations through their actions.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Then this mind theory is wrong.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;well, there is still more to it, and this is where
the empathy part comes in.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Theory of
Mind also says that autistics can not think in accordance with those other
motivations, and can not work through what other people would decide to do
based on those other motivations or other sets of knowledge.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I don't get it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Let's try this a different way ... if you thought
Sandi looked really bad in an outfit, would she know it looked bad on
her?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Probably not, she's got a lousy color sense.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Does she know she has a bad color sense?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No ... and I have no intention of telling her
that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So when you see Sandi in a bad outfit, you don't
think she knows it is a bad outfit?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So she might think it is a good look for her and
buy it?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Maybe.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What
does this have to do with the mind theory?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Pretty much proves it to be wrong.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can think through what someone else will
do based on their knowledge and lack thereof rather than on your own
knowledge.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So does this mean that we aren't autistic?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No, it just means that researchers don't know
everything about autism yet.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Helen?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, Jake?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Are we doing the right thing with this?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I think we are.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I'm scared about what they're going to find about
me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen takes her husband's hand in hers, &quot;Jake, you
are a good husband and a good father.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That isn't going to change with a diagnosis of autism.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you are autistic, you always have been,
when I fell in love with you, when we decided to have children and as we've
been raising them.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
dining area<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I imagine you have many questions, and I understand
from Dr. Millipieds that you've already started, Daria.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, Dr. Bacon, I was trying to understand the
Theory of Mind.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I assure you, we're trying to understand it, as
well.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I have a question.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes, Quinn.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, from what Daria's been telling me, it does
sound like she has autism, but I'm not sure I have it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why do you think I have it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;First, we prefer to say that someone is autistic;
it is a state of being, not a disease to be treated and done with.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But, on to your question, We noticed that
your behavior was very focused on a limited number of subjects, that your
social interactions were awkward ...&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Awkward?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
don't think so.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I date more than almost
anyone I know ...&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Of course, in your limited area of concentration
you are able to appear somewhat normal, but all your other interactions are
stilted, limited, and apparently unfulfilling.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, I, uhh ....&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>After a moment, &quot;She's been getting a bit better at
it, though.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Quinn looks at her sister in astonishment, &quot;Ummm,
thanks.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I have another question.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I've been looking for literary references to
Asperger's or characters with Asperger's, but haven't found much other than
Prince Mark's son in Saberhagen's Sword books, and the endless debate about Spock
and Data from Star Trek.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Saberhagen?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I'm not familiar with that one, but we do have a list of literary, film
and television Aspergerians.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I'll give
you a copy during a session you have with me tomorrow.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And I'll want titles on the Saberhagen, Daria.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;of course.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I have a question.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The other Morgendorffer's visibly tense as all eyes turn
to Jake.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Dr. Bacon breaks the silence, &quot;Yes, Mr.
Morgendorffer.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, I probably didn't do as much research as
Daria, but it seems that ther's a lot more diagnosis of autism than there was
just a few years ago.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why is that?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The other Morgendorffer's relax as the anticipated Jakism
fails to materialize.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, that is a great question, and we don't have a
definite answer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I believe it is a
combination of factors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>First, more
doctors are familiar with autistic spectrum disorders and are comfortable
diagnosing such.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is especially true
since Asperger's re-emerged in the 1980s after collecting dust for almost forty
years.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then, I think there is an actual
increase in the number of people being born with autistic spectrum
disorders.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I think the technology
revolution has had a large role in that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>People with Asperger's are now more likely to be able to find careers
where they can take advantage of their special foci, especially in the computer
and engineering fields, and these jobs are less exotic, more mainstream,
meaning that these people are more likely to find spouses and have children who
will have the same or similar forms of autism, repeat.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I see.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Interesting.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Saturday<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Dr.
Bacon's office<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, Quinn, how are you this morning.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Fine ... a little scared.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;There's no need to be scared.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This should be a lot less intense than last
week ... but you didn't take last weekend very seriously, did you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, no.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
didn't really see a point to it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And do you see a point to this weekend?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I guess so.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And what do you see as the point of this
weekend?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, you're trying to decide whether Daria, Dad
and I have this autism stuff.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;This autism stuff, an interesting way of putting
it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You don't really see much difference
between whether you are autistic or not, do you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Not really, although Daria said there were some
ways to use it to my advantage.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Did she, now.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What sorts of ways did she tell you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, she said there were study tricks and ways of
influencing people.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I see.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And
you'd like these things.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yeah, I've never really been all that interested in
the stuff they teach in high school so my grades aren't all that great.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If I can learn how to use this to do better
in school, that'd be nice.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hmmmm.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And
influencing people?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, I'm really popular at school, but there are a
couple people who are more ... almost as popular as me, but I would like to be
a bit more sure of being the most popular person at school.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And popularity is important to you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, yeah.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Why?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, I'm not a jock, and I'm not a brain, so that
pretty much leaves being in the popular clique if I want to have any friends.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And do you have friends from being popular?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, sure, there's Stacy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And there's Joey and Jeffy and, uh,
Jamie.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All of them adore me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And Sandi and Tiffany are in the Fashion Club
with me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;They adore you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;well, Sandi's ... like, really competitive and
sometimes its hard to be around her, but she is my friend.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Tiffany is a bit manipulative, but she's
never malicious.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;What about Daria, is she your friend?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Daria, no way.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;why not?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;She's a brain, and she's my sister.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And someone in the Fashion Club can't hang out with
a brain?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No way.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;But, if you were the most popular person in school,
wouldn't you be able to hang out with whomever you wanted?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Obviously, you don't understand high school
popularity dynamics.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I admit, it has been a while.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let's change the subject, sort of.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Tell me about your sister's friends.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, her best friend is Jane, she's a
painter.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And Jane's weird older brother
... he's a musician, and he's kind of cute, but he doesn't seem to like me much.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ummm, Kevin and Brittany, and Mack and
Jodie.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That Ted guy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Probably others, but I don't spend much time
paying attention to her or her friends.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So who are Kevin and the others you didn't
describe?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, Kevin is the quarterback of the football
team, and Brittany is the head cheerleader; they're dating.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mack is captain of the football team, and
Jodie does everything; they're dating, too.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Ted is kind of strange, he was homeschooled for a while and works on the
yearbook.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He's sort of popular, but I
don't know why.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So, Daria's friends with a lot of the jocks, and
the other brains, and the fringes of the popular crowd?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Definitely not all the jocks.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most of them wouldn't know her from anyone
else.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;But the important jocks are her friends but not
your friends?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I know I'm a little rusty
on high school politics, but I thought the jocks and the attractive were
supposed to be in the same crowds.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ummmmm, well, I, uh, um ....&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Dr.
Bacon's office<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, Daria, here's the list I promised.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Thanks.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I had an interesting conversation with Quinn.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;That's a first.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Someone having an interesting conversation with
Quinn is a rare event.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I doubt that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;You're entitled to your opinion.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;You don't like your sister?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, she does some things that really annoy me,
but I think the main problem is that I don't really know how to talk to
her.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Let's take both parts of that separately.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What does she do that annoys you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Doctor-patient confidentiality applies, this won't
get back to Mom and Dad?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Of course.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria pauses, gathering her thoughts.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then finally, &quot;The thing that annoys me
the most is that she doesn't live up to her potential.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She is almost as smart as I am, but refuses
to apply herself and wastes her energy on fashion and dating.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;But, if she's autistic, as we suspect, she may need
to _direct_ her energy toward those activities.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, um ... yeah, I guess you're right.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Anything else.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I guess all the money she spends on clothes instead
of letting Mom and Dad save for college, or their retirement, is kind of the
same thing, isn't it?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Mm-hmm.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And I already read that the obvious lies she tells
are probably a manifestation of Asperger's.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;What sorts of lies?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;She tells people at school that I'm her cousin, a
foreign exchange student, the maid, etc.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;You're kidding.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No, I'm not.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And people believe her?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I don't know.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And you've confronted her about this?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yes.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And did it stop?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Oh.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Let's move on to the other part.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;All right.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So what do you think is the problem communicating with her?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I speak English, she speaks popular.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Daria, you aren't really answering the
question.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No, I suppose not.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Care to try again?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;All right.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The lies bother me enough that I go into every conversation like we're
going to fight it out.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And do you ever have it out?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No, we just deal with the immediate issue and let
everything else slide.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Why?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;For me, I don't want to go ballistic like my
father.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Dr. Hinkel's office<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, Mrs. Morgendorffer, that was very
informative.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I'm trying to help as much as I can.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;You're doing great.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Let's turn now to Daria.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;All right.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;How is she doing, socially?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen sighs, &quot;I worry about that.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Too often she just hides in her room.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But, at least I don't worry about her friends
the way I did when we were living in Highland.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;What kind of friends did she have in Highland that
worried you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, there were these two boys.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Locals there would say, 'them boys just ain't
right' and I agree.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I think one of them
had a problem with fires, and they would hit each other and both were quite
profane.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Daria said she liked to mess
with their minds, but that doesn't sound like a healthy relationship.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;But for someone learning social interaction, having
two exaggerated lab rats might have been quite helpful for her learning how
others react to her.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Really?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;It is possible.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It might also be that she did enjoy messing with their minds.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Has she shown that kind of attitude toward
anyone here?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Just her sister.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hmmmmm.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And
how do the two of them interact?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Not very well, and I think a lot of it is my
fault.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Why do you say that?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, when I was getting back to work after Quinn,
I really didn't manage my time very well and raising the girls suffered.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You know the saying that time is money?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Well, I tried to substitute money for time,
buying cooperation from the girls rather than take the time to talk things
through.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And how does that play out in how your daughters
interact with each other?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Instead of having one or two good blowouts to clear
the air, they buy their way past each other, and a lot of little things build
up and linger unresolved.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;What sorts of things?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, Quinn really plays Jake for money, and it
rankles Daria because she thinks it means there might be less money for college
for Daria.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And is that the case?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Daria's
college money is never touched.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When
Quinn wheedles beyond her monthly budget, it comes out of Quinn's college
fund.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;You aren't really taking money out of her college
fund?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No, but we are taking from the account that we
created for Quinn's spending money for when she's in college.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ahh, I see.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Good financial planning.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I hope so.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And do your daughters know about these separate
accounts?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;No.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We plan
to surprise each of them.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And, so your daughters don't fight?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Not really.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Daria struggles with her emotions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I think Daria is afraid that if she ever lets loose, she'll be like
Jake's little rage storms.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;That is a not-unreasonable fear, if it is the
case.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>People with Asperger's get rage
storms just like people with Kanner-type autism.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Dr.
Millipied's office<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, Mr. Morgendorffer.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Do you think you are autistic?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I think I might be.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I seem to have a lot of the right behaviors.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Such as?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, probably the big two factors are difficulty
reading emotions and emotional outbursts.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Have you always had these problems?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, as much as I can remember, yes.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;How did your parents handle the outbursts?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;They didn't.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>My father shipped me off to military school to 'teach me some
discipline.'&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Based on last week's experience, I would have
thought that statement would have been the trigger for an outburst.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, that's really the thing, if I'm thinking
about it, I can control it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Mr. Morgendorffer, that is a very important
statement.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Dr.
Millipieds office<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I disagree.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I think we should tell the parents.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Richard, it isn't just a confidentiality issue, it
is a trust issue.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Betray the trust Daria
showed you and she might well reject this entire weekend.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hinkel, you've been silent so far.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What do you think?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;You said she didn't tell you until she had verified
confidentiality rules?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then it is
privileged communication.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I am sure Mrs.
Morgendorffer would agree.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Alright.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
won't say anything.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But, I want you to
try to talk Daria into expressing her feelings to Quinn.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Based on my conversation with Mrs. Morgendorffer, I
was already planning to do that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Good.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Dr.
Bacon's office<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, Mr. Morgendorffer, how did the morning
session go?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, Dr. Millipieds and I spent a lot of time
talking about how others react to my emotions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I guess I really never thought about how I could impact other people
when I lose control.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Kind of silly not
to have seen it given how over-the-top I can get.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;One of my favorite lines from a book comes from a
science fiction story, 'A blind spot is, by definition, something you can not
see.'&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Yeah.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
its really got me thinking about how much I've hurt my relationships with the
girls.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Can they really talk to me if
they are afraid I'm going to lose it?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Good question.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What do you think is the answer to that question?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Dr.
Hinkel's office<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So, Quinn, how do you get along with your
sister?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I dunno.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Okay, I guess.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;You guess?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, we don't really fight, but it isn't like we
spend a whole lot of time together.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Why don't you spend time together?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I guess we move in different circles.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Wait, there's more to it than that.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I know she hates when I pretend she isn't my
sister.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Why do you do that?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I don't know anymore.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Anymore?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And
what used to be the reason?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, I guess I liked being the center of
attention.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I didn't want Daria taking
the spotlight from me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then I guess I
thought people wouldn't like me if I had a brain for a sister.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And you don't feel that way anymore?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, Dr. Bacon pointed out that Daria seems to
have more friends than I do, and I know I don't have any friends as close to me
as Jane Lane is to Daria.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And if you could pick any one person, who would you
want to have be that close a friend to you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Quinn looks down into her lap and doesn't say
anything.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Finally, &quot;I don't
know.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Dr. Hinkel's office<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So, Quinn is the stereotypical little sister.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She's cute and gets all the attention while
you work hard and get ... what?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Actually, for the most part I don't work all that
hard.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Truth to tell, Quinn probably puts
more effort into getting attention than I do into both working and avoiding
attention.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Interesting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Why do you try to avoid attention?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, people don't seem to notice me for the things
for which I'd want to be noticed.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And in what ways would you want to be
noticed?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ummm, I guess I hadn't thought of it so much as
what I'd want as in terms of what I want to avoid.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Okay, what do you want to avoid?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Being judged for my looks and the degree to which I
conform to the expectations of others.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Hmmmm.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And
what expectations do others have of you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;That I'll be a good student and otherwise not do
much.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Doesn't sound like a bad set of expectations.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I guess not.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;But ... ?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;There should be more.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I just don't know how to articulate what I do
want.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I see,&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Dr. Hinkel leans forward in her chair to emphasize the next question,
&quot;Is it that you don't know what you want or afraid to ask for it in case
they say 'no'?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Ummm...&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;What would you want from, say, Quinn?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Dr.
Millipied's office<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Daria is very self-reliant isn't she?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;In some ways.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In others, she's so afraid of failure that she'll never try to
succeed.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And what, if anything, do you do to try to get her
to ... expand her horizons?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Oh, Dr., I've tried so many different things.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I've basically ordered her to participate in
activities, I've bribed her, I've threatened her with things I know she doesn't
like ...&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And have you ever tried encouraging her?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;What do you think I've just been talking
about?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;You've been talking about negative
inducements.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What positive inducements
have you offered her?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;I'd think money would be pretty positive.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;In some ways, I'll never understand you
Americans.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you have to pay her to do
something, don't you think that means she doesn't want to do it and can't see
any reason to do it, and that you're just paying her for her time?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

willing to make the first move.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the
dining area, lunch<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;We thought we would present the official diagnoses
to all of you at once.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Thank you, Dr. Hinkel.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Please.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Well, Mrs. Morgendorffer, you don't get a diagnosis
this weekend, since you were the focus of last weekend.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;So why did I have to work harder this weekend than
last?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Probably because this matters more.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Everyone is silent as the truth of that statement rolls
across the room.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Dr. Bacon takes over, &quot;Mr. Morgendorffer, we have
concluded that you have High-Functioning Kanner-type autism.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This afternoon, you'll be working with Dr.
Millipieds on emotional management and impulse control techniques.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Okay.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Quinn, you have the Asperger's Syndrome form of
autism.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You'll be working with Dr.
Hinkel on impulse control and study habits.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;Alright, the study tricks.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The doctors and Helen all smile a bit at Quinn's remark.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Daria is too busy waiting for her results to
indulge in even a Mona Lisa smile.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&quot;And, finally, Daria.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Your diagnosis took the most time for
us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was some thought that you
might be Kanner-type like your father, but ultimately we did decide that you do
indeed have Asperger's Syndrome.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I'll be
talking to you about safe communication of emotion.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Daria nods, letting the impact of the diagnosis set in.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Location:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the
dining area, mid-afternoon<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Mr. Morgendorffer, Quinn, Daria, we have small gifts we'd
like to give to each of you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Quinn perks up, &quot;Presents, wow.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For once I really wasn't expecting
something.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Helen looks to Daria for a reaction, but sees none, and
thinks to herself, &quot;Whatever they talked to Daria about has really turned
down her enthusiasm about this.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I think
