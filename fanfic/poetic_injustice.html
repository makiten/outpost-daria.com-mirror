<P>"You brought the poems?" she said, sitting in her large, Italian leather chair facing the window. <BR>
<BR>
"Yes, Ms. Shoobocks." Stacy gulped and stepped all the way into the room. "But.... I.... uh...." <BR>
<BR>
"What is it, Miss Rowe? I haven't got all day!" Ms. Shoobocks spun her chair around to face Stacy, who was shivering a bit in front of the office desk. <BR>
<BR>
"I---heard something today. From a friend." <BR>
<BR>
Ms. Shoobocks raised an eyebrow. "Oh? What?" <BR>
<BR>
"My friend, Quinn..... she said that they pay some people for their poems." <BR>
<BR>
"And you believed her?!" <BR>
<BR>
"I---" <BR>
<BR>
"Are you saying that I'm a liar?!" <BR>
<BR>
"No! No! No, Ms. Shoobocks, of course not!" <BR>
<BR>
"Good.... good. What a ridiculous idea. Paying people for their poems. She must think you're an idiot if she expects you to believe that." <BR>
<BR>
Stacy looked at the ground. "I guess maybe she does." <BR>
<BR>
"I don't think you're an idiot, Stacy. Now, you <I>did </I>bring the poems, right?" she asked with a hopeful look in her eye. <BR>
<BR>
Stacy reached down into her backpack and pulled out a folder full of notebook paper. "Twenty Christmas poems, just like you asked." <BR>
<BR>
"Excellent." Ms. Shoobocks smirked as she took the papers from her. "That will be all." <BR>
<BR>
Stacy sighed and headed for the office door. "And Stacy?" said Mr. Shoobocks. "You shouldn't let other people take advantage of your na&iuml;vet&eacute; like that." <BR>
<BR>
"Of course not, Ms. Shoobocks." <BR>
<BR>
"Good. Forty ‘Happy Anniversary’ poems for next time, then." <BR>
<BR>
"Yes Ms. Shoobocks. Anything for Hallmark, Ms. Shoobocks." </P>
