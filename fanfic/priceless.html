<p class=MsoNormal><p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shortly after 11:30 AM, Helen Morgendorffer was at her desk
typing up the day's umpteenth brief and downing her third cup of coffee.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was shaping up to be a typical day. And
then her assistant blew in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Marianne! <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>What's
going on?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's not like you not to
knock."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"I hate to just barge in like this, Helen, but Line 2's for
you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's Richmond General
Hospital and they say it's an emergency."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><I>Oh no.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Mother.</I><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"I'll
take it in here," a visibly shaken Helen said.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She picked up the receiver before the first ring
ended.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Helen Morgendorffer.... yes...
oh dear God.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'll be there as soon
as I can.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If I get started now, it
should take me about four hours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Have you called my sisters?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I see...."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After hanging up the phone, she raced into her office
closet, where she kept a spare power suit and an overnight bag with extra
toiletries for those evenings where it was easier to sleep at her desk than go
home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She seized the bag and <span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>in a move that sent her colleagues
looking for the remaining three Horsemen of the Apocalypse, she left work to be
at Tess' side. Not only was the firm's biggest workaholic taking a day off, she
was going to spend it with her mother.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><p><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As she drove to Richmond, she tried to remember a time when
she and her mother had not been at loggerheads.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She couldn't do it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><I>Well, if mother hadn't favored Rita over Amy and me and spoiled
her beyond all reason, or thrown a fit when I went to law school, or threatened
to cut me out of the will when I married Jake, or taken every chance she could
to criticize everything I do... oh, who am I kidding.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm just as bad as she is.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I criticize everything she does, I stopped speaking to her
for several years... ugh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There's more
than enough ugliness to go around.</I> <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It wasn't that Helen enjoyed battling with her mother.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She hated it, but she'd been doing it
so long that it was hard to imagine life any other way.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When other women described their
mothers as their best friends she was at once flabbergasted and envious.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Part of her could not imagine feeling
that way about Tess.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Another part
of her could but tried very, very hard not to.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen had always hoped that things would get better, that
someday the rift would close.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Someday, when she made partner and the kids moved out and there weren't
a million and one people asking her to do a million and one things by next
Thursday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Someday, she'd be able
to reach out to her mother and get a fresh start. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today, someone had thrown a rock at Helen's head, and taped
to it was the message &quot;Someday never comes.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tess' condition was grave.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The doctors weren't sure if she'd survive the night.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They'd advised Helen to find any family
members who might want to pay their last respects.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Her younger sister Amy was flying in from Providence,
her niece Erin would arrive from Boston that evening, and she'd told Jake to
bring their daughters right away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The only one MIA was Rita.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><i>For fifty years, she's been sponging off of Mother, and now
that ungrateful wretch can't even come to her deathbed,</i> Helen thought
ruefully.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then she shook her head
as if to shake out the thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Seething over Rita wasn't going to help anyone.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With her mother unresponsive and Amy
not due to arrive for thirty minutes, Helen pulled out her briefcase and set to
work.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Back at the Morgendorffer house, Jake burst into the kitchen
in a panic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Daria...
Quinn... Virginia... now!&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
leaned against the wall, hyperventilating.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria was nonplussed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Her father had a history of nonsensical outbursts.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Does he want to take us to
Virginia see Elvis in a grilled cheese sandwich?</i> she wondered.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Slow down, Dad,&quot; she said calmly.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Don't forget about that heart
attack.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Your mother just called.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Grandma Barksdale,&quot; he panted, &quot;she had a
stroke.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Looks bad.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We need to go.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Ok, I'll call Quinn's cell,&quot; she said with no
change in tone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Great,
now the Battling Barksdale Sisters are going to duke it out over the
will.</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She made a mental
note to find some over-the-counter antacids for Helen; dealing with her sisters
tended to give her ulcers.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Twenty minutes later, Quinn arrived to find Daria and Jake
chucking overnight bags into the trunk of the Lexus.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Where's Mom?&quot; Quinn whined.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;This is <i>her</i>
mother.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You'd think she could,
like, come along.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Your mother's already there,&quot; Jake said, much
steadier than before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;She
left work around 11:30 this morning to go to the hospital.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Mom left work early?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Man, this must be serious.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Quinn dashed upstairs to get a bag, and when she returned
the family was on their way.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When they finally arrived in Tess' room, they had expected
to find the three sisters screaming at each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, they found Helen and Amy talking in hushed tones
and Tess' bed unoccupied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><i>Something's up,</i> Daria thought.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Barksdale girls were never
quiet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Girls!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Jake!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's good to see
you.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Helen said.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jake embraced Helen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;How are you holding up, dear?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She sighed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;The situation doesn't look good.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It's difficult to say how badly Mom's brain has been damaged.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She might die, she might have only
minor handicaps, or she might be a vegetable.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>They're operating on her brain right now to stop the
bleeding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Amy and I thought it'd
be best to get everyone together, just in case...&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;What about Aunt Rita?&quot; Daria said.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amy and Helen exchanged glances.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>After an uncomfortable pause, Amy spoke.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;We're not sure where Rita
is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The nurses say she brought Mom
in, but they haven't seen her since.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We asked Erin to get in touch with her - Rita's more likely to talk to
her than us - but so far nothing.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria was incredulous. &quot;You mean she just
disappeared?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen's fists tightened.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><i>God, the things I could do with that little
brat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What I wouldn't give for
five minutes alone with her and an ironclad alibi.</i><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Girls, you probably know that
Rita's had a drinking problem in the past.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amy rolled her eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Helen was being too damn euphemistic, as usual.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Or rather, she's had a problem
<i>not</i> drinking.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;We think Mom's stroke may have pushed her off the wagon.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After Dad's funeral, she went on a
five-day bender and...&quot; Helen grimaced.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><I>Lock it down, Morgendorffer, </i> she
commanded herself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Suffice it to say that we think she didn't wait for
the funeral this time.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Amy
jumped in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;So Aunt Rita's out doing keg stands while her mom is
dying?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That is so
<i>wrong!</i>&quot; Quinn cried, and for once, she couldn't have
been more accurate.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What happened next surprised Daria and Quinn even more than
Rita's possible whereabouts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Helen
Morgendorffer broke down sobbing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><i>If this stroke doesn't kill Mother, Rita will.</i><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thirty-five thousand feet above Kansas, Rita Barksdale was
on her second glass of wine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At
least, the flight attendants thought it was her second glass of wine.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She'd had one glass in the airport bar,
and for good measure, washed it down with a scotch on the rocks.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With any luck, she'd be asleep soon and
she wouldn't have to worry about getting thrown off the plane for
drunkenness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That had happened to
her twice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe more, if you
counted that time back in '88 when she woke up in Dubuque.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She still wasn't sure how she wound up
there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No matter.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In a few hours, she'd be in Las Vegas,
playing the slots, chasing Chippendales, and drinking enough to forget most of
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Forgetting was all she really
wanted to do right now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Forget
that her mom had just had a stroke and wouldn't survive.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Forget that what was left of Mom's
savings would be gone after her hospital stay.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Forget that <i>she</i> was the reason there was
so little left...<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Never mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She'd done her duty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She'd
been there for Mom, unlike Helen, Patron Saint of Workaholics, and Amy, Queen
of the Disappearing Act.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Let them
deal with Mom for once in their pathetic lives.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><i>I'm the one who lived with Mom all those
years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm the one who followed in
her footsteps at the Junior League, I'm the one who drove her wherever she
needed to go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm the one who stood
by her after Dad died... well, after I sobered up anyway.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And now that Helen and Amy are on their
way, I'm the one who ensured that she wouldn't die alone.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My job is done.</i><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rita wanted to remember her mother as the active woman she'd
been, and thus there was no reason to sit by her deathbed and weep, nor any
reason to go to the funeral and weep some more. Let Helen and Amy have the
negatives: the hospital, the funeral, the cemetery. Negatives were all they
were likely to remember about Mom anyway; those two brats never could stop
criticizing her. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Never mind</i>, she thought. <i>Just
close your eyes, and when you wake up, you'll be in Vegas.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just close your eyes...</i><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The doctor, an officious-looking man of about 35, arrived at
9:00 the next morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jake,
Daria, Quinn, and Erin were sharing a hotel room a few miles away.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The two Barksdale sisters had slept in
Tess' room - Amy on a recliner, Helen on a cot - and were now stirring sugar
into their coffee in a desperate attempt to make it palatable.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Are you Mrs. Barksdale's daughters?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm
Helen Morgendorffer and this is Amy Barksdale.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I'm Dr. Whitney.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He shook their hands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;I have good news and I have bad news.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The good news is that the surgery was a success.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Your mother's going to live.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She's very lucky; about 80% of the
people who have this type of stroke don't survive.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Oh thank God,&quot; Helen said.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;What's the bad news?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;As we discussed yesterday, your mother's faculties
will be diminished once she wakes up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She'll need a great deal of care.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I suggest you investigate nursing homes.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Could she be cared for at home?&quot;<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Helen asked.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Maybe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
depends on how much brain damage she's sustained.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I'll schedule an MRI for this afternoon.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That'll tell us the full extent of the
stroke.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Here's my card; let me
know if you have more questions.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>With that, the doctor left.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen stared at her unconscious mother with a look of
intense concentration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><i>I've been avoiding you too long.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It's time to change that.</i><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;What is it?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Nothing, yet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I just... I need to go take care of some business.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'll be back in a few hours.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You damn well better come back.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm not dealing with this mess
alone.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen looked her sister in the eye.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I will be back.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If I don't come back, it's because I
ran into Rita and she shot first.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen, of course, did not run into Rita.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even if Rita had been within 100 miles
of the family, she wouldn't have been caught dead in the public library, which
was where Helen spent the afternoon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She wasn't looking for any book; she simply needed a few hours of peace
and quiet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She returned to the
hospital that afternoon with her head clearer than it had been in years.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That evening, Helen explained the
situation to her family over a just-this-side-of-edible dinner in the hospital
cafeteria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;So the MRI said
that most of Mom's brain damage is in the part of the brain that controls
speech.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There's also some damage
to her motor centers, but she'll still have her cognitive abilities.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Is she going to get better?&quot; Quinn asked.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Some stroke survivors do,&quot; Helen replied.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;A few don't.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But in order to get better, she'll need
a lot of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>rehabilitation.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;What, she should join AA?&quot;<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quinn said.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Not that kind of rehabilitation, Quinn.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Physical rehabilitation.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And on that note, I need to discuss
something with all of you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Six questioning eyes locked on her.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>I hope Jake doesn't have
another heart attack.</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Helen sucked in a deep breath and said, &quot;I want Mom to move in with
us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And I want to quit my job so I
can help take care of her.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria dropped her fork. &quot;Who are you and what have you
done with my mother?&quot; <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;But... but... what about money?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And your mother... under our roof...
you hate your mother!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Can't...
take ... more... battling... Barksdales!&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Jake cried. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen wrapped an arm around Jake's shoulders.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Relax, Jakey.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Your business has been taking off
lately, and we've got money saved for Daria and Quinn to go to college.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And Mother has a nest egg of her own we
can use.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;But Mom, making partner is, like, the only thing
you've talked about since we moved to Lawndale.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If you quit, you can't do it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She smiled wanly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;I really did want to make partner.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But some things are more important.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you were to look up the word &quot;thunderstruck&quot; in
the dictionary, you'd likely find a picture of Daria Morgendorffer's face at
that moment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>I feel like
I've walked into an after school special,</i> she thought.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A few hours later, Helen explained the situation to
Amy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;So you don't mind my
taking on Mom?&quot; she asked.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Mind?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>No!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm grateful.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I love Mom, but there's no space in my
apartment for her, and my department chair has me running around like a
one-armed paper-hanger until my tenure review next year.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But are you sure you're up for
this?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I did the math, and it looks like we can use Mom's
savings to pay for a lot of her treatments.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Plus, we'll get some money from the sale of her house.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amy shook her head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;Mom's not going to like that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I don't particularly like it either.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After all, that house was Mom and Dad's
dream.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But it'll be a long time
before Mom can live on her own again - if ever - and it doesn't make any sense
to pay the mortgage on an unoccupied house.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By Monday morning, Tess had recovered enough to notice her
surroundings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The family had all
gathered in her room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Someone had
told her why they were there, but she couldn't remember what was said. She
gazed over at the two girls sitting next to Erin.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Are those Helen's daughters?</I> she
wondered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Lord, they've
grown up in a hurry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
redhead... Quinn, yes, that's her name... she's showing a little too much belly
there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But at least she's
pretty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If she plays her cards
right, she'll find a good husband.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The brunette... Darlene?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>No, Daria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rita told me the
girl's an antisocial bookworm, yet stubborn as a mule.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Poor child somehow got both Helen and
Amy's worst qualities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Good luck
finding a man for that one, Helen.</I><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Mom, the doctor's here,&quot; Helen said.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>I can see that, you nitwit.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Glad you tore yourself away from work
long enough to see your mother.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Did you have to get surgery to remove that cell phone from your
ear?</i><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Hello, Mrs. Barskdale,&quot; Dr. Whitney said, pulling
up a chair next to the bed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;I'm Dr. Jeremy Whitney.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You're in Richmond General Hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>You had a stroke three days ago and we're trying to figure
out how it affected you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Can
you understand me?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tess opened her mouth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;Y... uh...&quot; <i>Dammit, what is that
word?</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her face turned
crimson as she struggled to remember.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Giving up on speech, she merely nodded.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Mrs. Barksdale, can you tell me the last thing you
remember before you got to the hospital?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Um, Friday sun up, we watched... uh, Showcase Showdown,
talked about the, um, <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>meeting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rita
called... doctors."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Tess was
enraged.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She understood the doctor
and she remembered the morning of her stroke perfectly: It was Friday, just
after 11 AM, and she and Rita were watching &quot;The Price is Right&quot; and
discussing a Junior League meeting when suddenly she couldn't feel her
foot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rita called 911 and they
went to the hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She knew it;
why the hell couldn't she say it?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><i>Since when does a stroke turn you into a
two-year-old?</i> <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Grandma, what's wrong?&quot; Erin said.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She had never known Tess to be anything
but direct when speaking.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dr. Whitney then handed Tess a pencil and paper and asked
her to try to write down her thoughts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The result was similar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
made a few notes, then turned to Helen and Amy.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Your mother is suffering from Broca's aphasia.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She can understand everything you say,
but as you can see, she's having difficulty expressing herself both verbally
and on paper.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Oh Mom,&quot; Helen said softly, tears welling up.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><I>I'll be damned.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The Woman of Steel has a heart after all,</i> Tess
thought.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;There is good news, though.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Speech therapy could be a big help to your mother.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Have you decided where she's going to
live after she's discharged?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This time, Tess found the words she was looking for.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Two of them, anyway.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She shouted, &quot;Home!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rita!&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jake took Helen's hand as she started weeping.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Shoes shuffled.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Eyes turned to the floor.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>What the hell is going
on?</i> Tess wondered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Suddenly, she realized that Rita wasn't there.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amy pulled herself together first.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Mom, we don't know where Rita is.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nobody's seen her since she took you to
the hospital on Friday.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tess' brows furrowed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;No." <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Erin walked over and took Tess' hand.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I'm sorry Grandma,&quot; she
said, fighting off tears.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I
tried everything I could think of for the last two days, but I can't find
her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I left her a bunch of
messages and she won't call back.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tess softened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;You're a good um, daughter of daughter." <i>Poor thing.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What's she going to do without her
mother?</I><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Mom,&quot; Helen said softly, &quot;Jake and I want
you to come live with us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm
going to quit my job so I can spend more time with you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>What what WHAT??</I><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Hmph.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't...think it is to be true."<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen briefly stepped back as if she'd been slapped.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Take a deep breath,
Morgendorffer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Remember where
</i>your<I>stubborn streak came from.</i> &quot;Mom, I feel
awful about the way things have been between us.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I want to make it up to you.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>If you come live with me, I'll quit my job.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>You'll quit your job?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I had a stroke, not a lobotomy.</i><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Hmph.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen shrugged.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She'd hoped to do this in person so she could see the expression on
Eric's smug little face when he realized he couldn't foist his work on her
anymore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Oh well, if this was what
it took to convince Mom, she'd do it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She whipped out her cell phone and began dialing.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Hello, is Eric Shrecter available?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Tell him it's Helen Morgendorffer.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Yes, I'll hold.... Hello, Eric.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When am I going to be back at the
office?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I will not be back at the
office...<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>STOP THAT LAUGHING!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'll fax you a written resignation
later today.... I'm leaving because my mother had a stroke and my siblings
aren't able to care for her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And
since I don't believe in warehousing my mother in a nursing home and you don't
believe in flex-time, I have no choice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Tell Marianne she's been great.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I'll be back to clean out my desk on Wednesday.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Good bye.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tess blinked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;OK.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Me come.&quot;<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me, and I forgot how to say &quot;thank
you.&quot;</i><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By Wednesday evening, the Morgendorffer clan had returned to
Lawndale and Daria finally had a chance to discuss the last few days events
with her best friend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Over an
extra-large pepperoni pizza, Daria explained the new family situation.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;So now Grandma Barksdale lives with us and Mom swears
she's going to take care of her.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane raised an eyebrow.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;How is she going to find time to do that when she's
spending 90 hours a week at the office?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;She's quitting her job.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane laughed so hard that she nearly choked on her
pizza.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After clearing her throat,
she said, &quot;Wait.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You're not
laughing.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It's not a joke.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Mom really did quit her job.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She and Grandma have been feuding since before I was born, and Mom
decided it's time to bury the hatchet.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Whoa.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Being jobless must be a shock for your mom.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;She's taking it pretty well so far.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She went to clean out her desk at the
law firm and when she came back, she had the biggest grin I've ever seen.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When I left, she was calling
occupational and speech therapists for Grandma and drawing up a new
budget.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;What do you mean by a new budget?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Oh you know, more homemade food, less frozen lasagna,
less money for Quinn to blow on clothes she'll only wear once.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Why do you ask?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"All the care your grandma's going to need sounds
expensive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How is your mom going
to be able to pay for that and Raft tuition when she's unemployed?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;My folks have been putting money in my college fund
since I was a baby.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There's enough
money to cover it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How are the
wandering Lanes paying for BFAC?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane shrugged.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;I got a scholarship from BFAC that pays about half my
tuition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When Grandma Lane heard I
was going to college, she decided that she should help me make something of
myself because she figures none of my siblings will.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>So she's covering the rest of my tuition, plus room and
board.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Wow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>What's the catch?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I have to finish in four years and I have to live in
the dorms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's a small price to
pay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, I still haven't told
you what you missed at graduation.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;A bunch of boring speeches given by people I'll never
see again?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Even better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You missed getting to give a speech!&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now it was Daria's turn to nearly choke.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;What?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yeah, they gave you an award for 'academic achievement
in the face of extreme misanthropy.'&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria waved her hand dismissively.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Sounds like a back-handed compliment.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Anything interesting, like Kevin
falling off the stage?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Kevin didn't get on stage.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;What, did he and Brittany oversleep?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Even better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Kevin didn't graduate.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;There is a God!&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Back in Richmond, Amy and Erin had a Herculean task ahead of
them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Everything Tess had
accumulated over the last few decades needed to be sorted. Some things would be
sent to Lawndale so that she could use them now; others would be placed into
storage in case she was ever able to live on her own again.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No one dared say it, but everyone knew
that the possibility of Tess regaining her independence was slim.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The best she could hope for was
assisted living.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Money was another issue.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Someone had to find out exactly how much money was in Tess'
bank accounts and find a way for Helen to be able to access it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Someone had to put the house on the
market.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Someone had to take care
of the credit card bills.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rita had
been named executor of the estate, so normally these would be her duties.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With Rita nowhere to be found, the will
stated that Erin should take her place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Amy wasn't required in Providence until the start of the summer term, so
she offered to help Erin.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While Amy was sorting clothes in the master bedroom, Erin
was in the study.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Erin figured the
credit cards should be her first priority.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She didn't know how long it was until the next payments were
due, and she knew how angry credit card companies got when you missed a
payment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Grandma doesn't
need that kind of stress,</i> she thought.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She went into Tess' billfold to find the actual cards - it
would be a good idea to hold onto them in case Tess wanted to use them later.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Gee, that's strange.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Three slots for credit cards, but only
two cards are here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe she
cancelled one.</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A memory drifted up into Erin's mind.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;The two things a girl can never
have too many of are credit cards and gentleman callers,&quot; her grandmother
had said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No, Tess would never
cancel the card.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Erin decided to search the desk.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe the other card was only for emergencies and it was
stored separately.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Or maybe Tess
really had cancelled it.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Or maybe my mom took it.</i><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>No.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Of course
she didn't.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Whatever else her
mother had done wrong, she couldn't have stolen the card.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Could she?<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rooting through the desk, Erin found no card.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But she did find the credit card
statements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There was a folder for
Visa statements... yes, that card was here.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>There was another folder for MasterCard statements.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That card was here too.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And there was a folder for American
Express Gold Card statements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That
card was missing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>God,
please let there be another explanation for this.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Please don't let my mom be a thief.</i><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She searched the other drawers of the
desk like an addict looking for drugs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><i>Please let there be a secret hiding place or a safe deposit box
key or something!</i><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An hour later, Amy entered the study to find all the drawers
on the desk removed and her niece sobbing amid a pile of papers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She knelt in front of Erin and took her
hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;What's wrong?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It's my mom,&quot; she wailed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;She took Grandma's gold
card.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two thousand miles away, Rita's luck was running out.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She did well at first, winning $15,000
at the craps tables.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was about
to cash in her chips when she saw it: Texas Hold-Em!<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She'd been a poker queen during her brief stint at Great
Prairie State, so she could really clean up now.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>At least, that's what she'd thought two martinis ago.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now the alcohol was catching up, her
chips had dried up, and she just wanted to lie down.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><I>Might as well put a few charges on Mother's gold
card while I still can.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I already
put the plane ticket on here, so what harm would a hotel room do?</I><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then, through Rita's alcohol-induced fog came the
realization that her family had access to Tess' credit card information.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They may have already cancelled the
cards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And if they hadn't, the Las
Vegas charges would appear on the statement.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>No one could have taken the cards except her, and once they
saw the charges, they'd know how to find her.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Helen's a pit bull when it comes to getting what
she wants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There's no way I could
avoid her.</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Using Mom's
cards was out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She had to find
another way to make some cash in a hurry.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She toyed with the antique rings on her right hand.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Great-Grandma Barksdale would spin in
her grave if she knew what was about to happen to them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But then, she was probably already
spinning from everything else Rita had done that day.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><I>Sorry, Great-Grandma.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It's you or me, and I choose me.</i><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A few minutes later, Rita walked out of the casino.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The sale of the rings was just enough
to cover the money she'd lost at poker.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Now what?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The pounding in
her head was getting unbearable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She needed to sober up before she could make any more plans.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She stumbled into an alley, vomited, and dozed off.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Several hours later she woke to the
sound of a fistfight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Luck was on
Rita's side this time because she sidled away from the commotion
unnoticed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The pounding in her
head was gone, but a rumbling in her stomach arrived.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now what?<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>I'm so tired of asking myself that.</i><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She looked across the street and saw a
seedy strip club, the type of place that the frat boys at Great Prairie State
used to go to when they didn't have enough cash to drive to Chicago for real
fun.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The place had a &quot;Help
Wanted&quot; sign in the window.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Could she?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Yes.
<i>What else do I have going for me, anyway?</i><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She went back to the casino, ducked
into a bathroom, rinsed her mouth out and combed her hair.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>This could work.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It has to work.</I><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She crossed the street fixated on the neon sign above the
front door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;The Flamingo&quot;
it said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She walked in and asked
about the job.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The manager came in
a few minutes later.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Hunger made
it difficult to concentrate on what he was asking her, but one question stood
out.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;How old are you?&quot; he asked.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Thirty-five,&quot; she said.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>A fifteen-year lie.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He believed it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was
hired.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>I finally got a
job.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Happy now, Helen?</i><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday evening, Amy called her sister to explain the
situation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Bad news, bad
news, and more bad news.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And I
know what Helen does to the bearers of bad news.</i><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After three rings, Helen answered the phone.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Hello?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Hi Helen, it's Amy.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Are you busy?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Helen smiled to herself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Busy was having to work ten-hour days and coming home to find that Daria
had mouthed off to a teacher and Quinn was getting a D in math and Eric was
calling <i>again</i> and the only thing for dinner was Jake's
kitchen sink stew.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Running all
over town to get Mom to her appointments and getting home by six was downright
laid-back in comparison.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Um... there's no other way to say this.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Erin and I have been going over Mom's financial records, and
the news is not good.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amy fiddled with the phone cord.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Are you sitting down, sis?&quot; <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen slid into a kitchen chair.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I am now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>What's going on?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Well, first the bad news.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Rita stole Mom's gold card.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;WHAT???<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>That reprobate!!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm going
to kill her!&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Well, good luck finding her.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We spoke with the credit card company and they said that the
only charge that's been made since Mom had her stroke was an airline ticket.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She could be anywhere.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen was numb.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Rita had pulled some godawful stunts over the years, but this was worse
than any ten of those combined.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>After a long pause she said, &quot;Tell me you at least got them to
cancel the card.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yes, they were really good about it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They refunded the charge Rita made and
gave Mom a new account number.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But... that's not the worst of it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Mom doesn't have nearly as much in savings as we
thought she did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The account's
down to around $1,000.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She felt grateful that she'd heeded her sister's advice to
sit down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If she'd been standing
up when she heard that, she'd be on the floor in a puddle now.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The last she'd known, Tess had nearly
$40,000 in the bank. &quot;You mean Rita stole that too?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Are there any depths that little shit
won't sink to?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;She didn't steal it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Mom gave it to her.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen put the phone down and screamed out a diatribe of
obscenities that would make Larry Flynt blush.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Then she picked up the phone again.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Why did Mother give her the
money?&quot; she said through clenched teeth.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amy fidgeted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><i>Please don't kill me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I'm just the messenger.</i> &quot;Erin told me that when Rita
turned fifty, she had a bit of a meltdown.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She was depressed about getting old and she was afraid she'd
never get married again -&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;As if three times weren't enough.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Anyway, Mom thought that plastic surgery would cheer
her up.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Exactly what did she have done?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amy shuffled through a stack of bills.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Breast implants, arm lift, face
lift, liposuction in three places, spider vein removal, permanent eyeliner,
collagen injections... and those are just the ones I know about.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Erin said that Rita hired a personal
trainer and spent a lot of time in spas too.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;So why didn't Erin tell anybody about this before
now?&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Because she didn't know where the money was coming
from.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She thought that Mom was
writing checks for all these procedures, or putting them on the gold card.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Please don't blame her for this.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She's not her mother's keeper.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The entire household felt the wind come out of Helen's
sails.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>She's right.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Erin lives ten hours away from Mom and
Rita, and her marriage is on the rocks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She can't be expected to know what they're doing every second.</i><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Tell Erin that I'm not angry at
her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But from this day forward, I
have no sister named Rita.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amy blinked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Surely Helen wasn't going to simply let this go!<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;That's it?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No tirades?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>No hunt for Rita's blood?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen may have been a pit bull, but she had the sense to
know when she was beaten. &quot;What good would it do at this point?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We don't know where she is and finding
her would take an army of private detectives.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And that would take money that we don't have.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rita obviously doesn't want to be part
of this family anymore,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>and after
what she's done, I don't want to call her family.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She's dead to me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amy sat in silence for a moment.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>At first she couldn't believe what her sister had said.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>But then, disowning everyone
is pretty much what I did between grad school and Erin's
wedding.</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Amy decided
that the issue of Rita could be settled if and when she returned.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Right now, there were more pressing
matters.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Eager to move on, Helen asked, &quot;Is there anything else
I should know about?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
talked to a real estate agent about selling Mom's house.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We'll get a fair amount of money for
it, but not as much as we'd hoped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The roof's leaking and the siding's turning to pulp, so they'll both
have to be replaced before we can sell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>That'll eat into the profits.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;How much?&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Helen asked.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amy quoted a figure, and Helen's head spun.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She sat in a daze for a few
moments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then Amy's voice came
over the phone line as if out of a fog.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;Sis, are you OK?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yeah... yeah, I'm fine.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I just... uh...&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I'm sorry, I know it's a lot to take in.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yeah... uh... Amy, I'll call you tomorrow.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I need to do some math.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before she had quit her job, Helen felt like she spent her
whole life robbing Peter to pay Paul.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She stole time from her daughters to be at work, and from work to be
with Jake, and from herself to do the trillion and one other things she needed
to get done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But until now, she'd
never felt like she was actually stealing from anyone.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now there was money involved.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To say that her sister's news had been a shock was the
understatement of the year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
she'd quit her job, she thought that her mother had saved enough to cover any long-term
care she might need.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Little did
she know that Rita's need to keep young and beautiful was more important than
anything else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not only had Rita
depleted the savings, but she'd put most of her personal training sessions, manicures,
and &quot;look-at-me&quot; outfits on Tess' cards.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>That coupled with Tess' home being in a greater state of
disrepair than previously known meant that Helen had a hard decision to make.
<i>Mother should have been smarter than that,</i> she thought,
grinding her teeth.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Her first option was to find a part-time job and pray that
she'd still have the money and time to care for Tess and send her daughters to
college.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That wasn't very likely;
Helen had learned from bitter experience that when law firms said &quot;part
time&quot; they really meant &quot;we'll pay you for part time work, but if
you're a team player, you won't mind working full-time hours.&quot;<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And it would pay less - much less -
than she was making before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, what would Mom do while she was working?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>I can't leave Mom alone until
more of her speech comes back, and that could take months.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What if there was an emergency?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Would she be able to call 911?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Would the operators understand
her?</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There were senior
centers in Lawndale where Tess could stay while the rest of the family was at
work and school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But the cost
would have been so high that there'd be too little left over for tuition
payments, not to mention car payments and mortgage payments and credit card
payments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For now, part-time work
was out.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second choice was to crawl back to her old firm, beg
them to re-hire her, and put Tess in a nursing home.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><i>But if I did that, what kind of example would I be
setting for the girls?</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Returning to her old job would send a subtle but strong message that her
work was more important to her than her mother - or her children.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the whole point of asking her
mother to move in with her was to end the feud they'd been having for nearly
four decades.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If she sent Tess to
the nursing home, she would kill her chances of ever reconciling with her
mother.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then there was the third choice: use the girls' college
funds to pay for Tess' care.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><i>God, what an ugly option.</i><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But at this point, it appeared to be the only one.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Selling her own house might help, but
it was only temporary; there was no telling how long Tess would need care.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Plus, the real estate market in
Lawndale was in a rut.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It could be
months before they found a buyer.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>There has to be another way.</i><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She thought of her husband.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jake may have had &quot;fruitcake&quot;
written all over him, but he was a whiz with money.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>If anyone could get them out of this jam, he could.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Jakey!&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yes, dear?&quot; He said, scrambling to the table.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Brew a pot of coffee.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We have some number crunching to do.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Jake set to work, an idea popped into Helen's mind.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She picked up the phone and called Amy
back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Hi Amy, it's me again.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I just have a quick question.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Ask away.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Do family members of CCRI faculty get free
tuition?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Spouses and children do, but no one else.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Why do you ask?&quot;<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Amy paused for a moment and then said,
&quot;Oh.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Jake and I started a college fund when Daria was six
months old.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When she was that age,
we never thought she'd get into a school like Raft.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Plus, I was still in law school and we didn't have that much
to give.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Later on, we saw how
bright she was and we tried to add to it more often, but Jake and I were both
making a lot less money in Highland, so the balance stayed fairly low until we
came to Lawndale.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Didn't Daria get any scholarships?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Well, she only applied for the Wizard Scholarship and
got rejected.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I thought she'd be
able to get some aid from Raft, but their scholarships are all need-based, and
at that time we didn't qualify.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Couldn't she have gotten any that were
merit-based?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No,&quot; Helen sighed.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;After Daria told me Raft was her first choice, I
called the financial aid office and asked about scholarships.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They said that anyone who could get
accepted to Raft would qualify for a merit scholarship, so they didn't hand any
out.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Damn,&quot; Amy sighed. &quot;You know I'd pay for
Daria to go to Raft if I could, but CCRI just had another round of budget cuts
and it looks like the raises we were supposed to get two years ago aren't
coming till the next Ice Age.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I do
want to help, though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What's
Daria's contingency plan?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I don't know,&quot; Helen admitted.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I wanted to go over the numbers
again before I talked to her.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amy did some mental calculations.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Well, I can definitely handle resident tuition at most
state schools, so tell Daria to consider me her new college fund.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It'd probably be too late for her to
get into a dorm anywhere, but if she could go to school locally...&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yes, Lawndale State and Carter County Community
College are both here in town.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;I could pay for tuition at either of those
places.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Or, if she didn't mind
putting off college for a little while, she could live with me in Providence
for a year, and then she'd qualify for resident tuition at the University of
Rhode Island.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Thank you, Amy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This means a lot to me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm
sure it'll mean a lot to Daria too.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After Helen ended the call, she looked into the dining
room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her husband was sitting at
the table, scribbling away and absolutely oblivious to everything around
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Well, he's always
oblivious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Math just intensifies
it.</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She smiled to
herself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She'd always loved
watching Jake do math.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;Serene&quot; was not normally a word one would use to describe
Jake Morgendorffer, but when he was crunching away at a math problem, he seemed
so peaceful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He was born to
calculate.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Several hours later, Jake looked up.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He'd finally finished, but the results
weren't going to be popular.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Time
to go show Helen; she was much better at delivering bad news than he.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He padded through the dark kitchen into
the living room, wondering where everybody was.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Then he noticed the clock.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><i>2:30 already?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I'd better get to bed.</i><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As he walked down the hall to the master bedroom, he noticed
that Daria's bedroom door was ajar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Stealthily, he opened it a little wider and peered in at her.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>I wish I could do better for
you, kiddo.</i><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next day while Jake was at the office, Helen called a
family meeting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria, Quinn, and
Tess gathered around the kitchen table where Helen stood looking like someone
had just kicked her puppy.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Everyone, I'm afraid I have bad news. <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>There no easy way to say this, but...
the money situation is a lot worse than we thought.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Rita spent most of Mom's savings on plastic surgery, and as
a result, the sale of her house isn't going to be enough to cover her
treatment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria, Quinn, I'm afraid
we have to use your college funds to pay for your grandmother's care.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;WHAT??&quot; Daria squawked.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Why didn't you tell me this sooner?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I would have applied for more
scholarships if I'd known!&quot; <i>I'd have sold my bodily fluids to get
out of this teenage wasteland.</i><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Daria,&quot; Helen said in the calmest tone she could
muster, &quot;we didn't find out about this until last night.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria's head fell forward onto the table.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>This cannot be happening.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This absolutely cannot be
happening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I did not just spend
four years busting my ass to get into a good school only to have it ripped away
from me at the last second by a relative I barely know.</i><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Oh my Gawd, does this mean I have to go to community
college?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You can't even join a
sorority at community college!&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Quinn cried.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Don't worry, Quinn,</i> Tess thought.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>You don't need a sorority to
find a good husband.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Lord knows
the one Rita met through her sorority was a bum.</i><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Quinn, you have another year before you start
college.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you make the most of
it - bring up your grades, get more involved, bring up your test scores - you
might be able to get a scholarship somewhere.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And maybe by then we'd qualify for more federal aid,&quot;
Helen said.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;So what about me?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Are you just going to let me rot in Lawndale?&quot; Daria
demanded.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen brightened a bit.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Daria, there is some good news.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Amy's offered to help you with
college.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She'll pay for you to go
to school locally, or you can take a year off and live with her, and then
you'll be able to get resident tuition at URI.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Why can't I just enroll at URI now?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Because you have to live in Rhode Island for a year
without taking classes in order to get residency.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Out-of-state tuition at URI is almost $18,000 per
year, and that's a hardship for Amy right now.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria folded her arms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;Nobody seemed concerned that not being able to go to Raft would be
a hardship for me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen was enraged, but before she could react, Tess spoke
up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;You should be
happy.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen looked at her mother quizzically.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Happy?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tess frowned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;Er... Thanksgiving?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Oh, you mean thankful?&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Quinn said.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yes,&quot; Tess replied.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Hardship is having a... brain thing.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Hardship is not knowing whether, uh...
daughter... is OK.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Hardship is not
this.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Lord, this
girl is spoiled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>See what happens
when you don't pay enough attention to them, Helen?</i><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Your grandma has a point, Daria...&quot; Helen began,
but she was cut off.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><I>Oh no, it's an after school special
again.</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;It's nice
to know who's really important around here.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I'll be at Jane's.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;...so that's the way it is,&quot; Daria explained,
seated on Jane's bed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;The
College Adventures of Daria and Jane aren't going to happen.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Damn, that sucks.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>What are you going to do?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Kill my grandmother?&quot; Daria joked.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Good luck getting into college with a murder rap.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Second choice?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria sighed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;I just can't decide right now.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Getting good grades and getting into a good college has been
the focus of my life since I was 14.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I knew that if I just worked hard enough, sooner or later I was going to
get out of here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now it comes out that
I could have goofed off half the time and still be in the same situation I am
now - going to a state school.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane thought for a moment.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Daria, I know how you feel -&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No you don't.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Getting rejected from a school is being told you can't cut it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Raft said I could cut it, but I'm not
good enough for them without $50,000 a year for the next four years.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You didn't have to worry about paying
for BFAC.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane snorted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;Getting rejected was not the only reason I didn't want to apply to
BFAC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I really was afraid I
couldn't afford it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If I hadn't
gotten that scholarship -&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>She would bring that up.</i><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;And how did you get a scholarship
anyway, with all those C's in math?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It's not a merit-based scholarship.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's a scholarship for students who demonstrate
financial need.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;What?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;You heard me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Think about it, Morgendorffer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>My mom makes ceramics and my dad's a freelance photographer - emphasis
on 'free.'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Things are a little
better now, but back in middle school Adrian and Courtney and I<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>had to dig through the couch cushions
to find money for dinner.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria's anger dissipated like fog at midday.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She'd known the Lanes were shiftless,
but she didn't realize it had ever been that bad.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I'm sorry, Jane.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jane shrugged.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;It's not your fault my folks are irresponsible.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No, I mean about the way I acted.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was rude.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It's OK, Daria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You are now obligated to put up with one of my tantrums.&quot;<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane smiled.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It's a deal.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria returned the smile.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;But I still don't know what to do about college.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Give yourself a few days to think about it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Lawndale State has rolling admissions,
so you can apply there any time.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;That's a good idea.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, I think I better go apologize to Mom.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was almost as nice to her as I was to
you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Okay, amiga.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Give me a call later.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria returned home to find the rest of the family gone and
note from her mother saying that she had taken Tess to physical therapy, Quinn
was out with friends, and they all expected to be back before dinner.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Might as well start looking at
L-State and URI's websites,</i> she thought resignedly.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>I can't make a decision
without knowing anything about either school.</i><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two hours later, Helen knocked on Daria's door.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Mind if I come in?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Have
a seat.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Daria, I just want to say that I know how disappointed
you are about Raft, but it's not the end of the world.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Lots of successful people went to state
schools.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Believe me, we'd send you
to Raft if we could.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But your
grandmother can't go out and get a job to help pay for her care.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You, on the other hand, can get a job
to help with school, or apply for scholarships next year.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria sighed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;I know that, Mom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And
I'm sorry I yelled at you earlier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But... I worked really hard to get into Raft, and all that work came to
nothing.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen hugged her daughter.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I know how much effort you put in, sweetie.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Your father and I have always been
proud of your dedication to school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And I know how much it hurts to devote yourself to a task and have it
come out poorly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I felt that hurt
every time I lost a case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
whenever I lost a case, I'd allow myself a certain amount of time to be upset
about it, and then I'd get back up and start working on the next case.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dwelling on disappointment will only
you into a bitter recluse, and you're too young for that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>"Well, I was hoping to get an early start," she said with a
Mona Lisa smile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"But you're
right."<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Helen started.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She hadn't expected it to be this easy.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Who are you and what have you done with my
daughter?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria smiled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;I talked to Jane earlier today and I realized that I'm actually
pretty lucky.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Note to self: thank Jane,</i> Helen thought
as she glanced over Daria's shoulder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;Is that L-State's website on your computer?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yeah.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
think I'd like to go to school there.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Really?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
thought you'd jump at the chance to live in Rhode Island with Amy.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Rhode Island is nice, but L-State has a creative
writing program and URI doesn't.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, if I took time off from school, I'm not sure I'd want to go
back.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Okay, sweetie.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Call Amy later and let her know what you've decided.&quot;<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Helen kissed the top of her daughter's
head and left the room.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amy Barksdale flopped onto the couch of her Providence
apartment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She'd just returned
from Richmond and she was exhausted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><i>If Daria moves in with me, I'll have to clean out that spare
bedroom for her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As if cleaning
out Mom's house wasn't bad enough.</i><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She groaned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Tess was an incredible pack rat, and Amy had inherited the trait.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>I shudder to think of what
I'll have stockpiled when I'm her age.</i><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amy was about to crack open a beer when the phone rang.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She considered letting the machine pick
up, but Helen's number displayed on the caller ID.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Better see what she wants.</i><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Hello?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Hi Aunt Amy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It's Daria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Are you
busy?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;No.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>What's going on?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Um, I want to say thank you for paying for me to go to
college.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It occurred to me that
it's probably not easy for you to scrounge up the money for that, and I'm
really lucky to have you for an aunt.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amy grinned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I'm
lucky to have you as a niece.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Have
you decided where you're going to go school yet?'<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Um, yeah, that's part of the reason I was
calling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm going to go to
Lawndale State.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's not that I
don't want to live with you, it's just that L-State has a creative writing
major and URI doesn't.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Yes!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Cleaning averted!</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;That's OK, Daria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
doesn't make much sense for you to go to a school that doesn't have the major
you want.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, I'm not exactly
easy to live with - just ask your mom.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><i>And I like my privacy just as much as you do.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We'd both go nuts living in close
quarters.</i><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria smiled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;She'd have similar things to say about living with me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Anyway, this is good news.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I know it's not exactly your first choice, or even your tenth,
but hey - you're going to college!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Even though you'll be in the same town, it's really a different
world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You're going to love
it.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><I>Don't tell her
the truth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She'll crack.</i><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Thanks, Aunt Amy.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I have to go; there's some stuff I need to take care
of.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Okay, Daria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Talk to you later.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daria set down the phone and pulled her chair up to the
computer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Opening up a new
document in the word processor, she began to type.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Dear Raft College,<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Due to circumstances beyond my control, I will not be
matriculating this fall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At that point, the screen became blurry.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria first thought there was something
wrong with the monitor but no, the monitor was working perfectly.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her eyes had filled with tears.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thirty minutes and nearly as many tissues later, she had the
letter signed, sealed, and in the mailbox.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Now there was only one more chore.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Daria made her way into the living room and found Tess at
her usual spot on the couch.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Um, hi Grandma.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Mind if I sit down?&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tess glowered at her granddaughter, but nodded.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Uh, I just want to say that I acted like a real jerk
this morning, and I'm sorry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not
getting to go to Raft is a huge disappointment, but um... I realized earlier
today that a lot of people are a lot worse off.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And... um... that it's actually pretty selfish of me to want
to go to Raft when you need the money for treatments.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tess gaped at Daria for a moment, then smiled.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><I>Perhaps there's hope for you
after all,</i> she thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;Niceness... uh, I mean, thanks...&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Apology?&quot; Daria squeaked.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Yes,&quot; Tess smiled.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Apology accepted.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Want to watch Humphrey Bogart?&quot;<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Tess clicked on the TV and flipped to
the Classic Movies Channel, where &quot;Casablanca&quot; had just started.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Sure,&quot; Daria said.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><i>I could get used to this.</i><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><p><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And for the rest of the evening, peace reigned in the
Morgendorffer household. <p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This story was inspired by a thread at the PPMB entitled "Bad
News, Daria," where there was a discussion of what would happen if Daria couldn't
afford to go to Raft.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I thought
the story had potential, but since the Morgendorffers seem well off, I first
had to find a way to make that scenario plausible.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>From there, the dominoes began to fall.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Two sequels to this story are
planned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One will focus on Daria's
adjustment to Lawndale State and the other will be Rita-centric. </p>
