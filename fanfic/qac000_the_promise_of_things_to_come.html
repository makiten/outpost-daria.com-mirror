<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First day of classes. Oh joy. Leaving Lawndale was hard enough. She hadn’t
brought all that much, hadn’t meant to, that is, but just the thought of her
little girl going off to college was more than enough to open the floodgates on
Helen’s credit card, if not her tear ducts. While annoying at times, Helen did
have useful parenting responses. Well, useful for some, in any case. It all fit
in the SUV, and Jake would be well out of earshot by the time the bills arrived,
so no real harm done.</p>
<p>Heading onto the quad, she sighed to herself. The first week was a bit
hectic, moving into her new room (a single, thank God), arranging a schedule,
and trying to track down professors to get permission to add their class to her
official roster, despite the university’s best efforts. But now, her room
livable and a schedule approved, signed, and duly filed in triplicate with the
registrar, only one task remained: locating the classes based on the acronyms in
the course and room roster. Oh, and surviving the first day of classes would be
nice as well.</p>
<p>Walking across the quad, the eclectic mix of buildings on the campus seemed
to crowd her narrow path. The University policy that buildings must be
representative of the time they were constructed in sounded great on paper, but
led to a very interesting feel for the campus. Where else could you find a
combination of colonial architecture, castle-like monoliths of brick and stone,
and the infamous Randall Hall, designed in the industrial nightmare style so
popular in the 70’s? Somehow, this would be her home for the next four years.
It would take some getting used to.</p>
<p>Shaking her head, she remembered the task at hand. Class. Dropping her bag to
the soft grass, she removed a small slip of paper, studying it carefully before
proceeding.</p>
<p>&quot;White Hall? That would be … there.&quot;</p>
<p>Across the quad, an old colonial building stands behind a quartet of tall oak
trees. Behind the leafy canopy of the center two trees, ‘hite Ha’ is visible
in large metal letters. Zipping her bag and hefting it over her shoulder again,
she heads off towards the building, entering through the first entrance.</p>
<p>Inside the building, a single long corridor runs the length of the building,
ending in a stairwell. Along either side of the corridor, classrooms branch off
at irregular intervals, with room numbers mounted on large plastic signs just
outside the door.</p>
<p>&quot;Ok, Introduction to Micro-Economics 101, White Hall 143. Hmm. 130, 132,
134 … &quot;</p>
<p>After a moment of searching, it becomes clear that there are no odd numbered
rooms anywhere in sight. Puzzled, she notices a sole open door at the far end of
the corridor. Curiously, she moves to the end of the corridor, peering
cautiously into the office. Satisfied, she walks through the door to reveal a
middle-aged woman sitting behind a large metal desk, piles of papers neatly
stacked on every flat surface. Looking up from her work, the woman studies the
new arrival with penetrating but friendly eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me guess, a freshman?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um, yeah.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I’m Rosalyn, the department secretary. Can I help you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um, I’m looking for room 143? I have a class there…&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Smiling, the woman gestures at the far wall of the office. &quot;Go back down
the hall, walk outside, and go in the other door. Room 143 is the second door on
the left.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Outside?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yep. This building is divided into two distinct parts, parts which don’t
connect to each other internally.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why would they do that?&quot;</p>
<p>The woman sports a small smile before responding. &quot;Our best guess is
that the architect was drunk. Or just didn’t like the university.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And no one thought to check the plans before they built it? Whose crazy
idea was THAT?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey now, don’t be criticizing the University.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um, why not?&quot;</p>
<p>Chuckling lightly to herself, the woman turns back to her computer, typing as
she speaks. &quot;Oh, no reason. They just like it if we say stuff like
that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh. Well … I really have to be going. I wouldn’t want to miss my
first class.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Watch what you say. You might change your mind.&quot;</p>
<p>Shrugging, she heads out of the office, turning down the corridor to towards
the door.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inside a lecture hall, a tall, thirty-something professor is perched by the
door, sitting back against the wall in front of a sparse classroom. Glancing in
disappointment at the scant handful of students in a classroom designed for over
one hundred fifty students, the professor turns quickly as the door swings open.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, hang on a second Miss …&quot;</p>
<p>Shifting slightly to observe the professor, she replies to his implied
question. &quot;Morgendorffer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Miss Morgendorffer. Are you in this class, or just looking?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the class. You signed my add/drop slip last week.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh. Well then, you’ll need a course packet. Here.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taking the packet, she takes a seat in the middle of the classroom, leafing
slowly through the stapled sheets. As she scans the syllabus, the seats around
her slowly fill with groggy students, an aroma of coffee hanging heavily in the
air. Just before reaching the end of the packet, the professor addresses the
class in a loud, confident voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Ok class, I suppose I should welcome you to our fair university and all
that, but lets get right down to business. My name is Professor Warre, and I am
taking over this class from Professor Johnson. I know that many of you see this
class as nothing more than an easy grade, but I can assure you that this year
will be different than previous years.&quot;</p>
<p>The professor pauses briefly as a groan circulates through the class.</p>
<p>&quot;Great. I wonder if there’s any room in poly-sci?&quot; mused a
student from the back of the room, eliciting a disappointed glare from the
professor. Raising his voice slightly in a commanding tone, the professor
continues, quickly regaining control of the lecture hall.</p>
<p>&quot;I can assure you that by the end of this class, you will know the
basics of economics. Or you will fail. Three tests, twenty percent each, one
final, thirty percent, and weekly homework to make up the remaining ten percent.
Now that we’ve gotten through the basics, we may as well get started with the
class.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, he sure doesn’t waste any time, does he?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Usually they give a day for people to settle in. So much for gentle
introductions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ms. Morgendorffer!&quot;</p>
<p>Turning in shock back to the front of the room, Professor Warre is staring
directly at her, as is much of the class. Behind her, a lanky girl, dressed in a
pair of cut-off jeans and a dark black t-shirt with ‘Carpe Noctem’ written
on the front, sits back sheepishly, looking thankful but guilty for bringing the
professor’s wrath on her classmate.</p>
<p>&quot;In my classroom young lady, we do not talk during lecture. Do you have
a problem with that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um, no?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good. But while I have your attention, perhaps you could explain to us
the concept of supply and demand?&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leaning forward, the black-shirted girl surreptitiously whispers, &quot;I’m
sorry,&quot; softly into her ear.</p>
<p>&quot;Well Miss Morgendorffer, we’re waiting for you to enlighten us.&quot;</p>
<p>Facing the professor, she stares at him with a determined stare, locking eyes
for a brief but significant moment before responding. &quot;Supply and demand is
a simple concept that economists like to pretend is complex and insightful.
Basically, it means that if the demand for a commodity, say oranges, exceeds the
available supply, then prices will rise until demand for oranges equals the
available supply.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That’s a reasonably good, if simplistic view of the matter…&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, this ignores the effects of limited competition, product
substitution, and inelastic demand on an economy, which would merely interfere
with the understanding of the fundamentals.&quot;</p>
<p>The professor cocks his head, recognizing that there is more to this girl
than meets the eye. &quot;Um, yes, that’s, uh, very good Ms.
Morgendorffer,&quot; he replies, studying her carefully before scanning the
class once again. &quot;Moving along…&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the lecture winds to a close, the class as a whole have their heads down,
furiously taking notes in their notebooks until the professor concludes.</p>
<p>&quot;And that’s the basic foundation upon which modern economics is based.
Now, before the next class, I expect you to read chapters 1-3 in your
textbook.&quot;</p>
<p>From the front of the classroom, a male student looks up in surprise.
&quot;Professor Warre? You want us to read three chapters by Wednesday?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The first chapter is only ten pages. It’s a very simple overview of
the entire course.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You want us to read two chapters by Wednesday?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. I do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh.&quot;</p>
<p>As the class begins to stand and pack their bags, the black-shirted girl
leans forward. &quot;Hi, I’m Amber. Not bad back there. How’d you know all
that stuff?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, that? Something I picked up in High School.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you always so confrontational with teach … professors?&quot;</p>
<p>Shaking her head, she turns to Amber with a smirk. &quot;Well, not really.
But if you establish yourself as a ‘smart’ one early on, you’ll earn a lot
more leeway later.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And the smart ones make the teacher look like a fool?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no. You’re not showing them up, you’re challenging them. Show’s
you’re awake…&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Semantics. Say, I didn’t catch your name…&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Morgendorffer.&quot; Looking up in surprise, she shakes her head
briefly in amusement. &quot;Sorry about that, I’ve been in a few too many
university offices this past week. My name is Quinn. Quinn Morgendorffer.&quot;</p>
