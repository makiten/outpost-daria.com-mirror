<p>Quinn looks out over the quad for a moment, a loose magenta t-shirt hanging
gently over her black jeans. Running her fingers through her now short hair, she
sighs to herself as she walks onto the quad for her first day of classes at
Wharton University. Her first week had been a bit hectic, moving into her new
room (a single, thank God), arranging a schedule, and trying to track down
professors to get permission to add their class to her official roster, despite
the university’s best efforts. But now, her room livable and a schedule
approved, signed, and duly filed in triplicate with the registrar, only one task
remained: locating the classes based on the acronyms in the course and room
roster. Oh, and surviving the first day of classes would be nice as well.</p>
<p>Walking across the quad, the eclectic mix of buildings on the campus seemed
to crowd her narrow path. The University policy that buildings must be
representative of the time they were constructed in sounded great on paper, but
led to a very interesting feel for the campus. Where else could you find a
combination of colonial architecture, castle-like monoliths of brick and stone,
and the infamous Randall Hall, designed in the industrial nightmare style so
popular in the 70’s? Somehow, this would be her home for the next four years.
It would take some getting used to.</p>
<p>Shaking her head, Quinn remembers the task at hand. <i>Class</i>. Dropping her bag
to the soft grass, she removes a small slip of paper, studying it carefully
before proceeding.</p>
<p>&quot;White Hall? That would be … there.&quot;</p>
<p>Across the quad, an old colonial building stands behind a quartet of tall oak
trees. Behind the leafy canopy of the center two trees, ‘hite Ha’ is visible
in large metal letters. Zipping her bag and hefting it over her shoulder again,
she heads off towards the building, entering through the first entrance.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">#</p>
<p>Inside the building, a single long corridor runs the length of the building,
ending in a stairwell. Along either side of the corridor, classrooms branch off
at irregular intervals, with room numbers mounted on large plastic signs just
outside the door.</p>
<p>&quot;Ok, Introduction to Micro-Economics 101, White Hall 143. Hmm. 130, 132,
134 … &quot;</p>
<p>After a moment of searching, it becomes clear that there are no odd numbered
rooms anywhere in sight. Puzzled, she notices a sole open door at the far end of
the corridor. Curiously, Quinn moves to the end of the corridor, peering
cautiously into the office. Satisfied, she walks through the door, revealing a
middle-aged woman sitting behind a large metal desk, piles of papers neatly
stacked on every flat surface. Looking up from her work, the woman studies the
new arrival with penetrating but friendly eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me guess, a freshman?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um, yeah.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I’m Rosalyn, the department secretary. Can I help you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um, I’m looking for room 143? I have a class there…&quot;</p>
<p>Smiling, the woman gestures at the far wall of the office. &quot;Go back down
the hall, walk outside, and go in the other door. Room 143 is the second door on
the left.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Outside?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yep. This building is divided into two parts, which don’t connect to
each other inside.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why would they do that?&quot;</p>
<p>The woman sports a small smile before responding. &quot;Our best guess is
that the architect was drunk. Or just didn’t like the university.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And no one thought to check the plans before they built it?&quot; Quinn
asked, genuine surprise in her voice. &quot;Whose crazy idea was THAT?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey now, don’t be criticizing the University,&quot; Rosalyn warned,
wagging a finger at Quinn.</p>
<p>&quot;Um, why not?&quot;</p>
<p>Chuckling lightly to herself, the woman turns back to her computer, typing as
she speaks. &quot;Oh, no reason. They just like it if we say stuff like
that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; Quinn said, checking her watch. &quot;Well … I really have
to be going. I wouldn’t want to miss my first class.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Watch what you say. You might change your mind.&quot;</p>
<p>Shrugging, Quinn heads out of the office, turning down the corridor towards
the door.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">#</p>
<p>Inside a lecture hall, a tall, thirty-something professor is perched by the
door, sitting back against the wall in front of a sparse classroom. Glancing in
disappointment at the scant handful of students in a classroom designed for over
one hundred fifty students, the professor turns quickly as the door swings open.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, hang on a second Miss …&quot;</p>
<p>Shifting slightly to observe the professor, she replies to his implied
question. &quot;Morgendorffer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Miss Morgendorffer. Are you in this class, or just looking?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the class. You signed my add/drop slip last week.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh. Well then, you’ll need a course packet. Here.&quot;</p>
<p>Taking the packet, she takes a seat in the middle of the classroom, leafing
slowly through the stapled sheets. As she scans the syllabus, the seats around
her slowly fill with groggy students, an aroma of coffee hanging heavily in the
air. Just before reaching the end of the packet, the professor addresses the
class in a loud, confident voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Ok class, I suppose I should welcome you to our fair university and all
that, but lets get right down to business. My name is Professor Warre, and I am
taking over this class from Professor Johnson. I know that many of you see this
class as nothing more than an easy grade, but I can assure you that this year
will be different than previous years.&quot;</p>
<p>The professor pauses briefly as a groan circulates through the class.</p>
<p>&quot;Great. I wonder if there’s any room in poly-sci?&quot; mumbles a
student from the back of the room, eliciting a disappointed glare from the
professor. Raising his voice slightly in a commanding tone, the professor
continues, quickly regaining control of the lecture hall.</p>
<p>&quot;I can assure you that by the end of this class, you will know the
basics of economics. Or you will fail. Three tests, twenty percent each, one
final, thirty percent, and weekly homework to make up the remaining ten percent.
Now that we’ve gotten through the basics, we may as well get started with the
class.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, he sure doesn’t waste any time, does he?&quot; a girl whispers
from the row behind Quinn.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Usually they give a day for people to settle in. So much for gentle
introductions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ms. Morgendorffer!&quot;</p>
<p>Turning in shock back to the front of the room, Professor Warre is staring
directly at her, as is much of the class. Behind her, a lanky girl, dressed in a
pair of cut-off jeans and a dark black t-shirt with ‘Carpe Noctem’ written
on the front, sits back sheepishly, looking thankful but guilty for bringing the
professor’s wrath on her classmate.</p>
<p>&quot;In my classroom young lady, we do not talk during lecture. Do you have
a problem with that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um, no?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good. But while I have your attention, perhaps you could explain to us
the concept of supply and demand?&quot;</p>
<p>Leaning forward, the black-shirted girl surreptitiously whispers, &quot;I’m
sorry,&quot; softly into Quinn’s ear.</p>
<p>&quot;Well Miss Morgendorffer, we’re waiting for you to enlighten us.&quot;</p>
<p>Facing the professor, she stares at him with determination, locking eyes for
a brief but significant moment before responding. &quot;Supply and demand is a
simple concept that economists like to pretend is complex and insightful.
Basically, it means that if the demand for a commodity, say oranges, exceeds the
available supply, then prices will rise until demand for oranges equals the
available supply.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That’s a reasonably good, if simplistic view of the matter…&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, this ignores the effects of limited competition, product
substitution, and inelastic demand on an economy, which would merely interfere
with the understanding of the fundamentals, don’t you agree?&quot;</p>
<p>The professor cocks his head, recognizing that there is more to this girl
than meets the eye. &quot;Um, yes, that’s, uh, very good Ms.
Morgendorffer,&quot; he replies, studying her carefully before scanning the
class once again. &quot;Moving along…&quot;</p>
<p>As the lecture winds to a close, the class as a whole have their heads down,
furiously taking notes in their notebooks as the professor concludes his
presentation.</p>
<p>&quot;And that’s the basic foundation upon which modern economics is based.
Now, before the next class, I expect you to read chapters 1-3 in your
textbook.&quot;</p>
<p>From the front of the classroom, a male student looks up in surprise.
&quot;Professor Warre? You want us to read three chapters by Wednesday?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The first chapter is only ten pages. It’s a very simple overview of
the entire course.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You want us to read two chapters by Wednesday?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. I do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh.&quot;</p>
<p>As the class begins to stand and pack their bags, the black-shirted girl
leans forward, getting Quinn’s attention. &quot;Hi, I’m Amber,&quot; she
offered in a friendly tone. &quot;Not bad back there. How’d you know all that
stuff?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, that? Something I picked up in High School.&quot;</p>
<p>Amber stares at Quinn for a moment before continuing. &quot;Are you always so
confrontational with teach … professors?&quot;</p>
<p>Shaking her head, she turns to Amber with a smirk. &quot;Well, not really.
But if you establish yourself as a ‘smart’ one early on, you’ll earn a lot
more leeway later.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And the smart ones make the teacher look like a fool?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no. You’re not showing them up, you’re challenging them. Show’s
you’re awake…&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Semantics. Say, I didn’t catch your name…&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Morgendorffer.&quot; Looking up in surprise, she shakes her head
briefly in amusement. &quot;Sorry about that, I’ve been in a few too many
university offices this past week. My name is Quinn. Quinn Morgendorffer.&quot;</p>
<p>Looking at Quinn, Amber studies her for a second, her blue eyes trying to
look straight through Quinn. &quot;You’re a freshman, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um, yes. Yes, I am,&quot; Quinn replied, not fully understanding the
significance. &quot;Is that a problem?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nope. We’re all freshman at some point,&quot; Amber reassured her.
&quot;At least, those of us who get that far. It’s just rare to see a freshman
with your confidence.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know what? You still haven’t.&quot; <i>Now if Daria was here</i>,
Quinn thought …</p>
<p>&quot;A rose by any other name …&quot; Amber said, rubbing her eyes as the
two began to head out of the classroom. &quot;Hey, if you want, I know this
great coffee shop nearby. I don’t know about you, but these 8:30 classes are
just too damn early for me.&quot;</p>
<i>
<p>Coffee.</i> Quinn could think of a thousand reasons to say no. Stains.
Complexion problems. Just two of a number of reasons she’d used in the past.
But now, they all seemed … distant, unimportant. The answer surprises Quinn,
even as she responds. &quot;Sure. Coffee sounds great.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">#</p>
<p>Opening the large glass doors, Quinn and Amber enter a quaint coffee shop,
making their way into the short but rapidly growing line. Quinn looks up behind
the counter at the vast array of coffee flavors as Amber leans against the
railing. Quinn tries to decide what she wants, staring up at the large printed
menu. English Toffee Cream, French Vanilla, Rain Forest Nut, Hazelnut, or Irish
Cream? <i>So many different flavors to choose from</i>, Quinn thought, turning
to Amber. &quot;What do you recommend?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Personally, I love the hazelnut. Good stuff.&quot; Closing her eyes for
a moment, she smiles in remembrance. &quot;After nine at night, they’ll make
it triple strength if you ask nicely.&quot;</p>
<p>Shuddering slightly at the thought, Quinn shoots a strange look at Amber.
Noticing her reaction, Amber smiles, looking back at Quinn. &quot;So I take it
you’re not a big coffee fan?&quot;</p>
<i>
<p>Uh-oh</i>, Quinn thought, <i>think fast</i>. &quot;Um, it’s not that,&quot;
Quinn said, trying to buy time for her mouth and mind to come to agreement.
&quot;It’s just that, um, I never really needed to stay up that late in High
School.&quot; <i>At least not for academic reasons</i>, she mused.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, so you’re one of those genius types who don’t have to work at
anything, huh?&quot;</p>
<p>Quinn shifts slightly, angry with Amber for making fun of her, when she
realizes that Amber doesn’t know anything about her, that she was actually
serious in her question. Caught up in the irony of the situation, Quinn begins
to laugh. Confused, Amber looks to Quinn, cocking her head in a curious stare.</p>
<p>&quot;Was it something I said?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You might say that,&quot; Quinn managed as she gradually stopped
laughing. &quot;If you really want to know, I’ll tell you over coffee. It’s
kind of a long story.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So whadda you two want?&quot; barked the apron clad employee working
the counter.</p>
<p>&quot;I’ll have the hazelnut, cream, no sugar.&quot; .</p>
<p>&quot;And for you?&quot; he asks Quinn.</p>
<p>Sniffing the air for a second, Quinn gives a barely perceptible shrug.
&quot;Hazelnut sounds fine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You want anything in that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um, no?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Black it is then.&quot;</p>
<p>The employee turns, removing two paper cups from a stack before walking back
to the wall of coffee machines behind him. As he pours the coffee, Amber looks
to Quinn in surprise. &quot;Black?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My jeans?&quot; Quinn asked, having missed the employee’s comment.</p>
<p>&quot;Your coffee.&quot; Looking at Quinn suspiciously, Amber gently
questions her. &quot;Have you ever had coffee before?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um, once or twice, yes.&quot;</p>
<p>Before Amber can continue, the employee returns with two large paper cups
full of coffee. &quot;There you go, one with milk, one black, hazelnut. Pay up
at the register,&quot; the employee says unenthusiastically, directing his
attention at the next customer. &quot;Next!&quot;</p>
<p>As the man behind the two places his order, Amber and Quinn make their way to
the cash register. Searching her jeans to find money, Quinn nods her head
towards the counter. &quot;Not terribly friendly here, are they?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, if you had to get in at 4AM for the early shift, you probably
wouldn’t be in a great mood either.&quot;</p>
<p>Handing a five dollar bill across the counter to the cashier, Quinn considers
Amber’s statement. &quot;I guess that makes sense… But if they don’t like
it, why do they work here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Money. Loans don’t cover everything.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Loans?&quot; Quinn asked, receiving her change from the cashier.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure. You can’t spell Wharton University without IOU,&quot; Amber
replied, heading off towards an open table.</p>
<p>As Quinn and Amber walk towards the table, Quinn lags slightly behind Amber,
her head cocked slightly. <i>She seems friendly</i>, Quinn observes silently. <i>And
with a touch of Daria’s sense of humor too. Oh well, nobody’s perfect.</p>
</i>
<p>Taking a seat in a booth against the wall of the shop, Quinn removes the
plastic lid on her coffee and takes a tentative sip. After an initial look of
pleasant surprise, Quinn’s face flinches slightly as the bitter aftertaste
kicks in. Waiting a second, Quinn takes another sip, her reaction almost
completely suppressed.</p>
<p>&quot;You’re right, this is pretty good.&quot; Placing the coffee down on
the table, Quinn looks across at Amber. &quot;I take it you’re not a
freshman?&quot;</p>
<p>Looking up at Quinn, Amber smiles briefly. &quot;That’s right, I’m a big
bad sophomore.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is that a problem?&quot;</p>
<i>
<p>Shouldn’t I be asking you that</i>, Quinn wondered? &quot;Um, it’s just
that in high school, we didn’t really, uh, interact much? With the other
classes, that is.&quot;</p>
<p>Laughing slightly, Amber shakes her head. &quot;I’d forgotten just how
naïve you all are coming out of high school.</p>
<p>&quot;Gee, thanks.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, relax. I didn’t mean it like that. It’s just that it’s not
all that important here. Here, you’ll get to know the people in your classes,
and maybe in your major. Do you have a major yet?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um, no.&quot; <i>A major</i>, Quinn wondered? <i>I’m just worried
about surviving for now. Besides, how am I supposed to know what I want to do?</i>
&quot;Do you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As of yesterday? Yes. I’m officially a Computer Engineering
major.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Computer engineering?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yep. Now you know my deep dark secret.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don’t worry. I won’t tell anyone you’re a sophomore.&quot;</p>
<p>Amber laughs in surprise as she puts down her coffee. Being careful not to
knock over the cup, she reaches up and gently scratches the side of her nose.
Satisfied, she turns her head to Quinn with a smile. &quot;You’re pretty funny
for a freshman.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um, thanks,&quot; Quinn replied uncertainly. Continuing with
trepidation, she asked &quot;If you don’t mind me asking, why are you in econ
101? Isn’t that, like, a freshman class or something?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not for engineers. We get stuck with calculus, physics, and chemistry
our first year.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ick!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, that pretty much sums it up. So you’re interested in
economics?&quot;</p>
<p>Taking a sip of her coffee, Quinn considers her answer for a moment before
responding. &quot;Well, sort of, I guess. Honestly, my advisor recommended the
course to me, said it fit a lot of, um, destitution? No, distribution
requirements.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You were right the first time,&quot; Amber replied, holding back a
laugh. &quot;You seemed to know what was going on pretty well though. You must
have had a better high school that I did …&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lawndale? Not really. I had an older sister,&quot; Quinn said as a
pensive look crossed her face. &quot;She’s a lot smarter than I was. Am.
Whatever.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don’t sell yourself short Quinn. I’ve seen a few people stand up to
professors like that before, but most of them are, um, arrogant pricks. You seem
almost normal.&quot;</p>
<i>
<p>Normal.</i> Had someone called Quinn normal in high school, she would have
been livid. She was so much more than normal. She was pretty, popular,
important. She was somebody. Funny then, how normal seemed like such a
compliment now. Taking another sip of coffee, she slowly stepped out of her
moment of introspection. &quot;Thanks, I think.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don’t mention it,&quot; Amber said flippantly, checking her watch.
&quot;I’ve gotta get going now. I have to stop by the Engineering Registrar
before my next class to make sure that they haven’t mangled my schedule too
badly. Say, would you want to join my friends and I for dinner?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dinner?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Or what passes for it at the dining hall.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um, sure. What time?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, we’ll meet you outside, and we always leave the dorm at 6:22 for
dinner.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;6:22?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have strange friends. See you then!&quot;</p>
<p>As Amber stands up, heading out of the building, Quinn watches in silence.
Turning back to the table, Quinn stares at her coffee, deep in thought. <i>Nice.
She seems so nice</i>, Quinn thought. <i>Why couldn’t she have been at
Lawndale? Oh well. I suppose I should track down my next class while I have the
time.</i></p>
<p>&quot;Now where would BH 203 be?&quot; Standing up, Quinn slings her backpack
over her shoulder, remembering at the last moment to grab her coffee as well.
Taking a sip as she heads for the door, Quinn smiles. &quot;You know, a girl
could get to like this whole coffee thing…&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">#</p>
<p>Across the campus stood a large, imposing building, a masterpiece of brick
and mortar. Known to the students as Balder Hall, it was the home of the
chemistry department, and the home of many a campus legend. It was rumored that
the roof was designed to remain in a single piece in an explosion, although
university policy took a dim view of students attempting empirical validation of
this legend.</p>
<i>
<p>It was all very interesting</i>, Quinn thought to herself as she entered the
large front door into the cavernous corridors. <i>Now if there were only some
easy way to locate her classroom.</i> If she didn’t know better, she would
have thought that it was a rite of passage or something. Little did she know
that the university thought almost the exact same thing. Thankfully, the
building was considerably simpler than White Hall. Heading up the staircase,
pausing now and then to gaze at the ornate marble carvings and gold inlay, she
was pleased to discover room 203 immediately adjacent to the staircase.</p>
<p>&quot;Now that wasn’t too bad,&quot; Quinn muttered aloud. &quot;I think I’m
getting the hang of this whole college thing.&quot;</p>
<p>Opening the classroom door, Quinn hesitates momentarily to look over the
classroom. It was somewhat smaller than her economics class, seating about
seventy students in hard wooden chairs with swing-up desks just to small to be
of any use at all. Heading into the classroom, Quinn is about to take a seat
when she recognizes a student towards the front of the lecture hall. Curious,
she walks over and sits down next to him.</p>
<p>&quot;Justin?&quot; Quinn asked in surprise. <i>What was he doing here</i>,
she wondered? Justin was one of Quinn’s neighbors in her dorm, an average,
blond young man with a penchant for chemistry and physics. As he turns to face
her, Quinn can’t help but smile. He has a certain … innocence to his
expression, a natural ability to look completely naïve, even when it was
clearly not the case. <i>It was for the better that he doesn’t realize this</i>,
she thought. <i>If he ever did, he could be dangerous.</p>
</i>
<p>&quot;Quinn? What are you doing here?&quot; Justin asked, looking up from his
notebook.</p>
<p>&quot;Um, I thought that my chemistry lecture was in here. Is there a
problem?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, maybe. My chemistry lecture is meeting in here today.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Chem 215?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That’s right. Chem 215. Honors general inorganic chemistry.&quot;</p>
<p>Taking in Justin’s statement, Quinn stares at him for a long moment,
remembering her first week. <i>Honors chemistry? But the lady said that this was
the only one open. She didn’t mention …</p>
</i>
<p>&quot;Um, Quinn? Are you OK?&quot; Justin interjected.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, I’m fine Justin. They just didn’t tell me that it was an
honors class. Great.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is that a problem?&quot;</p>
<i>
<p>Problem is an understatement</i>, Quinn thought. &quot;Well, unlike you, I’m
not all that good at chemistry. It’s just, um, not my thing.&quot;</p>
<p>Watching her expression of concern, Justin smiles at her sweetly. &quot;Just
give it a try, for a few weeks at least. It can’t be all that bad, can it?
Besides, if you have any trouble, just ask me. I’d be more than happy to give
you a hand.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, thanks,&quot; Quinn said uncertainly. With most guys, Quinn would
have no doubt that it was pure hormones speaking, a simple trade, chemistry for
a date. But with Justin, Quinn could never be certain. Justin was a healthy
male, but he was also genuinely nice, and in the week she had known him, he had
gone out of his way to help people a number of times, for little more than a
smile and a ‘thank you’. It made him very hard to figure out at times, a
trait that Quinn alternately found annoying and attractive.</p>
<p>&quot;No problem. At least this way, you get to enjoy my company during
lectures.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well THAT certainly convinced me to stay.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey now, let’s not get personal.&quot;</p>
<p>Smiling, Quinn looks up, straight at Justin. &quot;What, you’re saying
there’s no chemistry between us?&quot;</p>
<p>Grimacing slightly, Justin gives Quinn a look of faux-disgust. &quot;That’s
just horrible Quinn.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks.&quot; Reaching down to retrieve her notebook, Quinn couldn’t
help but give a small chuckle. <i>Was she flirting with him? Hell, she wasn’t
even sure. But he did have a point that lecture would be much more bearable with
a familiar face nearby. And she did have three weeks to switch classes at will,
didn’t she?</i> As the professor began to introduce himself and the class to
the students, Quinn looks down at him, considering her options. <i>I may as well
give it a try,
</i>
she mused<i>. What do I have to lose?</p>
</i>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">#</p>
<i>
<p>Well, I survived the first two classes</i>, Quinn thought, walking into the
bookstore. Dropping her bag into a cubby against the wall, she retains only a
small slip of paper containing her class roster. Passing through the large
anti-theft detectors mounted at the entrance/exit, she immediately stops at a
diagram of the bookstore layout, a large diagram color-coded by subject.</p>
<p>&quot;If I were a chemistry book, where would I be hiding?&quot; Quinn asked,
looking down at the legend. Turning back to the map, she quickly locates the
blue section on the diagram. &quot;Ah, chemistry! Got you!&quot; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Spending a moment to orient the map with the bookstore around her, Quinn
heads into the bustling crowd. After a fighting through the overcrowded aisles,
Quinn slides into the chemistry section, taking a moment to breathe before
beginning the search for her textbook. Scanning the course numbers listed on the
shelf, Quinn locates her textbook relatively easily. Picking it up, she briefly
scans through the book, reassuring herself that it is the right one. Satisfied,
she closes the book, noticing the price tag on the back cover.</p>
<p>&quot;Ninety dollars? For a book?&quot; Quinn exclaimed without thinking.
&quot;That’s ridiculous!&quot;</p>
<p>Quinn stopped suddenly, mortified that someone had caught her talking to
herself. But as she looked around, she realizes that none of the students appear
to have even give it a second thought. With a slight scowl, she picks up the
book. &quot;It’s not like I get a choice here, I suppose,&quot; she sighed.
Clutching the book to her chest, she pushes her way back into the crowd.</p>
<i>
<p>Maybe I should have picked a less crowded time</i>, Quinn pondered as she
fights against the surging crowd of students. <i>Lunch might have been better. I
can’t imagine it could be worse, in any case.</i> Of course, back in high
school, she could have recruited an entire honor guard to clear the way for her.
Such was life. Taking advantage of a brief opening in the crowd, Quinn ducks
through, pushing her way into the economics section.</p>
<p>&quot;Now which of these books do I need?&quot; Quinn asked herself.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, that’s quite easy miss,&quot; a store employee responded,
surprising Quinn. &quot;On the bottom of each shelf is the listing of both the
required and recommended books for each class.&quot;</p>
<p>Turning, Quinn cocks her head at the employee. &quot;Oh, I didn’t notice
that. Thanks.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No problem,&quot; he replied, eying the crowd nervously.</p>
<p>&quot;Busy day?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Actually, yesterday was worse.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Worse than this?&quot; Quinn asked, staring out at the crowd.</p>
<p>&quot;Yep.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I’m sorry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, it pays the bills. And as long as I can avoid the manager, I won’t
get stuck at the checkout.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Excuse me? Sir? Can you help me?&quot; another student asked, confused.
&quot;I can’t seem to find my textbook, and the sign said it was somewhere
over here…&quot;</p>
<p>Sighing, the employee turns to the student briefly. &quot;Sure, I’ll be
there in a second.&quot; Turning back to Quinn, he looks at her in silent
frustration. &quot;Well, duty calls,&quot; he observed, gesturing at the crowd.
&quot;Good luck out there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks.&quot; Watching as he walked away, Quinn turns slowly back to
the books, searching until she had located the two books required for her
economics class. Piling them on top of her chemistry text, she lifts the three
books, genuinely surprised at their weight. <i>Should have gotten a basket</i>,
she thought as she forced her way back into the crowd towards the long checkout
line. Enduring a moment of silent frustration, she takes her place in the long
checkout line.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">#</p>
<p>Returning from the bookstore, Quinn opens the door, standing in the doorway
as a silhouette against the bright hallway lighting. <i>Two hours in line</i>,
she thought flipping on a light switch and driving the shadows to the corners of
her room. With a hint of exhaustion, she drops her backpack on her bed, sitting
down momentarily. Leaning over, she sets the bulging plastic bag of textbooks on
the floor next to her bed, rubbing her tender wrist gently.</p>
<p>Kicking off her shoes, Quinn looks slowly over her room, her home for the
next year. Her desk, standard university issue, doing an admirable job of
holding up the laptop her parents had given her for graduation. &quot;For
academic use only,&quot; Jake had insisted, before Helen managed to divert his
attention. Thankfully, he had missed Daria’s gift, The Sims, &quot;For
non-academic use only&quot;. Family could be so strange at times. Or all the
time, in her case.</p>
<p>Standing up slowly, Quinn walks over to the window next to the desk, pulling
the curtains open to look over the dining hall immediately behind her dorm.
&quot;What a scenic view,&quot; Quinn said to herself, as she watches students
entering for dinner. After opening the window slightly to let some air into her
room, Quinn turns away from the window, heading towards the closet next to her
door. Opening the closet, Quinn stares in, a wistful expression on her face.</p>
<p>Reaching into the open closet, she is interrupted by a knock at the door.
Closing the closet, Quinn turns, opening the door to reveal a blonde girl,
standing an inch or two shorter than Quinn. Smiling, Quinn leans against the
wall as the girl enters.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey Marisa!&quot; Quinn exclaimed, a hint of excitement in her voice.
&quot;Did your first day of classes go well?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, not bad,&quot; Marisa replied in a friendly tone. &quot;I just
looked for the trail of clueless-looking students, and followed them. It worked
pretty well.&quot; Looking at Quinn’s bed curiously, she points at the bag
still sitting on the floor. &quot;Shopping at the bookstore?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Two hundred and fifty dollars worth of textbooks,&quot; Quinn replied
fatalistically. &quot;And that’s only two of my classes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really?&quot; Marisa replied, astonished at the figure.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, that’s what they charged me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh. You know, I better call my mom tonight. I don’t know if I have
that much money left.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um, they take credit cards,&quot; Quinn ad-libbed. Thankfully, Marisa
didn’t seem particularly worried about her financial status, which suited
Quinn fine. Quinn had no problem with it per se, but after years of manipulating
Helen and Jake, and her time with the fashion club, she never really worried
about money. One consequence was that she often forgot that her friends’
parents out here might not be as well off as the average Lawndale high crowd.</p>
<p>&quot;That only puts it off for a month,&quot; Marisa observed sourly.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, I know. But it at least gives you time to find the money.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess,&quot; Marisa admitted warily. &quot;It just seems like a lot
for books.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is Marisa, it is.&quot; Glancing down at her watch, Quinn notices
that it’s already ten after six. &quot;Hey, I’m meeting someone for dinner
in ten minutes or so. Hungry?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure. Just gimme a sec to check my mail and grab a coat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cool. I’ll knock on your door when I’m ready.&quot;</p>
<i>
<p>Ah, Marisa</i>, Quinn thought as she closed the door. <i>It would be good to
have a familiar face around during dinner, just in case.</i> Pulling out a
chair, Quinn sits down at her desk, tapping the touch pad on her laptop to rouse
the computer from its sleep. After a short moment, the soft whir of the cooling
fan permeates the room as Quinn launches her E-mail program.</p>
<p>&quot;Junk, Junk, Forward from Daria, read it later, random university
notices, Ooh, chain mail,&quot; Quinn reads aloud. &quot;Well, that was worth
it,&quot; Quinn observed in bemusement, minimizing her E-mail program. Grabbing
a small wallet containing a few dollars, a student ID, and a credit card, she
closes the top on her laptop, slips back into her shoes, and heads out to get
Marisa for dinner.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">#</p>
<p>&quot;There’s nothing like a meal at the dining hall to make you miss that
good old home cooking, eh Quinn?&quot; Amber asked in amusement. Picking at her
food, she looks across the table at Quinn. &quot;Somehow, I get the feeling that
salad isn’t supposed to be brown.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um, actually, the food here is better than my father’s cooking.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really?&quot; Amber asked, surprised. &quot;Is that possible?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don’t think the dining hall’s food has sent anyone to the
hospital,&quot; Quinn replied, staring down at her plate. &quot;Although the
jury may still be out on that one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, it’s not so bad Quinn,&quot; Marisa interjected. &quot;At least
it’s all you can eat.&quot;</p>
<i>
<p>Assuming that you like grease</i>, Quinn thought. <i>Sandi would be in hell
here. Too bad she’s not around,</i> Quinn mused, smiling slightly at her
private joke.</p>
<p>&quot;You mean all you can stomach?&quot; responded one of Amber’s friends
sarcastically.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, come on Dave, you know it’s not all THAT bad.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What, next you’re going to tell me that it grows on me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That would kind of defeat my argument, now wouldn’t it?&quot;</p>
<p>Quinn couldn’t help but be amused by Amber and Dave’s easy repartee about
something so trivial as the food. They’ve already been here a year. She’d
think it would get old by now.</p>
<p>&quot;And we just couldn’t have that, now could we?&quot; Dave quipped,
obviously teasing Amber. There was something about the familiarity between the
two that Quinn found … interesting. Back at Lawndale, things were so simple.
Boys were for dating, and girls were competition for said dates, simple as pie.
Not that she could make pie, but that was another matter. Here, however, things
were more difficult, confused.</p>
<p>&quot;You know me,&quot; Amber replied in a pouty tone. &quot;I’ve always
gotta be on top&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That’s not what I’ve heard…&quot; Dave responded in a suggestive
voice. Surprised, Quinn and Marisa exchange a look of uncertainty, neither one
terribly comfortable with this type of conversation.</p>
<p>&quot;As if you would know,&quot; Amber countered, taking it in stride.</p>
<p>&quot;Um, excuse me?&quot; Marisa said meekly, looking at Amber with a
questioning gaze. &quot;Doesn’t that bother you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Does what bother me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All his, um, innuendo and stuff?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh that? Not at all. He’s just trying to get a rise out of me.&quot;</p>
<i>
<p>Hmmm</i>, Quinn thought. <i>Should I or shouldn’t I?</i> &quot;Or are you
trying to get a rise out of him?&quot; she asked suggestively. <i>Oh God, she
thought, did I really just say that?</i></p>
<p>&quot;Hey!&quot; Amber shouted, momentarily surprised. Thinking for a second,
she laughs at herself as she turns to Quinn. &quot;Not bad Quinn, not bad at
all. You’ve got potential kid.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you always so nice to everyone?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only those who can hold their own with me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why Amber, you flatter me,&quot; Dave replied sweetly, flitting his
eyes at Amber in an absurd gesture.</p>
<p>&quot;Not you Dave, I’m just using you for homework.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As long as there’s no sex this time. There’s only so much a man can
take.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aww, did I tire you out?&quot; Amber asked in a teasing voice. Shaking
her head, she turns to Quinn and Marisa, speaking in a softer voice. &quot;This
is what you get for choosing a predominantly male field, I suppose.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So, you don’t like it?&quot; Marisa asked curiously.</p>
<p>&quot;I get to wrap men around my little finger. What’s not to like?&quot;</p>
<i>
<p>What indeed,</i> Quinn thought. &quot;And they don’t mind?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Naw. This twerp aside, it’s not as if I make them do much more than
get together to work on homework. Oh, and buy pizza. Pizza is good.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pizza?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Breakfast of Champions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pizza for Breakfast?&quot; Quinn responded, more surprised than
anything else.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; Amber responded, in a matter of fact manner. &quot;It’s
easier on the stomach than curry chicken.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ewwwww …&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Freshmen,&quot; Dave observed sardonically. &quot;So
closed-minded.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">#</p>
<p>In her room after dinner, Quinn sits on her bed, reading slowly through the
economics assignment. <i>I realize that this is a textbook</i>, Quinn thought as
she finished the introduction, <i>but do they have to make it this boring?</i>
Scanning the next chapter briefly, she closes the book, pondering for a moment
before deciding to check her E-mail again. <i>How did people ever procrastinate
before computers</i>, Quinn wondered as she sits down in front of her computer.</p>
<p>Opening her mailbox, Quinn checks for new mail, receiving none. Noticing that
Daria’s forward is still marked as unread, Quinn double-clicks on the message,
opening it in its own window.</p>

  <i>
  <p>Well, that ought to be good for at least a nasty response in the morning, </i>Quinn
  thought. <i>Not that Daria would really be offended by any of it, but she had
  a reputation to protect. And if anyone’s earned the right to tease their
  sister,</i> Quinn mused, <i>it’s definitely me.</i></p>
  <p>Standing up again, Quinn notices that it is only 8:30. <i>It’s amazing
  how much time is in a day when you aren't averaging two dates a night.</i>
  Reaching down, she grabs her chemistry book off the floor, reluctantly
  followed by her economics text and a five-subject notebook. Dropping a pen in
  her pocket, Quinn leaves, closing the door behind her.</p>
  <p ALIGN="CENTER">#</p>
  <p>Up a half-flight of stairs from Quinn’s room lay the study lounge for the
  floor. As with most everything, the name could be deceptive. The study lounge
  served as one of the primary social areas for a given suite in a dorm,
  providing a comfortable public area for students to study, read, or share a
  greasy pizza at three in the morning, cramming for a test.</p>
  <p>As Quinn entered, the décor still surprised her, although she had often
  sat in the lounge in the week before classes, getting to know her suitemates. <i>It’s
  just awful</i>, she thought, fully realizing that the university wasn’t
  about to replace perfectly functional furniture simply because it looked like
  a reject from a 70’s leisure suit.</p>
  <p>&quot;Hey Quinn!&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh, hey Justin,&quot; Quinn replied, somewhat surprised by his
  presence. Looking over at him, she pensively gazes at the dark-haired boy
  sitting next to Justin on the bench before hazarding a statement. &quot;You’re
  … Victor, right?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Can any of us really say who we are?&quot; Victor replied without
  looking up.</p>
  <p>&quot;You’ll have to excuse my roommate,&quot; Justin said, a chuckle in
  his voice. &quot;He always seems to get philosophical when he thinks he’s
  busy.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Cuts down on questions,&quot; Victor offered, not terribly fond of
  being described in the third person.</p>
  <p>&quot;But what if someone responds?&quot; Quinn asked.</p>
  <p>&quot;Then at least I get a good conversation out of the exchange.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Don’t mind him. He’s a pre-med, terminal case,&quot; Justin
  observed, a jocular note in his voice. &quot;I’m told that there’s no
  known cure for this disease, so we’ll just have to render supportive care
  and hope that we can bring him out of it on his own.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Funny Justin. Current acceptance rates for medical school have fallen
  below forty percent, which doesn’t even count all the people who gave up
  before they had the chance to apply. I have to work as hard as I can if I want
  to be sure to make it into medical school. You just don’t understand the
  pressure a pre-med is under.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Sure I do. I just don’t think it’s worth the trouble.&quot;
  Walking over to Quinn, he sits down next to her, casting a brief sideways
  glance at her books. &quot;Studying already? You’re almost as bad as
  Victor.&quot;</p>
  <p>Seemingly paying Justin little mind, Quinn reaches out, making a brief note
  in her notebook. Dropping the pen into her textbook to mark her place, she
  calmly turns to Justin and playfully hits him over the head with her notebook.
  &quot;Did you say something?&quot; Quinn asked coyly.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh, never mind,&quot; he replied, lifting the cover of Quinn’s open
  book to glance at the title. &quot;Chemistry? Isn’t it a bit early to be
  worrying about that?&quot;</p>
  <i>
  <p>There’s never enough time to sufficiently worry about chemistry,</i>
  Quinn thought. <i>All those formulas and interactions, it just never made that
  much sense to me.</i> &quot;Well, we can’t all be chemistry Olympians
  Justin.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Potential Olympian. I was one of twenty candidates, but I wasn’t
  one of the three selected to compete.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;So you’re only one of the twenty best in the nation, rather than
  one of the three best,&quot; Victor said sardonically, hazarding a glance up
  from his work. Smiling at Justin with an implied challenge on his face, Victor
  returned to his work before Justin could respond.</p>
  <p>&quot;Don’t you have work to do?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;And miss this wonderful lesson on geek flirtation?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I’m not …&quot; Justin mumbled, trying to find the perfect words
  as a gentle shade of pink covered his face. <i>It was really quite charming,</i>
  Quinn thought. She had plenty of experience with boys reaching for dates with
  her, due to her good looks and instant popularity. But Justin treated her more
  like a friend than a girl. It was something Quinn was ill accustomed to, but,
  like a drug, the more she received, the more she wanted.</p>
  <p>&quot;This isn’t geek flirtation, its geek friendliness,&quot; Quinn
  teased.</p>
  <p>&quot;Gee, thanks Quinn. I think…&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Don’t mention it.&quot; Looking over to where Justin had been
  sitting, Quinn notices that he doesn’t appear to have any books with him.
  &quot;Are you working on anything?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Nope. The power in our room went out, tripped a breaker or something.
  It takes a while for the damn thing to reset once it trips.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; Quinn remarked thoughtfully. &quot;I just wanted to get out
  of my room for a while,&quot; she admitted sheepishly.</p>
  <p>&quot;Stir crazy already?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Nope. Just felt like being around people.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;So you could read a chemistry text.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Misery loves company,&quot; Quinn said, lifting the chemistry book in
  a symbolic gesture.</p>
  <p>&quot;It can’t be that bad now,&quot; Justin reassured Quinn. Leaning
  over, Justin rests his chin on Quinn’s shoulder as he scans Quinn’s book.
  For her part, Quinn glances at Justin uncertainly. Part of her wanted to push
  him back, the ‘not until the fifth date’ reaction she had so vigorously
  cultivated in high school. But Justin was merely reading innocently, as far as
  Quinn could tell. <i>Besides, it feels rather nice,</i> she thought secretly.
  In the end, the situation resolved itself, as Justin sat back, shaking his
  head, a bemused smirk on his face.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh, stoichiometry. Yeah, that pretty much sucks. Sorry.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I thought you liked chemistry?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Chemistry, yes. This is more of applied math though, just balancing
  equations. The fun stuff comes later.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Fun stuff?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Yeah. There’s some really cool stuff that you can do. Here, let me
  see that book for a second.&quot; Opening to a chapter in the book, he sets
  the book on her lap, leaning over as he begins to explain to Quinn the finer
  points of chemistry.</p>
  <p ALIGN="CENTER">#</p>
  <p>Back in her room, Quinn removes her shoes, getting ready for bed. <i>Justin
  loves talking about chemistry,</i> she mused. Had someone suggested even this
  morning that she would find chemical equilibrium remotely interesting, she
  would have dismissed it out of hand. But he had so much enthusiasm that Quinn
  found herself genuinely interested at times, to her great surprise. Sliding
  her economics text and a notebook into her backpack, Quinn slips into a
  t-shirt, and had just taken off her pants when her computer emitted a telltale
  beep. I thought I turned that off, she thought, as she pulls on her shorts.
  After staring at the computer for a moment, she sits down, tapping gently to
  bring up the screen and the new E-mail.</p>

  <p>Quinn smirks as she finishes the message, pleased that Daria hadn’t been
  too offended at her previous E-mail. <i>This truly is an age of miracles</i>,
  she thought, <i>when even Daria can take a joke. </i>Putting her computer to
  sleep, she slides into her bed, laying her head back on the pillow. Staring up
  at her ceiling, she couldn’t help but feel some degree of satisfaction. <i>Not
  bad for the girl’s whose own mother &quot;couldn’t think about what went
  wrong there.&quot;</p>
  </i>
  <p>If Helen had known that she was hiding behind a car the whole time, she
  would have been devastated. Sighing, Quinn remembered it all too clearly. It
  had taken her a while to realize exactly what her mother had meant, but Quinn
  wasn’t a complete moron, even back then. Watching surreptitiously over the
  following months, she realized something. Her parents were proud of Daria, of
  her achievements. Granted her parents, Helen in particular, were concerned
  about Daria’s social development, her casual disdain for so much of the
  modern world. Even so, it was clear to Quinn that they were proud of Daria
  nonetheless.</p>
  <p>In contrast, Quinn had realized that she was being tolerated, handled. It
  wasn’t like they didn’t love her or anything, and probably didn’t even
  realize that they were doing it. But after so many years, their expectations
  for Quinn had fallen far below what she was capable of. Despite this, Quinn
  had almost convinced herself that she was just being paranoid, when she got
  her PSTAT scores back. That was a major turning point for Quinn, when she made
  a life-altering decision. I am pretty, I am popular, but I am not stupid. <i>Now
  to prove it</i>, she thought, drifting off to sleep.</p>
  <p>Waking the next morning, Quinn gets up, rubbing her eyes as she slowly
  stands. Groggily, she makes her way to the door, searching briefly before
  finding the light switch. Grimacing slightly as the room is bathed in a bright
  light, she walks over to the closet. After opening the door, Quinn stares into
  the closet in a moment of quiet consideration. Reaching in, she proceeds to
  remove a fluffy pink towel with</font><font SIZE="2"> ‘</font><font FACE="TypoUpright BT" SIZE="4">Quinn
  Morgendorffer</font><font SIZE="2">’ </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">embroidered
  along the top, a pair of blue jeans, and a deep maroon t-shirt. Raiding her
  dresser for underwear, a bra, and the toiletries kit given to her by her aunt
  Rita, she collects the entire ensemble into a neat pile, trudging off to the
  shower.</p>
  <p ALIGN="CENTER">#</p>
  <p>Later that morning, inside a comfortable classroom, a group of students are
  sitting around a large round table, chatting in a reserved fashion with each
  other. As Quinn enters, she scans the room, finding an empty seat between a
  heavyset young man and an African-American girl with bright red hair. Sitting
  down in her seat, she turns to the girl, studying her hair with a queer
  expression.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes, it’s dye,&quot; the girl offered brusquely.</p>
  <p>&quot;I kind of figured that,&quot; Quinn responded, looking down with an
  abashed expression on her face. &quot;The black roots kind of give it
  away.&quot; Pausing momentarily, Quinn collects her thoughts before
  proceeding. &quot;Do you like it that way?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot; Well, it’s kind of fun, and this way, if people look at me
  strangely, they can just pretend that it’s because of my hair.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Why else would they look at you strangely?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Hello? How many black students have you seen here?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh. I see,&quot; Quinn admitted. &quot;I guess I didn’t
  notice,&quot; she said, embarrassed.</p>
  <p>&quot;Why would you? It’s not like it’ll cause you any problems.&quot;</p>
  <i>
  <p>Oh boy</i>, Quinn thought. &quot;Well, you’ll always have the hair, won’t
  you?&quot;</p>
  <p>The girl looks at Quinn briefly before responding. &quot;Yeah, I guess you’re
  right. I’m Sam.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Sam?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Short for Samantha.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Ah, Ok. I’m Quinn,&quot; she offered, glad to be on less tenuous
  ground.</p>
  <p>&quot;So Quinn, are you into mythology?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well, sort of. It helped that this class happened to fit my schedule
  pretty well.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;You too? I was afraid that I would be the only semi-enthusiastic
  person here.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;We’re freshmen meeting at eight in the morning. I don’t think
  over-enthusiasm will be a major problem,&quot; Quinn observed, still a little
  bleary in the eyes.</p>
  <p>Sam begins to speak, but is interrupted as a twenty-something man in a pair
  of jeans and a button down shirt enters, removing a backpack from his shoulder
  to extract a notebook. Opening the notebook, he takes an official-looking list
  and stands up in front of the class. Briefly canvassing the class, he clears
  his throat, garnering the silence of most of the students in attendance.</p>
  <p>&quot;Class? If I could get your attention please? My name is Jeremy, and I’ve
  been assigned to teach this class. I need to go through the roster to make
  sure that everyone is here, so when your name is called, let me know that you’re
  here, OK?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Professor?&quot; a girl asked, raising her hand.</p>
  <p>&quot;Call me Jeremy. I’m a grad student, not a professor.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh. Can you sign my add/drop form?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I could, but it wouldn’t mean anything,&quot; he replied, somewhat
  disappointed at the answer he had to give. &quot;You’ll have to go down to
  the department office for that. They don’t permit grad students to sign
  official forms, other than tuition checks, that is.&quot;</p>
  <p>Scanning the class, Jeremy pauses for a few seconds, giving time for any
  additional questions. Receiving none, he begins calling student names from the
  roster.</p>
  <p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Making a final note, Jeremy places the class roster back on the desk,
  finished with the roll call. &quot;Ok, I should have everyone down now. Those
  of you who aren’t officially in the class need to contact the department to
  be added pretty soon. Let me know if there are any problems, and I’ll do
  what little I can to resolve them.&quot; Pausing, he extracts a nagalene
  bottle from his backpack, taking a small sip of water before continuing.</p>
  <p>&quot;Hopefully, y’all realize that this is a class on mythology. More
  specifically, we will be studying the traditional Greek and Roman mythology,
  with a limited coverage of derived works such as those of Homer and Virgil.
  But first, I’d like to pose a simple question to all of you. Why does
  mythology exist?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Because someone wrote down the legends of the time?&quot; the boy
  next to Quinn proposed.</p>
  <p>&quot;You’re missing the point,&quot; he replied gently. &quot;What was
  the motivation of the legends? Why go to all the trouble to create such an
  intricate and complex system, a system that was evidently part of public life
  if temples are any indication. What fundamental need did mythology
  fulfill?&quot;</p>
  <p>Back near the window, a conservative student speaks up in response.
  &quot;They were lacking a spiritual life, and were not yet prepared to accept
  the truth of the one true God,&quot; he stated with utter confidence.</p>
  <p>&quot;Prepared? In what way?&quot;</p>
  <p>Rising to the challenge, the student hesitates but a moment in responding.
  &quot;They were not ready to make the difficult leap and admit that there was
  but one God for all mankind.&quot;</p>
  <i>
  <p>Great</i>, Quinn thought, fearing the worst. <i>My second day of classes,
  and we’re already starting a holy war, like when Stacy decided that she didn’t
  like Sandi’s shoes …</p>
  </i>
  <p>Looking up in a conscious attempt to pay attention rather than let herself
  be distracted, Quinn was surprised. Not only did Jeremy seem entirely
  unconcerned at the situation, he actually seemed to enjoy it. As Jeremy turned
  his seat to face the student, Quinn leans forward, curious.</p>
  <p>&quot;So you feel that accepting the one God was simply too difficult for
  the ancient Greeks to accept. Is that it?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes. They could not conceive of anything as beautiful as our
  Lord.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;If you don’t mind me asking, why was that so difficult?&quot;
  Jeremy said innocently.</p>
  <p>Taken aback, the student gives him with a strange look as Quinn watches in
  fascination. &quot;Well, to realize that you’re wrong, and that there is but
  one God …&quot; he reiterated, much less confident than he had been earlier.</p>
  <p>&quot;You don’t understand the question,&quot; Jeremy interrupted.
  &quot;Historically, if we look at Christianity, it WAS difficult, but much of
  that difficulty was due to being persecuted, tortured, and killed for your
  beliefs. Looking at the beliefs themselves, the traditional Christian believed
  in a single God who loved all, a kind God who was vengeful only as necessary.
  In contrast, the pagan gods of Greek and Roman mythology were a convoluted
  lot, often working at cross-purposes against one another and causing trouble
  to many a mortal who happened to get in the way. So which is more difficult,
  believing that a loving God will watch over you, and reward you for the
  hardships you’ve endured for him, or believing that your gods work mainly
  for their own benefit, caring little for a mere mortal?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Um …&quot; the student stammered, uncomfortable with the recent
  turn of events. Quinn smirks as the student sits back in his seat, admitting
  defeat. As he does, Jeremy stands, trying to make a point to the whole class.</p>
  <p>&quot;Polytheism was not necessarily ‘easier’ than monotheistic
  beliefs, and treating them as such can affect your reading of classical
  mythology. But getting back to the first question, what was the purpose for
  mythology? What basic desire was satiated?&quot;</p>
  <p>Taking a chance, Quinn slowly raises her hand, nervous but determined.
  Jeremy looks to Quinn, glad to have elicited a response from the class.
  &quot;Yes, Quinn is it?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes, Quinn,&quot; she reiterated, buying an extra second or two.
  &quot;It seems that, like, a lot of the myths seem to, uh, explain how stuff
  works. The world, I mean.&quot; Pausing for a moment, Quinn gives a slight
  shake of her head, trying for a better explanation. &quot;If you look at
  mythology and all, there are a lot of stories about how the world works, like,
  um, Apollo as the sun, and that Atlas guy holding up the sky. So, um, was
  mythology a way to explain, like, how things work?&quot;</p>
  <p>Quinn looks slightly away as she finishes, trying to hide the fear that she
  had just made a fool of herself, made herself look stupid in front of her
  classmates. Thankfully, the fear was short-lived, as Jeremy’s face lit up in
  satisfaction.</p>
  <p>&quot;That’s an excellent observation Quinn. That is in fact one of the
  major purposes of mythology, to provide an explanation of the natural world
  around them. By providing an explanation, mythology helped people to
  understand their world, to be more comfortable with it, as it were. There is
  another major angle to mythology that y’all should be able to see. Any
  guesses?&quot;</p>
  <p>The class looks at him with uncertain expressions, unsure about what he’s
  looking for. Reaching down, a few students remove one of the textbooks,
  scanning the pages for a clue, when a soft voice is heard.</p>
  <p>&quot;Morals?&quot; a woman asks from the back of the class.</p>
  <p>&quot;How so?&quot; probed Jeremy, trying to extract more details from the
  student.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well, there’s a bunch of stuff about what to do and what not to do.
  Lots of heroes, like Jason and Theseus, but lots of anti-heroes, like Arachne
  and Narcissa. So, like, it seems to me that they were a way of teaching people
  how to behave…&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Very good! There’s just a little extra piece. In addition to saying
  ‘this is good, this is bad’, the myths also provided rewards and
  punishments. If you were really good, you could become a god, whereas if you
  were really bad, you would spend eternity in Tartarus as punishment. So myths
  were both a list of approved behavior and a threat/promise of
  punishment/rewards,&quot; Jeremy lectured enthusiastically. &quot;Of course,
  these myths were intimately entwined in the culture of the time,&quot; Jeremy
  notes, proceeding to start a class discussion on the subject.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&quot;So, today we’ve discussed the basic motivations for mythology, and
  how these factors interacted with the local culture to affect the myths
  themselves,&quot; Jeremy tells the class, wrapping up for the day.
  &quot;Before next class, I would like you to read the first three sections in
  our first book, which covers the basic creation myths found in Greek culture.
  Next class, we’ll be discussing these myths, with an eye towards comparing
  them to the creation myths of other cultures. Are there any questions? No?
  Then that’s the class for today.&quot;</p>
  <p>As Jeremy closes up his notebook, Quinn does the same, placing it back into
  her backpack and preparing to leave the class. Standing up, she picks up her
  backpack, turning to Sam as she does.</p>
  <p>&quot;See you next class?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Yeah, I’ll be here. God, this is too early for me.&quot;</p>
  <p>Sam walks out the door. As Quinn moves to follow her, Jeremy addresses her.
  &quot;Quinn? Do you have a minute?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Um, yeah, sure,&quot; Quinn answered, trying to figure out why she
  had been singled out. <i>Did I do that badly,</i> she wondered?</p>
  <p>&quot;Did you have a class on mythology in high school?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Um, not really. My sister had a lot of books though. Why?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well, you really seemed to understand what was going on in our
  discussions today. I just thought you’d like to know.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; Quinn uttered, genuinely surprised. &quot;Um, thanks.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;You’re welcome. See you Thursday?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Yeah, I’ll be here,&quot; Quinn said uncertainly. Turning to head
  out of the classroom, a smile spreads over Quinn’s face.</p>
  <p ALIGN="CENTER">#</p>
  <p>Beneath the bright blue sky, Quinn sits down in the shade of a large oak
  tree, looking out over the quad as the sunlight splays across the green grass.
  Removing the shrink-wrapped sandwich and diet soda she had picked up at the
  dining hall, she leans back against the tree beginning her lunch.</p>
  <p>Taking a bite of her sandwich, she removes her economics book, reading
  slowly in the gentle fall air. <i>How is it that they can ruin a simple turkey
  sandwich,</i> she wondered. Quinn was far from a gourmet cook, but even she
  could handle a few slices of meat between two pieces of bread. Quinn smiled in
  amusement at the fact that the same university that was directing her
  education somehow directed these people who couldn’t make a decent sandwich.</p>
  <p>&quot;Quinn?&quot; Marisa asked, walking up behind Quinn, interrupting her
  train of thought. &quot;Is that you?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;None other. What are you doing here?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;It’s just too nice a day to spend inside. I mean look around!
  Everything’s so green and warm. You’ve gotta enjoy weather like this while
  it lasts.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Spoken like a true Canadian.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Whatever. Do you mind if I join you?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Sure, there’s plenty of grass to go around.&quot;</p>
  <p>As Marisa sits down and takes out her lunch, Quinn returns to her book,
  trying once again to finish the chapter. Sighing, she closes the book, turning
  to Marisa. &quot;Somehow, I don’t think that the most beautiful setting on
  earth would be enough to make this book interesting. Do the professors, like,
  get to choose which books they use?&quot;</p>
  <p>Hesitating a moment to swallow her food, Marisa looks at Quinn in a
  thoughtful stare. &quot;I guess so,&quot; she offered tentatively, &quot;I
  wonder how they choose…&quot; Thinking a moment, Marisa reaches out with her
  hand. &quot;Could I see the book for a minute?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Sure,&quot; Quinn replied, handing over the book. <i>How tempting it
  is just to tell her to keep it.</i> The thought of wading through that entire
  text was not something that she was particularly looking forward to. Looking
  over at Marisa, Quinn watched as she studied the first page or two of the
  book. <i>Why would she be interested in the copyright information,</i> Quinn
  wondered. The answer came quickly, as Marisa handed over the book pointing to
  a single line:</p>
</font>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="margin-left: 0"><font face="Fixedsys">Assistant Editor : Dr. Peter
    Warre</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p>Well, that’s certainly interesting,</font></i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
Quinn thought. <i>It definitely explains why he likes the book.</i> Pondering it
a moment, Quinn makes another important realization. <i>It probably isn’t the
best idea to make my feelings about the book known to the professor. He might
take it personally, after all.</p>
</i>
<p>&quot;I’ll bet he gets paid for using that book,&quot; Marisa observed as
she opened a bottle of iced tea.</p>
<p>&quot;What,&quot; Quinn asked in surprise, &quot;You think they bribed
him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not exactly. But I’ll bet he gets a royalty for each book sold. So,
like, by making the whole class buy his book, he probably earns some
money.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don’t think he’d do that just for the royalties, do you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Probably not. But if you were the editor for a text, don’t you think
you’d want to use it for your class?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not this book,&quot; Quinn scoffed.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, to each their own, I suppose.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, whatever. I’m just not looking forward to reading through this
whole book for the class. It’s just utterly tedious.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why don’t you get another book, a better one?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; Quinn asked, not understanding.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, just because you’re required to buy that book doesn’t mean
that you couldn’t get another book, does it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know, that’s a really good idea. Thanks.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">#</p>
<p>After a nice lunch on the quad, trading writing seminar stories with Marisa,
Quinn sets off to track down her final class of the day. Luckily for her, labs
didn’t start for another week or so, giving Quinn and the rest of the freshmen
a chance to get their life in order. The language department was housed in
Jameson Hall, a quaint building in a secluded edge of campus, it’s walls of
brick and mortar covered in a thick mat of ivy. Out near the forest preserve, it
was easily Quinn’s longest walk of the day, the farthest from her dorm room by
far.</p>
<p>Entering a small classroom intended for no more than forty students, Quinn
takes a seat, waiting for class to start. <i>Spanish,</i> she thought.
University regulations required a foreign language, and most of the people she
had seen in arranging her schedule recommended Spanish as a good choice. It was
one of the more common languages in the United States, and she was assured that
it looked good on a resume, although that was a concern for after graduation,
years from now.</p>
<p>At the front of the classroom, a tall Hispanic woman with long black hair
enters, standing at the front of the classroom. Checking her watch, she begins
the class almost exactly at the appointed hour.</p>
<p>&quot;Buenos tardes, estudiantes. Me llamo Senora Martinez, y daré clases de
español para Ustedes.&quot;</p>
<i>
<p>Ok</i>, Quinn thought sourly, <i>if I knew what you’re saying, I wouldn’t
need this class.</p>
</i>
<p>&quot;Quisas quieren saber si puedo hablar en ingles. Es verdad, Yo hablo
ingles cuando es necessario, pero espero que después de uno o dos meses,
podríamos hablar sólamente in español.&quot;</p>
<p>Realizing the confused look emanating from the classroom, the professor
addresses the class in English this time. &quot;I’m Professor Martinez, and I’ll
be teaching Spanish 101 this year. It is my hope that after the first month or
two, we can speak only in Spanish. It is my opinion that the best way to learn
Spanish is to speak Spanish, and that is exactly what we will do.&quot;</p>
<p>Sighing, Quinn opens her notebook and pulls a pen out of her pocket,
preparing for the long class ahead of her.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">#</p>
<p>Back at the dorm, Quinn enters her room, carrying another large bag of books,
a bag that she unceremoniously dumps at the foot of her bed, next the others.
Gently setting her backpack down, she looks out the window for a moment, going
over her assignments in her head. <i>Three chapters of economics, two of
chemistry, a few myths for a discussion session, and the first section of her
Spanish text, including writing out all of the problems included therein. It was
a lot of work.</p>
</i>
<p>Heading over to her closet, Quinn opens the door, staring inside. To the
right, there are a plethora of shirts, jeans, and dresses, arranged carefully by
color. To the right is a single, solitary outfit hanging loosely off of a
hanger. As Quinn turns the outfit slightly, it comes clearly into view, a small
pink t-shirt with a butterfly across the top and a pair of bell-bottom pants.
Quinn looks for a moment, closing the closet door with a thunk. As she moves
towards her bed, someone knocks at the door.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey Quinn! It’s Marisa!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, hey. What’s up?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A bunch of us are going out for pizza. Wanna join us?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; Quinn responded. &quot;Just let me grab my wallet.&quot;</p>
<p>Picking up her wallet and keys from her desk, Quinn looks back at her room in
satisfaction. <i>I can do this,</i> she thought. <i>I will survive college.</i>
Shutting off the light, she heads out the door and out for dinner with her new
friends.</p>
