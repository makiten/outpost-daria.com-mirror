<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>"<EM>Quinn goes Lawndale High's Reunion. There she 
is frustrated that people's perception there is that she hasn't changed much. 
Also, there we get to see various other characters and their 
predicaments."</EM></FONT></DIV>
<DIV><EM><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT></EM>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Note: This is fictional all character's new 
backgrounds and situations are purely made up.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Quinn morgendorffer enters Lawndale High's gym 
sighing deeply. How long has it been since she stepped through these doors? To 
her it felt like a millenium though the sign above the gym declares it a decade. 
Upon entering the much remembered gym, two familiar faces run up to greet her: 
Stacy and Tiffany.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>"Stacy! Tiffany! How <STRONG>are</STRONG> you 
guys?" Quinn said excitingly.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Stacy who was dressed in a flower dress, smiled, 
"Just excellent! My waitressing job has reached it's biggest peak; I made 
twenty-five bucks in tips last night! Can you believe it?</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Quinn made an attempt at a cheerful laugh but came 
up short.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Quinn "Well that's...great Stacy. How about you 
Tiffany, what have you been up to these last ten years?</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Tiffany, dressed in khakis and a white shirt, 
shrugged, "I've been good. My real-estate business has been lagging but I'm sure 
It'll pick up. How about you Quinn, what have you been up to?</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>"Well, after collage, I got an intern job at 
<EM>Vogue</EM> and am now the senior editor." Quinn stared down at her feet 
uncomfortably.&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Stacy smiled, "I bet you'll be vice president there 
for sure."</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Quinn looked at Stacy awkwardly, "Stacy, <EM>Vogue 
</EM>doesn't have a vice president, and if they did, I wouldn't want it. I'm 
happy where I am."</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Tiffany and Stacy laughed.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>"What?" asked Quinn.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Stacy wiped away a tear, smearing her mascara. "Oh 
Quinn, you're such a joker."</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Quinn crossed her arms in contempt.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Meanwhile, across the room, Daria and Jane come in 
from the&nbsp;back.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>"I still can't believe I'm here. Why did you want 
come here Jane Lane?" Asked Daria.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Jane grinned, "Oh&nbsp;C'mon, Morgendorffer, this 
is&nbsp;our chance to see how pathetic our counter parts have become in the time 
of our absence."</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Daria looked at her, giving her the&nbsp;"not 
convinced" look.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Jane threw up her hands, "Ok, ok. hours d' eavours 
and cocktail drinks."</FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Daria sighed. She then spotted Mr. DeMartino. She 
strolled up to him. Mr. DeMartino&nbsp;is very different&nbsp;now, well 
slightly. He is now bald, in a wheelchair, and has a nurse 
assistant.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>"Well&nbsp;you certainly look better." She said. 
</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>"Daria! My best student." said Mr.&nbsp;D, "After 
my triple <STRONG>bypass surgery!&nbsp;</STRONG>I was given Nelly, 
here,</FONT>&nbsp;<FONT face=Arial size=2>to make sure I receive&nbsp;<STRONG>no 
more stress!</STRONG> So, how are you?</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Just when she was about to answer, an all to 
familiar person came up behind her.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin who is working as a valet, 
was dressed in a&nbsp;purple&nbsp;vest, his hair slicked back, and his usual 
goofy chompers being canopied by a ratty mustache. "Hey&nbsp;Daria! How's it 
going? Whoa!&nbsp;Who's the old fossil?" </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>"Kevin, if you were a bit more perceptive, it'd 
probably be the first sign of the apocolpsy." Mr. D scowled.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Kevin beamed. "Hey Mr. D! I didn't recognize you, 
being old and all. Hey, are you still peeved that I totaled your 
van?</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Mr. D's eye bugged out fully and quivered, 
"<STRONG>What!!</STRONG>"</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Kevin took a step back, "Heh, I guess I forgot to 
tell you huh?"</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Quinn was about to scream too. Between Stacy and 
Kim reminding her of everything the three of them did in extreme detail, and the 
fact she still hadn't seen Sandi, she was going crazy.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Stacy had just returned with two punch 
cups.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>"Stacy," asked Quinn, "</FONT>&nbsp;<FONT 
face=Arial size=2>Where is Sandi? I thought she was going to be here with you 
guys."</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Stacy dropped her head and shuddered. "Oh Quinn, 
you haven't heard have you."</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Quinn shook her head.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Stacy put down her cup and took Quinn's hands in 
hers, "Sandi died two years ago. It was some sort of strange allergic reaction 
to Maybelline eyeliner."</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Quinn looked down at the floor 
again.&nbsp;It&nbsp;made her sad to realize how out of touch she had been with 
her dearest friends. Yet, with the exception of Sandi, no one really changed out 
here. Everyone has remained the same as she left them, well almost the 
same.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Stacy tried to brighten up the conversation, "So 
Quinn, what guys are you dating?"</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Quinn looked up as if remembering she was there. 
"Oh, uh,&nbsp;there is this one cute photographer I'm seeing, I think it 
actually maybe the real thing."</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Stacy giggled again, "You're so funny. No, really 
what guys are you dating?"</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Quinn removed her hands from Stacy's. "What do you 
mean "what guys" I told you I'm in a serious one with one." </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Stacy just grinned away. 
"Fibber."</FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Quinn sighed in agony and went off to the punch 
section.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>There she met Jane. "Hey Red, long time no see. 
How's New York for you. Daria says you're quite the dictator at the 
office."</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Quinn smiled, finally a question with some 
intelligence. "Oh, busy. My staff has absolutely no feel for fashion and it's 
leaving me bitter. How's Boston?"</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Jane put down her half eaten prawn and sighed, 
"Never better. Though&nbsp;Jessie has been struggling with his dot.com company, 
but, I'm glad I have another Morgendorffer to help with the 
burden."</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>"Well you do better than me sometimes." Said Daria 
coming up behind Quinn.&nbsp; The two sisters hugged eachother warmly. "How are 
Trent and the kids,&nbsp;Daria?"</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Daria smiled, "They're fine. Trent apologizes for 
not coming. He said he didn't want to face his "ghosts"&nbsp;here."</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>"Well," said Jane, "That's the Lane's for you. 
Always use superstition to get out of a situation."&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Just then Kevin comes running followed in pursuit 
by Mr. DeMartino in his wheel chair.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>"Gangway!"Yelled Kevin.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>"Kevin! I'm going to break your legs!"</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Everyone turned away as they passed. Brittany came 
in as the commotion died. She looked around. "What all the hubbub? Was that 
Kevy?&nbsp;Oh, Hey Daria, Hey Quinn, Hey Jane! What's Up?" Said Brittany in her 
froot loopy like manner.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Each person told of their past and their current 
present.&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Brittany smiled, "Gee that is sooo interesting. 
Quinn you amaze me the most. I thought you were going to be in Mary Kay or 
something. You sure like fashion; you haven't changed a bit."</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Quinn glared at Brittany venomously. "You know 
Brittany, I'm curios, what have you been up to?" </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Brittany beamed, much like Kevin, "Well I met this 
nice old guy, who said if I married him I would be secured for life."&nbsp; 
Daria, Jane, and Quinn looked at eachother. Daria asked, "Brittany, do you know 
what a gold-digger is?"</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Brittany looked perplexed,"I don't know, I don't 
really like shovels very much."</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The reunion had just ended and Quinn was 
glad.&nbsp;After constantly trying to convince other people outside of Jane and 
Daria, no one seemed to accept the fact that she wasn't the same 
anymore.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Then came Mr. O'Neil. He spotted the group (Daria, 
Quinn, and Jane.) Leaving the building. He came bounding up.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>"Daria! Quinn! Jane! It's so good to see you! What 
have the three of you been up to all these years?</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>"Well, I'm a freelance writer and mother of three." 
said Daria.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>"I'm still a starving artist of the masses." said 
Jane.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Mr. O'Neil looked bummed. "Oh dear."</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>"What?" asked Daria.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>"Daria, I'm sorry, I'm just kind 
of&nbsp;disappointed that you didn't become&nbsp;a teacher. But alas, what have 
you been up to Quinn?"</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Quinn attempted a smile, "I've become the senior 
editor of&nbsp;<EM>Vogue</EM> magazine."</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Mr. O'Neil eyes were wide with surprise, "Wow, 
that's unusual."</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>"How do you mean?" Asked Quinn.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>"Well, don't take this the wrong way&nbsp;Quinn, 
but I assumed you were going to be a cosmetics salesmen." Mr. O'Neil said 
nervously.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>"What!" Exclaimed Quinn.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>"You seemed to have a <EM>natch</EM> for that sort 
of thing, if I remember." said Mr. O'Neil, tying to gain back some 
ground.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Quinn erupted, "Why can't anyone here be either 
happy or excepting of my life! You Mr. O'Neil, you've always tried to think of 
the better of students and this is how you classify me?"</FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Mr. O'Neil looked confused, 
"Well...Yeah."</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Quinn bared her teeth and kicked Mr. O'Neil right 
between the legs.&nbsp; He shuddered as he fell.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Quinn turned back to Jane and Daria.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>"You'll never know how long&nbsp;I wanted to do 
that." said Quinn.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>"Ah Damn, Daria I guess you&nbsp;can cross that off 
the list since your sister beat you to it." said Jane nudging Daria on 
the&nbsp;shoulder.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Daria looked down at Mr. O'Neil and said "It was 
great to see you again."</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>As they were going to their veichles, Stacy ran up 
to Quinn.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>"Quinn! What happened back there with Mr. O'Neil? 
This isn't like you at all."</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Quinn smiled at her exasperated friend and said, 
"Yeah, it isn't."</FONT>&nbsp;&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
