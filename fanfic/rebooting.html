REBOOTING
<P>
a <I>Daria</I> fic by Wyvern337
<P>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
She had long since gotten this down to a routine.  In fact by
now it was approaching the status of a ritual, Daria thought as
she sat cross-legged on the floor of her room amid the supplies
she'd gathered.  First, remove the laces.  Then, this being summer,
check for salt stain in its favorite hiding place, along the sides
of the tongue.  Sure enough, there were a few traces of whitish
encrustation, though less of it than she'd been expecting.  Not
to worry, it'd be dealt with soon enough.  Next came the shoe
brush, the knocking of accumulated dust and dirt -- the loose
stuff, anyway -- off the uppers.  When she'd accomplished all
she reasonably could with the larger brush, Daria set it down
and switched to the toothbrush -- Quinn's, though to be sure it
was an old one she'd scavenged after her younger sister had replaced
it.  First, dip it into the cup of water she always kept handy
for this particular chore, then work it along the edge between
sole and upper.  Follow it with a dry soft cloth, to get rid of
the excess moisture.  Then it was time for the saddle soap --
or was it? Daria noticed a couple of small new scars on the toe
of her right boot, where the black outer coating had been gouged-through,
exposing the much lighter color of the natural leather beneath.
 There was a simple enough cure for that, of course, one she'd
discovered long ago.  Daria uncapped the black marking pen she'd
included among her cleaning supplies and rubbed the tip back and
forth across the small abrasions.  Soon enough, the only way their
existence could be discerned was a couple of spots  that were
slightly-rougher than the surrounding leather.
<P>
Okay, <I>now</I> the saddlesoap.  Daria opened the small flat
tin, moistened the sponge, and then worked it back and forth across
the surface of the goop in the container.  Starting with the salt
stain (the scourge of leather everywhere!) that she'd uncovered,
she set to working-up a good lather over the surface of the boot's
upper, paying special attention to working it into the seams,
the edge where the sole was attached, and the natural creases
that had worn over time into the heavy cowhide.  As Daria wiped-off
the excess lather and set the first boot aside, she decided that
this was as much treatment as they'd be getting this time.  They
were long past polishing -- the creases and wrinkles were <I>deep,
</I>the assorted scuffs and dings too numerous. When dampness
wasn't a major concern -- and given the time of year it wasn't
-- she preferred to be sparing with the mink oil as well, having
found that regular, frequent saddlesoapings really provided all
the protection and preservation her boots needed.
<P>
And now for the left one.  It was in much the same shape as her
right boot, no real need to deviate from routine:  remove laces...inspect
tongue...big brush...little brush...saddlesoap, paying special
attention to the...
<P>
Daria stopped cold.  Just beneath and ahead of the lower left
corner of the strip of leather that reinforced the area around
the boot's eyelets, a terrible, unthinkable, inevitable thing
had occurred.  There, surrounded by an especially heavy crease
where bits of leather had begun, despite regular and attentive
maintenance, to flake away, a hole had formed.  Gently, Daria
pressed against the spot from the inside.  The pale skin of her
fingertip showed clearly.  The hole went all the way through the
leather.  Breakout.  The end had officially begun.
<P>
The boots might -- probably would -- last a while longer, but
they were definitely on their last season.  After being reheeled
twice and resoled once, they were finally manifesting a sign of
unavoidable wear that simply <I>couldn't</I> be fixed.
<P>
Of course, the simple wearing-out of an item of clothing was the
<I>least</I> of what this was about.  Sitting there staring at
the damage, Daria thought back over the history involved.  Ever
since she'd first gotten them when her family still lived in Highland,
she'd worn <I>that one</I> pair of boots, almost every waking
moment.  She'd been wearing them her first day at Lawndale High,
when Ms. Manson had given she and Quinn that ridiculous psychological
test.  They'd been on her feet when she walked into the self-esteem
class her sarcastic responses to the test had landed her in. 
When she'd met Jane.  At the party Brittany had invited her to
in thanks for teaching her one-point perspective in art class.
 In the woods, when her family had gone temporarily (more-) insane
from eating psychotropic berries and she'd had to summon help
on her mother's cell phone.  They'd been the only item from her
normal outfit she'd retained when she changed her look for the
trip to (or at least towards) Alternapalooza.  Likewise when she'd
wrested back her &quot;identity&quot; from Quinn by imitating
her sister's style.  Daria had worn her boots under the horribly
ill-fitted bridesmaid's dress she'd been forced into for her cousin's
wedding, and with her Nutty Nutty Nutty World uniform when her
mother had dragooned her into getting a job -- <I>any</I> job
-- as some kind of object lesson in how miserable the working
world was (as near as Daria had ever been able to guess, anyway).
 She'd been wearing them when her family had -- briefly -- been
burned out of their home.  During that shockingly-unexpected first
kiss with Tom, through her resulting estrangement from Jane --
and so much more, both good and bad.  She'd even worn them under
her gown at graduation, despite both Helen's and Quinn's attempts
to get her into something more formal for the occasion.
<P>
&quot;That's funny&quot;, said Daria when she felt she could trust
her voice again, &quot;I thought <I>I</I> was supposed to be the
one who was fatally wounded when my life flashed before my eyes.&quot;
<P>
Mechanically, Daria finished maintenancing her boots, then sat
for awhile just gazing at them and remembering.  Mostly remembering.
 She found herself, to her mild embarrassment (at least no one
was around to see!) having to remove her glasses and blot at her
eyes with her shirttail before standing up and proceeding to the
next order of business:  getting ready for bed. 
<P>
Daria didn't retain any clear memories of her dreams that night,
just vague unpleasant impressions revolving around themes of loss,
endings and unwanted change.
<P>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
&quot;But Mu-ooom! It's going to be <I>senior year</I>! My big
chance to make a <I>statement</I>! As vice president of the Fashion
Club it's my <I>responsibility </I>to make as good and lasting
an impression as possible.&quot;
<P>
Daria looked down at her cereal, stirring it occasionally and
even more occasionally taking a bite as she listened to Quinn
wheedling and cajoling their mother at the breakfast table.  It
was as good a way as any to distract herself.  She even found
herself admiring  -- however abstractly -- her sister's technique.
 First bring up the &quot;senior year is special&quot; angle,
then play up her extracurricular activities and the relevance
of what she was asking for to them.
<P>
&quot;Well, I can see where there'd be a larger selection, and
even how it relates to your position in the Fashion Club&quot;,
Helen admitted somewhat grudgingly, &quot;but after all that's
just an extracurricular activity.&quot;
<P>
&quot;And <I>you've</I> said yourself how important having a record
of extracurricular activities is when applying to college,&quot;
Quinn countered, a slight triumphant note discernible in her voice.
 &quot;I'm going to want to make as good an impression as I can
when I apply to Pepper Hill this year!&quot;
<P>
And three makes the hat trick, thought Daria.  Work in the alleged
practical benefits deriving from what she wanted to do.  This
last statement even offered the added advantage of implicitly
heading off objections on the grounds of...
<P>
&quot;<I>Not</I> until you bring up your gra--&quot; Helen caught
herself before finishing the sentence, though Daria was mildly
surprised she'd even begun it aloud.  Force of habit, undoubtedly,
from all those years when Quinn's grades <I>had</I> been a problem.
 That had changed pretty close to completely over the past schoolyear,
to the extent that it was looking like Quinn was actually likely
to be accepted at the college of her choice.  Nice try, mom, but
she even has your usual trump card sewn up.  Wouldn't even be
<I>too</I> surprised to see her wind up in your profession someday.
 Say what else you would about her sister, thought Daria, one
thing she was <I>very</I> good at was manipulating situations
-- and people -- to get what she wanted.
<P>
And what she wanted today was to be given unrestricted credit
card access and be turned loose on the Mall of the Millennium
to shop for her back-to-school wardrobe.  Dream big, sis, thought
Daria, smirking inwardly.  Helen, of course, was resistant, seemingly
almost more over the principle of the thing than for any practical
reasons.  Alas, Quinn just wasn't leaving her much in the way
of grounds for objection, and it was looking like it would be
only a matter of time before she caved in.  
<P>
To Daria's mild surprise, Helen actually seemed to've come up
with yet another counterargument, or at least she looked as if
she was about to say something else in response, but whatever
it was would never be known because Daria chose that moment to
take a deep breath, steel herself (was she actually going to <I>say</I>
this?), and enter the conversation:
<P>
&quot;Well, you know, I'm going to be heading off for college
in a few months and, uh...&quot; Daria faltered briefly, colored
slightly, then pushed on ahead:  &quot;I'm going to be needing
a few items, myself.&quot;
<P>
For a moment Helen just sat there, wordless, stunned-to-silence
by her elder daughter suddenly jumping in, apparently on the side
of her younger sibling's insatiable desire for ever newer and
more-fashionable clothes, of all things! Then, suddenly, her whole
attitude seemed to change as she relented.  &quot;Well, that <I>is</I>
true of course, Daria.  You'll be going into a whole new environment,
all new people...this would be an <I>excellent </I>opportunity
for you to reinvent yourself, change your image.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Well, I don't know whether...&quot;
<P>
&quot;You can't just keep on the way you've always been, Daria,&quot;
Helen continued, warming to the subject.  &quot;We've discussed
the matter before, and I'd think some of your more recent experiences
would've shown you that, as well.  It doesn't have to be anything
drastic, of course -- and I wouldn't expect that from you anyway.
 You might <I>try</I> taking a minor piece of advice or two from
your sister, though -- I think you <I>both</I> have things you
could learn from each other.  Jake?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Mwhuhuh?&quot; came the witty reply as Daria's father found
his morning paper drawn away from his face and himself drawn into
the conversation.
<P>
&quot;The girls are going to the Mall of the Millennium today,&quot;
declared Helen, &quot;They'll need the credit cards and your Lexus.&quot;
<P>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
&quot;No.  Makeovers.  Quinn.  And  that <I>isn't</I> negotiable.&quot;
<P>
Daria sat behind the wheel of the Lexus, her sister in the passenger
seat, as she guided the car through surprisingly-light freeway
traffic.  They'd been on the road for slightly over an hour and
she'd at first been pleasantly-surprised when Quinn had actually
tried to make conversation with her, rather than either remaining
silent or going on about what she planned to buy herself.  Daria's
mood had gradually soured, however, as Quinn's talk had consisted
mainly of trying to get her to completely change her look -- with
Quinn handling the planning and execution, of course.  Daria had
refused offers of makeovers from her sister before, with sufficient
sarcasm, vehemence, or whatever else the situation seemed to call
for at the time, that such offers had long since stopped coming.
She guessed that Quinn had felt emboldened by what their mother
had said that morning at breakfast.  Or maybe it was something
to do with the fact that Daria was actually planning on shopping
-- not merely entering, but actually <I>shopping </I>-- at places
frequented by the <I>attractive </I>and <I>popular. </I> Perhaps,
then, there was hope for her after all?
<P>
&quot;Okay, then, we could just get your hair done a <I>little
</I>differently... I mean it <I>could</I> be bouncier -- not like
<I>mine, </I>of course....&quot;
<P>
&quot;Unless I dyed it.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Ugh, <I>Daria,</I>&quot; Quinn started, then she paused
as a thought struck her. &quot;Of course, it wouldn't have to
be some completely different color... or even all your hair. Have
I ever told you how much prettier I think you'd look with some
auburn highlights? I mean, it'd be, like, really subtle, since
you're so close to that color anyway. If we did that, and changed
that...that hair<I>don't</I> of yours to something at least <I>tolerably</I>
fashionable...&quot;
<P>
At first Daria bristled at her sister's description of the way
she wore her hair...but then she started to actually envision
some of the changes.  She'd always chosen things like her clothing
and hairstyle to reflect her philosophy that it was what was inside
that counted, and that looks were a poor thing to judge by.  She'd
much rather people notice her for -- and be impressed by,naturally
-- her mind.  She still believed all that, of course, and yet....now
there was someone in her life who was attracted to all the things
about her she liked most about herself.  Two of them, in fact,
but there was one in particular she found herself, ashamed as
she would've been to've admitted it out loud, actually <I>liking</I>
the idea of making herself more physically attractive to.  The
corners of Daria's mouth turned up involuntarily as she thought
of how Tom might react to a change in her look.
<P>
Quinn, noticing her sister's slightly-dreamy expression, moved
in for the kill. &quot;C'mon, Daria, I know just the place.  And
after that we can see about getting you some new clothes, stuff
that fits you better, that makes you <I>look </I>good.  And above
all get rid of those...those <I>things</I> you wear instead of
shoes.&quot;
<P>
Quinn noticed the sudden change of expression on Daria's face
and abruptly stopped talking, almost frightened.
<P>
Staring straight ahead at the road, Daria heaved a deep, very
tired-sounding sigh and said &quot;actually, Quinn, that's about
the only thing I intend to replace, let alone change, about my
look just now.  This pair of boots is wearing out and I'm going
to need something new for when I go off to college.&quot;
<P>
&quot;But <I>Daria</I>,&quot; began Quinn.
<P>
&quot;I'm going to the picnic, and I'm taking...an aardvark.&quot;
<P>
Quinn folded her arms across her chest and glared out the passenger
side window.
<P>
After a few more minutes she spoke again:  &quot;Could you at
least let me give you some advice on choosing new shoes? I really
think I could help you.&quot;
<P>
After continuing to stare ahead a few more moments, Daria sighed
again and said &quot;I'll undoubtedly regret this, but okay.&quot;
<P>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
Daria wondered absently if this was the same shuttle train she'd
been sick in on her first visit to the Mall of the Millennium.
 She'd parked the Lexus in one of the outer ring lots -- even
though traffic had been light on the way over, by the time they'd
actually reached the mall it had been the nearest thing she'd
been able to find.  At least she wasn't feeling nauseous this
time, Daria reflected, though Quinn might've been more...amusing....to
be ill in front of than Jane.
<P>
Soon they pulled up at the mall's main entrance, and Daria heard
her sister emit the same enraptured sigh her classmates had chorused
at that point during her first visit to the mall.  It was a sound
that made Daria frown reflexively -- the mall was just <I>not</I>
her favorite place.  Still, she supposed it had it's uses...
<P>
The two sisters walked through the main entrance side by side,
past the welcome desk and the goodbye desk that flanked the entryway,
avoiding the worker costumed as a giant bumblebee handing out
flyers as if it were one of the real, stinging variety.  Daria
cringed inwardly at the throngs of people...now she remembered
why she didn't like the mall.  Best, getting it over with <I>quickly</I>
out of the question, to at least not let it drag on any more interminably
than it had to.  &quot;So, Quinn, this's mainly your expedition
-- where to first?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Oh, I thought Gish's first,&quot; her sister replied.  &quot;It's
the closest of the places I want to go, and besides they're having
a one-day sale!&quot;
<P>
&quot;Good timing, sis.&quot;
<P>
&quot;I'm kind of an expert.&quot;
<P>
Daria followed her sister off to the right, into section...some
drab shade of green.  <I>You'd think they'd be able to come up
with more attractive colors to designate their different areas,</I>
she thought.  While watching Quinn shop didn't hold much by way
of entertainment value for her, Daria had been tasked by Helen
with making sure her sister didn't overspend...much as she'd've
preferred to hole up in Books By the Ton and let her sister max
out the credit cards.  The day dragged on as Quinn worked her
way through the mall's department stores,employing her sister
as pack mule.  First Gish's with its one-day sale, then up a level
to area B, section blue and Spackle &amp; Spackle.  Once Quinn
was through with that store, they proceeded up to level 5 area
D section orange, which contained both W.H. Trogg, the mall's
smallest and most-exclusive department store, and the Fashion
Clubhouse.
<P>
As they crossed the mall's central area, past the escalators and
the roller coaster, Daria caught the scent of sundry, mostly deep-fried,
delights wafting down from the food courts next level up.  A rumble
from her stomach reminded her that she hadn't eaten anything since
breakfast, and Daria managed to talk Quinn into briefly skipping
over their next destination and going up to the top level of the
mall for lunch. 
<P>
As they stepped off the escalator to Level 6 Area H Section Green
(a somewhat less-unappetizing shade of green than she'd seen before),
Daria was momentarily blinded by the sun shining down through
the glazed ceiling of the mall and as she reflexively looked down,
she was startled, in these surroundings, to see that the glass
had prismed the sunlight and spread a rainbow strip of light along
the floor of the mall.  It stood out brilliantly against the light-colored
tiles.  The crowd of shoppers walked back and forth right through
it, oblivious, but Daria stood there for a long moment just looking
at it.
<P>
<I>How could someone walk right through something like that without
noticing? </I>She wondered, <I>let alone hundreds of someones?</I>
<P>
 Quinn immediately headed to Tofu Fighters (they had the lowest-fat
menu), while Daria found herself torn between Fries and Things
and The Lard Yard.  She finally decided on the former -- slightly
less-disgusting name -- and got herself a large serving of cheese
fries.  The two sisters sat opposite each other at one of the
food court tables as Daria tore into her lunch while Quinn picked
fastidiously at hers.
<P>
&quot;I'm pretty sure it's not poisoned any worse than mine,&quot;
said Daria.
<P>
&quot;Ha,&quot; replied Quinn.  &quot;I'm sure it wouldn't be
important to <I>you</I>, but among the attractive and popular
you can never be <I>too</I> thin.&quot;
<P>
&quot;At least until ketosis sets in,&quot; retorted her sister.
<P>
&quot;And what's <I>that</I> supposed to be?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Oh, just when a starving person's vital organs start digesting
themselves in an effort to keep them alive.&quot;
<P>
&quot;<I>Ewwwwwwww.</I>&quot;
<P>
&quot;Makes your breath stink real bad, too.&quot;
<P>
&quot;<I>EWWWWWWWWWW!</I>&quot;
<P>
Daria formed one of her wry, ironic little smiles as she noticed
her sister suddenly begin attacking her tofu-whathaveyou with
noticeably more enthusiasm.
<P>
-----------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
After lunch, Daria followed Quinn through her shopping at W.H.
Trogg and (<I>ugh</I>) the Fashion Clubhouse, and finally Quinn
said &quot;well, I know <I>I</I> need some new shoes, and I guess
it's about time I helped you out with your...situation.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Thanks <I>so</I> much, sis,&quot; came the muffled reply
from beneath a mound of shopping bags.
<P>
&quot;Oh, don't mention it.  I know <I>just</I> the place.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Just the place&quot; turned out to be a horrifyingly boutiquey
shoestore called Felling Feety, located (a testament to Quinn's
strategic thinking) in the same sector as W.H. Trogg and the Fashion
Clubhouse.
<P>
&quot;Looks like the circus came to town and forgot their shoes
when they left,&quot;  Daria couldn't help commenting as they
entered the place.
<P>
Quinn stopped, planted her hands on her hips, and looked her sister
up and down appraisingly. &quot;Now, let's see.  What kind of
shoes to improve that...outfit....of yours.  Hmmmm...I know! Over
this way!&quot;
<P>
And so, Daria began trying on new shoes.  First, the color:  &quot;Black,
of course,&quot; said Quinn, &quot;I mean, even <I>you</I> wouldn't
try brown shoes with that black skirt!&quot;
<P>
Then came the styles:  first wedge heel, square toed Mary Janes.
 &quot;They're surprisingly comfortable,&quot; insisted Quinn.
 Daria found she couldn't agree:  for one thing, the shoes were
just too light on her feet -- they made her feel...well, almost
<I>naked</I>.  She missed the weight of her boots, the way they
covered most of her calves, and the Mary Janes constantly felt
as if they were about to come right off her feet.  Quinn next
offered her platform waffle Mary Janes with square toes.
<P>
&quot;<I>Platform?</I>&quot; replied Daria, arms folded across
her chest.
<P>
&quot;Uhhh, maybe not.&quot;
<P>
Quinn next got her sister to try on Oxfords.  &quot;They're a
little more like...<I>boots,</I>&quot; she said, managing to force
herself to say the word, &quot;but they're not hopelessly unfashionable.&quot;
<P>
To be sure, they at least didn't feel like they were about to
fall off, but as she walked around the shoe store in them Daria
found there were still things she missed.  They were still too
light, didn't cover any of her lower legs, and she missed the
ankle support her boots provided.
<P>
&quot;I don't know, Quinn,&quot; she said uncertainly.
<P>
And so it continued, trying on different styles of shoe at Quinn's
recommendation, always finding at least one of the same few things
wrong about them.  After awhile, Quinn's patience began to thin.
 &quot;Daria,&quot; she said at last, &quot;why don't I let you
work on picking some things you like out yourself, then maybe
I can give you sort of a fashion veto? or, like, advice on which
ones suit you best?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Okay, Quinn,&quot; agreed Daria, feeling somewhat relieved.
<P>
&quot;Just one rule -- <I>anything </I>but Converse,&quot; called
Quinn over her shoulder as she headed off to another section of
the store.
<P>
Daria quickly found herself unimpressed with the selection.  Picking
up a 20 hole black sidezipper laceup she examined the waffle soles.
 The... <I>platform</I> waffle soles, with ridiculously high heels.
 &quot;Who.  Would even.  Bother?&quot; she wondered aloud.  <I>This</I>
was fashionable? it wasn't providing her with much reason to revise
her opinions on fashion.
<P>
Daria walked around the display, looking at various boots and
finding various reasons to reject them, until she reached the
other side.  And saw them.  And for a long moment just stood there,
wishing she could disbelieve her eyes.  They were a pair of 10
hole Doc Martens, relatively ordinary <I>except that....</I>
<P>
They were horrible.
<P>
They were evil.
<P>
They were deeply, <I>deeply</I> wrong.
<P>
They were...<I>pink.</I>
<P>
An awful, bright, bubblegum pink with an eye-hurtingly contrasting
bright blue interior.  Daria reached out and picked up the one
on display, mostly just to convince herself she wasn't hallucinating.
 Sadly, she only confirmed she wasn't.  They were real all right.
<P>
&quot;Not even if the alternative were a lifetime of going barefoot,&quot;
she said to no one in particular, &quot;Though they might be just
the thing for...&quot;
<P>
&quot;<I>Ugh!</I> not <I>even!&quot;</I> came the disgusted voice
behind her.
<P>
&quot;Oh, hi Quinn,&quot; said Daria, &quot;I was just thinking
of you for some reason.&quot;
<P>
&quot;I just thought I'd check on how you were doing,&quot; her
sister answered.  &quot;<I>Tell</I> me you're not thinking of
getting <I>those.&quot;</I>
<P>
&quot;As a matter of fact, no.  I was just thinking <I>you</I>
might like them.&quot;
<P>
&quot;You've <I>got</I> to be kidding,&quot; said Quinn.  Then
she remembered something Sandi had once told her about klunky-looking
shoes making the rest of her look even cuter by comparison.  &quot;On
the other hand...hmmm....I don't know...&quot;
<P>
&quot;C'mon, sis,&quot; said Daria, a teasing lilt in her voice,
&quot;They're <I>you.</I>&quot;
<P>
&quot;God, Daria!&quot; said Quinn exasperatedly.  &quot;Clothes
and shoes are all about getting people to <I>like</I> you.  What's
<I>that</I> got to do with <I>being</I> you? -- Oooh, intermediate
markdowns!&quot;  And with that remark, Quinn dashed off to another
section of the store, leaving her sister staring after her, speechless.
<P>
<I>She doesn't even realize what she just said, does she? </I>thought
Daria, <I>and what's worse, I'm not sure I have an answer.</I>
<P>
Daria didn't buy any shoes, or boots, that afternoon.
<P>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
&quot;Daria, what's <I>wrong?</I>&quot; asked Quinn.  &quot;I
mean, ever since back in the shoestore at the mall you've been,
like, weird, even for you.&quot;
<P>
Daria cocked an eyebrow at that remark, but said nothing.  Quinn,
not noticing, continued, &quot;all like, quiet and, <I>breedy</I>
and...<I>stuff</I>.  I can tell there's something bothering you,
but I don't know <I>what.&quot;</I>
<P>
Her older sister didn't answer, simply continuing to stare ahead
as she drove them back towards Lawndale.  The trunk and most of
the backseat were full of Quinn's new fall wardrobe, including
shoes.  Daria had, after all, not bought anything while at the
mall, which had Quinn somewhat worried about how she was going
to justify some of her purchases to Helen when they got home.
 There was also something else that was worrying her -- her sister's
weird mood, which had begun back at the mall and continued without
letup during the drive home so far.  It was obvious even to Quinn
that something was bothering Daria, and she was beginning to get
concerned.
<P>
Quinn finally resigned herself to the silence and just stared
out the window at the scenery.  She actually jumped in her seat,
she was so startled when Daria said, &quot;Quinn, can I ask you
something?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Uhm, sure, I guess.?.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Talk to me about Dave.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Huh?&quot;
<P>
&quot;You know, Dave Sorenson, the guy who tutored you last summer.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Well, uh, what about him? I mean it's not like we've seen
each other or talked or anything since the end of last summer.&quot;
<P>
&quot;You had a crush on him, remember?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Well, I wouldn't call it a <I>crush</I> exactly...&quot;
<P>
&quot;Whatever.  What attracted you to him in the first place?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Well, uuhhh....&quot;  For a moment Quinn was truly and
completely at a loss.  Then she began to remember.  &quot;For
starters, he was kind of cute.  I mean, not like <I>football player
cute</I> or anything, but...you know....&quot;
<P>
Daria didn't immediately reply, simply waited for her sister to
continue.
<P>
&quot;But I guess mostly it was that we could, you know, <I>talk</I>
about stuff.  I mean, we'd joke about stuff and he'd say stuff
that was really interesting, and he seemed to be interested in
stuff that <I>I </I>said, and he was <I>really</I> smart, like
you --&quot;
<P>
This drew another raised eyebrow from Daria, but if Quinn noticed
she didn't give any indication, continuing on with her description.
 &quot;And he knew lots of neat stuff and we had fun talking about
it and --&quot;
<P>
&quot;So in other words he liked you for <I>being</I> you,&quot;
Daria interrupted.
<P>
&quot;Only he <I>didn't</I> like me, <I>did he?&quot; </I>said
Quinn with a vehemence that caught her sister completely by surprise.
 &quot;Not in any way that <I>mattered.</I>  'Sure Quinn, I like
you.  You're a 'good kid' -- whatever <I>that's</I> supposed to
mean -- 'now excuse me while I get on with my life and forget
about you.  Drop me a line so we can pretend that's not what's
happening.'  So much for having somebody like you for being yourself!
God, Daria, you <I>do</I> read too much -- try getting out and
actually <I>living</I> some if you're getting ideas like <I>that!</I>&quot;
<P>
Daria didn't say anything the rest of the drive home.
<P>
When they pulled up in front of their house and parked, Daria
got out first and walked around to Quinn's side of the car just
as her sister was standing up.
<P>
&quot;Daria, what's...&quot; Quinn began, but she never got a
chance to finish.  All she saw was a green blur, all she had time
to get out was a startled little yelp as Daria surged across the
remaining distance between them...
<P>
And grabbed her younger sister in a crushingly-tight hug.
<P>
Seemingly as soon as she realized what she was doing, Daria let
go of Quinn and, without any word spoken, walked quickly to the
door and inside.  Quinn just stared after her.  As Daria walked
into the living room, only one thought occupied both sisters minds:
 
<P>
<I>What the hell brought THAT on?</I>
<P>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
Weeks passed.  Despite the regular maintenance rituals, the final
decay of Daria's boots not only continued but accelerated.  The
hole she'd first discovered enlarged, widened, started to become
a split.  Thirteen days after she'd first noticed the original
damage, she noticed a spot on her right boot beginning to break
out, in the deep crease that'd formed just behind the toe.  Now
both were on their way out.  Daria sat on her bed, trying unsuccessfully
to read.  Her gaze just kept being drawn to the increasingly obvious
-- and severe -- damage to her footgear.  Why was she waiting?
she knew they were going to have to be replaced, and soon.  
<P>
Of course, she already knew the answer.  Just as the rush of emotions
she'd felt when she first discovered the damage had been about
far more than the loss of a pair of boots, this was about more
than simply replacing an item of her wardrobe.  Though Daria knew
she'd always have  the memories associated with her old pair of
boots, it still felt like she'd be throwing away...well....a <I>part</I>
of herself.  Disposing of a large part of who she was.  And why
did all that need disposing of, anyway? If she replaced them with
something completely different, what did that say about who she'd
been, and how it fit with who she...wanted to be?..was becoming
whether she wanted to or not?
<P>
&quot;If Quinn had any idea I was brooding over what kind of statement
my <I>shoes</I> made I'd never live it down -- <I>or</I> get her
to stop offering advice on the subject.&quot;
<P>
Tiring at last of continuing to stare at her boots while wallowing
in angst, Daria got up off her bed, picked up the day pack she'd
carried her books in all through high school, and began putting
things into it.  After she was done, she hooked one strap over
her shoulder and left her room, switching off the light on her
way out.
<P>
Downstairs, she saw Jake busying himself in the kitchen.  &quot;No
dinner for me tonight, Dad,&quot; she called as she walked past.
<P>
&quot;Oh? why's that, kiddo?&quot;
<P>
&quot;I'm going to Jane's.  I'll probably be staying over.&quot;
<P>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
&quot;The vet recommended a change in diet -- but nothing like
this!  Housepet eating disorders, next on Sick, Sad World!&quot;
<P>
Daria picked up the remote and hit the mute button as the program
went to commercial, then pushed herself farther back on the bed
she was sitting on the edge of.  She ended up reclining with her
weight resting on her elbows, her feet projecting over the edge
of the bed.  This had the unintended effect of giving Jane, who
was sitting next to her, an excellent view of Daria's boots --
and the shape they were in.
<P>
&quot;Nice incipient pair of sandals you've got going there, Morgendorffer,&quot;
said Jane, her perspective not affording her a view of the sudden
darkening of her friend's expression.
<P>
&quot;You know, <I>Lane</I>, I didn't lose my first name when
I started dating your ex,&quot; said Daria sharply.
<P>
&quot;Huh?&quot;, Jane replied, startled by the vehemence in her
friend's voice.  She turned, saw the look on Daria's face... &quot;uhhm,
have I perhaps managed to touch a raw nerve here?&quot;
<P>
Daria sighed, looked down, and said, &quot;I feel like I've been
<I>all</I> raw nerve lately.  Sorry.  It's really not about you,
at least not directly.&quot;
<P>
Jane had known her best friend long enough to recognize when there
was something gnawing at her, but even she wasn't prepared for
what she heard next as, without looking up, her long reddish-brown
hair obscuring her face, Daria asked, &quot;Jane, why do you like
me?&quot;
<P>
Jane didn't literally bite her tongue, but she gained a new insight
into that figure of speech as she just managed to prevent the
words 'I don't know' from exiting her mouth.  Of course she knew,
but it wasn't something she'd given conscious deliberate thought.
<P>
<I>How the hell do you frame an answer to that raw a question?
</I>Thought Jane.
<P>
<I>Real damn carefully, if it's just been asked by one of the
people you care about most in the world.</I>
<P>
For a long moment Jane didn't answer, just gazed at her friend
as she tried to think of what to say.  Suddenly, Daria said &quot;show's
back on,&quot; and hit the mute-button on the remote again before
Jane could say anything more.
<P>
They watched and listened to the Sick Sad World reporter introducing
 the story, then to the yipping, pedigreed subject of the next
story.  &quot;She knows she's a winner...&quot; Daria began reciting.
 Jane chuckled softly in reply.
<P>
The rest of that night's TV viewing went pretty much as usual,
just providing color commentary on the programming and similar
light banter.  Once they were bedded down and the lights were
out, the conversation again turned more serious, but in a somewhat
different direction than before.  &quot;You know, it's down to
only a couple more months before we both go off to college,&quot;
said Daria from the bed.
<P>
&quot;Yeah, to different schools,&quot; agreed Jane from her sleeping
bag on the floor, a hint of sadness creeping into her voice.
<P>
&quot;Hundreds of miles apart,&quot; Daria continued.
<P>
&quot;Of course, there's always winter and spring breaks,&quot;
Jane offered.
<P>
&quot;Unless I decide to spend spring break in Daytona Beach.&quot;
<P>
This brought a guffaw from Jane, who then added, &quot;And, of
course, we've got summers off.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Assuming neither of us ends up doing a summer internship
of some kind.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Damn.&quot;
<P>
There was a pause, then Daria spoke again.  &quot;It <I>feels</I>
like we're never going to see each other again, doesn't it?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Yeah,&quot; agreed Jane glumly, &quot;and we haven't even
gotten to what happens <I>after</I> we graduate from college.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Damn.&quot;
<P>
The two friends were silent for a long time after that.  Finally,
Jane said &quot;I'm really going to miss you, Daria.&quot;
<P>
&quot;I'm really going to miss you, too Jane.  We've really had
something...&quot;
<P>
&quot;Special?&quot;
<P>
&quot;That'd be a start.  Had and <I>been.</I>  It's like, I keep
trying to picture life where our only contact with each other
is through things like phone calls and email, and it just doesn't
register.  I can't picture it.  It's just too big a difference
from what I'm used to.  And....&quot; Daria hesitated.  This wasn't
an easy admission for her, even to Jane, even though she knew
her friend probably realized what was coming next.  &quot;It scares
me, Jane, more than anything has in awhile.&quot;
<P>
And then Jane, reckless, outgoing, risk-taking Jane Lane, heard
her own voice catch, and shake, as she said, &quot;It scares me
too, Daria.  Scares the hell out of me.  And...I can't picture
it, either.&quot;
<P>
Neither girl said anything else that night, but sleep was a long
time coming to either of them.
<P>
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
&quot;Writing <I>again</I>, Morgend -- err, <I>Daria</I>? Jeeze,
you're not careful, you might wind up becoming a success or something.&quot;
<P>
This drew a raised eyebrow from Daria, but no verbal reply as
she continued writing in the composition book open in her lap.
 She was sitting up in bed -- Jane's -- wearing her usual tee
shirt and shorts nighttime ensemble, as her friend zipped open
the sleeping bag she'd spent the night in and spread it over the
armchair to air.
<P>
&quot;<I>What,</I> exactly, are you writing that's so important
at this early hour?&quot; Jane finally asked.
<P>
There were many possible answers, of course, starting with sarcastic
inquiries as to what sort of schedule Jane's muse kept, but she
just wasn't in the mood.  Instead, she went with the direct, honest
answer:  &quot;It's my dream journal.&quot;
<P>
&quot;No kidding?&quot; asked Jane, an eyebrow arching curiously,
finding herself edging towards the bed despite herself.  &quot;You
can actually <I>remember</I> that stuff, I mean on a regular basis?&quot;
<P>
&quot;I can now,&quot; said Daria, frowning slightly and tipping
the notebook upwards, away from curious eyes.  &quot;I've trained
myself to.&quot;
<P>
Catching her friends incredulous -- or at least skeptical -- expression,
she continued:  &quot;At first no, I didn't remember any more
than most people do.  The trick turned out to be writing something
-- <I>anything</I> -- as soon as I wake up in the morning.  Even
if it's just the fact that I didn't remember any of my dreams.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Funny thing for a writer to figure out,&quot; said Jane.
<P>
&quot;That and to keep at it,&quot; continued Daria.  &quot;I
didn't start to notice any improvement in my recall 'til I'd been
at it a couple of months.&quot;
<P>
&quot;So how long have you been at this, then?&quot; asked Jane.
<P>
&quot;Do I have to answer that?&quot;
<P>
&quot;That long, huh?&quot;
<P>
Daria said nothing, though she did give one of her rare, slight
smiles as she finished what she was writing and closed the notebook.
 She stood up, stretched, turned to Jane and said &quot;Okay,
so which one of us gets cleaned up -- hey! <I>personal!&quot;</I>
<P>
Jane had picked Daria's dream journal up off the bed.  Opening
it to a blank page near the end, she pretended to read aloud:
 &quot;Arms raised in a vee, and the dead lay in pools of maroon
below.  Hmmmm, wonder what aspect of the psyche of Daria Morgendorffer
<I>that</I> might symbolize.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Undoubtedly my disdain for public speaking,&quot; replied
Daria.  &quot;Have you read the next entry?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Uhhh...<I>next</I> entry?&quot; asked Jane, not quite sure
where this was going.
<P>
&quot;The one that ends '...and bury your body in this dress.'&quot;
<P>
With a mock-frightened squeak, Jane snapped the notebook shut
and tossed it onto the bed.  &quot;So, amiga, what daring and
adventuresome activities were you planning for today?&quot;
<P>
&quot;I don't know,&quot; admitted Daria.
<P>
Jane's gaze fell on her friend's deteriorating footgear, lying
there on the floor of her room.  &quot;Weelll....&quot; she began,
&quot;unlike the two of us as a shopping trip to the mall would
be...&quot;
<P>
Daria rolled her eyes, but Jane pressed ahead:  &quot;hey, Cranberry
Commons might not be the most momentous place for your next pair
of boots to've originated, but that <I>is</I> where I got mine.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Well, it's not like I have my mom's credit cards with me...&quot;
began Daria.
<P>
&quot;What about that Montana Cabin Fund of yours?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Well, it'd make a pretty sizable dent, but,&quot; Daria
sighed, then concluded &quot;I <I>do</I> need to replace this
pair, and pretty soon.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Okay, then,&quot; said Jane.  &quot;First we hit your place,
then it's off to the mall.&quot;
<P>
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
Cashman's.  Not Daria's favorite place in the world, or even at
Lawndale's own Cranberry Commons Mall.  She found herself having
to admit, though -- and it may well have been her own disdain
for the place that'd prevented her learning this before -- that
the shoe department had a surprisingly extensive selection of
boots.  Though there was nothing there exactly like what she had
(hardly surprising, considering what they were), Daria had to
admit that some of the Doc Martens looked...intriguing...  Thankfully
there was no sign of the pink horrors she'd seen at the Mall of
the Millennium, though some of what she saw seemed almost as extreme.
 Not for Daria, alas, were the purple Docs, or the 24 hole leopardskin-print
ones.  Her eyes fell on one pair, though, that <I>did</I> catch
her attention:  charcoal-gray, 20 hole, except for the fact that
they were a bit shorter (slightly-shorter, in fact, than the pair
she was wearing herself) they were almost exactly like Jane's...
<P>
&quot;Excuse me,&quot; said Daria to a nearby sales clerk, &quot;do
you have these in....&quot; she paused for a moment, trying to
remember what the English equivalent of her shoe size was.
<P>
One thing Daria had to admit:  it had taken a fair amount of breaking-in
--not to mention a few blisters and abrasions -- before her old
pair of boots had been this comfortable.  They were lighter on
her feet than the old pair, but not in the flimsy-seeming way
of any of the things Quinn had tried to get her into.  Ankle support
was good, they covered...enough of her calves to feel right in
that respect.  Daria walked from one end of the shoe department
to the other, tried shifting her weight around in the boots she
was wearing, finally stopped in front of a full length mirror
to inspect her appearance.  Jane stepped into view next to her,
and Daria was struck by a certain...similarity of appearance.
 Her eyes went back and forth from Jane's boots to the ones she
was wearing.  Except for height, they were almost identical. 
Daria continued to stare as the sight sent her mind off on a tangent.
 Suddenly she frowned, then bent down and began to unlace the
Docs.  &quot;Lunch break before I decide,&quot; she explained
to Jane.
<P>
Daria and Jane sat across from each other at one of the plastic
tables in the mall's food court.  &quot;So, Daria,&quot; asked
Jane, &quot;planning on trading up in terms of footwear?&quot;
<P>
&quot;What's that supposed to mean?&quot; asked Daria suspiciously.
<P>
&quot;Uh, nothing really,&quot; Jane replied, somewhat taken aback.
 &quot;Just wondering what you thought of that last pair you tried
on.  You seemed to like them...&quot;
<P>
&quot;Well, yeah, I like them, I guess...&quot; began Daria a
bit hesitantly.
<P>
&quot;<I>But,</I>&quot; continued Jane for her.
<P>
&quot;I'm not sure, exactly,&quot; said Daria.  &quot;I like them,
but....&quot; she trailed off, then took a deep breath and continued:
 &quot;they just remind me an awful lot of yours.  It's like,
if I change my look in that regard, am I just imitating you? there's
a lot about you I admire, Jane, and sometimes I feel like I <I>should</I>
be more like you, but what does that imply about who I was before?
that it was all a mistake, in need of correction? that everything
I was, was just a phase I needed to grow out of?&quot;
<P>
&quot;<I>Daria, </I>they're just a pair of <I>boots!</I> you know,
something you put on your feet to protect them from sharp rocks
and to kick people with?&quot; replied Jane, startled and even
a little appalled at her friend's speech.
<P>
&quot;Yeah, I guess, whatever,&quot; mumbled Daria, staring down
at the tabletop.
<P>
For a long moment Jane just looked at Daria, not quite sure how
to respond to her friend's latest angst-fit.  Obviously it tied
into her question from the previous night, but she still wasn't
quite sure exactly what she was getting at, nor how to pursue
the subject.  Probably best, at least for now, to change it, then.
<P>
&quot;So, Daria, you feel like staying over this Saturday night?
Getting down to our last days together and all...&quot;
<P>
&quot;Sorry, Jane,&quot; said Daria, &quot;but Tom and I have
a da- have plans for that evening.&quot;
<P>
Jane stopped for a moment, surprised at how much the remark had
stung.  By now she was as over the &quot;Tom Thing&quot; as she
was likely to get, of course, and though there was still the occasional
small pang of jealousy at seeing the two of them together what
really bothered her was how she often felt like a third wheel
when around them, and how alone she felt most of the rest of the
time.  Where were all of <I>her</I> friends? where was <I>her</I>
support system? the truth was that, except for Trent, outside
of Daria she really didn't <I>have</I> one.  Jane remembered all
the times, in all the ways, Daria had been a jealous, possessive
friend, slowing Jane down and getting in her way when she'd tried,
and wanted to try, new things.
<P>
Thing was, though, that since Daria and Tom had become an item,
Jane had gotten a taste -- taste, hell:  her fill and <I>then
</I>some -- of how Daria must've felt those times she'd gotten
jealous and possessive.  Dammit, they <I>weren't </I>going to
see each other again, for a longer time than they'd been apart
since they first became friends, and it was going to happen after
only a few more weeks!  Suddenly, irrationally, and she <I>knew</I>
how unfairly, Jane felt real anger welling-up within her.  How
<I>dare</I> Daria deny her time together, for <I>any </I>reason,
when they had so little of it left? How <I>dare</I> she? Why,
without her, what would Daria have? She wouldn't even--
<P>
&quot;You know, Daria, if it weren't for me you wouldn't even
<I>have </I>a boyfriend to hang out with instead of me.&quot;
<P>
&quot;We've been over that before,&quot; replied Daria, &quot;and
your point is?&quot;
<P>
&quot;<I>And</I>,&quot; Jane continued, &quot;if it weren't for
<I>me </I>reaching out to <I>you</I> way back in that self-esteem
workshop, you wouldn't even have <I>me.</I>  I mean, if you want
to spend this coming Saturday with Tom that's fine, I can see
that, but considering that it's really <I>not </I>like you're
going to be making a whole lot of new friends once you're away
at college I'd've <I>thought</I> you'd've wanted to spend a little
more time with the one person --&quot;
<P>
&quot;Excuse me?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Okay, one of <I>two</I> people you've met who'll put up
with you.&quot;
<P>
&quot;<I>Excuse me?&quot;</I>
<P>
&quot;Oh, come <I>on,</I> Daria,&quot; continued Jane, &quot;you
know how high-maintenance you are!
<P>
&quot;<I>WHAT?!&quot;</I>
<P>
&quot;Daria, you've built up such a high wall around you it could
well be <I>another</I> sixteen years before you let anyone else
through.  And when you do they'd better be someone who can take
a lot of abuse! I mean, the things I've put up with from you...&quot;
Jane continued.
<P>
&quot;So, let me see if I've got this straight,&quot; said Daria,
managing with effort to keep her voice level.  &quot;You're doing
me a big, unilateral favor by being my friend, and you don't think
I'm going to find anyone else who'll do something so selfless
for me again?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Daria, face it: you'll never make friends easily or well,
and you're just not good at properly maintaining friendships you've
got.  I mean, to your way of thinking...&quot;
<P>
Daria bolted upright.  &quot;So now <I>you're</I> the expert on
how <I>I</I> think?!&quot; she said angrily, her face reddening.
 Then suddenly, without another word, she turned around and walked
off.
<P>
Jane sat there and watched Daria go, too stunned -- whether at
Daria for walking out on her or herself for attacking her friend
like that she couldn't say -- to go after her.
<P>
&quot;<I>Nice</I> one, Lane,&quot; she said to the empty chair
opposite her.  She continued to stare bleakly across the table
for quite awhile.
<P>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
&quot;Well, so far I'd say it's one of your best stories yet,&quot;
said Tom as he read the document displayed on the screen of Daria's
computer.  &quot;I especially like the way you can tell something's
eating-away at the author's soul.&quot;
<P>
&quot;What?&quot; asked Daria a little worriedly, from where she
was lying on the bed, spread-eagled on her back, lifting her head
from where it'd been dangling off the end.  She was rather proud
of her latest story, and didn't want her current mood seeping
into it.  &quot;Uh, how can you -- I mean, what makes you think
that?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Well, said Tom, turning to look over his shoulder at Daria,
&quot;for one thing there's the fact that you've only written
about two lines since the last time you had me read it.  Might
I possibly detect a hint of some ulterior motive in your asking
me over before this weekend?&quot;
<P>
Daria sat up, turning as she did so that she ended up sitting
perched on the edge of her bed.  &quot;Well, uh,&quot; she began,
staring down at her disintegrating boots, &quot;it's kindof about
our relationdateshipthing.&quot;
<P>
Tom swiveled the chair around so that he was facing his girlfriend.
 &quot;We've been over this before, I <I>thought</I>:  we decided
we'd give the long distance thing a try, and if it doesn't work
out, it doesn't work out.  If you find somebody new while you're
away at college, I'll...get over it, and if <I>I</I> meet someone
new while we're apart, I'll sleep in a chainmail jockstrap for
the next year.&quot;
<P>
&quot;It's not that,&quot; said Daria, continuing to address the
floor, &quot;it's that, well, Jane and I had a fight earlier today.&quot;
<P>
&quot;I thought this was about <I>us</I>?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Just bear with me.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Fair enough.&quot;
<P>
&quot;We had a fight, and I'm not even sure what it was about.
 I'm not even sure whether she meant to say what she did, or meant
it the way it came across.  I, uh, kindof got up and left before
things cold get resolved, or explained.&quot;
<P>
&quot;<I>You</I> got disgusted and walked out on <I>her?</I> Isn't
that kindof unusual for you two?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Thanks, Tom.  That helps.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Uuh, open mouth, insert foot? I'm sorry Daria, I --&quot;
<P>
&quot;Well, really I think that touches on what my problem with
the whole thing is,&quot; said Daria, cutting Tom off.  &quot;Lately
I've been thinking a lot -- and none-too-highly -- of myself and
how I relate to people.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Well, <I>we</I> seem to relate pretty well,&quot; Tom opined.
<P>
&quot;When we're not fighting,&quot; countered Daria.  &quot;And
almost invariably they're fights <I>I</I> picked.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Uhm...&quot;
<P>
&quot;For about the past year, its seemed as if every time I turn
around I catch myself behaving badly -- <I>worse</I> than badly,
really:  more like inexcusably, and then getting my nose rubbed
in how horrible I've been being.  Things didn't used to be like
that.  It's like --&quot;
<P>
&quot;Like you're growing up?&quot; asked Tom.
<P>
Daria heaved a deep, frustrated sigh.  &quot;Sure, if you consider
'growing up' to consist of life hitting you with an unrelenting
flurry of petty little traumas and then whatever's left of you
when the dust settles being declared 'matured'.  And I guess that's
a large part of what's bothering me:  what <I>will </I>be left
of me? <I>any</I> of what was there before?&quot;
<P>
&quot;I suppose this would be a bad time for 'people grow and
change' platitudes.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Yes, Tom, I'm afraid it's more one of those 'shut up and
keep listening' moments,&quot; replied Daria, managing a brief
smile as she did.  &quot;Of <I>course</I> people grow and change;
I'm <I>not </I>the person I was when my family first moved to
Lawndale, and I really wouldn't <I>want</I> to be.  But the way
I see it, there's a <I>big</I> difference between that and wanting
to simply <I> dispose </I> of the 'old me' and start over.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Who said you had to do anything like that?&quot; asked Tom
confusedly.
<P>
&quot;I keep telling myself that I'm not composed solely of my
fears, insecurities, and assorted shortcomings, and that arbitrarily
changing my look isn't going to get rid of them, either, but then
I look at how many mistakes I've made, especially over the past
year or so -- even relative to other people my age -- and I get
the impression that to a large extent I <I>am</I> going to have
to start over in order to get it right, and that everybody else
has a better idea than I do of how that should be done.  Has my
whole life-so-far just been a blind alley, developmentally speaking?
What if I've gotten it so completely wrong I'm going to have to
drop both who I am and what I <I>thought</I> I wanted to become?
I don't know whether I find <I>that</I> possibility more frightening
or discouraging.&quot;
<P>
&quot;But you're going away to college,&quot; countered Tom.
<P>
&quot;What's <I>that</I> got to do with anything?&quot; responded
Daria, confused and irritated.
<P>
&quot;Isn't that at least <I>part</I> of what college's <I>supposed</I>
to be about?&quot; said Tom.  &quot;I mean, even if you <I>do</I>
eventually have to buckle down and conform, isn't college, in
part, <I>supposed </I>to be kindof a last fling in terms of putting
off having to deal wit that kind of thing? I mean, why does all
that <I>have </I>to be decided <I>now?</I>&quot;
<P>
&quot;But what about <I>after</I> college?&quot; asked Daria.
 &quot;After four or, if I change my mind about wanting to be
a professional student, six or even eight years of college, I
wind up just coming back to the same problems and having to face
them again? Is putting it off really going to help anything?&quot;
<P>
&quot;You think it doesn't scare me, too?&quot; Tom snapped. 
&quot;Haven't you noticed how I keep trying to distance myself
from my family and their way of doing things? Not a day goes by
I don't look at my folks and wonder whether they felt the same
when they were my age, and about whether life's gonna end up molding
me into them -- doing the same things they do, the way they do
them, despite everything I hoped, everything I tried...&quot;
<P>
Daria blinked in surprise, and even flinched a little at the outburst.
 She was <I>not</I> used to hearing  that much emotion in her
boyfriend's voice.  &quot;I'm, uh, I'm sorry Tom,&quot; she said,
feeling a small pang of the kind of shame that had recently become
all too familiar to her, &quot;I guess I accidentally hit a nerve
there; I hadn't been thinking that I might not be the only one
having to deal with a bunch of fears and uncertainties just now.&quot;
<P>
&quot;That's okay,&quot; said Tom, a bit less than proud of himself,
too.  &quot;Sometimes we <I>all</I> get too wrapped up in our
problems to think in terms of what other people must be going
through and besides, it's not like I'd discussed any of this with
you before.&quot;
<P>
Just then the phone rang.  &quot;<I>Quinn!</I>&quot;, called Daria.
<P>
&quot;Not here, remember?&quot; said Tom.  &quot;Fashion Club
meeting? Stacy's house?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Right,&quot; said Daria.  She picked up the phone, hit the
talk-button. &quot;Hello?&quot;
<P>
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
Jane took the long way home from Cranberry Commons, replaying
the day's fiasco in her mind.  It was painfully obvious something
was bothering Daria -- and had been for awhile.  It was also obvious
that whatever it was had something to do with Daria's shortcomings
and character flaws -- though about the only <I>other</I> thing
that was obvious was that Jane had managed to hit a raw nerve
and then, almost reflexively and through sheer jealous spite,
she'd jabbed and dug at it 'til Daria couldn't stand any more
and had taken off on her.
<P>
The farther along Jane walked, the rottener she felt.  After arriving
back at Casa Lane, she went straight upstairs to her room and
just sat there, brooding, for what she eventually decided was
entirely too long a time.  Deciding that going for a run might
be a good way to clear her head, Jane dug around in the pile of
clothes in her closet until she found what she usually wore when
she went running and began changing clothes.  First the shirt,
as she shrugged out of her red jacket, then pulled the black vee-neck
over her head and off, replacing it with the maroon crew-neck
tee shirt she'd pulled from her closet.  No need to change what
she'd had on underneath -- Jane wore a sports bra most of the
time, both because she found it more practical at times like this
and because she'd found that going out in public with her figure
somewhat...<I>compressed</I> brought a welcome reduction in ogling.
 Next thing was to unlace and pull off her...boots. 
<P>
After tugging the first one off, Jane just sat there on the edge
of her bed for a moment, holding it in her hands and staring at
it.  Frowning at it.  Scowling at it.  This whole latest thing
with Daria wasn't <I>just</I> about boots, of course, but it was
what had set it off. &quot;<I>Dammit!&quot; </I>exclaimed Jane,
flinging the boot across the room in a sudden burst of temper.
<P>
It landed next to Daria's backpack.  &quot;Ah, crap,&quot; said
Jane. Much as she might want to run her worries off just then,
there were other things to take care of first.  She crossed the
room, picked up Daria's backpack, and then walked around picking
up items of clothing and other belongings of her friend's and
putting them into it.  The last one she came across was one that
had previously been sitting unnoticed behind her on the bed --
Daria's dream journal.  Jane held it in front of her, looking
at the cover.
<P>
<I>What do </I>you<I> know about how I think?</I>
<P>
<I>So now </I>you're <I>the expert on how </I>I<I> think?</I>
<P>
And here it all was, wasn't it? probably the best view anywhere
into what really made Daria Morgendorffer tick....
<P>
<I>Hey! <U>personal</U>!</I>
<P>
Disgusted with herself for even thinking it, Jane shoved the notebook
into the pack and quickly zipped it closed.  She reached down,
picked up the phone, started dialing and then changed her mind.
 &quot;I think I heard somewhere once that neutral territory was
best for these things,&quot; she said to no one in particular.
 Jane retrieved her boot, pulled it back on and relaced it, then
hooked one armloop of Daria's pack over her shoulder and headed
out the door.
<P>
Not too much later, Jane reached the Pizza King.  She walked straight
to the payphone there, fished briefly in her pocket for change,
plunked it into the machine and placed her call.  Jane stood there
listening to the phone ringing and ringing at the other end. 
She was beginning to seriously wonder whether Daria was home --
dared she try Tom's house? -- when the phone finally was picked
up and a familiar voice said &quot;hello?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Yo.  Culinary question, amiga,&quot; said Jane.
<P>
&quot;Excuse me?&quot;
<P>
&quot;I've got a hankering for an unusual pizza topping, and I'm
not sure whether I want my crow regular or extra-crispy.  Care
to come advise? my treat.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Ehrr...okay,&quot; replied Daria.  There was a pause as
she held a brief, somewhat muffled conversation with someone else
at her end, then she said, &quot;Tom and I'll be by to pick you
up in a few minutes.&quot; 
<P>
&quot;No need,&quot; said Jane, &quot;I'm already there.&quot;
<P>
---------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
Jane was sitting almost directly opposite the door to the restaurant,
so Daria and Tom spotted her as soon as they walked in.  As they
walked towards her, Jane picked up Daria's backpack from where
it'd been sitting on the booth's bench between her and the wall.
 &quot;Peace offering?&quot; she said to Daria, holding the pack
out towards her friend.  &quot;Everything's there and in case
you're wondering, <I>no</I> I didn't.&quot;
<P>
This brought a brief, puzzled frown from Tom, then he said &quot;I'll
go place our order&quot; and discreetly made himself scarce.
<P>
&quot;Don't tell me <I>you're</I> thinking about changing your
look,&quot; said Daria to Jane.
<P>
Jane paused, momentarily-confused, then looked down at herself
and saw she was still wearing her running shirt.  &quot;Nah, just
a sudden change of plan on my part,&quot; she replied, then gestured
at the empty bench.
<P>
Daria sat down in the booth opposite Jane.  &quot;So, Daria, have
you been trying as hard as I have to figure out what that was
all about earlier?&quot;
<P>
&quot;It's all the changes taking place in my life, I guess,&quot;
was the reply.  &quot;That and the ones coming up.&quot;
<P>
&quot;C'mon, Daria,&quot; said Jane, less-than-convinced.  &quot;We've
already discussed this -- going away to college has us <I>all</I>
scared -- being away from what we know, and from <I>who</I> we
know....&quot;
<P>
&quot;That's just part of it, Jane,&quot; replied Daria.  &quot;I
guess the way the college thing ties into what I've been feeling
is that I'm just not sure my coping-skills are up to it.  As I
said, my life's been changing a lot, especially in the past year
or so, and as you may've noticed, I really haven't been coping
with it all that well.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Like there's really a right way to cope with whatall you've
been through?&quot; Jane asked.
<P>
&quot;A righter one than I've usually managed to choose, it seems,&quot;
said Daria.
<P>
&quot;Are you sure you're being completely fair with yourself?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Well, yeah, actually.  I can't say I've really had all that
much reason to be all that fond of myself lately.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Daria! What're you <I>talking</I> about?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Well, for one thing there's the way I've gotten so jealous
and possessive whenever you've spent time with almost anyone besides
me,&quot; Daria began.
<P>
&quot;Yeah, and that'd be a lot easier to be mad at you about
if <I>I </I>hadn't acted like such a total bitch today I drove
my best friend to run off and leave me there pondering my sins,&quot;
replied Jane with one of her characteristic smirks.  &quot;If
I'm not overinflating my own ego too much by saying this, I'd
suspect I'm one of the most important people in your life right
now.&quot;
<P>
&quot;You're the best friend I've ever had, Jane,&quot; said Daria,
&quot;though if you go spreading that rumor I'll deny I ever said
it.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Same here on both counts, o partner in crime,&quot; came
the reply.  &quot;And as I seem to remember us discussing last
night, I <I>really </I>don't like the idea of losing-- of us being
apart.  I guess the thought that, with us running out of time
together the idea you were going to be spending some of it with
someone other than me was enough to set li'l Janey off.  I'm sorry
about that, Daria.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Accepted,&quot; said Daria, finding herself unable to supress
a smile.  &quot;Still freakin' friends.&quot;
<P>
&quot;<I>And</I> it's not even like that was the first time jealousy
and possessiveness had me getting...weird....with you.  Remember
back when you were in the midst of stealing my boyfriend?&quot;
said Jane.
<P>
&quot;I did <I>not</I> steal--&quot; began Daria, then noticed
her friend's ironic just-kidding smirk.  She smiled in response,
then suddenly turned serious again.
<P>
&quot;The reason I got so jealous and possessive when you spent
time with other people, Jane, is that you're not just the best
friend I've got, until Tom you were the <I>only</I> friend I had.
 And that was because I never reach out to people -- never learned
how.  The only reason I have you as a friend is because you reached
out to me all that time ago in the self-esteem class.&quot;
<P>
Jane squirmed a little, averted her gaze.  She was uneasy with
hearing this again so soon...and especially so with hearing it
from the friend she'd said it to as an attack -- coming back as
a frank admission.
<P>
&quot;So what am I going to do when I go away to college? In eighteen
years I've met <I>two</I> people who getting close to has worked
out with -- one of whom I met because <I>she </I>reached out to
<I>me,</I> and the other through the first.  How likely do you
think it is that I'll get that lucky again in less than another
eighteen years, <I>really?&quot;</I> said Daria intensely.  &quot;I've
been hiding behind this pose, this shell I built to keep from
getting hurt for so long that I don't think I <I>know</I> any
other way.&quot;  Daria looked down at the tabletop.  &quot;Sometimes
-- pretty often lately -- I catch myself feeling like nothing
but a contemptible little piece of damaged goods hiding from the
world behind the mouth she's developed.  What's there to <I>like</I>
about someone like that?  I don't buy that it's my 'sense of humor'
-- I mean isn't that just part of the mouth I've got on me, part
of how I keep myself hidden away? part of what's <I>wrong</I>
with me? Jane, why the hell have you put up with me? <I>what</I>
about <I>me </I>is there to like?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Well, I'm still around, aren't I?&quot; offered Jane. &quot;That
says something.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Like what?&quot; countered Daria.  &quot;No offense but
that sounded more like an evasion than an answer.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Well,&quot; Jane began, a bit awkwardly.  She didn't like
being put on the spot like this, of course, but it was obvious
to her how important her answer was.  &quot;For one thing, Daria,
before you came along I was <I>alone</I>.  Notice the huge circle
of friends I introduced you around to after I, as you put it,
reached out to you way back when we first met? It was like, I
saw the everyday idiocies going on around me, the hypocrisy, the
conformity, the just plain <I>stupidity</I>, and it was like I
was the only one who ever noticed, or realized what they were
seeing.&quot;  Jane began to warm to her subject.  &quot;And then
one day, sitting in this stupid self-esteem workshop I kept taking
over and over just so I'd have something to <I>do,</I> there's
this girl asking cogent, incisive questions -- the <I>last</I>
thing the people who run things like that want to hear.&quot;
<P>
I was scared; I'd tried reaching out to people before, and had
ended up an outcast for my trouble.  But I thought I'd run across
something rare, someone worth the effort and the risk of trying
to get to know, and you know something, Daria? I was <I>right!
</I>Know something else? I was <I>usually</I> wrong about people.
 Sure I reached out to other folks, at other times, but what did
it get me?  Bobby Bighead? Puh-<I>leeze!</I> and then there was
that time I let Coach Morris goad me into that little crusade
to convince her not all Lanes are slackers and joined the track
team.&quot;
<P>
&quot;You mean when I threw that jealous little bitch-fit and
alienated you because of the time you spent practicing, and with
the track team, especially a certain one of them...&quot; Daria
interrupted.
<P>
&quot;Evan turned out to be a jerk, in case your new preoccupation
with seeing Daria Morgendorffer as the source of All That Is Wrong
With The Universe has made you selectively forgetful,&quot; Jane
rejoined.  &quot;Though that reminds me:  another thing you contributed
that I admit to being a bit short of is your strong moral sense.&quot;
<P>
&quot;You mean my self-righteousness,&quot; replied Daria.  &quot;About
the only times I can remember people telling me about my strong
moral sense was when I was either being asked to compromise it
-- to spare somebody's feelings, 'cos I was acting like a jerk,
or both -- or when I was being ridiculed for having one in the
first place.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Well, not to claim you've never been an uptight moralistic
jerk about anything...&quot; Jane began, drawing a frown from
across the table, &quot;but you know something? if it weren't
for you, I'd've finished high school still getting 'by's in any
classes that didn't interest me -- which would've eventually been
everything except art.  And where would <I>that</I>'ve got me?
And hey, for that matter who was it that refused to sell Mrs.
Johansen chocolate during that fundraiser because it would've
poisoned her, and who was only thinking in terms of having been
offered over a hundred bucks for the candy?&quot;
<P>
&quot;I <I>thought</I> you were kidding at the time,&quot; said
Daria, a little appalled.
<P>
&quot;Uh, okay, bad example,&quot; Jane replied, momentarily averting
her gaze.  &quot;But here's another, better one:  think I'd've
<I>ever</I> quit Gary's Gallery if it weren't for you? I might've
made a <I>career</I> out of copying other peoples' art.&quot;
 Jane paused then, and actually, visibly shuddered at the thought.
<P>
&quot;That wasn't simply a matter of morality,&quot; corrected
Daria.  &quot;If I recall correctly, weren't you busy convincing
yourself Gary wasn't just immoral, but criminally-so, as you tried
to talk yourself into quitting?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Hmmm...maybe that wasn't such a good example of Daria's
Moral Sense,&quot; admitted Jane, &quot;but you have to admit
you had me figured out in terms of what I was doing -- so it makes
a good segue to the next thing I like about you:  how smart you
are.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Another thing I'm used to hearing in the context of somebody
trying to get something out of me,&quot; said Daria.
<P>
&quot;Maybe so,&quot; said Jane, &quot;but like your morality
it doesn't make it any less true.  Not only are you smarter than
me, Daria, it's really not even close.  <I>That</I>'s really how
I lost Tom to you--&quot;
<P>
&quot;Speaking of Lost Tom,&quot; Daria interrupted, looking around
the Pizza King, &quot;shouldn't there be pizza by now?&quot;
<P>
She spotted him sitting in a booth in the far corner of the restaurant.
 He'd gotten himself a soda but there was no sign of any pizza.
 Waiting patiently for her and her best friend to resolve things,
Daria realized, and keeping himself out of the way in the meantime.
 Tom smiled at Daria as their eyes met, and she felt her face
warm as she blushed.  Daria still might not be completely convinced
she deserved them, but knowing there were people who cared about
her enough to do such things...she turned back to Jane.  &quot;Now,
where were you before you were so rudely interrupted?&quot;
<P>
&quot;I was saying,&quot; Jane continued, &quot;that you and Tom
bonded, among other reasons, because you're more-or-less equals
intellectually.  That was someplace I knew I just couldn't compete,
and it was a major contributor to how jealous I got.  Same way
I got jealous when I saw you, Jodie and Upchuck competing for
a scholarship I knew I didn't have a shot at.  <I>Not</I> that
I'm only <I>jealous</I> of how smart you are -- it comes in real
handy when your best friend can figure out things you just can't
seem to, like how to detourn the 'Student Life at the Dawn of
a New Millennium' poster contest you've been roped into.&quot;
<P>
&quot;So, I'm smart and I have a strong moral sense,&quot; said
Daria. &quot;Any other redeeming features?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Well, there <I>is</I> your sense of humor,&quot; said Jane.
<P>
&quot;You mean part of the antisocial mask I put up to keep the
world at bay,&quot; said Daria.  &quot;And you were doing so well.&quot;
<P>
&quot;No, really,&quot; insisted Jane.  &quot;Your sense of humor's
one of the best things about you, and I for one don't think it
has anything to do with your personality flaws.  You've learned
to skewer peoples' pretenses and hypocrisies with your humor,
which <I>needs</I> to be done in all too many cases and really
is -- as I think we both learned at an early age -- more effective
and usually <I>safer</I> than just saying &quot;this is stupid&quot;
in a lot of cases.  Besides, haven't you noticed the similarities
to <I>my</I> sense of humor? you've been dwelling on our differences
so much lately, I can't help but think maybe you've forgotten
how many ways we're <I>alike</I>.  The phrase 'kindred spirits'
ring any bells? And another thing -- assuming your ego can stand
being inflated any further of course.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Any more and they might be the rest of the week scraping
flecks off the inside of the restaurant windows,&quot; Daria deadpanned,
&quot;but it's your risk to take.&quot;
<P>
&quot;I've told you about Alison, from the art colony last summer,&quot;
said Jane.  &quot;I don't think I've ever told you how the two
of us hit it off in the first place.  We were both sitting next
to each other in the back row while one of the featured artists
there was holding forth about some ridiculous fraud of a piece
he'd done.  You know me, I couldn't help myself:  I started providing
color commentary, and the first thing I know this girl sitting
next to me joins in, making the same kinds of comments, laughing
at the ones I made.  We ended up going on just like you and I'd
used to do -- <I>that's</I> what attracted me to Alison.  And
the main thing that made me so vulnerable when she made that pass
at me was that I was desperate to have that with someone again
-- at the time I was scared I'd lost that permanently with the
only other person I'd ever had it with.&quot;
<P>
It was time for Daria to blush again.
<P>
&quot;So, since you really seemed to've forgotten,&quot; continued
Jane, &quot;<I>that's</I> what's good about Daria Morgendorffer
-- the short form anyway.  And my only piece of advice in terms
of changing yourself is not to ignore the Little Voice.&quot;

<P>
&quot;The one in my head that tells me to kill and kill again?&quot;
<P>
&quot;No, the next one you hear from the desk behind you that
says 'he doesn't know what it means, he's got this speech memorized.
 Just enjoy the nice man's soothing voice'.  Oh, and to let yourself
understand that the owner of that voice and you will both have
other friends, activities, commitments,&quot; Jane took a deep
breath.  &quot;Finally reaching a conclusion here, Daria -- <I>and
so on.</I>  I hope that answers your question.&quot;
<P>
For awhile Daria just looked down at the tabletop, thinking hard.
 Then she looked up and made eye contact with her friend across
the table.  &quot;Thank you, Jane,&quot; she said, her voice about
as emotional as Jane could ever remember having heard it.
<P>
&quot;Uhh...ahh....you're welcome?&quot; Jane stammered.  &quot;So
does this mean now we can get pizza?&quot;
<P>
&quot;No,&quot; said Daria, standing up.  &quot;Well, maybe later.
 For now, change of plans.  First, I need to tell Tom we're done
here.  Then, I need to find a phonebook.&quot;
<P>
----------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
Tom drove through one of the less well-known (to him, anyway)
parts of Lawndale, taking directions on the fly from Daria, who
sat next to Jane in the back seat.
<P>
&quot;It really would help if I had some idea where we're going,&quot;
he hinted.
<P>
&quot;Turn right at the next intersection, Jeeves,&quot; instructed
Daria.
<P>
&quot;I want a raise.&quot;
<P>
Soon Tom's Jaguar pulled up in front of a small, inconspicuous
storefront.  &quot;So this is the place?&quot; he asked.
<P>
&quot;Yep,&quot; replied Daria. &quot;You two wait here.&quot;
<P>
&quot;You want we should keep the engine running, boss?&quot;
asked Jane.
<P>
&quot;Nah, we should be able to make a quick enough getaway.&quot;
<P>
---------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
It's probably a safe bet that every town in America of any real
size has at least one.  This particular one was called &quot;Dave's&quot;.
 The shop was small and, while cluttered, was clean and well-lit.
 The mixed odor of oiled leather and long-stored canvas greeted
Daria as she walked in the door...just like that time in Highland,
all those years ago, she thought.  Daria walked past the racks
of new and used field jackets, the shelves of tshirts and various
camping gear, the glass cases of cutlery and police equipment
until, at the back of the store, she found the set of shelves
she was looking for.  As the person she'd talked to on the phone
had promised, they had her size in stock.  Once again, memories
came flooding back as she pulled the familiar orange-black-white
box out of its cubbyhole, sat down on the bench in front of the
shelves, and opened it.  She unlaced and pulled off her old pair
of boots, set them down next to the new set, and for a moment
just sat there looking at them.  So many memories...
<P>
<I>And here's where you start making more of them, Daria.</I>
<P>
She pulled the new pair onto her feet, laced them up, tied them
and started walking around the store in them.  Like before, they
felt comfortable right out of the box.  Daria knew that was misleading,
though, and that they'd take some breaking in -- cost her some
skin across the top of her right foot, if things followed the
same pattern as with the last pair.  She pulled a package of moleskin
off a display rack and put it with the boot box.
<P>
Daria was about to walk up to the counter to pay when, on the
spur of the moment, she unlaced the new boots and put them back
in the box, electing to wear the old pair through one more day.
 She took the boots (and the moleskin) up to the front counter
to pay.
<P>
&quot;Replacements, huh?&quot; said the man behind the counter,
who Daria noticed looked a little like her old driving instructor.
 &quot;Just in time from the look of it -- that pair's about ready
to put out to pasture.  No offense, of course, I know how attached
you can get to a pair you've had awhile.  That old pair the genuine
article?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Daria.  &quot;Same kind that're in the
box.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Eighty-two stitches across the toe, a hundred-one across
the back of the heel,&quot; the man replied.
<P>
&quot;I <I>will</I> be counting them, you understand,&quot; said
Daria.
<P>
&quot;Well, any that come up missing we'll put in for free --
extra charge for putting them in the boots, though,&quot; replied
Dave.
<P>
Despite herself, Daria found herself smiling at the exchange.
<P>
<I>You never know when you'll run into somebody who gets it...</I>
<P>
Daria left the store with her new pair of Corcoran jump boots
still in their box, and got back into Tom's Jaguar.
<P>
&quot;Home, Jeeves,&quot; she said.
<P>
&quot;I take it you got what you came here for?&quot; asked Jane,
eyeing the boot box.
<P>
&quot;You can see for yourself,&quot; replied Daria, opening the
box.
<P>
&quot;So after all that, you've decided to stick with a look that's...<I>you,&quot;
</I>said Jane.
<P>
&quot;For now, anyway,&quot; replied Daria.  &quot;Because me
is who I am.&quot;
<P>
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
<I>How many times do you have to do something for it to become
a ritual?</I>
<P>
Daria stood in the backyard of her parents' house and wondered
this as she played the stream from the garden hose over her feet
-- and her new boots.  A chaise lounge and beach umbrella awaited
her in another part of the yard, a cold soda already waiting for
her there, along with one of the books she was working on reading.
 She'd done this same thing once before, in Highland.  Was twice
enough to make it a ritual? or would --
<P>
&quot;DARIA, WHAT'RE YOU <I>DOING?!</I>&quot; came the appalled
voice from behind her.
<P>
&quot;Oh, hello, Jane.  Just breaking in my new pair of boots,&quot;
said Daria calmly.
<P>
&quot;By ruining them?&quot;
<P>
&quot;I'm <I>not</I> ruining them,&quot; explained Daria.  &quot;I'm
breaking them in.  First I wet them down -- not quite soaked --
and then I'm going to wear them for the next six to eight hours
or until they're dry, whichever comes first.  Starting out in
the morning on a late-summer day that promises to become nice
and hot, they'll shrink to my feet as the leather dries.  Stuff
'em with newspaper overnight as they finish drying. Once that's
done I'll give them a good thorough oiling, and they'll be well
on their way to being broken-in.&quot;
<P>
&quot;If you say so,&quot; said Jane dubiously.
<P>
&quot;Worked for my last pair, and look at how long those lasted.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Where'd you learn a trick like that, anyway?&quot; asked
Jane.  &quot;It sounds vaguely military.&quot;
<P>
&quot;My dad taught me back when I first insisted on buying a
pair of them with my accumulated allowances.  I admit I never
asked but I always assumed he learned it in military school.&quot;
 Daria walked to the valve and shut off the hose.  &quot;Care
to stick around while they at least start to dry?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Well, I <I>did</I> come here to see you,&quot; said Jane,
&quot;what with this being our last couple weeks or so together
and all.&quot;
<P>
And so Daria retired to her chaise lounge, her feet projecting
out of the shadow cast by the umbrella so the sun could better
dry them, Jane pulled up a lawn chair, and the two friends talked,
and visited, and just sort of basked in each others' company as
the day's shadows shortened, all but disappeared, then began to
lengthen again.  Eventually two more people exited the back of
the Morgendorffer house and joined them.
<P>
&quot;Um, hi Daria,&quot; said Quinn.  &quot;Tom's here to see
you.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Hey, Tom,&quot; said Daria, getting up off the chaise lounge.
<P>
&quot;Yo,&quot; echoed Jane.
<P>
&quot;Just thought I'd stop by and see how you were doing,&quot;
said Tom.  &quot;Care to go for an aimless drive around town?&quot;
<P>
&quot;I don't know about aimless,&quot; said Daria.  &quot;Would
pizza be out of the question? I'm starving.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Pizza it is,&quot; agreed Tom.  &quot;Are you in, Jane?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Raring.&quot;
<P>
Daria noticed that her sister, rather than going back into the
house, was continuing to hang around the three of them.  &quot;Quinn,
was there something you wanted to say, or has sunburn become fashionable?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Ha,&quot; replied Quinn.  &quot;I've been thinking about
what we talked about that time, you know, on the way back from
the Mall of the Millennium and, um, well, ah...&quot;
<P>
&quot;Yes?&quot; said Daria, a little impatiently.
<P>
&quot;Do you think we could get cheeseless pizza?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Inviting yourself along?&quot; asked Daria.
<P>
&quot;Uhm....uhh...Imean...&quot;Quinn stammered.
<P>
&quot;Relax, sis,&quot; said Daria.  &quot;I'm pretty sure there'll
be enough of us there to physically restrain you if you try to
eat more than one greasy fattening slice.  That is if nobody minds
having you along.&quot;
<P>
This last implied question was greeted by a matched pair of shrugs.
<P>
&quot;So, pizza it is, then.  Pizza for everybody,&quot; said
Daria.
<P>
The four of them walked around the side of the Morgendorffer's
house and made their way to Tom's car, one of them...<I>squishing</I>....ever-so-slightly
as she walked.
<P>
la-la-LA-la-la
<P>
========================================================================
<P>
AUTHOR'S NOTES:  First, thanks to my (let's all say it like Quinn,
now) *fashionable and popular* kid sister for shoe advice used
in the Mall of the Millennium scene (the line &quot;<I>anything</I>
but Converse&quot;, BTW, is there at her insistence, as the price
of technical advice.  It confuses me, too, if you want answers
try asking her).  Second, thanks to TAFKA and Lew o'er at the
Paperpusher's Message Board, for their discovery of the existence
of pink Docs -- once I learned of those I knew they <I>had</I>
to be worked into this fic, <I>and </I>had just the place for
them!  Thanks to Wraith, for webmeistering Sick, Sad World, where
I first learned of the existence of Daria fanfic, and thanks to
everybody I ought to be thanking but am too rummy to remember
to thank since I just stayed up 'til a quarter to three in the
morning getting this thing FINISHED!
<P>
Oh, and the boot-watering trick described in the last scene is,
indeed, both real and, as Jane sortof surmised, an old Army trick.
<P>
DISCLAIMER:  Just in case anyone thinks I'm even more delusional
than I am, I'm well aware I don't own Daria or any of the ancillary
characters in that series, MTV/Viacom does, I believe.  I did
this for fun, my own and hopefully that of at least some of any
people who read it...I'm pretty sure no money will ever change
hands as a result and I don't own enough of anything to be worth
suing, anyway.
