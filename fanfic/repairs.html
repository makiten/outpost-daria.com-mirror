<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Mr.
DeMartino put the drill down on the floor, a began to clean his eyes, full of
wooden dust. Trying to drill the necessary openings in the wooden walls, he
already broke a third auger from supposedly stainless steel. First he mentioned
Christ, Virgin Mary and the Holy Ghost in respect to Ms. Li’s determination, as
she had bought this cam building so thoughtlessly. Then  - the Holy Ghost, Virgin Mary and Christ in
respect to the inventor of stainless steel. His ears blushed, he hiccupped and
dropped the hammer. Mr. DeMartino sadly watched as the heavy hammer, also put
on a very long handle from suspiciously Whiter wood from the height of a step
ladder flies straight into the Timothy O’Neill’s noggin. One could only hope
that the feeling of peace won’t abandon the New-Age man even after such
unpleasant event. As expected, nothing terrible didn’t happen – the hammer
missed Mr. O’Neill noggin by a hair’s breath and shuttered on the floor,
leaving the Irishman still absent-minded, or not, as Mr. O’Neill looked up,
traced the falling route of the last for 300 leagues around hammer, and also
mentioned Christ, Virgin Mary, and the Holy Ghost. Then also St. Peter. For a
better, supposedly, expression. Into the room, that was supposed to be a dining
room, flew infuriated Ms. Barch – somebody again stole from her a knife for
wallpaper and she had to cut them with her huge two-hand shovel. Also Ms.
Manson again covered her favourite “funny” wallpaper in elven style - twigs,
leaves – with skulls and skeletons. A hangman was added to each branch. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>“Where’s
the knife? I’m asking you, where’s my knife?!” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>The
knife wasn’t found soon. In the Ms. Benson’s pocket, of course – she just
couldn’t walk pass a thing, that wasn’t watched by anybody. Her thrifty nature
prevented that. ‘Course, the Ms. Li preferred to call such thrift with a fancy
word “kleptomania”, but out of all LH teachers only DeMartino and Manson knew
its’ meaning. And didn’t tell anyone, what it meant. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Barch
and O’Neill for some reason chose exactly the-lying-in-a-corner rolls of
wallpaper and linoleum, to submerge in a discussion of some ideological
problems. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Morris
and DeFoe just fell asleep. On the sun. Pulling down the cowls and pulling the
capes higher, they lay on steps, and on all questions answered, that they tan
their legs, and that it’s the last word in fashion among the women of their
age. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Manson
coloured the living room’s platband, and, judging from the expression of the
true happiness on her face, skulls, skeletons, ripped-off limbs and tomb-stones
were again part of the decoration. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>“God,
what a mess!”, DeMartino mentally groaned, watching from the height of
step-ladder’s second-to-last step what was happening around here. Barch busily
restarted trying to sweep-off the garbage from the porch using her two-hand
shovel. It wasn’t quite successful, but she seemed to be little bothered by it
- apparently, she seriously became involved with inventing a new school of
sweeping. Something like “Cleanness – clearly Woman”. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>“Somebody,
give me a nail?!” he yelled from the ceiling and looked down. Somebody didn’t
respond. Morris half-opened one eye and thoughtfully stared at the DeMartino,
looming somewhere above, like a giant compass. He reminded her of shadoofs of
the wells in her native town. Benson responded after a few minutes. She dug in
her pocket, chose among all nails must rusty and bent, and handed it over to
the DeMartino. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>“Give
a good one!” DeMartino snapped. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>“Right!
So high, nothing is seen anyway. Why waste good nails?” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Mentioning
all generations of English kings, DeMartino hammered the crooked nail into the
wall. Because of its’ truly unique curvature, the ¾ of the blows – with the
handle of his wood-carving knife, nothing else was left – happened through the
hand. DeMartino emphatically wished good luck to students, who spoke of him, as
of unfeeling jerk. And hoped, that their legends would be truth for at least
this half an hour. The hand hurt. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Morris
finally tore away from the discussions about Art and Phys-Ed and deigned to
begin to wash the floors. DeMartino spitefully watched, as Ms. Muscle squeezes
the mop. Apparently, the mop seemed to her something average between a cable
and a dead cat. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>O’Neill
imitated her so well, that watching him DeFoe and Manson couldn’t restrain from
laughter. The result of laughter was completely sad – Manson dropped the can
with black paint, the oily paint spilled under O’Neill’s legs, he released the
step ladder... </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>When
O’Neill finally got-out from the ladder and DeMartino, on his usually pale
physiognomy was such an excellent disguising colouring of black spots, dots and
stripes, that one just wanted to sent him to resse. DeMartino did send him. Not
to resse, of course, there’s barely anything worth to resse about in such parts.
But – he sent him. Far away and in categorical form. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>From
the next room came a loud rustle, sound of something not-too-heavy falling and
loud curses in all known and unknown speeches. Hurrying there, LH staff
discovered almost buried under the mess of unstuck wallpapers Barch. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>“I
said so! I said so – we must glue using vinyl!!! Again couldn’t do it,
parasite?!” she clearly planned to through this whole stick mess onto the
Benson. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>“Why
at our place, why at our place... Why at our place the glue was always boiled
from rabbits! Why my mother, she was such a housewife, you, scow, could never
reach her, glued only with that...” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>The
moralizing voice of Morris came from the stairs. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>“In
the books of the Wise it is written: “Take one rabbit of average girth, the
bark of <i>Nurchaus</i> tree, taken in the first full moon of the decade’s
first year, shake it, boil it, and glue.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>“E...
When will we reach the beginning of the new epoch?” O’Neill naïvely  asked. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>“They
who walk the paths of Modernity, remember, that the bark of that tree can be
replaced by the substance “Bu-sti-lat”, dissolved half with water.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Morris
even rolled back her eyes, in the ecstasy of prophesying the great wisdom. This
wisdom, unfortunately, was too dark. To complete misunderstanding. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Barch
hysterically giggled, watching the disappointed faces of failed repairmen.
Sitting on a mess of unstuck “funny” wallpaper, she looked most like an
overgrown owl in its’ nest. Then her gaze stopped on Benson, who was trying to
leave the room – quietly, sideways. Something suspiciously stuck-out from under
her clothes. Like a Harpy or a Fury Barch lunged at her. After a second nothing
could be distinguished, only loud shouts came. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>“Give
the glue back! Give the glue back, you accursed miser! Give it back, I’m
telling you!” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>“I’m
won’t you great fool! I won’t!” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>“Give
it back!!!. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>“Never!
You uneconomically use it!!! A package for ten rolls – it’s unthinkable!!” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>DeMartino
pulled the aforementioned package of glue from under the combatants legs. On it
in clear English letters said: “Vinyl glue. One package for five-six rolls”.
DeMartino’s mood turned completely sour. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>When
the couple was calmed-down at last, he gave the package of glue to Barch,
putting on the shoulder of Benson, who jerked towards her treasure, a heavy
hand. Royally, one may say. It worked. DeFoe finally deigned to come into the
room, intrigued by the noise. The rest followed. Something suddenly rustled in
the corner, somewhere under the wallpaper. A hedgehog’s muzzle appeared from
under the paper. The most adorable hedgehog, ever seen by any LH teacher. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>“Breeding
hedgehogs... No bedbugs?” Manson grumbled, foresightedly – what if they get
dirty – raising the ends of her clothes. Then all momentarily turned deaf from
the DeFoe’s lively squeal: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>“He
is so cute!” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>The
rest shuddered. This cru of joy usually came before a total anatomically-pathological
examination of any object that caught the woman’s curiously, no matter how big
or small. She grasped the poor hedgehog, quickly grasping it by hind legs. The
hedgehog demonstrated its’ cute grey belly. From the window’s direction came a
dreamy voice of the Manson: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>“Let’s
nail him to the window! It’ll look good...” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>DeMartino
examined the room. The wallpaper lay in a mess in a corner. The whitewash dripped
with disgustingly white and juicy drops from the ceiling – Benson dissolved her
four times more from her thrifty nature once again. The plinth lay in a
terribly twisted position. Wooden chips, wallpaper clippings, a spilled box of
excellent nail and a huge two-handed sword lay underfoot. All others raised
more fuss around the hedgehog, than the football team with the football ball.
DeMartino raised the hand with the whistle. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>A
terrible howl ripped the silence. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>After
ten minutes an ideal order reigned in the castle. DeMartino, whose ladder with
firmly grasped by O’Neill, whose mouth was trustworthily closed by squeezed by
the lips nails, hammered the dowel into an opening for the shelf. The hammer,
found, as expected, in the Benson’s suitcase, hanged on his belt, firmly tied
by the rope. The same Benson, after inserting a new auger into the drill,
determinedly drilled the stone wall. The Morris saw a new plinth in the yard,
finally armed with a plumb. DeFoe washed the floor in the dining room with her
own hands. Manson carried the pails with the water. Barch stuck the fragmented
wallpaper. Manson painted-over her artwork with some decent black paint.
Overall – truly an idyllic picture... </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>DeFoe
stumbled on the stairs and dumped water straight on Barch. She luxuriously got
off the knees, took the mop, twisting it into an elegant mop, swung, and threw
far over the castle’s wall. Tracing its’ way, she mentioned simultaneously
Christ, St, Paul, Virgin Mary, the holy Ghost, St, Peter, Abraham and his descendants.
O’Neill painfully blushed and dropped the drill. Judging by everything, it just
had to fall on Manson’s leg. DeMartino bent and covered his ears... </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>“Repairs
– a mighty complicated thing...” DeFoe said lyrically. </span></p>
