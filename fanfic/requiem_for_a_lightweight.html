</FONT><P>Short description: Daria just isn't her old self, at a loss upon finding the world suddenly less sick and sad.</P>
<P>This story theoretically fits somewhere in Season 5, and assumes that Daria and Tom remain together.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">* * *</P>
<P>I. 1.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">EST. SHOT: EXT. MORGENDORFFER HOME in mid-afternoon. DARIA, with book bag, turns off the sidewalk and approaches the house, stopping at the front door. SFX: Opening credit music fades. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LS: INT. MORGENDORFFER HOME, the front door dimly lit through drawn curtains. SFX: Key in lock, door opens.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">DARIA:</P>
<P>Hello? Quinn? Anybody?</P>
<I><P>DARIA enters, closes door behind her, hits a light switch and slings book-bag at foot of stairs. SFX: Klunk!</P>
<P>CU: DARIA</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">DARIA:</P>
<P>Ahh...finally, an afternoon of neglect and abandonment. (g<I>lances up as if at unseen wall clock) </I>Dad's not lurking about at four in the afternoon, for once.</P>
<I><P>LS: "COUCH SHOT" from POV of TV. DARIA enters from right, passes in front of couch, picks up remote, points it at TV. SFX: TV  random promo chatter during commercial break. DARIA pushes button several times to find the right station. SFX: different random promo chatter as DARIA sets remote on couch and moves off left to kitchen. </P>
<P>SFX: Rustling in kitchen. Shortly thereafter SFX: TV, a game show starts, bad theme music under.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">ANNOUNCER <I>(TV VO)</I>:</P>
<P>Welcome to Stab for Cash! In which three contestants match wits to earn the chance to stab our pile of hundred dollar bills with a stick! Whatever makes it into the magic bag, they keep! But watch out for that counterfeit! Now, here's your host, Bob Day!</P>
<I><P>DARIA enters left with a soda and a bag of chips. SFX: TV level drops to a babble, following game-show patter of hosts voice and contestants' introductions, interspersed with applause and cheering.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">DARIA:</P>
<P>Huh? What the...?</P>
<I><P>DARIA&#9;sits in left center of couch, sets down food and grabs the remote. SFX TV changes up one channel, back down to game show, volume comes up.</P>
<P>CU TV: STAB FOR CASH set, HOST's podium.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">HOST:</P>
<P>--day's categories are... <I>(cut to graphics of category titles)</I> Hit Movies... Sports Stars... 80s Teen Idols... and Fashion Models. Jenny, you're up first. </P>
<I><P>MS: DARIA on couch. SFX: TV under.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">DARIA:</P>
<P>Oh-kayyyy...right channel, wrong universe. Where the hell is Sick, Sad World?!</P>
<I><P>DARIA leans forward and picks up TV World magazine from coffee table, and begins flipping through it -- first calmly, then more feverishly. </P>
<P>CU: MAGAZINE. On the cover we read: "Game Shows Win the Jackpot...Again!"</P>
<P>SFX: Telephone rings.</I> </P>
<I><P>MS: DARIA.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">DARIA:</P>
<I><P>(increasingly desperate)</I> No...this can't be happening...okay, they moved it again or something...different channel? <I>(growing more intense -- phone continues ringing.)</I> Late night? Over-night? Weekends?</P>
<I><P>DARIA'S hand shoots out and grabs portable phone, talks while riffling through the magazine's pages.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">DARIA:</P>
<P>WHAT?!</P>
<I><P>MS: JANE'S BEDROOM. JANE is seated in front of her TV on the edge of the bed.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">JANE:</P>
<I><P>(annoyed and squeaking)</I> Yo! Chill out, Miss Manners! Is that any way to answer the phone?</P>
<I><P>SPLIT SCREEN: DARIA/JANE.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">DARIA:</P>
<P>Huh? Oh, hi.... <I>(continues pawing through the magazine)</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">JANE:</P>
<P>Jeez, what's going on over there? Quinn steal a metacarpal out of your bone collection to fashion a missing sweater button?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">DARIA:</P>
<P>(<I>throws magazine to the side in disgust, sighs deeply)</I> No, I think this is actually far, far worse.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">JANE:</P>
<P>Well, since I can hear the dulcet tones of Bob Day in the background, I think I can guess at the problem.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">DARIA:</P>
<I><P>(nearly whining, believe it or not)</I> What is this crap? Where's Sick, Sad World?!</P>
<I><P>CU: JANE on telephone.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">JANE:</P>
<P>Uh, it's as bad as you think, <I>mi amiga</I>. They cancelled it, at least here in Lawndale.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">DARIA <I>(VO over telephone)</I>:</P>
<P>WHAT?!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">JANE:</P>
<I><P>(JANE winces and pulls the phone away from her ear) </I>Hey, what did we say about phone etiquette? I need this ear for listening to music too loud.</P>
<I><P>CU: DARIA on phone.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">DARIA:</P>
<I><P>(upset)</I> How could it happen? It's been on since I was a kid! </P>
<I><P>SFX door opens, closes, klunk of a book-bag. QUINN enters through the front door out of frame.</P>
</I><P>That show's a public service, like electricity, or felons picking up garbage on the side of the road!</P>
<I><P>QUINN calls out during DARIA's previous line.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">QUINN:</P>
<P>Hellooo!</P>
<I><P>MS: JANE on phone, on bed. We see a newspaper next to her.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">JANE:</P>
<P>Sorry, it's all true. It's in the paper. <I>(picks up the Lawndale Sun-Herald -- we can see it's the Arts section).</I> "WLDL-TV premieres another of the new wave of game shows -- Stab for Cash-- today at 4 p.m. Program Director Gregory Pickering said the show, in which contestants match wits </P>
<I><P>LS: "COUCH SHOT," MORGENDORFFER LIVING ROOM. QUINN enters from left holding a soda, moves behind couch and sits down next at far right end, away from DARIA. JANE continues reading on the phone underneath.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">JANE <I>(VO over telephone)</I> (<I>continuous</I>):</P>
<P>for the honor of poking a big pile of money with a stick, was part of a shakeup intended to improve ratings leading up to the evening news. Long-time afternoon staple Sick, Sad World departs, another victim of the trend away from reality programming."</P>
<I><P>QUINN picks up remote and turns up the sound. DARIA shoots her a look.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">DARIA:</P>
<P>Wait a minute -- the world has clearly gone mad. You're reading from the TV column, <I>and </I>used "metacarpal" in a sentence. Where's the real Jane Lane? Where's my show?!</P>
<I><P>MS: JANE on phone. Picks up remote, starts flipping channels.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">JANE:</P>
<P>You of all people to get down on someone for improving herself through reading. <I>(to induce guilt, playfully)</I> I've had a lot of time on my hands, lately....</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">DARIA <I>(VO over telephone)</I>:</P>
<I><P>(ignores the jibe) </I>Well, I know that video vignettes of losers doing silly things and sensational quasi-news isn't exactly highbrow, but what kind of imbecile watches all these monotonous game--</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">QUINN <I>(VO over telephone)</I>:</P>
<P>No, no, no! Christy </P>
<I><P>MS: "COUCH SHOT" MORGENDORFFER LIVING ROOM. Quinn leans forward, hollering at the TV.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">QUINN <I>(continuous)</I>:</P>
<P>Turlington! Christy Turling-- oh, my God! Everybody knows that!</P>
<I><P>SPLIT SCREEN DARIA/JANE: Both are dumbstruck for three beats.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">DARIA:</P>
<I><P>(slowly)</I> I gotta--</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">JANE:</P>
<P>--come on over, yeah, before you break a blood vessel. Or someone else's.</P>
<I><P>JANE'S side of the split screen slides off as they hang up. Shot of DARIA widens to take in QUINN, clearly enjoying herself.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">QUINN:</P>
<I><P>(reaching for the phone)</I> Good, you're off the phone. I've got to tell the Fashion Club about this show! Imagine, Fashion Models as a category! I can't believe you had the good taste to watch it -- isn't it time for that Sicky Show, whatever-it-is?</P>
<I><P>After a beat, DARIA, furious, suddenly stands and points a finger at QUINN, who cringes.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">DARIA:</P>
<P>Just...just...stay away from my metacarpals, bitch!</P>
<I><P>DARIA stalks off, brushing past QUINN's legs, bumping the coffee table and knocking over her soda. We hear the door slam. A nail holding up one corner of the bizarre painting behind the couch comes loose and it swings down. QUINN still cringes, phone in her hand.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">QUINN:</P>
<P>What-<I>ever</I>, psycho.</P>
<I><P>SFX: Groovy generic scene transition music.</P>
</I><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I. 2.</P>
<I><P>EST. SHOT: EXT. LANE HOME. </P>
<P>INT. LANE HOME. MS: JANE, still on her bed, still watching </I>Stab for Cash<I>. SFX: transition music cuts with door banging open -- JANE jumps.</P>
<P>LS: Low-angle shot of DARIA in doorway. Focus-pull effect in and up to CU of DARIA's scowling face (maybe with SFX: Horror movie "sting"?) during next line:</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">DARIA:</P>
<P>Turn...it....off!</P>
<I><P>TWO SHOT: JANE and space on bed. DARIA enters shot and sits down</I>.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">JANE:</P>
<I><P>(hits the remote, mutters as DARIA crosses) </I>Whatever, psycho.</P>
<I><P>(DARIA just sits there. JANE looks at her for a bit.)</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">JANE:</P>
<P>You're not well, are you?</P>
<I><P>(DARIA just sits there)</P>
</I><P>I'm going to have to call in the authorities if this keeps up.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">DARIA:</P>
<I><P>(turns slowly and looks at JANE)</I> I-- <I>(turns away from JANE and just sits there some more)</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">JANE:</P>
<I><P>(after a bit) </I>Hoo, boy. This is bad. <I>(a beat) </I>Seriously, you're starting to scare me.</P>
<I><P>CU: DARIA</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">DARIA:</P>
<P>(<I>deep sigh -- she is miserable) </I>Okay. I tried to come up with a witty rejoinder, but I just can't. And all the way over here, I tried to plot some way to outwit my enemy, but in this case, I'm at a loss.</P>
<I><P>CU: JANE</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">JANE:</P>
<P>Wha? </P>
<I><P>XCU: DARIA'S eyes, squinting with hatred.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">DARIA:</P>
<P>Television programming executives. They're greedy, they're evil, and they just don't give a damn what we think. </P>
<I><P>TWO SHOT: DARIA and JANE. A beat, then JANE moves slightly away from DARIA on the bed.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">JANE:</P>
<P>Ooooh-kayyyy. Look, Daria, I'm bummed out, too. Sick Sad World gave us a lot of good times. We laughed, we mocked, we thanked God we weren't on it. But all good things must come--</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">DARIA:</P>
<I><P>(jumps up) </I>No! Don't say it! I'm not going down without a fight!</P>
<I><P>LS: 90 degrees from previous shot. DARIA starts pacing to-and-fro across room from door to bed, pounding her fist in her hand.</P>
</I><P>There must be something we can do!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">JANE:</P>
<I><P>(three beats -- to herself)</I> This wouldn't be a good time to mention that it's just a TV show, would it?</P>
<I><P>(Daria continues pacing.)</P>
<P>SFX: Groovy transition music up. </P>
</I><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I. 3.</P>
<I><P>EST. SHOT: SLOANE HOME.</P>
<P>LS: INT. SLOANE HOME -- TV ROOM.</I> <I>ANGIER SLOANE (Tom's dad -- hereinafter MR. SLOANE) sits on the couch, watching TV. SFX: Music under and out -- TV is playing </I>Stab for Cash's<I> final minutes underneath.</P>
<P>TOM enters.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">TOM:</P>
<P>Oh, hi, Dad. Didn't expect to find you lurking about at four in the afternoon.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MR. SLOANE:</P>
<I><P>(smiles)</I> Hi, Tom. No, in fact, I'm working, in a way.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">TOM:</P>
<I><P>(crosses and sits next to MR. SLOANE)</I> Working on what, reducing your attention span? That's a game show, isn't it?</P>
<I><P>CU: MR. SLOANE</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">MR. SLOANE:</P>
<I><P>(rolls eyes)</I> Now, son, we talked about that superior attitude of yours. Not everyone appreciates it. <I>(gestures to the TV) </I>Plenty of people watch this show, and most of them have money, and some of them make decisions on how to spend it based on commercials they see on WLDL.</P>
<I><P>CU: TOM</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">TOM:</P>
<P>Oh, that TV station your holding company just bought?</P>
<I><P>TWO SHOT: MR. SLOAN and TOM</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">MR. SLOAN:</P>
<P>Yeah. <I>(stretches back, quite proud of himself)</I> Since buying it was my idea, the other board members asked me to keep an eye on how things are going. </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">TOM:</P>
<I><P>(smirks)</I> Nice work, if you can get it. As for how the station's going,</P>
<I><P>CU: TV, WOMAN frantically stabbing a giant pile of bills with a stick, the kind felons use to pick up trash along the highway.</P>
</I><P>it looks like it's going to follow the herd and give the teeming millions another gimmicky game show in which Average Joe attempts to answer simple trivia questions for the honor of humiliating himself in public for money.</P>
<I><P>CU: MR. SLOAN, looking in TOM'S direction.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">MR. SLOANE:</P>
<I><P>(a beat -- dryly)</I> Running more game shows was one of <I>my </I>suggestions to the general manager, actually.</P>
<I><P>CU: TOM</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">TOM:</P>
<I><P>(sheepishly)</I> Um....oh.</P>
<I><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>MS: MR. SLOANE and TOM. SFX: TV seems to get louder in the awkward silence that follows.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">BOB DAY <I>(VO TV)</I>:</P>
<P>Well, let's count up your booty, Jenny... </P>
<I><P>SFX: Studio audience cheers.</I> </P>
<P>Oh, I'm sorry, but -- you stabbed the counterfeit! </P>
<I><P>SFX: Audience groans.</P>
<P>SFX: Phone rings.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">TOM:</P>
<I><P>(jumps up immediately) </I>I'll get it! <I>(rushes out)</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">MR. SLOANE:</P>
<I><P>(shakes his head, plays with the remote)</I> I thought that artist he was seeing was a little odd...but that Morgendorffer girl's 'tude is really starting to rub off on him.</P>
<I><P>LS: TOM walks up to the ringing phone perched upon a tiny table, next to a chair in the hallway (which is how classy people place their phones, I'm told) and answers it.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">TOM:</P>
<P>Hello?</P>
<I><P>INT. JANE'S ROOM. TWO SHOT: DARIA in foreground on the phone, excited, with Jane sitting behind her, holding her head in one hand and grimacing in pain for the humiliation through which her friend is about to put herself.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">DARIA:</P>
<P>Tom! Come over, I need your help! I'm going to start a petition drive!</P>
<I><P>SFX: End act music: Public Enemy, "Fight the Power." DISSOLVE to bumper.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">****</P>
<P>II. 1.</P>
<I><P>EXT. LANE HOME. LS: TOM at JANE'S front door. He is about to push the doorbell when JANE whips the door open.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">JANE:</P>
<I><P>(impatient)</I> Thank God you're here. <I>(pulls TOM in the door)</P>
<P>INT. LANE HOME, FRONT DOORWAY. MS: TOM stumbles in.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">TOM:</P>
<P>Okay, what the hell is going on? Is Daria okay? </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">JANE:</P>
<P>(<I>completely serious)</I> No. </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">TOM:</P>
<I><P>(stricken)</I> What was she babbling about on the phone? "The Show?" What --</P>
<I><P>JANE'S hand shoots out and cover's TOM'S mouth.</P>
<P>CU: JANE.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">JANE:</P>
<P>Okay, look, Mr. Sensitive. Here's the skinny, slowly and in words of one syllable. They cancelled "Sick, Sad World," and Daria's pretty unhappy. </P>
<I><P>CU: TOM.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">TOM:</P>
<P>(<I>muffled -- confused</I>) Mick Maa Morl--</P>
<I><P>CU: JANE.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">JANE:</P>
<P>(<I>sharply</I>) Hesh. This is serious. She's-- (<I>glances off in direction of staircase, as Daria is in Jane's room -- whispers) </I>She's totally overreacting. I can't figure out why, but she's absolutely unhinged by this. So, here's what we're gonna do.</P>
<I><P>CU: TOM.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">TOM:</P>
<I><P>(muffled)</I> Moud mou make mour mann moff my mouff, meese?</P>
<I><P>MS: TOM and JANE.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">JANE:</P>
<P>(<I>distracted</I>) Oh, all right. <I>(removes hand)</I> We're going to play along with whatever she wants to do, even if it's something extremely goofy and potentially incredibly embarrassing -- like asking people at school to sign a petition. </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">TOM:</P>
<I><P>(shocked)</I> Why?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">JANE:</P>
<P>(<I>as if to a slow child)</I> Because she's my friend, and your -- whatever -- and that's what you do when someone's flipping out -- even if it's over nothing. (<I>as an aside</I>) And besides, I'm a-skeered to get in her way....</P>
<I><P>CU: TOM</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">TOM:</P>
<P>C'mon, this is Daria! The poster child for ironic detachment! It should be fairly easy to show her that she's taking this too serious-- (<I>winces at the sound of Daria's voice</I>)</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">DARIA:</P>
<P>(<I>panicked, and it sounds damn eerie</I>) TOM! Are you down there?!</P>
<I><P>CU: JANE</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">JANE:</P>
<I><P>(whispers, dead serious) </I>So, we play along, see? Because while I dislike threatening violence....</P>
<I><P>CU: TOM</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">TOM:</P>
<I><P>(whispers, peeved)</I> Easy, killer. <I>(shouts up the stairs) </I>Yeah!</P>
<I><P>LS: TOM starts walking toward the staircase. JANE stays put.</I> <I>TOM turns around.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">TOM:</P>
<P>Uh, aren't you--</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">JANE:</P>
<I><P>(evil look -- a flip of the hand) </I>Shoo, shoo, Casanova...this is boyfriend-type work.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>II. 2.</P>
<I><P>INT. JANE'S ROOM. MS: POV from behind JANE'S computer, where DARIA is reading.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">DARIA:</P>
<I><P>(calls to Tom) </I>Get up here! <I>(clicks the mouse, reads. says to herself) </I>Damn right! <I>(Clicks the mouse, reads.) </I>Absolutely.</P>
<I><P>SHOT WIDENS to take in TOM, who has just entered. He lays a caring hand on her shoulder.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">TOM:</P>
<P>Searching for bomb-making recipes?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">DARIA:</P>
<I><P>(totally focused)</I> Nah, I've already bookmarked those. <I>(excited)</I> I found a Sick, Sad World bulletin board, and I posted my petition. We'll be getting signatures all over town!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">TOM:</P>
<I><P>(forced enthusiasm)</I> Uhhhhh....great!</P>
<I><P>MS: 90 degrees toward room door from last shot. TOM backs up as DARIA rises to take paper from the printer.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">DARIA:</P>
<P>Yeah, here's yours. No, take two...I only had room for 35 names. <I>(a beat, then suddenly grabs TOM in a hug -- trying really hard to not crack) </I>Oh, Tom, I'm... I'm...</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">TOM:</P>
<I><P>(comforting) </I>It's okay...</P>
<I><P>CU: DARIA.</P>
<P>SFX: Phone rings.</P>

<I><P>(upset)</I> How could they cancel it? And replace it with some stupid game show?!</P>
<I><P>CU: TOM</P>

<P>Shhh....It's o-- <I>(stiffens)</I> Uh, game show?</P>
<I><P>CU: DARIA</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">DARIA:</P>
<I><P>(bitter)</I> And the worst, gimmicky kind...something about the shameless competing to pick up money with a stick.</P>

<I><P>CU: DARIA</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">DARIA:</P>
<I><P>(look of true pain crosses her face) </I>Oh.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>II. 3.</P>
<I><P>EST. SHOT: EXT. MORGENDORFFER HOME. </P>
<P>SFX: Tools jumbling about in a tool box. QUINN is sniveling in the background.</P>
<P>CU: JAKE'S hand rummaging through a disorganized tool box containing a hammer, a cardboard strip with thumbtacks stuck on it in rows, a jar full of various screws, a screw driver, and various bubble-packs of fasteners.</P>
<P>INT. MORGENDORFFER LIVING ROOM. MS: Jake on his knees in front of tool box below the weird picture, which is still hanging from one nail.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">JAKE:</P>
<P>Dammit! I know I've got some countersinks in here, somewhere. Ow!</P>
<I><P>JAKE puts his thumb in his mouth. HELEN steps into the shot.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">HELEN:</P>
<P>Jake, you know you aren't good at this sort of thing. </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">JAKE:</P>
<I><P>(removes thumb) </I>I can put a picture hanger in a wall, Helen, I'm not completely clueless.</P>
<I><P>CU: HELEN looking down at JAKE.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">HELEN:</P>
<P>We just don't want a repeat of the kitchen light episode, do we?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<I><P>CU: JAKE</P>

<I><P>(mutters)</I> Boy, you nearly kill just ONE of their children and they WON'T let it drop! <I>(puts thumb back in mouth)</P>

</I><P ALIGN="CENTER">TOM:</P>
<I><P>(smiles, shakes head)</I> I still can't believe you called her a--</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">DARIA:</P>
<P>Look, it's bad enough I lost my cool, and will probably be paying for it for weeks, <I>and</I> that she didn't deserve it...this time.... Just kiss me good, because if I can't make the next five minutes go the way I want them to, I probably won't be seeing you for a while.</P>

<P>I shall do my best. <I>(they move toward one another -- scene ends before they kiss)</P>
