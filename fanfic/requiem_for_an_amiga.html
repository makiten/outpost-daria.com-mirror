<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE>Woooo</span>... Here we go, my first <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> fan fiction piece placed somewhere before season 5
but after Jane's Addition (In an Alternate Universe obviously...). Hopefully it
won't suck. I'll shut up now... One more thing though: I don't own <span

That honor belongs to Viacom and I'm not contesting that. I don't intend to
make any money from this and just hope that this doesn't get sued. Please!

<p class=MsoNormal>By Wordbearer2</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Jane was dead. Somewhere in <span
class=SpellE>Daria's</span> mind the phrase repeated over and over, a part of
her unwilling to accept the fact that one person she had ever let through her
shields and into her soul was gone. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> was walking
to school in late April, not feeling the chill wind that cut through the air
like a mournful emissary. Jane was dead. The thought came again and awoke
unwelcome memories in its passing. It had happened a week ago, Jane and Trent
were going to come over and they were all going to go out for pizza. "We'll be
over in a half hour, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>. Don't forget that <st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>
is driving us so you'd better have your kissing lips on!" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
grimaced at the statement before responding in her normal monotone, "Jane you'd
better hope that I don't figure out how to culture anthrax in the near future
or you're going to wake up with a room full of spores one day." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Jane laughed the threat away, her
blue eyes sparkling with delight, "Just be ready when we get there. See you
later, Amiga."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> had went downstairs and waited while reading her
book. She had chewed through three chapters of Dune Messiah before she looked up
and saw that <span class=GramE>a</span> hour had passed. Raising an eyebrow in
bemusement, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> went over to the kitchen phone, and
called Jane. The phone rang and rang, no one picking up, no answering machine
kicking in. "<span class=SpellE>Heh</span>," She said to herself. She went back
to her book. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>She thought, "Must be car trouble
and they are down getting it fixed." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Later that evening, as the <span
class=SpellE>Morgendorfers</span> sat down to dinner, lasagna, the phone rang.
Helen got up and answered it in her usual cheerful lawyer tone, "Hello?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yes this is the <span
class=SpellE>Morgendorfer</span> residence." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"<span class=SpellE>Daria</span> is
here. Do you want to speak with her?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Helen held the cordless out to a
now-interested <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and an official sounding voice
at the other end of the line began to speak, "<span class=SpellE>Daria</span> <span
class=SpellE>Morgendorfer</span>?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"This is she," <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
warily responded. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"Miss <span class=SpellE>Morgendorfer</span>,
we need you to come down to the hospital and identify two accident victims for
us, information on the bodies seemed to indicate that you would know them." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Alarm and confusion swirled in her
mind, though none of it reached her voice, "May I ask who you suspect the
victims <span class=GramE>are</span>?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"Fair enough, Miss <span
class=SpellE>Morgendorfer</span>. The two seem to be siblings, one Trent and <st1:Street><st1:address>Jane
  Lane</st1:address></st1:Street>. The male is still..." <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
stopped listening at that point, her focus drawn inward as she fought to keep
her emotions from boiling over. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>She blurted out, "I can be right
over." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The others in the room looked at
her curiously a moment as <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> asked like nothing
was wrong, "Mom. I need a favor..."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sight
of the school snapped <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> out of her flashback as
she entered the halls of Lawndale <span class=SpellE>Highschool</span>. She
walked alone, ignoring the other students as they did the same. Coming upon her
locker, a familiar sight greeted her eyes: Kevin, local sports monkey, making
out with the incredible inflatable Britney. Normally she would have pulled out
her whistle and scattered the twosome like a flight of quail, but today she
wasn't feeling generous and wanted to do something more... permanent to keep them
out of her hair. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"Kevin," she whispered in his ear.
Startled out of his lustful trance, Kevin jumped back in alarm, causing Britney
to slam against the locker. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"<span class=SpellE>Oww</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>! What did you do that for?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
paused for a moment, plastering a fake thoughtful expression over her face
before replying, "Just wanted your attention, Kevin. I come here every morning
and see you two lip locking like there's no tomorrow. Being a brain and all, I
know some things, and I just can't hold my silence anymore." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Kevin looked confusedly at Britney,
"Why is that <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>? It's just kissing!" Britney
chimed in, "Yeah! My <span class=SpellE>Kevie</span> loves to kiss me and it's
not like anything bad has happened..." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"Yet." interjected <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>, her finger held aloft. "You're both athletes, or
close enough anyway, and spend time in the locker rooms." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"Uh huh," the two nodded slowly as
she continued. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well studies show that there are
two kinds of fungus that settle in the boys and girls locker rooms respectively,
each perfectly harmless on their own. They just sit there in dark corners and
pump out spores." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Kevin looked lost now, his lack of
comprehension showing as his smile faltered, "Okay. So... what's wrong with
that?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
smiled inside as she activated her verbal trap, "Harmless on their own, but if
the two breeds mix they make a particularly nasty growth that I don't want to
tell you about so soon after breakfast." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>She shook her head in simulated
distaste as Britney asked, "What do these two funguses have to do with
kissing?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"Well... spores settle on wet moist
surfaces and cling there and since you go into the girls locker room and Kevin
goes into the boys'... let's just say that the risks are a little high for my
taste that a cross section could occur..." Britney put two and two together,
giving off an '<span class=SpellE>Eeeep</span>!' as she fled to the girls' room
in desperate search for an antifungal soap. Kevin just stood there, the gears
in his head knocked out of alignment by years of tackles. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Eventually he looked down at <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> and asked, "Does this mean that I can't kiss Britney
anymore?" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>He looked sad as a beaten puppy,
almost causing <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> to relent, but she hardened her
resolve as she pulled the final snare. "Not at all Kevin, there is a simple way
to kill the spores before they can cause any problems." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"What is it?" Kevin almost bounced
on his toes in eagerness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"All you have to do is take some
ordinary lye from the janitor's closet, apply it to your lips and drink some
water. Burn away those spores, so fast they won't have a chance." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span class=GramE>"Oh, yeah!!</span>
Thanks <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>!" Kevin sprinted away in search of the
janitor's closet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> let
her trademark smirk blossom to her lips as she used the solitary moment to get
at her locker and pull out her books. The quiet voice of her conscience was
silenced by her pride as she imagined the, "Good one, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>!
Way to smite the feeble minded of the world!" Jane would deliver when she heard
about this." <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> stopped mid stride, as the
knowledge 'Jane is dead' echoed through her head once more. The thundering
finality of that phrase triggered another memory as she robotically made her
way to class. The hospital was right. Jane and Trent were the two accident
victims. Classic scenario really <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> morbidly mused,
passenger side impact in a cross section. Jane was killed instantly as far as
the hospital could tell and <st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>
was in a coma for the foreseeable future after driving his head through a
window. The funeral was four days after that, a week from the present date, and
a grim cloudy affair it was. Tom was there of course, looking lost in his
finely tailored suit. Some teachers were there as well, Ms. Defoe looking the saddest.
The scattered Lane family was still scattered, only Jane's mother and two of
her wayward siblings present. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> and her family
were of course present. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
wore her normal outfit, against Helen's protestations, but Helen had relented
in face of her daughter's quiet stubbornness. For <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
the funeral was all but purposeless, a formality that didn't deserve her
presence. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> had mourned in the silent isolation
of her room, away from prying eyes and sympathetic ears, grateful for the
padding that muffled all noises as her sadness bled out in low cries and intermittent
steams of tears that <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> couldn't keep down despite
the best of her iron control. The pain oozed out of the gaping wound in her
soul that seemed to mock all efforts at control. Thus, she held her silence at
the funeral only through great effort, her face passive and the only weakness
in her concealing facade, her eyes, masked behind a pair of shades. She could
barely see through the non-corrective lenses, but was grateful for their
masking presence as various acquaintances spoke about Jane's life and memories
assailed her emotional control. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> went up to
speak, passing by the ebony casket to stand at the microphone. The dark clouds
momentarily thinned and a beam of light gleamed off the wood and raised
highlights off <span class=SpellE>Daria's</span> auburn hair and black shades. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>She cleared her throat as all eyes
locked upon her and smirked internally at the thoughts that must be going
through their heads. "Let it not be said that <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
responds in a typical fashion to tragedy," she wryly thought as silence
gathered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>At last she gave her prepared
speech to the tear stricken mass, "She was a good friend while she was alive,
but now Jane's dead and that's all I'm going to say about that. Thank you for
your time." The bald statement bounced off the audience with deafening silence,
the level monotone in which it was delivered rendering the eulogy harsh and final.
<span class=SpellE>Daria</span> moved away from the microphone and into the
midst of her family, coldly removing her mother's hand from her shoulder and
quelling Jake's abortive hug with a cold glance over her shades. Jake was
stunned by the heavy chill in <span class=SpellE>Daria's</span> face and didn't
try to speak again for the duration of the funeral. As the next speaker came up
to break the stunned silence, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> zoned out and
made a fierce vow under her breath that heralded from the depths of her pain. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"If letting people close means this
kind suffering when they go, then the obvious solution is to not let people get
close." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
frowned as she thought on this, "Jane got in because she thought I was
interesting. I'll have to prevent that in the future because I can't go through
this again." A tear trickled down her check unnoticed amid the general grief as
she made her oath and something faltered and died amid the turmoil of her
silent soul-felt grief.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>She reached O'Neil's class and took
her seat as the bell rang and the last of her class mates hurried into room,
Kevin conspicuously absent. O'Neil rose and started to begin his lecture but
was interrupted by a phone call, "Hello? This is O'Neil speaking." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>A pause, "Of course, I understand.
I do hope that he feels better..." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>A longer pause and O'Neil's face
fell, "Yes, I'll be quiet. Have a nice day, <span class=SpellE>Mrs.Li</span>." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The sensitive teacher composed
himself as he turned to face his apathetically waiting class and began his
spiel, "It seems Kevin won't be joining us today. He's had an accident in the
janitor's closet and needed to be sent home." <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
smirked to herself as the class just sat there like lumps. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The ever cheerful teacher continued
undaunted, "Edgar Alan Poe, poet of depressing subject matter. We have starting
going over the more cheerful of his early works. Can anyone tell me why he
started to write things that were just so incredibly sad?" The class just
stared back at him their eyes glazed at this hour of the morning while <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> managed to roll her eyes in contempt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>O'Neil faltered at this lackluster
response and reflexively turned to his star pupil, "<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,
could you tell us why he...Oh never <span class=GramE>mind</span>!" </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>O'Neil sounded nervous as he backpedaled.
<span class=SpellE>Daria</span> responded, "Excuse me? I'm quite ready, willing
and able to do this." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"But <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,
it has just been two weeks since Jane died and it is your first day back..." <span
class=SpellE>Daria's</span> face didn't show it, but O'Neil had touched off a
sore spot and she muttered under her breath. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Mack answered, "A series of tragic
situations conspired to make his childhood issues come to the fore in his
writing." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>O'Neil beamed at the response,
"Very good, Mack. His inner child needed love but it didn't get it from others
in his life. <span class=GramE>Anyone else?"</span> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
raised her hand and O'Neil reluctantly called on her, "Do you think just
because someone has had something bad happen to them they suddenly loose the
ability to cope with the real world?" <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> was angry
though the passivity of her features and levelness of her voice would conceal
that fact from all except Jane, and of course, Jane was dead. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>O'Neil nervously responded as his
vestigial perceptivity detected something was amiss, "Of course not, <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"Then why do you treat me with kid
gloves? Twenty-one people die every minute. If everyone failed to cope with
death, the world would fall apart in a matter of hours and it hasn't yet done
that, has it Mr. O'Neil?" Contempt began to color her voice as O'Neil fell back
to sit on his desk and the class turned to stare at the normally passive
brunette.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"No," O'Neil uttered softly into
his palms. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"Correct. Then I suggest you start
thinking that way and let those who retain enough interest in your <span
class=SpellE>wishy</span>, washy teaching style, answer if they want." O'Neil
had burst into tears at this point and mutely nodded agreement. She would have
stopped at this moment, but something goaded her onward and she continued her
barrage, throwing comments into the teacher's self-esteem like sharp knives. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>"It is reactions like this that
make me doubt that you can be any kind of teacher to anyone. Personally, you've
been as much a help to me as napalm to a fire fighter. My 'dark subject matter'
to anyone besides yourself, would seem to be a merely incisive, cynically
balanced view of the world, but you can hardly see that through your thick,
rose-colored contact lenses." <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> was cold, ice
cold, as O'Neil visibly shuddered under her assault and those classmates seated
nearest her sought to get farther away from <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>,
transferring to other desks if possible. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
ignored all of this, the dark flame of her repressed pain channeling out past
her tongue and into the hapless O'Neil, "I should have realized that I had you
pegged from the first 'self esteem' class I had to take from you when I got
here. You don't know what you're doing. You cling to the curriculum like a life
raft and the few times that you stray from that crutch, you do more harm than
good. Remember the 'succeeding through failure' assignment? Maybe Li did pick
you up when you were a street corner feel-good preacher." <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
smirked at this point and the cold expression hit her face as light glared from
her glasses, making her seem both less and more than human. O'Neil didn't
respond, as he curled into a sobbing ball near the door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
turned to her classmates as he continued this way and said, "Guess we have free
study period?" Jodie opened her mouth to say something, but halted as the icy
deadness of <span class=SpellE>Daria's</span> expression caused her to hold her
tongue. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> turned away and pulled out her book, a
ragged copy of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Brave New World</i>, and
turned her mind to Huxley's words of warning. The rest of the period passed in
relative silence, the students speaking quietly amongst themselves, none daring
to disturb the seemingly tranquil <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>. O'Neil
slowly recovered enough to crawl into his desk where he dared not look her in
the eye for fear of another brutal tongue lashing. The air was thick with
nervousness and when the bell rang O'Neil made one last token effort at
teaching. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Quickly and softly he said. "Read the
Raven, Lenore and <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Haunted</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Palace</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
for homework tonight. We will be discussing them next class period." <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> got up and moved toward the door, her face
expressionless once more. Every one was eager to go, but no one crowded the
short brunette as she left the room. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> smiled to
herself, able to feel a little pleasure at how she had reduced the soft-headed
O'Neil to a blubbering wreck. It was a cold smirk, one that advertised her
perceived superiority to all who would challenge her. The whisper of the high
school rumor machine kicking into high gear as her classmates disseminated the
tale fed the smirk enough to temporarily bury her pain. It was a cold
expression, born of isolation, of all encompassing desolation. <span
