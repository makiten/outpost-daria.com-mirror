<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>From the
&quot;so-called&quot; diary of one <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> <span
class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>In two days, my
brother will return to visit us here in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>Lawndale</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>, the result of a bizarre,
nearly one hundred and seventy-five year old tradition at </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span
  style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>Eastward</span></st1:PlaceName><span
 style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'> </span><st1:PlaceType><span
  style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>College</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span
style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>, where the faculty suddenly
decides to go on a self-imposed, educational sabbatical for several days, and to sit around the place to
discuss their various curriculums amongst themselves for some sort of reason.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>Darren admits that he
doesn't know why in the hell this all starts so soon near the beginning
of the college year. He's heard of an old story about some kooky old
chancellor, who suddenly decided to close down the whole damn school because he
had to get home to tend the late summer crops on his farm, and it caught on in subsequent years with the people teaching under him, since they
were farmers, too. Why couldn't they have simply moved their damn farms to the <span
class=GramE>school,</span> or better yet, have the students help them in their
chores while teaching them? It would've saved a lot of time for all. Are the
majority of professors there today still part-time farmers? Do they have
backyard gardens to tend to?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>Though I'll never
admit it of course, I'm looking forward to seeing Darren again, just as I'm
sure mom and dad and Quinn are. Jane, of course, has seen him twice since on
her trips to and fro, so she doesn't count. Then again, it's not as if I'm
running a number tally of some sort, so I might as well throw her into the mix,
too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>I've gotten used to
not seeing Jane almost every other weekend, since Tom's, um,
&quot;occupying&quot; my time more. Ever since our little argument about his
taking me for granted, or my perception that he was, we've gotten closer to one
another. It's sort of weird, though, me having a &quot;boyfriend&quot;, letting
Tom into my life like this, exposing my thoughts and feelings about something
to him--and about him. I guess it's kind of similar to when I speak to Jane (or
to my family when I'm delirious) about a private topic, except it seems more
personal with Tom, somehow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>Well, of course it's
more personal. Tom's a guy who likes me. <span class=GramE>And I him.</span>
And those personal feelings have become <u>so</u> <span class=GramE>personal,</span>
they've become too personal to be written on this paper. Hence, those personal
feelings are going to stay right up here in the <span class=SpellE>ol</span>' <s>noggin</s>
head. For some reason, I hate using the word &quot;noggin&quot;. Guess it isn't
descriptive or complete enough for my writing, one of those words <span
class=GramE>that's</span> missing something somewhere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>Jane said that it
would become easier and easier if I repeated &quot;boyfriend&quot; to myself
whenever I looked deep into Tom's eyes. I responded that it would become easier
and easier for me to deprive Darren of his girlfriend when I looked deep into <u>her</u>
empty, open eyes as I dumped her cold, lifeless body into the abandoned
landfill one of these nights. She stopped teasing me about Tom after that. <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>, you've <u>still</u> got it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>I still have Jane's
company during the week at home and at school, where Ms. Li's gone into
overdrive concerning Darren's visit. She's ordered a massive clean-up of the
place by students, completely voluntary for real this time, per our little
agreement over Darren's pending donation to the school. Jodie's headed the
effort, of course, and with her well-known powers of persuasion, she had even
gotten a surprisingly high number of suck--<span class=SpellE>er</span>,
students to help in the cleaning effort in the name of school pride. Li's
pulling out all the stops.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span class=GramE><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>Poor
Ms. Li.</span></span><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'> All
of that preparation, only to have her ass nailed to the wall by Darren over her
<span class=SpellE>wreckless</span> spending he found out about from Woo's
little investigation of the school's finances after Jane's and my warnings.
She's going to be in for a surprise, though Darren's said that it won't
disqualify the school, he <u>will</u> demand some changes over the school's
&quot;unique&quot; accounting techniques from her. If we weren't stuck in
class, Jane and I would be in Li's office front and center, just for the
pleasure of seeing her shocked face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>Moving on, it's been
one hell of an active month since I've seen Darren the last time, hasn't it<span
class=GramE>?:</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>First, William
Appleton's body was found on a beach some twenty miles from here, and was
subsequently cremated, according to his wishes from his last will and
testament. How fitting for him in a way--the fire from the earth simply finished
off his body, whereas the fire from the bowels of hell will simply finish off
his soul, and from what I understand from some various religious literature,
forever. All I can say is burn, baby, <span class=GramE>burn</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>I don't know why, but
I was a little surprised that Darren didn't ask for a DNA test, just to make
sure it was him, even though the local forensics people said it was nearly
impossible to get any samples because it was so badly decomposed, thanks to the
saltwater the body absorbed, and that William Appleton's driver's license was
found on him. I <u>know</u> he's dead, but still...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span class=GramE><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>The
hell with it.</span></span><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>
Maybe I'm being paranoid after that ass almost killed me and Jane that night. I
suspect Darren simply wanted to quickly dispose of his uncle's body--and of his
uncle's nightmarish memory. <span class=GramE>Can't say that I blame Darren for
that.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>The body being found
also shut up any of those who had supported Darren's uncle, and had still held
animosity against Darren and Constance, even causing a few more dissenters to
put in for their <span class=SpellE>severance</span> pay, and quietly leave
the company. I guess some of them had actually held out the hope that he was
still alive, and would somehow ride in like the cavalry to save them all from
my brother's and Constance's tyranny, or something. Oh well, at least my
brother won't have to hear those nasty cracks about him having it easy anymore,
even though he insists that he's unfazed by them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span class=SpellE><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>Ahh</span></span><span
style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>, then there's Edward White,
sans his beard and mustache, spotted in Chicago, thanks to that trap
set up by Darren and Woo. White still somehow escaped, thanks to the bumbling
efforts of the local Keystone cops. When Jane heard about it, she didn't let me
or Darren forget it, and still hasn't, occasionally letting it playfully slip
out about how right she was to me. I wonder if I should let my fist playfully
slip out and knock that smug smirk off of her <span class=GramE>face?</span>
Nah, I couldn't do that. She'd probably tell me something like she was right
about me finally getting fed up, and clobbering her. I don't think I could give
her anymore satisfaction than what she already has, <span
class=SpellE>dammit</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p><span class=GramE><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>Enough
fantasy.</span></span><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'> <span
class=GramE>Back to reality.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>There's Uncle Jim,
who's nearly going bonkers over still not finding <span class=GramE>aunt</span>
Millie, the same, though on a different level, for Darren, who seems to be
resigned to not seeing her anytime soon. If Jane, our family, or his friends
weren't there for my brother, I'd find myself beginning to get seriously pissed
at Millie for doing this to herself, Darren, and everyone else. I mean, I know
she was deeply hurt by Edward, and I can see her wanting to bury the pain
someplace far off, but surely she'd know that she has people who care for her,
and that almost two months should've been enough time to get over what he did
to her?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>Did I just write all
of this because I'm actually worried about her? Yeah, I guess I did. Damn
lousy, pesky concerns.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>Oh, yeah. <span
class=SpellE>Krystal's</span> coming with my brother too, mustn't forget <u>that</u>,
oh no. Jane says that she's called practically everyday for Trent since Quinn
and I left Darren's, and <span class=SpellE>Trent's</span> been talking, humming
and singing about nothing but <span class=SpellE>Krystal</span> outside of the
group's regular songs, even slipping her name in one of two of them at the Zen
and at <span class=SpellE>McGrundy's</span>, where <span class=SpellE>Mystik</span>
Spiral's getting much better gigs--and money. I guess their recent success on
their tour has made the local owners sit up and take notice. They've
gotten more requests to play at other local clubs, too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>Mom's basically turned
them over to a promoter, though she's agreed to handle any legal matters for
the guys that might come up--for a fee, of course. Despite quickly settling
that lawsuit with the Weekly Blabber for $100,000, which surprised me because I
had expected that it would go to trial, and would be for a lot more, leave it to mom to still squeeze out as
much monetary blood as possible from her legal turnip.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>Moving back to </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>Trent</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>, I've never seen him behave
like this before, even with Monique. It's like he's becoming almost--giddy
about <span class=SpellE>Krystal</span>. It's scary to me not just because of
the strange way he's behaving, but also because all of this is beginning to
quietly drive Jane nuts, and I'd hate to see her allow herself to lose it
because of <span class=SpellE>Krystal's</span> little head games, especially in
front of Darren. She was <u>definitely</u> not pleased to know <span
class=SpellE>Krystal</span> was coming with Darren, much less staying under <u>her</u>
roof to boot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><st1:Street><st1:address><span class=GramE><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>Mrs.
  Lane</span></span></st1:address></st1:Street><span class=GramE><span

&quot;</span></span><st1:City><st1:place><span class=SpellE><span class=GramE><span
  style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>Trent</span></span></span></st1:place></st1:City><span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>'s</span></span></span><span
class=GramE><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'> little
friend&quot; staying over for a few days didn't exactly improve Jane's
disposition, either.</span></span><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>
It was all she could do not to tell Trent <u>and</u> her mother off, which
wouldn't have done her any good, of course. Oh, well. Maybe we can avoid <span
class=SpellE>Krystal</span> while she's visiting. At least that's what we plan
to do. God, I hope Darren doesn't ask her to come with us anywhere, even with </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>Trent</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>. The tension could kill us
all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>Only yesterday, after
yet another call from <span class=SpellE>Krystal</span> to Trent, while
Jane and I happened to be in the Lane's kitchen, I could swear that I saw my friend
grind her teeth so hard that she was <span class=SpellE>gonna</span> end up
like that &quot;<span class=SpellE>Metalmouth</span>&quot; guy Trent told Jane,
my dad, and me about a while back. She somehow forced herself to grin when a
smiling </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>Trent</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'> told us that <span
class=SpellE>Krystal</span> said hello, then she quickly left, dragging me
along in the process, up to her room. Did I mention that she snagged my left
arm in an iron grip of death while doing so? That arm's blood circulation
didn't return for an hour--seriously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>Still, despite
everything, I've got to hand it to Jane about keeping her temper over <span
class=SpellE>Krystal</span>. It must be hell for her. She keeps telling <span
class=GramE>herself</span> that </span><st1:City><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>Trent</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'> will either eventually see
through <span class=SpellE>Krystal</span>, or will get bored with her. So far,
a penguin has a better chance of being spotted in Lawndale
than <u>that</u> of happening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>To try and force
the penguin to appear against all odds, Jane, Tom and I have tried like hell
to find any trace of Sesame, concerning &quot;Sty Lark&quot;, a.k.a. <span
class=SpellE>Krystal</span>. Unfortunately, we've had no success. It's like
Sesame's vanished completely. Hell, maybe she's staying with <span class=GramE>aunt</span>
Millie. I'd be tempted to add Edward White in the mix if <span class=GramE>aunt</span>
Millie didn't hate his guts for what he did to her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>We did, however, find
Rocco in the Zen last week at a table, literally crying his eyes out about
Sesame, of all things. He said that he hadn't seen his &quot;<span
class=SpellE>gurl</span>&quot; since we did. For a moment, I honestly thought
that he missed her--until the first pitcher of beer and several giggling,
pushed-up bra wearing, super-tight leather-dressed Goth &quot;<span
class=SpellE>gurls</span>&quot; immediately cured his depression. <span
class=GramE>Nothing like women and alcohol to cure the blues.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>On that note about <span
class=SpellE>Krystal</span>, I haven't heard anything more from her via Darren
over Rory and Stacy. Quinn also said that she and Sandi haven't found anything
to connect those two at Stacy's place, so far. Both of them decided to not let
Tiffany in on their suspicions of Stacy, with Quinn giving her reason
that &quot;The fewer people who know this, the better.&quot; Yeah, right.
Obviously they're <span class=GramE>afraid</span> <span class=SpellE>Tiffany'll</span>
<span class=SpellE>accidently</span> slip out something to Stacy in her own
inane way, and more than likely, they're probably right. Tiffany's elevator
doesn't go all the way to the top, side, <u>or</u> bottom. It just floats there
in suspended animation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>In a way, it's
actually good that Quinn's worried about Stacy like this. It'll keep her mind
off of what happened with David Sorenson. After our little talk over it right
after he left, it's obvious that she's coming out of it, albeit slowly, but I
can still see that his rejection really hurt her. She really liked the guy, and
he basically rejected her the way she's rejected her drooling male entourage
for years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>Darren sounded a
little peeved when he heard, but I think I was able to get him to ease up a
little. Jane said she made Darren promise not to hunt David down when my
brother visits. I'm sure she was only joking--I hope.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>A while back, I
probably would've smirked widely in satisfaction at the irony of all of this,
but now, after getting a brother and a--boyfriend, I've actually found myself
softening to my sister's feelings, of all things. <span class=GramE>I'm
understanding</span> what it is to have a relationship, and what goes into
keeping it strong.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>God, I can't believe I
just wrote <u>this</u> down, too. Should I cross it out? <span class=GramE>Nah.</span>
I'll just build one of those &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; self-destruct
devices instead, and <span class=GramE>jury rig</span> it to my
&quot;diary&quot;. In the event Quinn or my folks try to sneak a peek at it,
it'll dissolve into smoke when it's opened. Note to self: Contact Peter Graves
on the Internet in the future, and get those damn instructions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>I've just finished my
lead article on teen self-esteem for <span class=SpellE>TeenLife</span>
magazine, and I'm about to send it off by e-mail. Save for any possible minor
corrections in spelling, Mr. Juarez has given his word that he won't delete or
edit out anything, that he'll leave it as it is. In other words, the magazine,
or this first issue at least, is completely at my mercy. I could have inserted
anything, and have gotten away with it. I'm in a position that any other writer
would kill to be in, a veritable dream that has come true for me, with even the
blessings of my fellow writers to boot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>So why was I <u>not</u>
merciless in writing this? Why, though I <u>was</u> being honest with this
article as I usually am when I'm writing? Was I seemingly holding back? Was it
because Jane, my family, and Tom liked it when I showed it to them, and I
couldn't let them all down by adding something nasty to it in the final rewrite
afterwards? Quinn in particular liked it, which scared the hell out of me. I
guess that part about only the &quot;popular&quot; crowd being able
to wear the on demand fashions over the &quot;unpopular&quot; crowd won her
over because from her point of view, it was <u>so</u> true.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span class=GramE><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>Quinn
and me in agreement over something.</span></span><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>
I think I'm <span class=SpellE>gonna</span> be sick. Another note to self: Puke
in Quinn's room, if necessity demands it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> stopped writing, and glanced down at what
appeared to be a credit card on her bed, then sighed. After a moment, she began
writing again.</p>

<blockquote style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt'>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>And then there's this.
A Northolt Bank card sent to me this afternoon via a special courier from
Darren for my 18th birthday, an &quot;early present&quot;<span class=GramE>,</span>
since he's said that I can send him all the bills I pile up when I use it.
It's the ultimate credit card, so secure that only a person who can produce
their own driver's license or other legitimate I.D. can use it, and no one
else. There's also the fingerprint encoded within the card's magnetic strip,
which has to match the <span class=GramE>user's</span> as a further security
measure. Makes you wonder why <u>all</u> credit cards haven't gone down this
route.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>Oh, wait. That's
right. <span class=GramE>Silly me.</span> The stores and credit card companies
need teens like Quinn or thieves (Is there any difference?) to <span
class=SpellE>wrecklessly</span> use the regular cards to purchase gobs of stuff
so the economy can be kept going (or so they all claim), and the store's and
credit card company's pockets can be kept full from the compounded daily
interest. <span class=GramE>Your plastic card at work.</span> <span

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>When Quinn first laid
eyes on it, I could've sworn that I saw dollar signs in those eyes, and drool
leaking from that mouth. My guess is that she'll be in here to lay on her
charms soon to butter me up, and drive me bonkers. How I look forward to <u>that</u>...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>Mom and dad
immediately went into telling me how careful I had to be in using it, giving me
the speech about &quot;financial responsibility&quot;, and not &quot;burdening my
brother's budget with 'needless' things, even though he could easily afford
them&quot;. Were they <u>serious</u>? They were giving the wrong advice to the wrong
<span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span> daughter, since I have no intention of
using this card ever, not even for a pizza--unless it's an absolute emergency,
such as if I've become destitute and have to buy one, but that's it, I swear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>That Darren had gotten
the card for me wasn't a surprise, since he was the one who practically
badgered me into taking it, and had me to give my fingerprint to the local bank
branch a scant week ago. I suspect the card was his way of trying to further
make up to me his role in that little sting operation over my taking the job at
<span class=SpellE>TeenLife</span>, even though I told him I was over it--that,
and what Jane had told me about his feeling awful all over again about it when
she returned to visit him. <span class=SpellE>Dammit</span>, why do I feel as
if he shamed me into taking it?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>I don't need or want
his money. He's already doing everything else for me, Jane, and Quinn, isn't
he? We'll be staying with him for a few years at his palace while going to
college nearby. He's paying for mine and Quinn's educations in full, not to mention that he's already giving me some money with his monthly stipend, and has
offered Jane a loan if she needs it for her artwork, not to mention her merely
having him for a boyfriend has already done wonders <u>for</u> her artwork.
We're practically swimming in his money and <span class=SpellE>generousity</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:"Lucida Handwriting Italic"'>Darren doesn't need to
do this, right?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>Suddenly, there was a tentative knock on the door. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
looked up and smirked slightly while sitting up on the side of her bed and
putting her &quot;diary&quot; in her strongbox, locking it. She quietly bent
over and slid the box under her bed.</p>

<p>DARIA: (Thought <span class=SpellE>v.o</span>. as she sits up: Like
clockwork<span class=GramE>...:</span>) C'mon in, Quinn.</p>

<p>Quinn, dressed in her yellow nightgown with the pink bunny, entered with a
slight frown, shutting the door behind her.</p>

<p>QUINN: (Walking over as <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> <span class=GramE>stands:</span>)
How'd you know it was <i>me</i>, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>?</p>

<p>DARIA: Couldn't have been anyone else. (Reaches down, picks up, waves credit
<span class=GramE>card:</span>) Only <i>you</i> could've been near enough to
hone in on my card while it was lying out on my bed.</p>

<p>QUINN: (Rolls <span class=GramE>eyes:</span>) Oh, ha-ha, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>.
(Pauses, uneasy <span class=GramE>shrug:</span>) I, um, was just passing by
your room, and wanted to know--</p>

<p>DARIA: (<span class=GramE>Interrupts:</span>) --Whether or not I've checked
to see how much is on my card over the Internet yet?</p>

<p>QUINN: (<span class=GramE>Frowns:</span>) <i>Dar</i>--<span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>ia</span></span>! That is <i>so</i> not true! (Pauses to <span
class=SpellE>Daria's</span> crossed arms and doubtful expression, <span
class=GramE>sighs:</span>) Okay, it <i>is</i> true, I admit it! I'm dying to
know!</p>

<p>DARIA: (Brief, uneasy <span class=GramE>expression:</span>) Um, I haven't
checked, and truth be told, I don't think I want to.</p>

<p>QUINN: (Surprised look, <span class=GramE>gasps:</span>) Huh? Why not?</p>

<p>DARIA: Because I don't plan to ever use it, that's why not. I don't want to
be tempted to see the credit limit on Northolt's website. I might suddenly
become freaked out at the amount on it, or something.</p>

<p>QUINN: (Snorts, holds arms <span class=GramE>out:</span>) Oh, <span
class=SpellE><i>c'mooon</i></span>, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>! I'm sure
it's like, not that much anyway! (<span class=GramE>Pauses:</span>) You're not
at least a <i>little</i> curious over how much Darren's put on your card? I
mean, it's your duty to see how much it is, so, uh, you won't go over your
limit in case you have to use it for something!</p>

<p>DARIA: (Deadpan <span class=GramE>tone:</span>) Says the girl who goes
through credit cards like water goes through a sieve.</p>

<p>QUINN: (Cocks eye and <span class=GramE>head:</span>) Huh? A what? Isn't that
a company that makes those eyelash curlers?</p>

<p>DARIA: (<span class=GramE>Sighs:</span>) Never mind. (Pauses, <span
class=GramE>adds:</span>) Look, I'll make you a deal, since I suspect that I
won't get any peace from you if I don't do this--if I show you what I have on
my card, will you promise me that you won't tell any of your friends, and
anyone else at school? The last thing I need is for Kevin to try and get me to
buy him something stupid, like DVDs titled, &quot;Vince Lombardi's Greatest
Called Plays&quot;, and to sponsor a keg team party--</p>

<p>QUINN: (Mock-shocked <span class=GramE>look:</span>) --<span class=SpellE>Daria</span>!
Would <i>I</i> do that? (<span class=SpellE>Daria</span> gives her a &quot;You <b>would</b>&quot;
expression) Hey! I haven't said anything to anybody since I heard you were
getting the card, right?</p>

<p>DARIA: Only because mom <i>and</i> dad bribed you with their gold cards last
week while practically begging you to keep your trap shut. (Pauses, more somber
tone, <span class=GramE>look:</span>) Quinn, I'm really serious, okay? I don't
want this to get out--</p>

<p>QUINN: (Slowly smirks:) <i>We--ell</i>...what's in it for me to keep quiet, Daria?</p>

<p>DARIA: (Narrows eyes:) "Me", as innnn...?</p>

<p>QUINN: (Shakes head slowly, mock-admonishing look, playful tone:) Oh, Daria, Daria, Daria--must we play this game?</p>

<p>DARIA: (After a moment:) You're really gonna shake me down by getting me to give you some money off of my card, aren't you? (Pauses:) Wasn't it enough that you got some stuff off of our folk's cards?</p>

<p>QUINN: (Smacks mouth, rolls eyes:) Geez, Daria, what's the big deal? We agreed to keep getting money from mom and dad when they wanted us to do things we didn't like, remember, just not to Darren! Besides, it's not like we haven't done this before between us, you know...</p>

<p>DARIA: True, but we did our "business" in this way before Darren cropped up on the scene. ("Sighs":) I guess you haven't really changed, huh?</p>

<p>QUINN: (Frowns:) Now, wait a minute! I have too changed!</p>

<p>DARIA: Oh? How? You're basically wanting me to pay you to keep your mouth shut about my card, more than likely wanting a certain percentage off of it after I check the amount. (Adds, wry expression:) I wonder what our brother would think about what you're attempting to do...</p>

<p>QUINN: (Peeved, narrows eyes:) Don't you <i>dare</i> bring Darren into this, Daria!</p>

<p>DARIA: (Casual tone:) And why not? Should I agree to pay you a certain fee off of my card to keep quiet, and don't think for a second that I'm actually considering it, the bills will hit Darren's desk, since he's paying them. While it's likely that he wouldn't ask about my direct ATM withdrawals, he'll probably wonder to himself why in the hell I'm taking out so much money, since it's not exactly something <i>I</i> would do. He might even ask me sometime down the road what's up.</p>

<p>QUINN: (Pauses, now looking uneasy:) Um, d'you think he'd really do that? (Wide-eyed, gasps:) You wouldn't <i>tell</i> him why you're really doing it, would you?</p>

<p>DARIA: (Cocked eyebrow:) What do <i>you</i> think? That I'd keep quiet about what <i>you're</i> doing, taking money that's supposed to be mine to spend, just for me? Get real. The moment our brother would ask, even hinting indirectly what was up, I'd tell him everything, you can count on that, and you'd <i>know</i> he'd come straight to you, telling you how disappointed he is--</p>

<p>QUINN: (Groans, interrupts:) --Okay, okay! I get the message, and stuff! (Bites bottom lip, sighs, slumps:) I promise not to say anything to anybody about your card at school. Not to Sandi, not to Stacy, not to Tiffany, to nobody.</p>

<p>DARIA: (Looks her over, suspicious <span class=GramE>expression:</span>) <span
class=GramE>Hmmm...</span>I see your fingers aren't crossed, the same for your
toes. How about your heart--?</p>

<p>QUINN: (<span class=GramE>Frowns:</span>) <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>! I <i>said</i> I wouldn't tell anybody, and I really meant it! (Looks off, softer tone:) When I think about it now, I know Darren would probably <i>really</i> be mad at me if I told someone. (Adds:) I--don't wanna have that happen. I know he's put a lot of confidence in me about stuff...</p>

<p>DARIA: (Takes this in, long pause. It appears to her that Quinn's actually sincere, for a change:) Um, fair enough. (Sits down at her desk, turns on her computer and <span
class=GramE>monitor, small smirk:</span>) Anyway, as an added security measure, keep in mind that I know where you sleep. It's all just a
simple matter of my pillow in the middle of the night, your perky little face,
and it's onto oblivion from there.</p>

<p>QUINN: (Sneers, slight smirk as she looks over <span class=SpellE>Daria's</span>
<span class=GramE>shoulder:</span>) I'll, like, keep that in mind, and stuff.
(Pauses, adds with a <span class=GramE>pout:</span>) Still, I wish Darren could've
given <i>me</i> a Northolt card like you! <i>I'm</i> responsible! </p>

<p>DARIA: (While typing up the Northolt <span class=GramE>site:</span>) <span
class=GramE>Yeah, responsible like a fox guarding a henhouse.</span> (Quinn
glares down at her) Besides, Darren's told you that you'll get <span
class=SpellE>your's</span> when you're 18, you know, and you're already
receiving that monthly stipend from him like me, not to mention that mom's won her
little surprise settlement with the <i>Weekly Blabber</i>--? Why, you'll have a
100,000 more reasons to nag her for stuff between now and then.</p>

<p>QUINN: (<span class=GramE>Snorts:</span>) You heard mom's declaration. (In a
mock-tone of <span class=GramE>Helen:</span>) &quot;This money is going to be
invested for the future&quot;. (Rolls <span class=GramE>eyes:</span>) <i>Who's</i>
future? <span class=SpellE>Her's</span> and <span class=GramE>dad's</span>? By
the time they'll get to spend it, they'll both be so old, they won't know what
to do with it 'cause they'll be so senile, and stuff!</p>

<p>DARIA: (While still <span class=GramE>typing:</span>) If push comes to
shove, at least they'll have enough money to pay somebody to care for them in
their later years, though it wouldn't surprise me if our brother got them to
live under his palatial roof instead. (Pauses, narrows <span class=GramE>eyes:</span>)
Why, he'd become the new Jock Ewing. (Continues typing)</p>

<p>QUINN: (Makes a <span class=GramE>face:</span>) <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>Ew</span></span>! Jock straps are <i>so</i> unfashionable! (<span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> gives a tiny <span class=SpellE>eyeroll</span>,
continues typing)</p>

<p>DARIA: (<span class=GramE>Stops:</span>) Okay, it's asking for my card's number,
<span class=GramE>then</span> it wants me to create a password. (Turns to,
looks up at <span class=GramE>Quinn:</span>) Turn around.</p>

<p>QUINN: (Frowns down at <span class=GramE>her:</span>) Don't you trust me, <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>?</p>

<p>DARIA: (<span class=GramE>Smirks:</span>) <span class=GramE>Of course not, even after our little agreement over your keeping quiet about my card. This is something altogether different.</span> (Quinn narrows her eyes) Turn around.</p>

<p>QUINN: (Hard sigh as she turns completely <span class=GramE>around:</span>)
I don't see what the big deal is, you know. I couldn't use the dumb card,
anyway, only you could!</p>

<p>DARIA: (<span class=GramE>Types:</span>) This is true, but I wouldn't want
you to get online at any time, and use my password to see if I had brought
anything on my, now to you, suddenly "dumb card". That's <i>my</i> business.</p>

<p>QUINN: (Still facing <span class=GramE>away:</span>) I thought you said you
weren't <span class=SpellE>gonna</span> buy anything!</p>

<p>DARIA: I don't plan to, but in the event some serious emergency comes up, I
might not have any choice if I'm really short of cash on the spot. Unlike <i>you</i>,
I plan to be frugal with my money.</p>

<p>QUINN: (Snorts, looks halfway <span class=GramE>around:</span>) Huh, no
surprise <i>there</i>. (Adds, <span class=GramE>realizes:</span>) Besides, I'm
more careful with my money these days, or have you forgotten?</p>

<p>DARIA: (After a <span class=GramE>moment:</span>) No, I haven't. I have to
admit that you <i>have</i> been somewhat frugal, too. (Pauses, adds, wry smirk:) I've sneaked around and have seen those deposit slips concerning your savings account--</p>

<p>QUINN: (Deep frown, interrupts, cuts eyes over:) Hey! You have the nerve to look through <i>my</i> personal stuff, but then I can't look at what you have on your card? That's not fair!</p>

<p>DARIA: (Continues typing, slight frown of her own:) Don't blame <i>me</i> if you leave your slips lying around on your bed for everyone to see, and you have your door wide open! If I were you, I'd get a safety deposit box! (Quinn fumes at this, glares at the opposite wall. Daria relents, softens tone:) Look, I haven't seen you buy
anything, other than getting some stuff off of our folks. (Pauses, cocks an <span
class=GramE>eyebrow:</span>) So how <i>do</i> you explain the gold cards and
the $100,000 whining?</p>

<p>QUINN: (Evil grin:</span>)
Call them &quot;financial rewards&quot; for my good behavior, (adds quickly:) that's what I meant by sayin' I had changed, you know. (<span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> shows a brief smirk in admiration as she continues to
type) I think I deserve it. (Pauses, cuts eyes to her <span class=GramE>right:</span>)
You wouldn't even buy a good book with your card, or something, if you saw one
in a store, at least?</p>

<p>DARIA: (Stares at the screen, sits back, turns <span class=GramE>pale:</span>)
Unless that good book costs <i>$60,000</i>, no, um, not likely--(Quinn turns
around, stares over <span class=SpellE>Daria's</span> shoulder in wide-eyed
shock)</p>

<p>At that moment, a shocked Helen and Jake suddenly <span class=SpellE>barrelled</span>
into <span class=SpellE>Daria's</span> room, looking over <span class=SpellE>her's</span>
and Quinn shoulders as well. Quinn frowned in mild revulsion as Helen and Jake
practically squeezed her in. After an instant, Quinn broke free, now looking
over <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>their</i> shoulders.</p>

<p>HELEN: What in the world?! That much money's on your card, <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>?!</p>

<p>JAKE: Wow! $60,000 <span class=SpellE>smackeroos</span>, with up to $20,000
to draw out for cash at a bank, and up to a thousand at an ATM!</p>

<p>DARIA: (Perfectly calm of course as she turns around, looks up at <span
class=GramE>them:</span>) Yes, you may enter my room, Mom, Dad. (<span
class=GramE>Pauses:</span>) How long were you two listening at my door, if I
may inquire? (Adds, glances at Quinn uneasily, and vice-versa:) And um, what did you hear?</p>

<p>HELEN: (Red-faced with Jake, looking <span class=GramE>guilty:</span>) <span
class=SpellE>Uhh</span>, <span class=SpellE>er</span>, just a little bit,
sweetie. <span class=SpellE>Er</span>, since we're not as busy on our jobs as
we used to be, we, ah, just decided to suddenly come up here and spend some
time with you, right, Jake--? (Motions head)</p>

<p>JAKE: But honey, you said that you wanted to see if <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
had checked out her card, yet--(Helen slaps his shoulder) OW! (Suddenly gets
it, nods with his goofy <span class=GramE>grin:</span>) Uh, yeah! She's right,
Kiddo! We didn't even hear about Quinn making that crack about our old age your
mother's <span class=SpellE>gonna</span> punish her for! (Quinn moans. Helen
sighs. Jake <span class=GramE>frowns:</span>) No, wait--we <i>did</i> hear
that--(glares at <span class=GramE>Quinn:</span>) <span class=SpellE>dammit</span>,
Quinn!</p>

<p>QUINN: (Uneasy look, <span class=GramE>chuckle, inwardly relieved that's <b>all</b> their parents heard:</span>) Uh, look, it was
just a tiny little joke, Mom, Dad--</p>

<p>HELEN: (Wicked, slow smirk, which causes Quinn to give a massive <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>eyeroll</span></span><span class=GramE>:</span>)
We'll talk about that &quot;tiny little joke&quot; later, Quinn. (Turns to <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>, keeps <span class=GramE>smirk:</span>) Not to
mention <i>your</i> little crack about your father and I needing someone to
take care of us in our old age, sweetie. We've still got a very long ways to go
before we reach <i>that</i> stage. (<span class=SpellE>Daria</span> gives a
brief snort) Honey, your father and I know $60,000 is a tremendous amount of
money for you. We should've asked Darren how much he was planning to put on
this card. If you can't handle it, I'm sure we can tell your brother to lower
it--</p>

<p>DARIA: (Turns off her computer and <span class=GramE>monitor:</span>) <span
class=SpellE>Nahh</span>, I--(frowns, pauses, rises from her seat, turns to <span
class=GramE>them:</span>) <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE><i>Waaaitaminute</i></span></span><span
class=GramE>.</span> What do you mean, &quot;<i>If</i> I can't handle it?&quot;
You both just gave me a lecture about financial <span class=SpellE>responsibilty</span>,
and now you're telling me that you don't believe that I should have this much
money because you think I'll suddenly go on a spending binge that'll make Quinn's
look pale in comparison?</p>

<p>QUINN: (Grins <span class=GramE>wickedly:</span>) Yeah, as <i>if</i>--</p>

<p>JAKE: (Waves hands with Helen, wide-<span class=GramE>eyed:</span>) No, no,
Kiddo! It's not like that at all--</p>

<p>HELEN: (Frantic <span class=GramE>nod:</span>) Your Father's right, sweetie!
We know you're responsible, really! It's just that it never occurred to us that
your brother would put that much on your card! (Glances at Jake, who <span
class=GramE>nods:</span>) We figured at least--(pauses, <span class=GramE>shrugs:</span>)
oh, a thousand dollars or two--</p>

<p>QUINN: (Crosses arms, disdainful <span class=GramE>look:</span>) Oh, <i>please</i>.
Nothing less than at least $5,000 in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>this
</i>day and age, yeah, maybe--</p>

<p>JAKE: --But <i>60,000</i> bucks?! That's a <span class=SpellE>whooole</span>
<span class=SpellE>lotta</span> <span class=SpellE>moolah</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>!</p>

<p>DARIA: (After a moment, <span class=GramE>nods:</span>) Yeah, it is. I admit
it, you're right. However, now when I think about it, Darren wouldn't put that
much on my card if he didn't think I could handle it.</p>

<p>QUINN: (<span class=GramE>Nods:</span>) <span class=SpellE>Daria's</span>
got a point, Mom, Dad. (<span class=SpellE>Daria</span> drops an eyebrow in
suspicion. Quinn shows a small <span class=GramE>smirk:</span>) He probably
knows <span class=SpellE>Daria's</span> the <span class=GramE>type</span> who
wouldn't spend a penny on anything, save for the boring, drab stuff that people
like her use. (<span class=GramE>Shrugs:</span>) You know, you are what you
buy, and <span class=GramE>stuff.,.</span></p>

<p>HELEN: (Mild frown, admonishing tone:) Now, Quinn, I don't think you should say that about your sister--</p>

<p>DARIA: (Returns the <span class=GramE>smirk, interrupts:</span>) --Normally, I'd say that
you've actually gotten me pegged, Quinn, but just for that, I think I'll break out my
card, and use a few thou to hire a <span class=SpellE>hitman</span> to take you
out, and I don't mean to Chez Pierre. (Quinn licks her tongue out)</p>

<p>JAKE: (Wide-<span class=GramE>eyed:</span>) Helen! Did you hear that?! <span
class=SpellE>Daria's</span> <span class=SpellE>gonna</span> rub out her sister!
(<span class=GramE>Frowns:</span>) <span class=SpellE>Dammit</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>, there's no way I'm going to allow you to--</p>

<p>HELEN: (Massive <span class=SpellE>eyeroll</span>, <span class=GramE>interrupts:</span>)
--JAKE! Get a grip! <span class=SpellE>Daria's</span> only joking!</p>

<p>JAKE: (Snaps out <span class=GramE>it:</span>) Huh? (Looks between them all,
<span class=SpellE>embarassed</span>, <span class=GramE>grins:</span>) <span
class=SpellE>Heh</span>--of course! I knew that! Good one, Kiddo!</p>

<p>HELEN: (<span class=GramE>Sighs:</span>) Sweetie, you'll be 18 in a
week-and-a-half, so we guess you're close enough in age to make your own
decisions. If you feel that you have no problem with this amount on your card,
then your father and I won't say anything more about it, right, Jake?</p>

<p>JAKE: (Thumbs <span class=GramE>up:</span>) That's right, <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span>! Darren must really trust your <span class=SpellE>judgement</span>
to give you that much!</p>

<p>DARIA: (Pauses, ponders <span class=GramE>this:</span>) <span class=GramE>Um,
yeah.</span> I guess he does. <span class=GramE>(&quot;Yawns&quot;:)</span>
Well, if there's nothing else, I think I'll turn in for the night. <span
class=SpellE>Gotta</span> get that sleep for school, you know. <span
class=GramE>Can't afford to miss Mr. O'Neill's exciting class, and all that.</span></p>

<p>HELEN: (Glances at <span class=SpellE>Daria's</span> alarm clock. It only
reads &quot;<st1:time Minute="30" Hour="9">9:30</st1:time><span class=GramE>&quot;:</span>)
<span class=GramE>Um, of course, dear. (Smirks:) Oh, and Quinn--?</p>

<p>QUINN: (Cocked eyebrow:) Yeah, Mom?</p>

<p>HELEN: (Keeping the smirk:) Your sister's right. You <i>do</i> require a safety deposit box for your deposit slips, because <i>I</i> saw one as well the other day on your bed while I put your folded clothes up. (Daria shows a slight smirk, while Quinn rolls her eyes) First thing tomorrow, I'll get you one with your own key, okay?</p>

<p>QUINN: Um, okay, Mom. (Quickly adds:) Just make sure I get <i>both</i> keys to it, alright? (Glances at Daria:) I don't want <i>some</i> people trying to look in it, if you know what I mean...</p>

<p>HELEN: (Like Jake, mildly chuckles in response to Daria's now-glaring at Quinn:) Of course, sweetie. Goodnight, you two. (Leaves)</p>

<p>JAKE: (As he leaves behind <span class=GramE>her:</span>) Yeah, goodnight,
Kiddo, Princess!</p>

<p>DARIA: (<span class=GramE>Deadpan:</span>) Goodnight. Sleep tight. Don't let
those hungry bedbugs bite.</p>

<p>QUINN: (<span class=GramE>Shudders:</span>) <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>Ew</span></span>! <span class=GramE>Icky bedbugs?!</span></p>

<p>DARIA: (Turns to <span class=GramE>her:</span>) Don't worry, it's just a
play on words--(adds, tiny little evil <span class=GramE>smirk and "menancing" tone:</span>) unless
you don't change your <span class=SpellE>bedsheets</span> on a daily basis,
that is. Then, <span class=GramE>it's</span> open season on you with those <span
class=SpellE><i>tiiiiny</i></span> little dust mites, also known as the "bedbugs", that'll prey on your body
during the night, <i>slooowly</i> devouring your delicate, pink skin as you sleep--</p>

<p>QUINN: (Becoming <span class=GramE>nervous:</span>) Well, um, I've just
changed my <span class=SpellE>bedsheets</span> tonight, so I'm not worried--</p>

<p>DARIA: (Looks up, mock-<span class=GramE>ponders, back in her normal voice:</span>) --Or is that <i>when</i>
you change your <span class=SpellE>bedsheets</span>? Now, I'm not quite so
sure--</p>

<p>QUINN: (Now <span class=GramE>uncomfortable:</span>) <span class=SpellE>Uhhh</span>,
I think I'll just leave--</p>

<p>DARIA: (&quot;Frowns&quot; in deep <span class=GramE>thought:</span>)
--Maybe it's a combination of both, upon further consideration--(Quinn bolts
from the room into her own, slamming her bedroom door. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
shows a rare grin as she quietly shuts her own <span class=GramE>door:</span>)
Yep, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, you've <i>still</i> got it. Knowing
Quinn, she'll probably be either snoring on the floor in her sleeping bag, or
lying on a bare <span class=SpellE>matress</span> come the morning. I really
should stop with the mind games on her--(<span class=GramE>pauses:</span>) <span
class=SpellE><i>nahhh</i></span>.</p>

<p><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> paused, <span class=GramE>then</span> looked
down at her card.</p>

<p><span class=GramE><i>$60,000.</i></span><i> Also $20,000 I could draw out of
the bank immediately. I could buy just about anything with this, if I wanted. <span
class=GramE>Perhaps a new car to drive around town in.</span> <span
class=GramE>Nah.</span> I usually can either drive <span class=GramE>mom's</span>
or dad's in a pinch, or ride with Tom in his when I don't need to walk. Lawndale's not exactly the size of New York City.
Besides, if I bought one, Quinn would pester me to lug her and her fashion
zombie buddies around. I couldn't take that, no matter what...</i></p>

<p><span class=GramE><i>Books?</i></span><i> Sure, I could buy those, but then,
Darren's got a whole load at his place that I could read anytime. I was <span
class=SpellE>gonna</span> get some anyway from him, since the Car--Lawndale
County board of commissioners last week had cut the county funding for that
proposed new library building to replace the old one we currently have. I guess
they needed the extra money for the really important things, like that new
practice field for </i><st1:City><st1:place><i>Lawndale</i></st1:place></st1:City><i>
High's football team I read about in the Lowdown...</i></p>

<p><span class=SpellE><span class=GramE><i>Hm</i></span></span><span
class=GramE><i>.</i></span><i> I'll definitely need some new clothes for
college, though I'm in no hurry to purchase any, of course. I can imagine <span
class=SpellE>Quinn'll</span> have a conniption when she falls all over herself
on insisting on helping me to buy some so she--</i></p>

<p><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> slapped her forehead with her free hand.</p>

<p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i>AGH! </i></b><span class=SpellE><i>Dammit</i></span><i>!
I can't <b>believe</b> I'm doing this! I just said that I wouldn't buy anything
with this damn card, and now here I am considering buying everything my greedy
little heart desires! I'm becoming Quinn! Nice work with the personal ethics, <span
class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>. Repeat to <span class=GramE>yourself</span>:
I will not use this card. I will not use this card. I will not use this card...</i></p>

<p><span class=SpellE>Daria</span> paused yet again, <span class=GramE>then</span>
looked down at her card again. This time she slightly smirked.</p>

<p><i>Except for pizza when Henri doesn't fix it, and I'm out with Tom or Jane.
Yes, definitely for pizza...</i></p>

<p>The next instant, her room phone rang. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
casually tossed her card on her bed, and began to make her way to the phone.
Before she could reach it, it stopped ringing.</p>

<p>DARIA: (Thought <span class=SpellE>v.o</span>.: Either somebody here has
already gotten it, or it was a wrong number, and the other party hung up, or
the phone <span class=SpellE>suddenly's</span> got a mind of <span class=GramE>it's</span>
own, and doesn't want me to answer it. If it's the phone, I'm <span
class=SpellE>outta</span> here.)</p>

<p>Immediately, there was a quick knock on her door. Almost as immediately, a
frowning Quinn opened the door, and walked in.</p>

<p>QUINN: It's Jane on the line. (<span class=GramE>Adds:</span>) I just spoke
to mom about those bedbugs, dust mites, or whatever, and she said there was no such thing.</p>

<p>DARIA: (Tiny Mona Lisa <span class=GramE>smile:</span>) Actually, there is.
I just told you a half-truth about them eating your skin while you sleep. In a
way, they really <i>do</i> eat your skin, but only when it's dead and fallen
off your body, and it doesn't have to be while you're sleeping. They're so
tiny, you really can't see them. Practically just about every home in the world
has them. The mites travel on visitors to other homes who might not have them,
so more than likely, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>we</i> have them,
since your friends and Jane show up here often, or we go to their homes. (Quinn
stares at her uneasily for a moment, <span class=GramE>then</span> glances
around as if she's trying to see them) You can look it up on your laptop for
further info, if you don't believe me.</p>

<p>QUINN: (Now briefly smirks after a moment, <span class=GramE>snorts:</span>)
Real funny, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, playing with me like that. (Crosses
<span class=GramE>arms, small smirk:</span>) Maybe I <i>should</i> tell a "half-truth" to the whole
school about your having that Northolt card, even risking Darren getting mad at me.</p>

<p>DARIA: (Showing no emotion, but in a subtly dangerous low tone, <span
class=GramE>deadpan:</span>) <span class=GramE>Then how about the <i>full</i>
truth from me, Quinn?</span> Darren's anger would be the <i>least</i> of your worries if you open your mouth. (Narrows <span class=GramE>eyes:</span>) I'll
break off and gnaw on your bones if I even <i>hear</i> the word
&quot;Northolt&quot; from any of our classmates at school, whether or not it's
directed at me.</p>

<p>Quinn stared at her, wide-eyed for an instant, then quickly left, slamming <span
class=SpellE>Daria's</span> door. <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> smirked. <st1:City><st1:place><i
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mission</i></st1:place></st1:City><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> accomplished. </i>She went beside her bed,
and picked up her phone.</p>

<p>DARIA: I got it, Quinn. (There is a click from the other end) <span
class=GramE>Hey, Jane.</span> (Jane, dressed in her usual bedclothes, appears
via a &quot;split screen&quot;. She's at her canvas in her room, holding her
cell phone in her left hand, while painting with her right one. We can't
&quot;see&quot; what it is she's painting, for the back of the canvas is only
shown.)</p>

<p>JANE: <span class=SpellE>Yo</span>! Did I catch you at a bad time, <span
class=SpellE>amiga</span>?</p>

<p>DARIA: I just insulted my sister by playing with her mind, <span
class=SpellE>sooooo</span>, <span class=GramE>no</span>.</p>

<p>JANE: (<span class=GramE>Snickers:</span>) <span class=GramE>Figures.</span>
(Light, casual tone as she <span class=GramE>paints:</span>) So, did you check
the credit limit on that Northolt card you got today yet?</p>

<p>DARIA: Yeah, as a matter of fact, I--(pauses, drops an <span class=GramE>eyebrow:</span>)
hold it. I didn't tell you yet that the card came in this afternoon. How'd you
know?</p>

<p>JANE: (Pauses painting for a moment, <span class=GramE>shrugs:</span>) How
else? Darren told me over the phone when he called earlier that he expected the
card to be there today. (Continues painting)</p>

<p>DARIA: Oh. Well, yeah, I checked.</p>

<p>JANE: (Amused <span class=GramE>grin:</span>) What did you think about that
$60,000 on it?</p>

<p>DARIA: (<span class=GramE>Sighs:</span>) You knew about <i>that</i>, too?</p>

<p>JANE: But of course. Darren wanted you to be surprised by the amount.</p>

<p>DARIA: (Picks up the <span class=GramE>card:</span>) Oh, I was
&quot;surprised&quot;, alright. So was the rest of my family.</p>

<p>JANE: Bet Quinn fell all over herself at the amount, huh?</p>

<p>DARIA: She figuratively did a 360 degree <span class=SpellE>backflip</span>,
along with my mom and dad. They both thought that my brother would have put far
less on it--(<span class=GramE>pauses:</span>) like me. This <span
class=SpellE>kinda</span> blows my mind.</p>

<p>JANE: (Cocked <span class=GramE>eyebrow:</span>) It does? Why? It's
basically a birthday present, right?</p>

<p>DARIA: (Sits on her <span class=GramE>bed:</span>) It's more than just a
&quot;birthday present&quot;. It's no different than if he had given me $60,000 outright,
Jane. Darren didn't have to give me this card, just a good book, or something.
I would've been more than happy. (Pauses, slightly pained <span class=GramE>expression:</span>)
Um, I think it had something to do with his still feeling guilty, you know,
about that &quot;sting&quot; he did to me to take the writing job.</p>

<p>JANE: (While still <span class=GramE>painting:</span>) <span class=SpellE>Annnd</span>,
you think this is his way of paying you back, sort of a &quot;bribe&quot;, is
that it?</p>

<p>DARIA: (Slight frown and irritated <span class=GramE>tone:</span>) Well,
when you put it like <i>that</i>--</p>

<p>JANE: <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>, even though Darren might be <span
class=SpellE>kinda</span> <span class=SpellE>sorta</span> doing that, what's
the big deal? You've taken money from your folks and Quinn, either when they've
done something to you that you didn't like to get you to forgive them, and in
Quinn's case, for blackmail, or to get you to do something that <i>you</i>
didn't like. How's Darren any different?</p>

<p>DARIA: (Tries to rationalize this, for Jane's hit the nail on the head here.
<span class=GramE>Pauses:</span>) Look, Jane, Darren's--well, Darren's a guy
who I can get money from anytime, right?</p>

<p>JANE: Right. (<span class=GramE>Pauses:</span>) And--?</p>

<p>DARIA: (Looks off for a <span class=GramE>moment:</span>) And thus, he's no,
um, challenge for me to hit him up for <span class=SpellE>moolah</span>, as
opposed to my parents. Quinn and I even made an agreement that we wouldn't try to finagle anything from him, just our folks. After all, he's already giving us money, right? (Uneasy shrug:) It would be too easy, like taking <i>Waif</i> from a
Quinn.</p>

<p>JANE: (Slight <span class=GramE>frown:</span>) Amiga, give me a break. I
don't buy that B.S. attempt at logic anymore than you do. I think you simply
want a brother without any strings attached, as opposed to getting into those
usual monetary games with the rest of your family. Darren's paying you some
attention, some <i>real</i> attention as a brother, but he's trying to do it in
a genuine way. You merely wish to return the favor by simply being a sister to
him with no strings attached, in this case, his <span class=SpellE>moolah</span>.</p>

<p>DARIA: (Stands, pauses at this for a moment, slightly <span class=GramE>smirks:</span>)
<span class=SpellE>Dammit</span>, am I <i>that</i> obvious, Dr. Lane?</p>

<p>JANE: (<span class=GramE>Smirks:</span>) I'm afraid so, my beleaguered
patient. (Pauses, uneasy <span class=GramE>look:</span>) Ah, are you planning
on turning down Darren's card because of the amount, or asking him to lower it?
He seemed to be really happy that you accepted it.</p>

<p>DARIA: (Glances at her credit card, <span class=GramE>ponders:</span>) <span
class=GramE>Nah.</span> (Jane looks relieved) My dad of all people said something
that really <span class=SpellE>kinda</span> got to me. He said that Darren must
really trust my <span class=SpellE>judgement</span> to have put that much money
on the card.</p>

<p>JANE: (Quieter <span class=GramE>tone:</span>) I think we both know that's
obvious. (There's suddenly a click on the line) Hey, is somebody trying to call
you? I don't think that's from my end--</p>

<p>DARIA: <span class=SpellE>Hm</span>, I think you're right, Jane.</p>

<p>JANE: (<span class=GramE>Nods:</span>) More than likely, it's probably
Darren, wanting to find out your reaction to his gift. He said that he wanted
to call you before he and Curtis had finished their studying, and just before he went to bed. I'll get off the line so you can talk to
him, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>. See you in school tomorrow. (<span
class=GramE>Smirks:</span>) Try not to gush too much while you're thanking him
for his incredible <span class=SpellE>generousity</span>.</p>

<p>DARIA: (<span class=GramE>Deadpan:</span>) Jane, this card <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can</i> pay for your funeral in full,
remember that.</p>

<p>JANE: (<span class=GramE>Chuckles:</span>) That will be taken under
advisement, <span class=SpellE>amiga</span>. <span class=GramE>Later.</span> <span
class=GramE>(Clicks off her phone.</span> The &quot;split screen&quot; goes to
Daria's side)</p>


<p>Daria clicked off her phone, then on.</p>


<p>DARIA: Hello? (Slight smile:) Hey, Darren. (Pauses:) Yeah, I just got the card in today. (Pauses, smirks:) <i>Oh</i> yeah, I saw the amount on Northolt's website, um, thanks. (Quickly adds:) Now I can buy that missile and launcher I've always dreamed of to destroy Lawndale...(chuckling is heard from the other end)</p>




<p align=center>**********</p>



<p><i>(Scene Two: Casa Lane, Jane's room. Jane, having just tossed her cell phone on her bed, has immediately resumed her painting, this time narrowing her eyes, as if she's in deeper concentration, which she is)</i></p>



<p>After a moment, <st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>, carrying
what appeared to be a garbage bag in the hallway, stopped at Jane's open door.
He cocked an eyebrow at her painting, sat his bag down in the hallway, and
quietly walked in, going over to her from behind.</p>

<p><st1:City><st1:place>TRENT</st1:place></st1:City>: (Looking over her <span
class=GramE>shoulder:</span>) Whoa. It looks like you've put in some pretty
intense work there, <span class=SpellE>Janey</span>.</p>

<p>JANE: Thanks, <st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>,
I--(suddenly becomes wide-eyed, turns around, panicked, spreads <span
class=GramE>arms:</span>) AGH! What in the <i>hell</i> are you doing in my
room?!</p>

<p><st1:City><st1:place>TRENT</st1:place></st1:City>: (Taken aback for a <span
class=GramE>moment:</span>) Huh? <span class=SpellE>Uhh</span>, your door was
open, and I just walked in. Sorry, I didn't know you didn't want to be
disturbed.</p>

<p>JANE: (Glances over at her door, thought <span class=SpellE>v.o</span>.: <span
class=SpellE>Dammit</span>, he's right. I should've had it shut. Nice
Kevin-like move, Lane. You should've just painted it in <st1:City><st1:place><span
  class=SpellE>Trent</span></st1:place></st1:City><span class=SpellE>'s</span>
room<span class=GramE>.:</span>) Oh. Um, that's okay. (Quickly <span
class=GramE>adds:</span>) Look, about this painting--</p>

<p><st1:City><st1:place>TRENT</st1:place></st1:City>: (Slight smile, gently <span
class=GramE>interrupts:</span>) --It's okay, <span class=SpellE>Janey</span>.
I'm not angry at you for doing it.</p>

<p>JANE: --I did it because---(pauses, for it's finally <span class=GramE>registering:</span>)
hah? You're <i>not</i> pissed that I did this? (Jane steps aside, motions with
her arm. We now &quot;see&quot; that it's a painting of a terrified <span class=SpellE>Krystal</span>,
who's lying on her back, spread eagle, on the bare ground in an unknown
mountain range. [She's fully clothed, sorry!] Her arms and hands are tied to
wooden stakes. She is staring up, wide-eyed, and mouth open. <span
class=SpellE>Krystal</span> is also engulfed in a huge shadow, as if something
above is about to fall on her--and it is. At the top <span class=GramE>of<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Jane's</span> canvas, there is a just a bit
of what appears to be the bottom of a huge, spiked boulder.)</p>

<p><st1:City><st1:place>TRENT</st1:place></st1:City>: (Shrugs, chuckles, <span
class=GramE>coughs:</span>) No, I'm not. You're an artist, and this is how you
express yourself, and stuff, like me with my music. We have to have outlets, or
something, or another. Besides, I expected that you'd do this.</p>

<p>JANE: (Utterly dumbfounded <span class=GramE>expression:</span>) You DID?</p>

<p><st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City> wordlessly smirked and
nodded. He went over to Jane's bed and sat down on the edge. <st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>
patted a spot beside him gently, motioning Jane to sit. A still-dumbfounded
Jane walked stiffly over, and quietly sat down. She looked over at <st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>
warily.</p>

<p><st1:City><st1:place>TRENT</st1:place></st1:City>: (After a moment, very low
<span class=GramE>tone:</span>) <span class=SpellE>Janey</span>, I know that
you don't really like <span class=SpellE>Krystal</span>. I know you've been <span
class=SpellE>kinda</span> trying to be nice around me when I say <span
class=SpellE>Krystal's</span> name, and stuff. (Jane stares at him, stunned) I
think I <span class=SpellE>sorta</span> saw it right when I first started to
see <span class=SpellE>Krystal</span>, and I think I know why.</p>

<p>JANE: (Swallows <span class=GramE>hard:</span>) You---you DO?</p>

<p><st1:City><st1:place>TRENT</st1:place></st1:City>: Sure. You think if things
get anymore serious between me and <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Krystal</span></span><span
class=GramE>, that</span> she's <span class=SpellE>gonna</span> replace you somehow
in my life. <span class=SpellE>Janey</span>, no matter what happens between <span
class=SpellE>Krystal</span> and <span class=GramE>me</span>, you and I will
always be brother and sister, that won't change. We've got a bond that nobody
will ever break.</p>

<p>Jane merely continued to stare at <st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>
in disbelief, not knowing what to make of this, both by her brother's surprise
reaction to her painting, and his remarkably poignant and touching remark about
their sibling relationship, even though his reasoning about her and Krystal was
obviously off the mark. Jane decided to go along with this--for now. <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>No need to tell </i><st1:City><st1:place><i
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Trent</i></st1:place></st1:City><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> what I really think about <span
class=SpellE>Krystal</span>, since I can't prove it at the moment</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: (Slight smile, quieter <span class=GramE>tone:</span>) Uh, well,
I--guess that's ri--(pauses, realizes, slight <span class=GramE>frown:</span>)
hey, waitasec! Are you saying that I feel sort of <i>threatened</i> by your
having Krystal as a girlfriend? That she'd somehow &quot;replace&quot; me?
Because I'm not, you know!</p>

<p><st1:City><st1:place>TRENT</st1:place></st1:City>: (Pauses, confused <span
class=GramE>look:</span>) Ummm, you're not?</p>

<p>JANE: (Stands, throws arms <span class=GramE>open:</span>) Of course not! I
wasn't like that when you started to go out with Monique, (adds under her <span
class=GramE>breath:</span>) at least at first. (Through subtly gritted teeth,
resumes her <span class=GramE>tone:</span>) I mean, if you're happy with--<i>her</i>,
<span class=GramE>then</span> I'm happy for you!</p>

<p><st1:City><st1:place>TRENT</st1:place></st1:City>: (Thinks, narrows eyes,
rubs chin, <span class=GramE>stands:</span>) Hmmm. (<span class=GramE>Pauses:</span>)
Then why <i>did</i> you paint Krystal like that?</p>

<p>JANE: (Wide-eyed, thought v.o.: Oh, poopie. <span class=GramE>Me and my big
mouth.</span> Think, Lane, think!) (Phony <span class=GramE>smile:</span>)
Beeecause it's my attempt at a joke about her, that's why! (<st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>
gives her a <b>very</b> odd look) See, I'm just razzing Krystal by painting
this, 'cause, ah, I'm gonna give it to her as a welcome gift! Yeah, that's it!
A freakin' welcome gift! <span class=GramE>(Thought v.o.: Oy.)</span></p>

<p><st1:City><st1:place>TRENT</st1:place></st1:City>: (Narrows <span
class=GramE>eyes:</span>) Hmmmm. (Shrugs, small <span class=GramE>smile:</span>)
That's pretty cool, sis. (Looks at painting <span class=GramE>again:</span>) I
think Krystal's gonna like her gift.</p>

<p>JANE: (Thought v.o.: I <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>was </b>planning
to hang it up in here, and look at it to cheer myself up whenever I got
depressed, but, what the hell.:)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>I'm
sure she <span class=GramE>will</span>, bro. (Thought <span class=SpellE>v.o</span>.
wicked smirk: I can always paint another one, and now when I think about it,
this could send a blunt warning message to <span class=SpellE>Krystal</span> if
she hurts <st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>, too...)</p>

<p><st1:City><st1:place>TRENT</st1:place></st1:City>: (Starts to <span
class=GramE>leave:</span>) Well, I'm <span class=SpellE>gonna</span> go, <span
class=SpellE>Janey</span>. I just finished cleaning my room to get it ready for
when <span class=SpellE>Krystal</span> visits us, and after I take this last bag
of garbage out, I'm <span class=SpellE>gonna</span> hit the sack--</p>

<p>JANE:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Yeah, ok--(wide-eyed, <span
class=GramE>realizes:</span>) you just cleaned WHAT?</p>

<p><st1:City><st1:place>TRENT</st1:place></st1:City>: (Stops, turns to <span
class=GramE>her:</span>) I just--(Jane zooms past him into the hallway. <st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>
looks after her, <span class=GramE>dazed:</span>) huh? (Follows her)</p>

<p>Jane had vanished into <st1:City><st1:place><span class=SpellE>Trent</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
class=SpellE>'s</span> room as he followed her in. </p>

<p>JANE: (From inside, mock-<span class=GramE>amazement:</span>)<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span><span class=GramE>The hell--?</span> What's
this I'm standing on? It looks so--bare!</p>

<p><st1:City><st1:place>TRENT</st1:place></st1:City>: (Ditto, droll tone after
a moment, <span class=GramE>annoyed:</span>) It's called the &quot;floor&quot;, <span
class=SpellE>Janey</span>.</p>

<p>JANE: (Still in her mock-amazement tone, from <span class=GramE>inside:</span>)
And what are those flat, smooth, bare barriers that are surrounding me? I don't
think I've seen those in a <span class=SpellE>looong</span> while. What they're
called escapes me at the moment--</p>

<p><st1:City><st1:place>TRENT</st1:place></st1:City>: (Still in his droll,

<p>Rory shut off his computer and monitor, <span class=GramE>then</span>
frowned deeply. He wordlessly rose from his desk, and left his bedroom. After a
moment, he walked over to <span class=SpellE>Krystal's</span> bedroom door, which was right across the hallway, <span
class=GramE>then</span> knocked.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>KRYSTAL: (From behind her <span class=GramE>door:</span>) Come in! </p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Rory walked in and quietly shut the door behind him, still with his frown. <span
class=SpellE>Krystal</span>, writing at her desk, and dressed in her
nightclothes, looked up at him, cocking an amused eyebrow. She was surrounded
by her accounting books, both on her desk, and on the floor.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>KRYSTAL: (<span class=GramE>Snorts:</span>) May I help you?</p>

<p>RORY: Why, yes, as a matter of fact you can, you bitch. (<span class=SpellE>Krystal</span>
gives him a &quot;<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>What</b> did you say?&quot;
look) You told Stacy's friend Quinn <span class=SpellE>Morgendorffer</span>
when she visited with her frigid bitch sister a few weeks back that I was
talking to Stacy over the Internet, didn't you?</p>

<p>KRYSTAL: (<span class=GramE>Stands:</span>) <span class=GramE>Pardon?</span>
(<span class=GramE>Frowns:</span>) What in the hell are you babbling about,
Rory? Where'd <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>this</i> come from?</p>

<p>RORY: (Walks over, <span class=GramE>scowling:</span>) Don't play innocent
with me, <span class=SpellE>Krystal</span>! Stacy just told me in a virtual <span
class=SpellE>chatroom</span> that her friends suspect that I'm talking to her!
(Goes up to <span class=GramE>her:</span>) The only way she could've known <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>that</i> was when you told Quinn! Didn't I
tell you if I wanted to see Stacy Rowe, that it was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>my</i> business? Remember what I said to you what I'd do if you tried
to interfere? (<span class=GramE>Pauses:</span>) <span class=GramE>&quot;Sty Lark&quot;?</span>
(<span class=GramE>Pauses:</span>) &quot;Darren&quot;? (<span class=SpellE>Krystal</span>
narrows her eyes) Yeah, that's right, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>that</i>.
(Begins to turn away)</p>
<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p><span class=SpellE>Krystal</span> suddenly grabbed a surprised Rory by his
collar, and flipped him on his back as she slammed him on her bed. She
straddled him as she tightly held his collar, so much so that she had twisted
it around her fist, up to his throat. Rory found <span class=GramE>himself</span>
barely able to breathe.</p>

<p>KRYSTAL:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>(Low snarl and <span
class=GramE>whisper:</span>) Let's get something straight, you ass--it's true
that I heard something to the effect that you may have been &quot;speaking&quot; to
Stacy, but for your damn information, it was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Quinn</i> who told me herself, or rather it was Darren who did! He told
me Quinn had said Stacy had mentioned wanting to see you again at their lame
high school one day, but suddenly said that she didn't mean it like that! Quinn
and her friends then suspected she was somehow seeing you! I didn't say a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>damn</i> thing to anybody! They figured it
out on their own!</p>

<p>RORY: (Pauses after a moment, ponders this as he tries to <span class=GramE>breathe:</span>)
Let's--just say that I believe you, and at the moment, I still don't. (<span
class=GramE>Gasps:</span>) Why didn't you say anything to me about it since
then?</p>

<p>KRYSTAL: (Slow, feral <span class=GramE>smirk:</span>) Because you didn't
want me to &quot;interfere&quot;, remember? </p>

<p>RORY: (Gasping again, <span class=GramE>frowns:</span>) Slick little--you'd
like that, wouldn't you? <span class=GramE>For me to be caught?</span></p>

<p>KRYSTAL: (<span class=GramE>Grins:</span>) It would sure as hell make it
easier for me if you were out of my life, Rory, I admit that.</p>

<p>RORY: (Returns <span class=GramE>grin:</span>) Just as I'm sure it would be
for <st1:Street><st1:address>Jane Lane</st1:address></st1:Street> if you were
out of her brother's life, eh, sis? (<span class=SpellE>Krystal</span> squeezes
his collar tighter) ACK! Cut--it--out--<span class=SpellE>Krystal</span>!
I'm---really--choking--here!</p>

<p>KRYSTAL: (Glares, through clenched teeth, draws <span class=GramE>closer:</span>)
Your point <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>being</i>--?</p>

<p>RORY:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>(Cuts eyes down, manages weak <span
class=GramE>smile:</span>) How---about---this--?
You're---turning---me---on---since---I---can---gasp---see---your---boobs?</p>

<p>Krystal gave Rory a disgusted look, then released him. She wordlessly
climbed off of him, and stood on the floor. Rory rubbed his neck as he stood
up.</p>

<p>KRYSTAL: I swear, Rory, if you do something bad to Stacy, I don't give a
damn <i>what</i> you say to Darren <i>or</i> our parents about &quot;Sty
Lark&quot;. I will mercilessly kick your sick, sorry, ass.</p>

<p>RORY: So noted, sis. However, I intend to see the little &quot;Nibblet&quot;
while you're visiting the slacker-slash-bum in that &quot;Lawndale&quot; place.
(Krystal narrows an eye) We're going to experience the sights and sounds of
Baltimore.</p>

<p>KRYSTAL: As I recover from your rather audacious and blatant announcement,
of which I'll further ask about in a moment, I must wonder as to how you're
planning to do this while you're going to school, if I may ask? White Plains
community college's schedule doesn't exactly coincide with Eastward's.</p>

<p>RORY: This is true. (Pauses:) See, I've decided to forgo my final year at my
beloved community college to pursue my new roving businessman's job full-time.
School has no more interest to me. Mr. Smith has asked if I could devote more
time to it, and I said yes. I could make loads more money working for him than
I could in my undecided major.</p>

<p>KRYSTAL: Ah, I see. (Sneers, doubtful tone:) And you've done such a <i>wonderful</i>
job so fast, that &quot;Preston Smith&quot; now wants you full-time. (<span
class=GramE>Smirks:</span>) Mummy and daddy are okay with this? I know our daddy
won't let you live under &quot;his&quot; roof, and lay around, job or no.</p>

<p>RORY: Couldn't agree with you more, so I'll be moving out as soon as
possible. (Krystal's mouth drops in shock. Rory <span class=GramE>smirks:</span>)
See? I'll be out of your life for real, sis. Don't ever say I didn't do you any
favors.</p>

<p>KRYSTAL: You're--<i>serious</i> about this? (Scowls:) Don't screw with me,
Rory.</p>

<p>RORY: (Chuckles <span class=GramE>disdainfully:</span>) That would be an
interesting thought if it wasn't so sick and wrong, <span class=SpellE>Krystal</span>--(grins
in a suggestive manner, leans forward, which actually makes <span class=SpellE>Krystal</span>
<span class=GramE>cringe:</span>) <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>right</i>?
(Pauses, backs <span class=GramE>off:</span>) No, it's true.</p>

<p>KRYSTAL: (After a <span class=GramE>moment:</span>) If you're serious, then
it's the best news I've ever heard in my life. Where in the hell are you going
when you move out, brother dear? New York City?</p>

<p>RORY: (Mock-gasps:) Why, you're a freaking psychic, sis. Mr. Smith even
helped me pick out a nice apartment in Menlo Park. (Krystal frowns for an instant, confused. Rory picks up on this, grins:) No, not where Thomas Edison once spewed out his inventions in New Jersey. This is a newly-redeveloped upscale tenement named after that place, as a matter of fact. It's not that far from Park Avenue. After I get settled in, I'll
even invite you and our parents so I can rub your snotty little face in my
success.</p>

<p>KRYSTAL: I'd rather rub <i>your</i> snotty little face into the ground.
(Pauses, narrows <span class=GramE>eyes:</span>) If I had any doubts that you
weren't up to something illegal with this elusive &quot;Preston Smith&quot;
character, they're gone now. He's paying you to smuggle some drugs into the
country, isn't he?</p>

<p>RORY: (Rolls eyes:) Oh, please. I know you've been checking around and hadn't
found anything...</p>

<p>KRYSTAL: That's right, I have. Nothing on this &quot;Preston Smith&quot;, <span class=GramE>which is even more
suspicious.</span> <span class=SpellE>I've</span> checked on the Internet, and
found nothing as well. (<span class=GramE>Pauses, narrows eyes:</span>) Does he live overseas, or
something, is that it?</p>

<p>RORY: (Now <span class=GramE>annoyed:</span>) I <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>told</i> you that I'm clean, now. No more illegal activities.</p>

<p>KRYSTAL: Except going out with underaged girls. (<span class=GramE>Pauses:</span>)
Why <i>did</i> you tell me about your meeting Stacy Rowe in <st1:City><st1:place>Baltimore</st1:place></st1:City>
while I'm in <st1:City><st1:place>Lawndale</st1:place></st1:City>?</p>

<p>RORY: (Grins:) Simple, sis. If I'm caught with Stacy, I'll assume that you
told them, and I'll make a beeline straight to Darren, and tell him about
&quot;Sty Lark&quot;--or I will when I get out of jail on bail, whatever. In
other words, if I go down, <i>you'll</i> go down with me. I'm counting on you
to discourage her buddies from following her to Baltimore, if they suspect
anything.</p>

<p>KRYSTAL: (<span class=GramE>Scowls:</span>) WHAT?! You bastard! Don't you <i>dare</i>
drag me into your sick schemes!</p>

<p>RORY: (Chuckles:) Too late, sis. You're in it deep. Call it my
&quot;punishment&quot; to you over keeping your mouth shut concerning Stacy's
friends suspecting us. (Yawns, <span class=GramE>stretches:</span>) Well, I'm
tired. I think I'll call that &quot;Sherri&quot; chick before I turn in. (To <span
class=SpellE>Krystal's</span> <span class=GramE>scowl:</span>) She's some girl
I met yesterday, someplace. <span class=GramE>Forgot where, though.</span> Ah,
well. (<span class=GramE>Shrugs:</span>) Got her phone number, you know. She's
hot! <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>G'night</span></span><span
class=GramE>, sis.</span> (Leaves)</p>

<p>Krystal glared silently after her brother as he left. She looked as if she
wanted to follow, but her phone began to ring. She glared once more at her
door, then went over to answer the phone.</p>

<p>KRYSTAL: (<span class=GramE>Curt:</span>) Hello? (Pauses, surprised <span
class=GramE>look:</span>) <st1:City><st1:place>Trent</st1:place></st1:City>? (<span
class=GramE>Pauses:</span>) What? (<span class=GramE>Pauses:</span>) Is something
wrong? (Sighs, glances at her <span class=GramE>door:</span>) There's--nothing
wrong. I'm just tired, (quickly adds, &quot;perky&quot; <span class=GramE>tone:</span>)
not that I'm tired of talking to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>you</i>,
that is. I'm sorry I sounded so snappy. I'm glad you called, as a matter of
fact. I need some comforting words from you--sweetie. (Pauses, smirks:) So,
how's Jane? I'll bet she's really eager to see me when I visit, huh...?</p>

Tell me about it. Man, I'm beat. I'm glad I only have two classes tomorrow, and
they're not until the late morning. All the other professors are getting off

you plan to be doing during the break?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>CURTIS: (<span class=GramE>Shrugs:</span>)
Funny you should ask. Honestly? I don't know. Unlike you, I don't have any real
plans. (<span class=GramE>Chuckles:</span>) Get this--my dad of all people is
giving me time off from his firm--<i>with </i>pay! (Darren's eyebrows rise in
shock) Yeah, I can't believe it, either! He says that I've done such a good job
there, and have had such good grades at school, that I've earned it--not that I'm
disagreeing with him, mind you. (<span class=GramE>Sighs:</span>) Thing is,
this means I have nothing to do. Talk about irony.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>DARREN: (After a <span class=GramE>moment:</span>)
Well, uh, I'm sure someone--I mean<span class=GramE>,</span> something will come

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>CURTIS: (<span class=SpellE>Embarassed</span>
<span class=GramE>expression:</span>) <span class=GramE>Uh, yeah, sorry about
that.</span> (Hangs <span class=GramE>head:</span>) God, I miss her. (Darren
appears to be about to speak, Curtis interrupts, slight <span class=GramE>scowl:</span>)
And no, I don't want you to offer to fly me down there to visit her, so drop
it. (Notices Darren's surprised look, lightens <span class=GramE>tone:</span>) You
know that my eating you out of house and home here is enough of a handout.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>DARREN: (Slight <span class=GramE>smile:</span>)
Fair enough. Actually, I was going to ask your opinion about my giving that
Northolt card to my sister. (Apprehensive <span class=GramE>look:</span>) Do
you think she really liked getting that much on her card? <span class=SpellE>Daria</span>
sounded--(pauses, <span class=GramE>ponders:</span>) I don't know, sort of
resigned to having it, like she was only doing it to please me. I only put that
much on it to insure that in an absolute emergency, she'd have enough money in
a pinch--<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>CURTIS: Hey, you don't have to sell
<i>me</i> on this. (<span class=GramE>Grins:</span>) I'm sure that if <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> suddenly needs to rent a Ferrari, that card will come
in handy. (Darren rolls his eyes) No, seriously, I'm sure everything's cool,
and even if it's eventually not, <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> can ask you to
cut it down, right? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>DARREN: Yeah, I guess. I just don't
want her to feel guilty in having the card, that's all. Even with Helen winning
that quick surprise settlement with the <i>Weekly Blabber</i>, I figured <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> wouldn't have to go to her or Jake anymore to ask for
money if she needs it--<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>DARREN: What's <i>that</i> supposed

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>CURTIS: Don't take this the wrong
way, bud, but $60,000 is a heck of a lot of money, you know--? Do you want <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> to feel as if she's beholden to you because you've
just given her that much money to do with as she pleases?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>DARREN: &quot;Beholden&quot; to me? But I'm not

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>CURTIS: And I know that you will,
bud. <span class=GramE>Nothing wrong with that, since I feel the same way about
my sisters.</span> (<span class=GramE>Frowns:</span>) Don't tell them I said

know?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>DARREN: &quot;Overboard&quot;? But you just
said--<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>CURTIS: --I said that if <span
class=SpellE>Daria</span> can eventually cut it down if she feels uncomfortable
with it, I never completely disagreed with you that she shouldn't have that
much. I think that's between you two. That being said, she's your sister. You
have money. <span class=GramE><i>Lots</i> of money.</span> <span class=GramE>Money
that you can share with your sister, and the rest of your family.</span> Hence,
you can give some money to your sister. <span class=GramE>Nothing wrong with

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>DARREN: (Narrows <span class=GramE>eyes:</span>)
Just that it shouldn't be so much money, right?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>CURTIS: (<span class=GramE>Shrugs:</span>)
Eh. Like I said, if <span class=SpellE>Daria</span> feels uncomfortable with
having that much money, she'll let you know.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

over at <span class=SpellE>Elenor</span>, who gives her a cool <span

and the mansion's basically going to be a ghost house, with no one here other
than <span class=SpellE>Elenor</span> and Claude, save for our "Special Guest". Henri's even going to leave
