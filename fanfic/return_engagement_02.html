her speaking to Sandi over the phone this morning about possibly seeing David
“One more time” at Lawndale State University. I thought about confronting her
over it, but I decided not to. (Shrugs:) Maybe Quinn wants to see if she still
has any feelings left for him. (Sighs, shakes head:) I think I’ll just stay out
of this from now on, and not play Dr. Phil anymore…</P>

more these days, she’d probably bore Darren to death with her take on fashions
instead. Look, I’ll reserve my opinions until asked, if
that’s what you’re inferring. In the case of Darren, I’m sure he’d probably jump
right in on the subject of David if Quinn asked him what he thought.</P>

else but. Darren <I>was </I>the person who called me last night after our talk.
At the end of our jabbering, he wanted to know yet again how Quinn was doing
after what happened with her former tutor. Though he didn't directly say it, I
could tell that Darren sounded a tad peeved again about the situation. I told
him that Quinn was still doing okay, but he didn't seem completely
convinced.</P>

an instant, then back to Jane:) Um, well--no, of course not, but after I hung
up, I couldn't help but to remember what you told me about his reaction to Mr.
Reardon's accusations against him for quickly “forgetting” about his deceased
fiancée Stephanie, and how Darren was with Rory McKinna in
that "Reynaldo's" place. He <I>was</I> royally pissed both times; he even grabbed
them both.</P>

just—(pauses:) a little worried that he might try to let David know (finger
quote:) “directly” on how wrong Quinn was treated from his point of view. Darren
was pretty damn lucky both times that he wasn’t arrested for attempted battery,
when I think about it. What if the third time’s a charm? (Sighs:) I know he took
that Zen Buddhist teaching along with his martial arts to calm himself down, but
I’m still wondering a little bit about what might happen if Darren happens to
meet him here…</P>

Okay, I admit that you <I>do</I> have a point or two, amiga, but what good would
it do, other than bringing Darren some unwanted attention, especially from the
tabloids, and maybe even a lawsuit after he’s arrested, from that "David" guy,
to boot? Besides, it’s not as if Darren’s even <I>seen </I>him, so he doesn’t
know what he looks like. I also don’t think Darren would want Quinn angry at him.
Plus, he’s promised <I>me</I> that if he happens to meet that “David” guy here
by chance, he won’t do anything bad, and that’s good enough for your's truly
because Darren knows it would make me become seriously pissed at him, too.</P>

wanted to spend some private time with his new wife. You thought that was so
sweet. Later that night, you had somehow convinced Eric and the other partners

next instant, Jake's desk phone intercom came on. A booming, gravelly-sounding,
female voice came over the speaker. At the same time, the woman in the outer office leaned over far enough from her desk to glance in, grinning as she

Agnes! You've got a call on line three! (Jake sighs. Yet another call. No rest

<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none">Jake couldn't help but
to chuckle as he briefly eyed Agnes. Ever since he decided to get a secretary to
help him, at Helen's insistence (something he
still wondered about until this day, particularly since she didn't ask for
<B>his</B> help when she chose one for herself only a few days earlier), he came
to appreciate the feisty older woman, with her excellent bookkeeping, typing,
and phone-answering skills, ironic in itself when he wondered about her mild,
scathing remarks, something that briefly reminded him of Daria. In fact, the two
sort of hit it off when they first met.</P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none">It
was a few days ago, when he had an evening dinner business meeting with a female
client. Jake had called Daria from the office after he remembered
that she had gotten out of school, and had asked her to borrow her mother's SUV
to drop off his dry-cleaned suit, since he didn't have the time to come right
home and change. Jake figured he could get Daria to do the favor, which, of
course Daria did--right after Jake had bribed her $20 after she asked, for which
he didn't mind, since he was rolling in the dough these days. Jake had told
Agnes offhandedly beforehand that a “young lady” was coming to bring his suit,
but in a typical fashion for him, had forgotten to tell her it was his eldest
daughter.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none">When Daria entered the
office with his suit, Agnes bluntly remarked in a joking way that is was bad
enough the “young lady” was seeing a married older man after hours, but to bring
in his clothes herself took the cake, since she should've allowed him get his
own funeral suit to be buried in. </P>

<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none">Daria, being caught
off-guard momentarily, smirked briefly, and quickly retorted before a shocked
Jake could speak in her defense that the suit was for Jake's birthday, not for a
funeral, though his wife <I>would </I>probably kill and bury him in it if
she <I>had </I>caught him cheating.</P>

<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none">Jake frowned a little
at this, confused while Agnes chuckled, and Daria continued to smirk. He finally
(and actually) got it after a minute, and laughed out loud. Daria and Agnes,
now by this time conversing casually, and of having introduced themselves to one
another, stopped and looked at him stoically. After a moment, Jake, embarrassed,
meekly went in and locked his office door to change.</P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none">By
the time Jake had left his office, his daughter had gone, but Agnes was still
there, chuckling at how she liked Daria's sense of humor, and how she hoped to
meet her again soon. Jake couldn't help but to be stunned at his secretary's
delight, or even how Daria had actually taken to talking to someone so casually
and apparently nicely the first time she had met them. Jake couldn't help but to
beam proudly went he thought his little Kidd—</P>

style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<p> Constance had decided to pursue a new way to ensure the attention of the division heads by insisting notes were taken by their secretaries. In the past, Arthur Sr. and William Appleton had provided prepared reports. All the division heads had to do was to read what they had reported themselves, if Arthur Sr. or William did not. To Constance, as former head of Appleton's Energy Division, this seemed boring.</p>
<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<p>Constance wanted to try a new approach by "challenging" the division heads to listen to her directly, making them to pay closer attention by having their secretaries take shorthand notes, then to later have each division provide its own package report within two weeks from the notes taken. Under Constance, there would be no more prepared reports. Everyone would be on their toes.</p>
<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>


<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none">Beside Darren was an
attractive, dark-skinned Hispanic-American woman in her late thirties, with long,
straight, dark brown hair, dressed in a sharp, feminine blue business suit. She,
like Jenna, Mimi, and all of the other various secretaries to the divisional
heads, was taking notes as well. This was Darren's recently-hired secretary,
Carmelita Benitez, who was Constance's personal secretary a few years before,
when Constance headed the Energy Division.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none">Carmelita had tired of
New York City's high-pressure world, and had transferred to Appleton's small
western operation in Oregon, where she was a secretary to the top regional
manager. Carmelita had settled in, liking the open air, and relative quiet of
the northwest. Only by (what was thought of at the time) the persuasion of her
old boss, a doubling of her yearly salary, and a guarantee of finding
an affordable apartment, drew Carmelita back to the high-pressure world of the
Big Apple.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none">Darren had only vaguely
recalled meeting Carmelita once, at a poolside business party several years ago
his parents had hosted at the mansion. He specifically remembered her only
because his uncle William had tried to come onto her while he was tipsy--only to
find himself in the pool after she had “accidentally” pushed him in! </P>
<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none">Grinning at that
thought, it didn't take Darren long to eagerly accept Carmelita, who had not
arrived as of yet, not just because of Constance's recommendation,
but also because he didn't have to worry about going through résumés from what
he suspected would be hundreds, perhaps even <I>thousands </I>of applicants
(mostly "love struck" women), who'd put in for the job to be his personal
secretary. </P>
<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none">Darren had shuddered
at the thought of wondering what Jane would think about a beautiful secretary
(by the picture Constance had shown him) working a room over from him. He had
told Helen and Jake about this over the phone when they had told him about their
<I>own</I> secretaries the two had hired as well--in the same week, no less!
</P>
<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none">Jake was at a loss
about what to say, only adding that Helen had chosen his, whereas Helen
recommended that Darren should simply introduce Jane to Carmelita the next time
Jane visited, to minimize any "misgivings" Jane might have. Daria and Quinn had
also agreed with their mother for Darren to do this, though Daria did some
wisecracking about "The mice will play while the cat's away". Weary about
engaging his middle sister in a battle of verbal teasing, which he was sure he'd
lose in the long run, Darren sucked it in, and said not a word.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none">Curtis thought it only
made perfect sense to anticipate anything from Jane by clearing the air with the
meeting, and a smirking Krystal uttered a smart, playful remark about Jane's
"Jealousy showing through here, just you wait". Grinning
because he figured she was kidding, Darren blew her off, though it seemed to him
that Krystal was enjoying the situation immensely, almost with a near glee.
Darren figured it was a residual effect of Jane's not approving of Krystal being
with Trent, which, though he wasn't sure, he suspected that Krystal had already
known.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none">Darren told Jane over
the phone about his hiring of Carmelita, quickly adding the mini history of her
with Constance to try and soothe Jane's possible fears. To his surprise, Jane
said that she definitely wanted to meet Carmelita, and to just "Shoot the
breeze" when she next visited (around the same time Carmelita would arrive, a
Saturday, coincidentally). And that there was nothing for him to worry about--if
that's what he thought--all while she was laughing. Darren figured Daria had
"prepared" Jane for when he'd call about Carmelita, and was inwardly grateful
for it.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal

<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none">Darren had spoken to
Carmelita over the phone as well the night before about meeting him and his
girlfriend at Cherie's for a quick lunch. Carmelita immediately agreed
after settling in her apartment, a new tenement called "Menlo Park". </P>
<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none">Carmelita had a
surprise of her own when Darren and Jane had arrived. She was with a very tall
and handsome man at a table, whom she introduced as Victor, a man who upon
further introduction had turned out to be her husband. He was someone she had met while
in Oregon, fell in love with, and married. Victor had worked at the same
Appleton operation, too, as a middle management clerical worker.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none">Another surprise over
the lunch also revealed that <I>Victor</I> was the one who had contacted
Constance concerning the secretarial opening, much to Carmelita’s shock. Victor
had asked Constance to keep it to herself, and to allow him to inform his wife.
He explained that though Carmelita had loved where she was, she had become
wistful about seeing her friends again, particularly Constance, and he had
decided to fulfill her wishes. </P>
<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none">After receiving a
crushing hug and a kiss of gratitude from his delighted wife, Victor further
explained that Constance thought it was a stroke of luck that she could get and
see Carmelita again, and had jumped at the opportunity--after promising the
raise and of finding the apartment if he could pull it off. Constance also
personally promised that she'd handle Victor’s company transference to New York
to be with his wife. From there, it was all a matter of Victor persuading
Carmelita, which he obviously did. </P>
<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none">Inwardly, a relieved
Darren felt a huge weight had been taken off his back--until a grinning Jane
decided to tease Darren by nudging Victor to question <I>Darren's</I> motives as
to the hiring of his wife. The expression on Darren's face, according to Jane,
"Was priceless". Turnabout was fair play. Fortunately, Victor and Carmelita
laughed voraciously at Jane's teasing, leaving Darren in a mild, sullen stupor
for the remainder of the lunch. Jane, though, had later pulled him out of his
funk with a kiss...</P>
<P class=MsoNormal

<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none">Darren quickly shook
his head, and glanced at his wristwatch. Throughout the meeting, now almost two
hours long, he occasionally and anxiously had done so. Carmelita cut her eyes
to him, stopped taking notes, and leaned over, speaking in a very low
whisper.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal

<P class=MsoNormal
style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none">CARMELITA: You know
Constance would've understood if you couldn't come, Darren. She probably
would’ve understood if you had just slipped out during the meeting. She’s aware
that you want to get to your friends and family as soon as possible.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal

<P class=MsoNormal

(Returning the whisper, leans over as well:) And that's the point,<B>
</B>Carmelita. <I>She</I> would've probably understood, but the other people
here <I>wouldn't.</I> If I'm serious about running
the company someday, I'd <I>better</I> be here, as much as I can. Besides, I'm
the major shareholder, not to mention that I was the one who recommended
Constance to run the company. I have to be here also to show that I support her
<I>and</I> the company to everyone.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal
style="MARGIN: 5pt 0in; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none">CARMELITA:
(After a moment:) That makes sense. (Glances at Constance, who's speaking in the
background:) From the presentation, she seems to have them eating out of the
palm of her hand. (Pauses:) I’m sounding biased, but I think you chose the right
person to lead the company. (Pauses:) You should be proud of her.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal
style="MARGIN: 5pt 0in; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none">DARREN:
(Shows Carmelita an inquisitive expression, then smiles quietly:) Thanks, and I
am, though I'd prefer to pass your praise on to my sister, Daria. (Pauses,
adds:) Besides, the meeting will be over soon, I can wait to join my friends at
Sean's, and I've already packed. In fact, I plan to leave tonight right after
our little party, and arrive in Lawndale early. (Thought v.o.: Provided that
Krystal is okay with that, [smirks:] and that I can get out of town before
Curtis sees his "surprise"...)</P>

<P class=MsoNormal
style="MARGIN: 5pt 0in; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none">Carmelita
nodded, and resumed her note-taking as Darren turned his attention back to
Constance. Almost immediately, the lights suddenly came on, and those around the
table erupted in warm applause and smiles as they began to stand and went over
to encircle her, offering their congratulations on her presentation. After a
moment, Darren rose and went over with Carmelita, offering their praise as
well.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal
style="MARGIN: 5pt 0in; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none">Several
minutes later, the conference room was mostly empty, save for a few stragglers.
Darren, holding several hand bags full of the newest sample fashions he had
gotten from Candi (per request of Quinn and the rest of the Fashion Clubbers),
went over to Constance. She was casually conversing with Carmelita and Victor,
who had come in a few minutes after the meeting’s end.</P>

Well, I'm taking off. I'm going to change upstairs in my office, go straight
home, then to Sean's, and head off to the airport. See you all in a few days.
(Turns to Victor, shakes his hand:) Nice to see you again, Victor.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal

<P class=MsoNormal

<P class=MsoNormal

smile:) No problem, Constance. I have complete confidence in you, and you more
than proved it in the meeting. (Grins:) I'm still going to nag you to take some
time off so you won't burn out, though. Now seems to be the best time with all
of the good feelings that oozed from everybody over the company's six-month

could speak, a delighted Quinn bolted down the stairs in a tizzy, practically
leaped off the bottom stair. She hugged Darren fiercely--while he was still
holding Daria, who suddenly had her face pushed into Darren's chest, skewing her
glasses a bit.</P>
