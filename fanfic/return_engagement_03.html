<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><i>(Scene Twenty-Three: Casa
Lane, a few hours later, Jane’s room. It’s now daylight, signaling the dawning
of a new day)</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Jane’s radio alarm clock on the
end table beside her bed hit “6:00 a.m.”, and then suddenly beeped. From the
lump under the bed cover, an arm stretched out, and calmly shut off the
clock. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Jane, wearing her usual,
converted-to night clothing of a red shirt and white shorts (which also
occasionally doubled as a jogging outfit), slowly pulled the cover off, yawned,
and then stretched. She quietly slipped out of her bed, gently rubbed her ribs,
and lip-smacked her mouth as she yawned again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Thought v.o.: Boy, <b>that
</b>was a good sleep, the best I’ve had in a while. Huh. Guess I was more tired
than I thought. Going to bed at ten o’clock didn’t exactly hurt, either. I
kinda figured I would be at least a <b>little</b> restless, since I thought I
wouldn’t be able to sleep because of Darren coming in today. Oh, well. Time to
get in a quick, little early-morning jog…)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Jane sat back on the edge of her
bed, and laced on her running sneakers. After combing her hair, she left her
bedroom just as Krystal, wearing a pink bathrobe and slippers, exited Penny’s
old bedroom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>KRYSTAL: (Smirks, stops, speaks
in a faux-sweet tone:) Good morning, Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Indifferent, gruff tone,
waves her off:) Eh, ‘morning, Krystal. (Krystal gives her a bemused look as
Jane walks by. After a moment, Jane stops, becomes wide-eyed, quickly turns
back in shock:) KRYSTAL?! What-in-the-<i>hell</i>--?! (Pauses:) How’d <i>you</i>
get into <i>my</i> house?! I thought you and Darren weren’t supposed to arrive
until later this morning!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>KRYSTAL: (Bemused chuckle:) 
Darren decided to surprise his family by getting here a tad sooner. As for <i>how
</i>I got in, Trent mailed me a key because he said you guys had
changed the locks. (Pauses to Jane’s now-stoic expression:) Oh, he didn’t tell
you--?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Flat tone:) <i>No.</i> It
seems that he kinda left out <i>that</i> little detail. (Thought v.o.: Which
gives me hope. Once you start seeing that my brother has a <b>lovably</b>
absentminded habit, you’ll have to think twice about seeing him.) What time did
you and Darren get in this morning?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>KRYSTAL: Around two a.m. He rented an SUV from the airport. Afterwards, we brought some groceries, and he dropped me off here. Henri’s been nagging at him to brush up on those budding culinary skills of his, so Darren's going to cook a surprise breakfast for his family this morning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Slight nod:) Yeah, I can
see that. Darren’s told me that he’s gotten a little rusty in his cooking
lately, and wanted to pick it up again. I’ve never tasted his cooking before,
now that I think about it. (Pauses, realizes:) Uh, did you say “we” bought some
groceries? Why’d <i>you</i> do that?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>KRYSTAL: (Shrugs, slight smile:)
Isn’t it <i>obvious</i>? I can handle a skillet or two, myself. In fact, I’m
going to cook some breakfast this morning for <i>you </i>guys. (Jane’s eyebrows
rise in surprise. Krystal smiles slightly:) I decided to follow Darren’s idea.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Uneasy look:) Oh, um, you
don’t really have to go to all of <i>that</i> trouble, you know. You’re a--
(pauses, strains to utter the word between her clenched teeth:) <i>guest</i>
here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>KRYSTAL: (Knowing smirk:) Oh,
nonsense, it’s no trouble at all! In fact, I insist!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Looks off, uncomfortable
expression:) Well, uh--</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>KRYSTAL: (Now shows a
barely-sinister grin, teases:) Oh, come on now, don't tell me that you think I'd
<i>poison</i> your food, Jane? (Thought v.o.: Which I probably <b>would</b>, if
I thought I could get away with it...)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Thought v.o. as she
exhibits a phony smile: You probably <b>would</b>, if you thought you could get
away with it...:) Of <i>course </i>not! It's just--that—-I--plan to go to the
Morgendorffer's after I take a shower and change! (Nods, goes with that line of
reasoning:) Yeah, I think I'll just skip my morning jog. I might as well chow
down there, because like I said, I've never really tasted Darren's food, (quickly
adds:) not that I think <i>yours</i> wouldn’t be tasty, either. (Pauses:)
Tell you what: If you want, you can prepare tonight’s dinner, or maybe
breakfast for tomorrow, and I'll try your food then, how's that?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>KRYSTAL: (Pauses, shrugs, slight
smirk:) Sure, why not? There's no hurry to decide either way right now.
(Pauses:) Maybe I’ll do both. (Grins, which appears subtly cold to Jane:) Rest
assured, though, I'll be sure to prepare a <i>very </i>special meal for either
or both occasions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Thought v.o.: Yeah,
that's what I'm afraid of...:) I'll--be looking forward to it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>The next instant, a tired and
bare-chested Trent, wearing black boxers, dragged himself from his room while
he rubbed his eyes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>TRENT: Janey, what's goin'
on...? I thought heard some talking...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Krystal eyed him up and down,
and then formed a lusty, slow smirk, while Jane mildly and briefly rolled her
eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>KRYSTAL: (Huge grin:) Trent!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>TRENT: (Shakes out of his sleep,
suddenly becomes wide-eyed, returns the grin:) Krystal? Whoa, you're here
already? (Suddenly alarmed:) Oh, man, what time is it? I overslept <i>again?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Low snort, thought v.o.: <b>&quot;Again?&quot;</b>)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Krystal stole a mercurial glance
in Jane's direction, then dramatically ran over to Trent, throwing her arms
around his neck, and pulling him down for a deep, long kiss. Jane showed a hard
stare at the sight, but kept her tongue, whereas Krystal seemed to put hers
down Trent’s throat. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>After a moment of staring, Jane
actually began to show an almost Daria-like tiny smirk. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Krystal barely squinted her eyes
open just long enough to gauge Jane's reaction to her kissing Trent, and
then suddenly found herself wondering what the youngest Lane sibling was
thinking. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Thought v.o. as she keeps
her smirk: <b>Big</b> mistake, missy. Trent's never been one to care about
brushing his teeth before he goes to bed. <b>I </b>oughta know. When he was
awake enough to speak in my face in the mornings, I could smell the skunk and
onion-like odors that practically erupted from his mouth. After having enough,
I kept my distance until he brushed his teeth. Either you've got a strong
stomach, or your breath is as bad as my brother's, and both of yours cancel each
other's out.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Trent and Krystal finally
stopped kissing, but held hands as they withdrew from one another. Krystal
smiled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>KRYSTAL: (Glances up:) <i>Hmmm...</i>that
was—the toothpaste with the mint and cherry flavor, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>TRENT: (Grins, which incidentally
shows his very clean teeth:) Yeah--that &quot;Teeth Brite&quot; stuff you told
me about. My mouth <i>does</i> taste better when I brush before I go to bed. It
keeps when I get up. Thanks for telling me about it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Cocks an eyebrow:) Huh?
(Narrows eyes:) <i>Waiiiiitasec.</i> (Pauses:) Trent, are you now brushing your
teeth before you go to bed? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>TRENT: (Pauses, shrugs,
uncomfortable look:) Uh, yeah, Janey. Ever since Krystal kinda--(pauses,
glances at Krystal, embarrassed look for a moment. Krystal merely smirks at
him:) uh, hinted that I should. I now do it like, about three times a day, and
stuff. (Jane appears very surprised) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>KRYSTAL: (Nods:) Good dental
hygiene is very important, Trent. (Snuggles up to him, purrs:) A girl likes the
clean mouth of a man, right, Jane? (Gives Trent a lusty expression:) Makes the
kissing easier. (Trent returns the same expression. They kiss again briefly)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (After a moment, looks
off, baffled:) Uh, yeah, it does at that... </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>KRYSTAL: (Sniffs his chest,
smiles:) Ah, and is that the “Green Water” body lotion I smell? (Trent nods,
smiling. She glances at Jane, smirks:) I brought that for Darren last year for
a Christmas present, Jane. He loves it. You’ve probably smelled it on him,
right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Pauses:) Ah, yeah, I
guess I have. (Thought v.o.: Which I didn’t notice, of course, because he never
mentioned it. [Pauses, realizes:] Stop it, Jane. Krystal’s trying to get into
your head. [Pauses:] Still, I wonder how Stephanie felt about that--?)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>TRENT: (Grins:) Thanks again for
sending me a bottle. I put it on right after I showered before I sacked out
last night. It really smells good. (Smells his arm:) Yeah, it keeps like the
toothpaste, too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Thought v.o., narrowed
eyes, realizes: Geez! Trent <b>has</b> paid more attention to his appearance
lately, now when I think about it. He's taken more showers, worn cleaner tee
shirts and jeans, and his goatee has been neatly clipped, the same for the hair
on his head, which has been combed down more. What's she <b>doing </b>to him?
Why didn't I notice all of this before?)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>TRENT: (Looks down at her,
smiles:) I guess you used the key I sent you, huh?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>KRYSTAL: (Smiles back, nuzzles
into his chest:) What do <i>you </i>think?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>TRENT: You have any trouble
finding your way around here?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>KRYSTAL: Nah. I fumbled for a
light switch or two, and then with Darren’s help, I quietly found your sister
Penny's old room, last one on the left, just like you described. (Glances at
Jane’s cocked eyebrow, smirks:) Darren didn’t want to wake you up, Jane, you
understand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Small shrug:) Um, sure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>TRENT: (Concerned tone, look:)
Man, I wish one of you would've done that, you know, so we could've helped you
out with your stuff--?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Mouth turns down
slightly, thought v.o.: What’s this &quot;we&quot; crap he’s babbling about?)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>KRYSTAL: (Lightly caresses
Trent’s face. Inside, Jane moans with disgust:) Oh, it’s all right, sweetie,
really. I took care of everything after Darren and I brought it all into the
living room. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>TRENT: (Slightly placated,
nods:) Well, as long as Darren was there to help, it’s cool. So, uh, what do
you think of our pad? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>KRYSTAL: (Glances around, brief,
bemused expression:) It’s quite a quaint little place you have here. (Adds
after a moment as she tepidly feels the hallway’s wall, lightly dusts off her
hands:) It’s very, uh, (pauses, looks for the right word:) tidy, too. (Trent
appears relieved)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Offended, slight sneer in
her tone:) Oh, it’s not quite the castle like <i>yours</i>, of course, and we
don’t have the necessary servants to accommodate our quaint little needs like <i>you</i>
do, but we somehow still get on with our quaint little lives. You see, our
house suits <i>our</i> needs, and in the end, that’s all that matters, right,
Trent? (Krystal shows a faux smile)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>TRENT: (Even <b>he</b> gets
Jane’s subtle insult, cocks an eyebrow:) Uhhh, Janey--?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>KRYSTAL: (Chuckles coolly, keeps
her eyes on Jane:) Oh, it’s all right, Trent! I’m sure Jane was only <i>joking</i>!
(Adds with her own sneer:) Remember, Jane gets <i>her</i> quaint little needs
filled by <i>Darren’s</i> servants when she visits <i>his</i> castle too,
right, Jane?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Nods, faux smile:) You
betcha. (Adds casually:) Though I generally do my own thing when I visit, and
try not to rely on his servants to wipe my nose <i>and</i> ass like I’m sure <i>other</i>
people do when they visit. I, for one, think that we should do as much as we
can for ourselves. (Krystal’s mouth twitches ever-so slightly while she
maintains her faux smile)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>KRYSTAL: (Barely strained tone
of control:) Why, I suppose I couldn’t agree with you more on <i>that</i> line
of reasoning, Jane. How <i>nice</i> of you to point it out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Playful sneer and tone
while keeping her faux-smile:) You’re quite welcome, Krystal. I’m <i>always</i>
glad to be of service to my brother’s girlfriend, and to my boyfriend’s
girl &quot;friend&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>There was a palpable silence in
the air for a moment as the two young women struggled to maintain their phony
appearance of civility. Trent glanced nervously between them for an
instant, and then bravely plowed forward.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>TRENT: (After a moment:) <i>Ummm</i>,
hey, I gotta introduce our mom to you, Krystal. She wanted me to let her know
as soon as you came in. I'll go to her room downstairs and--(turns to leave)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>KRYSTAL: (Puts her hand gently
on his shoulder, stops him:) Wait a moment, Trent. (Digs in her housecoat
pocket, pulls out a folded slip of paper marked “Trent and Jane”:) I almost
forgot about this. I found it under a magnet on your refrigerator when I put my
groceries in there this morning, (Grins, &quot;sweet&quot; tone:) and after I
fed and let out those delightful cats you told me about, “Zachary” and
“Taylor”. I just <i>love </i>cats! In fact, I plan to get one when I go back
home! (Jane does a mental eye roll. Krystal gives note to Trent. Jane crosses
her arms, suspecting what the note will say)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>TRENT: (Cocks an eyebrow,
distracted for a moment:) You bought some <i>groceries</i>? (Pauses, actually
awed:) <i>Whoa</i>. (Pauses:) Food.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>KRYSTAL: (Slight frown,
perplexed, while Jane knowingly shows an amused smirk:) Uh, yeah, Trent.
(Pauses:) “Food”. Like I told Jane, I wanted to cook you both some meals,
starting with breakfast while I’m here, (mock-wounded tone and pout, cuts eyes
to Jane:) but <i>Jane’s</i> going to go to the Morgendorffer’s instead to eat
some of <i>Darren’s</i> food. (Trent cocks an eyebrow at Jane)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Thought v.o.: <b>Oho!</b>
Trying to make me feel bad in front of my brother, and maybe get him to be a
little annoyed at me for my bad manners, aren’t you? Think again…) (Phony
smile, sighs:) Okay, you got me, Krystal. I really wanted you two to have some
time alone together since you haven’t seen each other in awhile, that’s all.
(Krystal says nothing, merely adds her own phony smile, indifferent)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>TRENT: (Smiles:) That’s pretty
cool of you, Janey. Thanks. (Unfolds, reads the note silently as Jane slightly
smirks at a now-stoic Krystal:) Hmmm--mom suddenly left for Florida early this
morning. (Looks up at both girls:) Something about an “Everglades pottery
inspiration”. She writes that she’ll try and get back before you leave,
Krystal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Snorts, rolls eyes:)
Surprise, surprise...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>TRENT: (Pauses, frowns
slightly:) Yeah...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>KRYSTAL: (After a moment:) Hm. I
guess she must’ve left just before I arrived, or rose and left after I came in
and hit the sack. Talk about bad timing. (Sighs, brightens:) Well, I wouldn't
worry about it. I'm sure she'll be back before I leave, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>TRENT: (Weak shrug:) Uh, I
guess.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Low, wry tone:) I
wouldn't hold my breath, though. You'll pass out from lack of oxygen. (Krystal
cocks an eyebrow at her)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>KRYSTAL: (Pauses, forced smile:)
Uh, what about your dad? It's possible he could pop up, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Smirks:) Not unless he’s
traveled around the world in a toaster will we see him anytime soon. (Trent
chuckles. Krystal drops an odd eyebrow at her) Listen guys, I'm gonna take a
quick shower and change, call and go over to Daria's, and on to what passes as
high school. (In a brusque tone, particularly aimed at Krystal:) See you later.
(Goes into bathroom, shuts door)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>KRYSTAL: (Turns to Trent,
smiles, hooks her arm with his, gently pulls him along as she speaks just loud
enough for Jane to hear:) And in the meantime, after you and I change, I’ll fix
you a humongous breakfast, and show you those new clothes I told you about that
I bought for you and your band.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>TRENT: (Turns a bit green, meekly protests:) Aww--Krystal...those clothes looked okay when we saw the picture on Janey's monitor, but they didn't seem like they were our style to me...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>KRYSTAL: (Grins, mock-admonishing voice, purrs:) Hush, baby. Your friends loved them, and overruled you, if you'll recall. We'll then go out, (In a teasing, still-loud tone:) get that nasty ol' old car of yours that you also told me about traded in to that “Happy Herb’s” place, (Returns to her regular, still-loud tone:) and you can show me around town in your newer one. (Playfully pushes him into his room) See you in a few—-(Pauses, then pulls down, kisses him deeply again, whispers in his ear:) <i>lover</i>. (Releases Trent sensually, turns, goes into
her room, her hips twisting. Trent looks after her, smiling, mesmerized for a
moment, then slowly shuts his door)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>In the bathroom, Jane, who had
been listening (of course), turned and leaned back against the door with a
stunned expression. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Thought v.o.: Did I hear
that right through all of that garbage she was spewing? Trent’s gonna ditch his
old Plymouth? If the housecleaning bit didn't do it for me, <b>this</b> sure
does! How’d she talk him into doing <b>that? </b>He's had that car since he was
<b>my</b> age! There's no freaking way that Trent could--dammit, I oughta call
out Krystal's crap right now--) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Jane sighed, and then slumped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Thought v.o.: Stop it,
Janey. You can't prove anything at the moment. According to Daria, Krystal's dad
gave her that alibi. We <b>know</b> Krystal's lying because
of Sesame's saying that she met her, and Sesame spoke to Krystal over the phone all
those times. Mr. McKinna's <b>got</b> to be covering for his &quot;darling
daughter&quot;.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Jane was about to pull off her
shirt when she paused, looking off into space.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Thought v.o.: No. No,
that's not <b>quite </b>on target, Janey, is it? Sesame never <b>said</b> she
met or talked to Krystal, dammit, only that she met someone once named
&quot;Sty Lark&quot;, which also happens to be an anagram for
&quot;Krystal&quot;. On top of that, we can't find Sesame, who has conveniently
vanished. Which, Daria thinks, Krystal had something to do with as well—-[Nervous
mental chuckle:] though I’m sure Krystal didn’t exactly pay someone to off her
so Sesame couldn’t squeal—-you <b>hope</b>. All we have is &quot;circumstantial&quot;
evidence...)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Jane then scowled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Thought v.o.: <b>Damn </b>the
circumstances. I told Krystal she'd better not hurt my brother, and I <b>meant </b>it.
[Smirks, mentally chuckles again, this time more confidently:] Besides, why in
the hell am I so worried about Trent trying to trade in what passes as his car?

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>The now-fully dressed
Morgendorffers, Jane, and Darren (who were sitting next to one another) were
eating the breakfast Darren had just prepared. Daria, Jane, Helen, and Darren
feasted on western omelets, Texas toast, bacon, orange juice, and coffee,
whereas Jake ate a small, low-fat broccoli and egg quiche with his coffee.
Quinn had an equally small, low-fat tomato and egg quiche, along with a ripe
slice of honeydew melon, seedless red grapes, orange juice, and low fat milk to
round out her breakfast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

Mmm! Oh, son! This omelet is delicious!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Ditto:) She ain't
kidding! This is <i>the </i>best damn omelet I've ever eaten, Darren, (adds:)
other than Henri’s, that is--and that includes the ones from restaurants!
(Swallows, grabs a bottle of hot sauce, shakes some more on her omelet)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (Delighted look as she
chews:) And my tomato quiche tastes <i>great,</i> Darren! (Eagerly takes
another bite, savors:) Mmmm…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JAKE: (Jumps in, grins:) Yeah,
and I just <i>love</i> my broccoli quiche, son! (Thought v.o. as his fork cuts
his food, confused expression: Geez, Helen and Quinn sure love Darren’s
cooking, don’t they? Even Jane’s gobbling it down like there’s no tomorrow!
Can’t say that I blame them though, ‘cause this <b>is </b>delicious! [Pauses,
slight frown of deep thought:] I wonder why none of them ever reacted to <b>my</b>
food like that? Could it be they think—<b>naaah</b>!) (Continues eating
blissfully)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>After a moment, everyone glanced
at Daria, who wordlessly chewed while she returned her own glance at them with
her usual emotionless expression. Helen dropped a subtle eyebrow that suggested
she say something positive (if that were possible). Jane merely smirked
wordlessly at Daria while she continued to chew. Darren looked at his middle
sister with a slightly twitching smile, trying not to anticipate laughing at the
sarcasm he knew was headed his way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Sighs, glances down at
her food for an instant:) Eh. It's passable, I suppose. Give yourself a gold star, bro. (She takes another bite, chews. Jane grins while Darren finally laughs)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN &amp; JAKE: (Admonishing
looks, while Quinn lightly rolls her eyes, not surprised:) Daria!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Holds up hands while
still laughing:) It’s okay! (Glances wryly at Daria:) I think that’s her way of
saying that she likes hers as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (After a moment, shrugs:)
Close enough. (Swallows, cuts her fork into another piece of the omelet.
Thought v.o.: Dammit. This <b>is</b> the best omelet I’ve ever eaten, other
than Henri’s, like Jane said. If I can compliment <b>his</b> cooking, shouldn’t
it be easier for me to do the same for Darren’s? [Pauses, deadpan:] Oh, that’s
right. I can’t do that because my family and Jane are around at the moment, and I
can’t show them that I have a soft side for my brother, dammit. Best to wait
until they’re in the next state before I tell Darren what I really think…)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Once again, speaking with
her mouth full, mocks as she shakes her head slowly:) Oh, Daria, Daria, Daria.
With that attitude, you'll never make it in writing as a food critic, will you?
This omelet is <i>smo-kin'</i>! (Swallows, drinks some orange juice, then
shakes yet more hot sauce on her omelet, starts eating again)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Smirks:) It <i>should</i>
be, Jane, since you keep drowning it in hot sauce. (Adds:) Careful not
to burn up any more of that poor tongue of yours for when you need to use it to
wrestle with my brother's as you make out with him. (Bites another piece)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (Shudders, while Jane

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Gives Darren a devilish
expression:) Oh, I wouldn't worry about <i>that</i> anytime soon, Daria. My
tongue's <i>plenty</i> long enough, right, Darren?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN &amp; JAKE: (Red-faced
again, before a now red-faced Darren himself can speak:) JANE!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (&quot;Innocent&quot;
expression as she chews:) What? (Pauses, shrugs:) <i>What?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (After a moment, grins
at Jane:) You know, you're lucky I had brought enough &quot;grub&quot; last
night to cover your suddenly being here. (Jane returns the grin as she chews)
It's a good thing you called just before I started to cook to warn me of
your pending arrival, or you would've been watching <i>us </i>eat. At least if
you had eaten Krystal's cooking beforehand, you'd have a full stomach while
doing so. (Jane chuckles, while Daria smirks slightly)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: (Admonishing tone of mild
surprise, but slips in a chuckle of her own with Jake, while Quinn giggles:)
Darren!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Returns chuckle:) Sorry,
Helen, just kidding. But seriously, Jane, I sort of figured that you'd stay
with Trent to try Krystal's food. She's a pretty good cook, having learned some
from her grandmother, when Krystal and Rory stayed at her house over a few
summers while her parents were out of the country on a business trip or two. (Jane
cocks an eyebrow, and stops in mid-bite. Daria and Quinn also pause in
mid-chewing, glance at each other, and then stare at Darren. Helen and Jake
continue to eat, not noticing) Krystal told me that she hated to learn at
first, but actually began to like it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: Oh, uh, really? (Pauses,
glances at Daria, then at Quinn)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Shrugs, bites a forkful
nonchalantly:) Yes. I've tasted her food before, though it's been quite awhile,
before I met Stephanie, in fact. Krystal occasionally invited me over to her house and cooked a meal for me. (Jane wordlessly chews, a stoic look having covered her face. Daria and Quinn once again exchange glances)</p>


<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>


<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Darren casually
drank some juice for a moment, then continued.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>


<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: However, she surprised
me by dropping off <i>two</i> huge baskets of food for our extra-long student council
meeting last Monday night at Eastward College. (Adds as Daria, Jane, and Quinn stop and stare at him:) Curtis and I told her the previous week that we were going to present to the council an idea to challenge the school's policy of allowing extra class credits for students working on part-time jobs. We thought it wasn't enough, based on Curtis's own experiences, and a few other student's as well, and that Eastward needed to allot even more. We figured the meeting would go about an hour over because we needed to work on an effective strategy. (Chuckles:) Everyone loved Krystal's tuna on rye sandwiches, chocolate cake, and sodas. Good thing no one thought about ordering take-out beforehand...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: (Smiles:) Oh, that was
very nice of her, son!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JAKE: (Grins, nods:) Yeah!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Pauses as she eyes Jane,
who continues to look stoic as she's chewing:) Um, don't take this the wrong
way, bro, but how do you know that Krystal actually <i>made</i> all of that
food by herself? Did she <i>say</i> that she did? (Jane snaps out of her funk,
shows a slight smirk at Daria. Darren cocks an eyebrow, stops in mid-bite) It
just seems like it's a lot of food for one person to make, even with advance notice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Nods slowly:) Hey, <i>yeeeah!</i>
Now that Daria's mentioned it, it <i>does</i> seem like Krystal would have to
be a super girl to do all that, don't you think--?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (Immediately jumps in,
particularly when she notices Darren's about to say something:) --Yeah, Darren,
uh, they're <i>right</i>! (Everyone, <b>especially</b> Daria and Jane,
surprisingly eye her) I mean, she might've had her chef help her at
least, you know--? How can you be so sure, and everything, (adds casually,
shrugs as she bites another forkful of her quiche:) not that there's anything
wrong with kinda stretching the truth at times--</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Slight smirk:) On that last part, that's <i>too</i> easy to comment on concerning <i>you</i> of all people, Quinn. (Quinn swallows,
licks out her tongue briefly at Daria. Helen gives both girls a brief frown of
disapproval, but says nothing)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Pauses, takes in what
they've all said, slight frown:) Well, uh, now that I think about it, I <i>assumed</i>
that she did when she dropped those baskets off. (Pauses, ponders, narrows
eyes:) In fact, she never <i>did</i> say that she made the food. I wonder how I
could've thought that--?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (As she throws a quick,
knowing look at Jane, then, amazingly enough, at Quinn.) (Thought v.o. as both
return their own, quick looks: It's pretty easy to think that, Darren. Krystal
just wanted you and your friends to <b>believe </b>that she did it all by
herself. She's quite nasty at that type of manipulation, isn't she...?) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: (Smiles at Darren,
good-naturedly adds:) Well, it's <i>her</i> thought that counts, Darren, no
matter <i>who</i> actually made that food. (Daria and Jane give her a brief,
droll look) Anyway, I wished you’d woken us up to let us help you prepare all
of this! Aren’t you the least bit tired, son? We didn’t know you’d get right
back up after only two to three hours of sleep, and start cooking!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JAKE: (Nods frantically:) Yeah,
Big Guy! (Points at himself with his thumb, grins:) I could've given you some of <i>my</i>
cookin’ expertise, too, you know! (Daria, Helen, and Quinn stop eating for a
moment to give him uneasy, alarmed expressions with Darren. Jane quickly drinks
some orange juice to keep from chuckling)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Quickly speaks:) Er, <i>no!</i>
(Pauses, calms down:) I mean, uh, no, it--wasn’t any problem, really. Besides,
I slept some on the jet ride here with Krystal, and I feel fine. I can take a
quick nap after I come back if I start feeling tired. I’ve done this at home
while going to Eastward because I’ve had to sometimes study business
into the early morning hours, (Grins at Daria and Jane:) something that I’m sure
you'll both appreciate doing next year, Jane, sis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Returns the grin:) <i>Hah!</i>
I'm <i>used </i>to staying up until the dawn working on my masterpieces! Bring
it on! (Resumes eating)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Deadpan as she takes
another bite:) Ah, the perils of college: stealing sleep between all of the
studying, not to mention all of the eating. (Smirks as she glances at her
mother while chewing:) I guess that means I won’t have any time to get into too
many extracurricular college activities and meet other people, eh, Mom?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: (Returns smirk:) Don’t
worry, sweetie. I still have a year to scheme something up, (Cuts eyes to Jane
and Darren, playful tone:) plus I’m sure your brother and Jane will help me
either way… (Drinks coffee)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Swallows, grins:) I’ve
already called the dragging-Daria-to-parties-against-her-own-will part! Though
like I told her, Darren will probably host several under his roof, (shrugs:) so
either way, she’s screwed. (Forks, bites another piece of omelet)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Reserved sigh, deadpan:)
I can always rely on your absolute loyalty, soon-to-be-dead friend of mine.
(Forks her piece of omelet, chews)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Chuckles while chewing:)
Hey, I’m just giving in to the inevitable, Daria. I say sit back, relax, and
enjoy the ride to adulthood. (Swings fist:) Full speed ahead!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Swallows:) Any chance
before you open it up, I can jump off beforehand and stay here in Teenageville
forever? (Pauses:) No, wait, scratch that. That’ll mean I’d have to stay in
high school, and even <i>I</i> don’t deserve <i>that</i> fate… (forks, bites
another piece)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Chuckles with the
others:) And since Jane’s covering Daria’s off-campus escapades, I guess that
leaves me with her on-campus ones. (Wicked smirk:) Speaking of which, Daria,
your buddy Dean Pierpoint wanted me to inform you that he’s looking forward to <i>personally
</i>helping you enter the various writing clubs and other organizations when
you arrive next year. (Adds, tries not to laugh, while Helen grins:) I'm only
too happy to let you know.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Takes this in calmly,
then in a deadpan tone as she eyes Darren:) Jane, I’m gonna veer our ride
to adulthood slightly off the road so I can run over Darren and
Dean Pierpoint, okay?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Finishes her omelet,
while chewing, waves fork at her:) Eh. As long as you don’t kill your brother
and my boyfriend so he can cook for me some more, I say go for it. You can
leave him a <i>little</i> crippled, I suppose. (Darren chuckles) As for your
future dean, I’ll leave it up to you as to how hard you wanna ram him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JAKE: (Stops eating, concerned
expression:) Uh, ya know, Kiddo, Jane, I think you both can go to jail for hit
and run, (To Helen:) isn’t that right, honey--?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: (Exasperated, sighs:)
Jake! Daria and Jane were only <i>joking</i>!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JAKE: (Faux-chuckle,
embarrassed:) Oh, uh, I knew <i>that</i>! HA! (Quickly resumes eating to cover
himself. Everyone merely stares silently at him for a moment)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (Breaks the silence:) Um,
anyway, I’m glad you’re coming earlier to our school, Darren. (Grins, becomes
excited:) That way you’ll see the flowers and the welcome banner we made for
you even sooner! (Darren cocks an eyebrow)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Deadpan, steals a
knowing glance at Jane, and vice-versa:) I’m sure Darren’s just <i>aching</i>
to see the fruits of the Fashion Club’s labor, Quinn. (Finishes off the last
piece of her omelet, stands:) That reminds me. I have to make a quick call.
Excuse me. Be back in a few. (Leaves)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Everyone stared after Daria for
a moment. Darren then spoke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Pauses:) Ah, flowers
and banners, Quinn? (Pauses:) For <i>me?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (Nods, drinks her milk,
swallows:) Yeah! It was all Ms. Li’s idea, and stuff! She said she didn’t want
to spare any expense in making the school look nice for you, and everything...
(finishes the rest of her milk)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Slight smirk as she eyes
Darren’s now-forming brief frown:) Gee, that was <i>awfully</i> nice of her to
do that, huh, Darren? (Pointed tone:) Going to all of that <i>expense?</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Eyes Jane, now-neutral
expression:) Yeah, it was, Jane. (Pauses:) “Awfully” nice. (Pauses:) Uh, I know
you don’t probably want to give too much away sis, but out of curiosity, how
big <i>is</i> this banner? Is there more than one?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (Shakes head, bites into
a grape:) Nah, just one, bro, around five feet high, an’ about thirty feet
long, I think. The letters are done in a royal blue, while the banner is a
lemon yellow, you know, our school’s colors. (Smug expression:) The Fashion
Club personally picked what we thought was the <i>right</i> blue and yellow,
not some icky, dumb ol’ blue and yellow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: (Raised eyebrows:) Oh,
my! All of that for Darren, sweetie? (Quinn wordlessly nods, finishes eating
her melon slice) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JAKE: (Ditto, grins to Darren:)
Wow, Big Guy! It looks like Ms. Li’s pulled out all the stops for ya, hasn’t
she?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (After a moment, glances
at a still-smirking Jane:) Umm-hmm, it seems like she has, Jake. (Pauses,
returns glance to Quinn:) <i>Sooo,</i> did any students volunteer to do the
poster and pick the flowers from some field, or something, Quinn? (Quinn cocks
an eyebrow. Darren adds:) You, know, I’m just curious. I wouldn’t have wanted
your principal or your fellow students and friends to go to all of that trouble
just for me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (Shrugs, nonchalant tone,
smiles:) Oh, it was no trouble, Darren. Ms. Li said that she had gotten some
clothing company to sew the banner. It's a really fancy-looking cloth one,
and stuff. (Darren's eyebrows rise <b>very</b> high at this, while Jane tries
not to snicker) She had a florist provide the flowers. (Wipes her hands on a napkin, then checks her nails. Helen and Jake glance at each other)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Nods while Jane now
shakes her head slowly:) I--see. (Pauses as if he’s mentally filing away what
Quinn’s said, which he is. Adds in a stoic, mock-excited tone:) Well, uh, I <i>sure</i>
can’t wait to see both, sis. (Jane silently snorts under her breath, finishes
chugging down her orange juice)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: (Pauses, cocks an
eyebrow:) Darren, it’s just occurred to me: How much <i>were</i> you planning
to donate to the high school? You’ve never said, exactly...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: That’s because I’ve
still not settled on a set amount, Helen. It’ll all depend on Ms. Li’s—-(pauses,
looks for the right word, glances at a smiling Jane:) “cooperation” in helping
me to decide. (To Helen and Jake’s dropped eyebrows:) Uh, we just have to work
out certain financial “kinks”, you might say. I’ve also decided to donate some
money to the entire Lawndale County school system, not just to the high school.
No need to make it look as if I’m favoring just the high school level. I
believe education has to be fully funded throughout, from preschool to college.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: (Smiles, delighted:)
Well, I think that’s just wonderful, sweetie! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JAKE: (Ditto:) It sure is, Big
Guy! (Thumbs up:) I’m proud of you!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (Nods:) Yeah, so am I! We
can get more stuff for our school, like full-length mirrors in the bathrooms
for girls to see themselves better! (Jane chuckles under her breath. Helen
gives Quinn a disapproving look)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JAKE: (Grins:) Good for you,
Princess! I’m proud of you, too! (Darren grins)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: (Annoyed:) Jake! Now,
Quinn, there are more important things to school than just larger mirrors—</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (Nods:) --Yeah, Mom,
you’re right, like eventually maybe some personal make-up rooms for the female
students all over the school to try out blushes, eye liners, and lipstick
between classes, too. But this is just a start. (Darren laughs with Jane) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: Quinn--! (Sighs, puts it
out of her head, smiles at her son:) With all of the nasty budget cuts our
state and federal legislators are making these days, especially in education,
it’s great to see someone do something about it, son.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Shrugs, glances at
Jane:) I have plenty of money. I might as well put it to good use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: If that’s the case, then
maybe you can buy some of our teachers a new personality, like offering a
dollar to them for each encouraging smile and comment they give to a student
during class. (The others chuckle)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Daria re-entered the dining room
with a glass of water, and took her seat at the table.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN:  (While drinking her
coffee, curious tone:) Who did you call, Daria?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Pauses, glances at
Jane:) Um, Brittany Taylor, for a confirmation of sorts. (Jane forms a brief
look of realization, but keeps silent. Helen, Jake, and especially Quinn gives
her an odd look, waiting for an explanation. Daria quickly adds:) I, uh, wanted
to make sure that a science homework assignment we’re both working on in Ms.
Barch’s class was due today, which it is. Brittany and I share the same table.
(The others then appear to look satisfied with her explanation, save for Jane,
who silently eyes Daria, as if she's waiting for more. Daria merely shows her a
wry, quick smile)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Pauses, contemplates:)
Brittany Taylor--? Isn’t she that blonde, pony-tailed cheerleader who, (Glances
at Jane uneasily for an instant, then continues:) uh, tried to come onto me
earlier this summer at that “Pizza King” place? (Helen and Jake look at each
other)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (Giggles, nods:) That’s
her, Darren!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: Ditto, unfortunately.
(Drinks her glass of water)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Grins at Darren’s
uneasiness, glances at Daria, mock-offended tone:) Why haven’t <i>I </i>heard
of this? Aren’t <i>you </i>the lover-boy?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Returns grin as he sees
she’s obviously not serious:) Don’t get any funny ideas, Jane. That little
incident happened before I met you, and I’m definitely <i>not</i> interested in
that &quot;Brittany&quot; girl. Besides, she’s going with that “Kevin” guy,
right? (Takes a bite of the final piece of his omelet)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Smirks at Jane,
nonchalant tone:) Oh, yeah, speaking of Kevin, Brittany also told me that right
after school yesterday, Ms. Barch nearly beat the hell out of him in the
hallway. (Daria casually drinks her glass of water again. Everyone, save for a
now-disappointed Jane, gasps. Daria swallows, continues:) Apparently, he tried
to knock her down for some reason, and she set herself upon the poor male lad.
(Exaggerated sigh:) I guess Kevin finally decided that life wasn’t worth living
anymore…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Wide-eyed:) <i>I’ll</i>
say! I don’t care if that “Barch” woman <i>did</i> know martial arts like me,
I’m glad she didn’t catch me that day she was chasing me! I’d hate to have
gotten into a scuffle with her! That lady’s <i>nuts</i>! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Smirks, reaches over,
pats his hand mock-assuredly:) Then I guess you don't want to see her any time
soon, huh? I heard Ms. Barch say that she wanted to see you again for some
reason. (Daria shows a small smirk)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Keeps his now
even-wider-eyed expression, looks between Daria and Jane:) She <i>does</i>?
(Pauses:) What, so she can finish the job?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Laughs:) I dunno, but it
sure sounded pretty important, &quot;Darry&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Sits back:) Uh, well,
maybe we'll see, Jane, perhaps while you guys are in class, and after I finish
speaking to Ms. Li. (Thought v.o., inwardly shudders: <b>Not</b>...:) I’ll need
to keep myself busy between classes, anyway…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: (Shakes head slowly:)
What in the world was that Kevin boy thinking, Daria, attacking your science
teacher like that?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (Rolls her eyes:) <i>Muh—om</i>!
“Thinking” and “Kevin” do <i>not </i>go in the same sentence! (Frowns:) I can’t <i>believe</i>
I actually liked that jerk once!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JAKE: (Frowns, slams fists on
table, which startles everyone and rattles the dishes:) Well, crap! And to
think that I liked that jerk, too! (Everyone gives him an odd look, to
which Jake quickly adds, panicked:) I mean, not like <i>that!</i> It was when
he came over that time to work with you on some school project, Daria,
remember? We bonded while watching the Pigskin Channel!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Small smile:) I
remember, Dad, (Adds, cuts a wry eye to her sister:) though he didn’t exactly
“work” with me as well as he did with <i>Quinn</i>…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (Glares:) Oh, that’s <i>really</i>
funny, Daria! I just <i>told</i> you that I liked him once! I don’t like guys
like Kevin anymore, as a matter of fact, (throws her hair back, waves her off:)
I’m <i>way</i> past him <i>and </i>guys <i>like </i>him! (Glances at her nails
again)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Thought v.o., somber:
Yeah, I know, especially since you’re into guys like <b>David</b>, now.) 
(Notices Darren giving Quinn a subtle, concerned stare, with Jane cocking her
own, curious eyebrow at him. Jane then glances briefly at Daria herself)
(Thought v.o.: And apparently, I’m not the <b>only</b> one who’s come to this
conclusion…)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Stops staring at Quinn
when he notices Jane, glances at his wristwatch, turns to Helen and Jake, small
smile:) Uhh, hey, aren't you two going to be late for work? (Begins to stand:)
Here, I'll start to clean up--</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: (Mild frown as she gently
reaches over and grabs his arm:) You'll do no such thing, young man! After
cooking this delicious breakfast, there's <i>no </i>way I'm going to allow you
to do any more extra housework this morning! I'll clean up the dishes. I'm
taking a few days off from the firm while you're here, anyway. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Daria and Quinn looked briefly
shocked, along with Jake. Despite their all noticing that Helen was indeed
doing far less work these days at the firm because of her new partnership, none
of them figured that she would take off the <i>entire</i> time for Darren’s
visit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: (Not noticing their
expressions, continues:) Taking off will also give me time to decide whether or
not to recommend to the other litigants that we should renew our lawsuit
against those <i>Weekly Blabber </i>bastards. (Frowns:) How <i>dare </i>they <i>and
</i>the FBI team up to hide the fact that you were innocent over killing that
Bowman man just before settling with us, Darren?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Slight smile:) Like I
said, Helen, I’m just happy that the FBI cleared me. (Pauses, adds:) When you
think about it further, it’s not as if the FBI and Bowman’s conglomerate
“teamed up” to do this. The FBI simply found out after investigating that I had
an ironclad alibi, and told the <i>Blabber, </i>which decided to quickly settle
with you and those psychologists so they wouldn’t have to pay any more money.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: (Cocks eyebrow:) Don’t
tell me that you actually <i>agree </i>with what they, particularly the <i>Blabber</i>
did, son?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: No, not from a <i>personal</i>
standpoint, but from a purely <i>business </i>one, yes. Looking at it from a
financial perspective, they were watching out for their bottom line.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: Don't you mean, watching
out for their <i>bottoms,</i> Darren? (Helen, for once, smirks at one of
Daria's cracks)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Small, brief grin:)
Good one, sis. (Takes on a serious expression, to Helen:) Look, if you want to
pursue reopening the lawsuit with the others, then it's your call, and
I'll definitely support you. But, you and the others also have $100,000 and an
apology, and as you know, legally, this could end up taking years in the
courts, with Bowman's company endlessly filing appeals. Is that what you want?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: (Pensive expression,
sighs:) I--don't know, son. I <i>do </i>know that although we signed an
agreement not to sue Bowman’s company in the future again after we settled, I’m
of the opinion that this development <i>does </i>change things legally, and
<i>can</i> be challenged. (Ponders, turns:) Jake, Daria, Quinn, what do you all
think? Should I try to reopen the lawsuit? I'm sure the psychologists would
follow whatever I decide, since they deferred all of the legal matters in this
case to me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JAKE: Gee, honey, maybe we
should just drop it? I mean, Darren's got a point. Why go through all that
legal hassle?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (Brightens, gasps:) But
it could even mean <i>more</i> money, and everything, Mom! (Daria mouths,
&quot;It figures&quot;, to herself) You can really get that company but good!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: One for, one against.
What do you think, Daria?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Pauses, considers:) This
is like <i>Let's Make A Deal</i>, where you already have a nice prize, but then
you're offered a chance at an even better one if you exchange what you have for
what’s behind door number three, but it incurs risk because it could turn out
you could win something useless, like, oh, a year’s supply of  pore refiner—</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (Mildly offended,
frowns:) --Hey! Speak for yourself, Daria! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Small Mona Lisa smile,
while the others chuckle:) I’m not, Quinn. I’m speaking for <i>you</i>. <i>I</i>
don’t need the stuff. (Quinn rolls her eyes. Daria grows serious:) Financially,
and I might add, ironically, you and the others would have to spend the settlement money to help your case, Mom, not to mention taking up time from your jobs in court, and it still wouldn't guarantee that you'd win, even if you pooled your resources. On the other hand, you could expect a
kick-ass windfall for your troubles if you all <i>do</i> win, and it would've
been worth it, sooo… (Pauses, grows silent, ponders)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN:  (After a moment of
waiting with everyone else:) Sooo…?<br>
<br>
DARIA: (Sighs:) Bluntly, I think you should sit on what you have, Mom, so you
can come out ahead. Why gamble if you don't have to? (Quinn mouths, &quot;It
figures&quot;, to Darren. Daria notices this, adds:) It's not like we need the
money, though I'm sure Quinn really was looking forward to that second home on
the Riviera... (Quinn snorts. Jane chuckles with Darren)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: (Nods slowly:) You've all
made very good points, especially you, sweetie. I suppose I really <i>don't</i>
need the extra money, or waste the time to reopen this lawsuit. But, out of
common courtesy, I'll still contact the others who might want to go after Mr.
Bowman's company on their own. I'll tell them that I've decided to drop out,
though.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Also nods:) I think
that's a wise choice, Helen. (Pauses, smiles:) Now, getting back to those
dishes, are you sure you don't--</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: (Returns smile, firm
tone:) --Yes, I am, son. Don't worry about them. Besides, you don't want to be
late coming in early to the high school, do you, hmm? (Pauses to the confused
stares of everyone, confused frown herself:) Wait a minute...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Immediately reaches into
her pocket, pulls out her trusty pad and pencil, scribbles:) &quot;Late coming
in early&quot;. Mom, as much as it kills me to say this, that was an absolutely
brilliant and ironic quote. I have <i>got </i>to use that in a story sometime.
(Pauses, adds:) I call first dibs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Swings fist, mock frown:)
Curse you, Morgendorffer! I coulda made a ton of money using that quote in my
art!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Small smile:) Let’s
pretend I'm one of Darren's omelets and bite me, Jane. (Darren laughs with
Jane)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: (Rolls her eyes with
Quinn, who shakes her head:) Oh, for the love of--(sighs:) never mind, you two.
(Notices Jake drinking coffee:) Honey, aren't <i>you</i> going to be late for
work? You said you wanted to get as much done as possible today before you took
tomorrow off…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JAKE: (Puts down his cup:) Huh?
(Goofy grin, remembers:) Oh, yeah! I’ve decided that I'm takin' a few days off
myself, starting today! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: (Surprised look with
Daria and Quinn:) You <i>are</i>? Why didn't you tell me? What about Agnes? Is
she off, too?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JAKE: (Waves her off:) <i>Nahh!</i>
See, I've gotten Agnes to catch up on some paperwork that I fallen behind on. (Shrugs:) You know, mundane stuff, and she'll take care of any messages to
give to me when I get back. Or, she'll call me on the phone if it’s a real emergency!
(Frowns, realizes:) Besides, why do <i>I</i> have to say anything in advance
about getting a few days off, especially to see my son? <i>You</i> didn't!
(Gestures wildly with his arms:) I'm my own boss and man, dammit, and if I
wanna take off, I'll take <i>off</i>! (Looks up, frowns again, shakes fist:)
You got that, Old Man?! <i>I’m</i> taking off! (Jane and Darren glance at each
other, uncomfortable)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Thought v.o.: You're
taking off all right, Dad. Final call for flight J-A-K-E, now boarding for
parts unknown...) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (Hard sigh, frowns:)
Daddy! Like, calm down, okay?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: (Exasperated expression:)
Yes, Jake, will you get a <i>grip</i>? I'm sorry for even bringing it up in the
first place! If you want to take some days off, starting today, then that's
fine!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JAKE: (Immediately calms down:)
Oh, uh, okay, then. (Hopeful look to Darren:) Hey, Big Guy! What’re you doing
after you come back from school? I was hoping we could hang out a little before
we play that golf game with Angier Sloane tomorrow! (Crafty expression, narrows
eyes, grins:) You know, maybe go out to the club for our own golf match
beforehand, so we can get a little jump on him--?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Pauses, hesitates,
looks at Daria and Jane:) Oh, sorry, Jake. I have plans to go out with Jane and
Daria. (Jake tries to keep an understanding smile, but it’s forced) We probably
won’t be getting back until early evening as well, especially if I’m not tired
from getting up early. (Adds:) Daria, you said Tom's going to join us at that
“Pizza King” place--?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Mona Lisa smile at
Jane:) –-Yeah, where Jane's volunteered to buy us all a super large pizza with
the works, save for those damn anchovies, right, Jane? (Darren looks between
them, surprised) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Mock-glares:) <i>Ohhh</i>
yeah, Daria. Thanks ever-so-much for reminding me…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Keeps her smile:) Don’t
mention it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Returns smile:) I already
did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Mock-utters in a low
tone:) Lousy, non-precognitive senses…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: Jane, you don't really
have to buy--</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Leans over, puts her
finger on his lips:) --<i>Ah-ah</i>, dear boy! I <i>do </i>have the moolah
these days to do such a thing, you know. Why should <i>you </i>have all the fun
in buying everything for everybody? Learn to mooch off of others like everyone
else, and stop being so damn nice and generous for a change! (Removes her
finger)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Chuckles:) You’re going
to regret uttering those words. Just for that, I’m going to deliberately build up an
enormous appetite this afternoon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Evil grin:) Heh, draw up
your accursed appetite plans and make them as fancy as you want, “Darry”! I can
cover anything you, Daria, and Tom can eat at me! (Shakes fist:) Let the
challenge begin! Let the pepperoni pizzas whiz by! I have plenty of money to
throw around at you fools!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (Wide-eyed:) Throwing <i>pizzas</i>?
(Frowns, disgusted, shudders:) <i>Ewwww</i>! Gross! Why would you guys want to
do <i>that </i>with your food?! (Daria, Jane, and Helen roll their eyes, while
Darren laughs at Quinn’s crack. Quinn rolls on, not noticing:) It’s like, bad
enough to <i>eat</i> all of that icky, fat-soaked, cheese, meat, and sauce and
everything that’s on the pizzas, but to have them spilled all over an expensive
and beautiful, say, Gilaviniani dress after some dumb ol’ food fight is too
much—</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Deadpan:) --As opposed
to your nonfat, no-cheese-and-meat, paper-thin pizzas that barely are above
being classified as “cardboard”, but hey, at least your “Gilacrappy” dress will
survive, clean as a whistle. To hell with these things called “bibs”, or
“napkins”. (Quinn playfully sticks her tongue out again at Daria. The others
chuckle, though Helen gives Daria an admonishing, but playful eyebrow drop)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Cocks an eyebrow,
pauses:) Does that mean you’re not going to be able to join us, Quinn--?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: Huh? Oh, uh, no, Darren.
Sorry. I’m—(Pauses:) um, going to be doing some fashion stuff with Sandi and
Tiffany after school. (Quickly smiles:) But we’ll spend some time together
later, right? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Returns smile:) Sure.
(Chuckles, jokes:) I’ll try to “squeeze” you in with everyone else while I'm
here, somehow. (Jane pauses, appears to want to say something, but decides to
stay silent)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: (Raised eyebrows, now
realizes:) Oh my! Jane, how successful <i>have</i> you been with selling your
art?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Shrugs, looks at her
hands, turning them over as if she’s examining them, blows on them, smiles:) <i>We—ell</i>,
Mrs. Morgendorffer, I don’t wanna <i>brag—</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Smirks:) Yes, you do—</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Wild grin, jumps in,
looks around at everyone, excited:) You’re right, Daria, I <i>do</i>! See, I’m
doing pretty well locally with my artwork and sculptures. I’ve just sold two
paintings and a sculpture a couple of days ago for a nice wad of cash. It’s
been like that for a while, now. (Thought v.o., glumly tempered: Well, ever
since I first met Darren, that is…:) I figured that you knew. In fact, I’ve had
a write-up about my work in the latest local art magazine <i>Art &amp;
Sculpture Right Now.</i> (Reaches over and down into her book bag under the
table, takes out the magazine, glances at Darren:) I was planning to surprise
you later today by telling you about it. Trent and Daria already know, by the
way. (Gives magazine to Darren)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Smiles, delighted as he
takes the magazine:) That’s great, Jane! Congratulations! (The others, save for
Daria, also add their own congratulations, though Jake, still down from not
being able to spend any time with his son today, is less enthused. As for
Daria, she simply shows a tiny smile of pride in her friend)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Returns smile:) Thanks,
Darren, everybody. (Quickly adds nonchalantly:) The article’s on page ten, by
the way. The review on my work was all positive and enthusiastic as well,
(Counts on her fingers:) and it’s twelve paragraphs long, spanning three pages,
has a stunningly beautiful and gorgeous picture of me and some of my art—
(Darren chuckles, opens the magazine to page ten. Helen, Quinn, and a still
less than excited Jake rise, go around the table, and gather to read over his
shoulder)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Playful eye roll,
smirks, in a deadpan, droning tone:) –Containing approximately 10,997 words, of
which such phrases as “promising, new, hip, and deep artist” occupy every 100<sup>th</sup>
word of said article, (Curves her right hand to the form of a mouth, moves her
thumb and fingers:) yadda, yadda, yadda—</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Mock-annoyed look and
tone at Daria, returns smirk, continues on:) –<i>Annnd</i> I’ve sent a copy of
the magazine to Tess Donovan, you know, the head chancellor of the New York
City Art School, where I’m going next year--? She was pretty happy for me as
well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: --Speaking of copies, did
I also mention that you brought ten additional ones for yourself?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Wry tone and smile:) Not
until just now. Thanks <i>loads</i> for pointing that out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: Don’t mention it.
(Smirks:) Again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: I just did. (Smirks in
return:) Again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Playful, sneering tone
as he looks up from reading:) Gee, it’s a good thing all of this isn’t going to
your head, Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Returns the same tone,
smiles:) Oh, but it <i>is</i>, “Darry”. (Holds both sides of her head, shakes
it gently from side to side:) My head’s so big now, it’s practically about to <i>explode</i>
with ego! (Darren laughs)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Deadpan:) No question
about humility <i>here…</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (She shudders as she sits
back in her seat. Helen and Jake also return to theirs:) Ew! Jane! Don’t say
that!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Chuckles with Darren:)
Sorry, Quinn. I didn’t mean to gross you out <i>too</i> much.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: Yes, you did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Smiles sweetly at Quinn:)
Okay, I did, but not too much, really. (Quinn snorts briefly, shakes her head)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: (Brightens:) Perhaps I’ll
buy a piece or two of your art while I’m off, Jane--? (Jane looks quite
surprised. Daria cocks an eyebrow) I look at that family portrait in the living room, and I love it every time I lay my eyes on it! Do you have many other works that you’ve done recently? (Daria gives her mother a brief look that practically screams, &quot;You're <b>kidding</b>, right? She's an
artist!&quot;)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Notices Daria's glance at
Helen, keeps herself from grinning:) Uh, sure, Mrs. Morgendorffer. I have
several works of my paintings and sculptures in a gallery here in town, in
addition to some others in and around the area. (Reaches into her jacket
pocket, pulls out a card, which she gives to Helen:) That’s to a place called
“Gary’s Gallery”, just off of Forman Drive. I know the owner. He’s okay. Just
tell him you know me, and he’ll give you a discount.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: (Smiles:) Thank you,
Jane. (Stares at card, slight frown:) Hmm. “Gary’s Gallery”. I think I’ve heard
of this place in passing, somewhere... (pockets card)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (Looks at her pink
wristwatch, reaches down, grabs her book bag, stands:) Well, uh, we’d better
get to school, and stuff. (Grins:) We <i>are</i> gonna ride in the Escalade,
right, Darren? (Daria and Jane glance at each other as they grab their own book
bags, and stand with Darren)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Returns grin:) Of
course, sis. I promised that we would.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (Tepidly adds:) Um, you
don’t mind if you pick up my friends at their houses on the way to school, do
you? I called Sandi and Tiffany just before we ate, and told them that you
would—</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Cuts her off:) --I <i>knew</i>
there was a catch when you asked our brother to get that thing. You just <i>have
</i>to show off Darren’s fancy land cruiser to the rest of the fashion horde,
don’t you? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: (Dropped eyebrow:) Now,
Daria, I--</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (Frowns, interrupts:) --<i>Hey</i>!
For your information, I’ve ridden in luxury SUV’s before, like the rest of the
Fashion Club—</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Returns the
interruption:)  --Oh, I don’t doubt <i>that.</i> I <i>know </i>that you’ve all
had (finger quote:) "certain" standards of being seen with (finger quote:) "certain" boyfriends
in (finger quote:) "certain" vehicles during (finger quote:) "certain" times of the day and month in the past. (Quinn glares. Daria sighs, exasperated:) Quinn, I just want to quietly
travel to school this morning without what I anticipate will be your friend’s
usual prattling over being impressed by a GPS system, CD changer, DVD/ TV, and
whatever other fancy bells and whistles Darren has in his SUV.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Glances at Jane, who
merely shrugs indifferently:) Look, I don’t think--</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (Keeping her glare,
interrupts:) --Then why don’t you just <i>walk</i> to school, Daria? That way,
you don’t haveta worry about hearing that “prattling” stuff you think Sandi,
Tiffany, and I would be saying about the SUV’s G.P.A., and everything! Nobody’s
asking you to ride, anyway!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: (Frowns, suddenly stands,
commanding tone:) Girls! That’s <i>enough</i>! (Startled at her tone, Daria and
Quinn stop. Helen sighs:) Quinn, you should’ve let Darren know earlier about
Sandi and Tiffany before putting your brother on the spot like that— (Quinn
gasps in shock, while Daria slightly smirks)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Raised eyebrows:) Huh?
But it’s really no prob--</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: (Plows on before Darren
can continue:) –And that being said, Daria, I don’t think there’s any harm in
riding to school with Quinn’s friends in Darren’s rental. It’s not so far that
you couldn’t put up with a <i>little </i>talking, at least. (This time, it’s
Quinn’s turn to smirk. Daria’s mouth turns down slightly in disapproval) From
what I’ve seen, it’s quite a nice vehicle, and I couldn’t blame your sister or
her friends for wanting to talk about it. (Hesitates:) Er, in fact, if you’re
receptive, son, I’d like to ride in it myself, since I’ve never ridden in an
Escalade before, (Adds tepidly, in her falsetto tone, forced smile:) um,
perhaps when you and I visit where I work--? Eric and my other partners want to
meet with you again, dear. (Daria cocks an eyebrow, but remains silent)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Pauses, shrugs:) Sure,
no problem, and of course I‘m receptive, Helen. In fact, I have an extended,
named, nonowner liability insurance that covers any immediate family members
if they want to drive it, (Quinn brightens up in delight. Darren notices,
grins, adds:) except you, of course, sis. You don’t even have your learner’s
permit, yet. (Quinn’s face drops in disappointment. Darren adds:) However, when
you get it, I’ll put you on next time as well, as long as somebody from the family’s
riding with you, that is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (Smiles:) Okay, Darren, I
can wait! I’ll be getting my learner’s permit later this year, anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: (Nods, satisfied:) Good.
That’s settled. (Pauses, realizes:) Wait. Quinn, don’t you have another little
friend with Sandi and Tiffany, too? What’s her name--? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (Scowls briefly, annoyed
that her mother would forget so easily, sighs:)  “Stacy”, Mom. She’s staying
out of school today to get ready for that Bliss Cosmetics interview thingy in
Baltimore I told you about last night, remember?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: Oh, yes, “Stacy”…
(Notices Jake, who seems sad and has a faraway expression:)  Jake--? Is
something wrong? (The others look at Jake)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JAKE: (In his own little world,
stares ahead, thought v.o.: Gee, maybe I should’ve gone into work so I’d have
something to do. I wonder if Helen’s gonna be busy after she calls those
shrinks? Crap! Why can’t Andrew, Steve, and Calvin be off today like me?! I'll
tell you why, Jake! It's because they don't like you, except to use you through
your son! It's not fair, dammit! Maybe I’ll just play with my train set, or
something…)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: (Cocks an eyebrow, nervously
glances at the others, a bit louder in tone:) Er, <i>Jake</i>--?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JAKE: (Snaps out of his trance,
goofy grin:) Huh? Oh, uh, sorry, honey, everybody. I was just thinking about
what I could do with my spare time today. (Sighs, slumps, looks off into space,
mutters just loud enough:) Guess I’ll just play with myself ‘till you guys get
back—</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>


<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (Wide-eyed, stunned:) DADDY! <i>Ewwww!</i>
(As she runs out from the dining room, disgusted look:) If I didn’t have to go
to school, I’d take another shower! <i>Ewwww! Ewwww!</i> (Disappears around the
corner)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: (Same expression as Quinn:) QUINN! No, wait! Your father didn't mean it like-- (Turns, red-faced at the [obviously unintentional] inference, frowns, hard sigh:) DAMMIT, JAKE!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JAKE: (Completely baffled as he
looks after Quinn:) Huh? What’d I say?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>HELEN: (Quickly turns to a <b>very</b> widely-smirking Daria and Jane, points to the way out:) DARIA! JANE! DON'T EVEN <b>THINK</b> ABOUT SAYING A <b>DAMN</b> THING!

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Darren, who had been laughing
hard all during this time, had fallen down to his knees on the dining room floor, holding his stomach, red-faced, and howling. His eyes started to water,
and he was unable to speak, much less even to think, coherently. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Helen, still red-faced and
embarrassed, briefly glanced down at her laughing son. She thought about saying
something to him, but gave up, sighed, slumped back into her chair, and put her

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><i>(Scene Twenty-five: The
Lawndale High parking lot, about fifteen minutes later. Darren’s rental SUV
rolls into a parking space. A few students walking by in the background stop
and stare. Darren, holding what appears to be a computer notebook, gets out
with a smiling and chattering Quinn, who had been riding shotgun. Sandi and
Tiffany, both of whom had been in the second row, and are also smiling and
chattering, follow, as does Daria and Jane, who were in the third row. The
remaining FC’ers gather around Darren for a moment, talking)</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (As she and Jane get out,
low voice:) Actually, as much as I hate to admit it, the ride here wasn’t
half-bad, (Jane smirks. Daria frowns:) and no, I’m <i>not </i>talking about the
quietness and comfort of the Escalade, or those damn rear headset TVs we all
had—(Adds tepidly:) tempting as it was. I’m referring to Quinn’s not being able
to go on about the leather upholstery like she really wanted because of
Darren’s questions to Sandi on how she was doing with, well, you know… </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: Those sessions with her
“shrink”? (Nods:) Yeah, I admit I was rather curious, too. It’s not as if
Sandi’s announcing how she’s doing to the world…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: Would <i>you</i>? In
fact, Quinn’s said that as far as the rest of the school’s concerned, they <i>don’t</i>
know about her little secret trips, not even Ms. Li.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Frowns, realizes:) Hold
it. I seemed to recall that our fellow students suspected that Sandi <i>was</i>
seeing someone, right--? (Daria shows a quick nod) For a day or two, even Sandi
was unpopular with the male horde, here. (Hesitates, adds:) I, uh, even felt a
little sorry for her. (Daria says nothing. Jane narrows eyes, looks off:) That
suddenly passed away completely a few days later because they were around her
again in the hallways. (Pauses:) I wonder why…?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: One name: Quinn. I'd
asked her if she knew what the deal was. She said Sandi’s brothers admitted
being responsible for blabbing it out because they were pissed that Sandi
wasn’t “totally” their sister.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Frowns, stunned:) You
have <i>got </i>to be kidding me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: Nope. Anyway, Quinn said
that she had “addressed” the problem, and that Sandi’s sibs were gonna recant
their story. (As she stares at Sandi and the others talking to Darren:) I
suspect Quinn used her usual feminine charms on Sandi’s younger brothers to
change their minds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Staring as well at
Sandi:) Yeah. Quinn <i>does </i>have that gift, doesn’t she? (Pauses, slightly
uncomfortable look as Sandi chuckles at Darren with the others:) Uh, Daria, I’m
really, really, <i>really </i>okay with Darren’s concerns about Sandi over what
happened that night in the warehouse, but do you <i>really</i> think Sandi’s
over Darren--</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Slight frown as she
continues her own stare, interrupts:) –<i>No. </i>(Jane turns to her,
surprised. Daria looks back:) She told you that herself on our way up to
Darren’s, remember? Sandi knows that Darren will only see her as a casual
acquaintance, though, maybe even as a friend, and that’s all, nothing more. I'm
pretty sure of that. (Hesitates:) Uh, in a way, that sorta <i>impressed</i> me
that she’d accept him like that, similar to that night when she put your hand
on Darren’s in that warehouse... (Jane grins. Daria frowns, mock-warning tone:)
Shut the hell up, Jane…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Keeps her now-wider grin,
gentle tone:) <i>Relax,</i> amiga, I’m not gonna tease you about “softening up”
on Sandi, really. You didn’t with me when I felt sorry for her. (Sighs as she
eyes Sandi again:) I just wish I could say the same about you-know-who not
wanting Darren…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (After a moment, in what
she hopes to be an encouraging tone:) Krystal will slip up, Jane, no matter how
much she claims to like Trent just to piss you off. Darren has eyes only for
you, so keep that in mind. Otherwise, outside of the “Sty Lark” thing that we <i>will
</i>prove, the only way they’ll break up after her seeing Darren’s still with
you is that Krystal will--drop—(Pauses, catches herself, winces:) dammit.
Insert foot in mouth, now…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Smirks:) Go on, you <i>know
</i>you wanna say it, Daria. (Daria forms a tiny, pained expression) That
she’ll eventually get tired of my brother, and of his (finger quote:) “ways”,
thus hurting him in the process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Looks off,
uncomfortable:) Well, since you’ve done the dirty work for me, I’ll just leave
my grateful tip, and walk off, now… (starts to leave)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Small chuckle, puts her
hand on Daria’s shoulder, stops her:) Not so fast, amiga. (Daria turns back.
Jane removes her hand) We’re stuck together on this, so where you go, <i>I </i>go.
Don’t worry. I’m not angry at you for helping me to point out Trent’s
shortcomings. I knew them long before I met you, anyway. (Daria appears to look
relieved) I know, though, that he cares for me, and I care for him, and we’re
there for each other. That's why I'm trying to be here for him. (Slumps, sighs
at the irony:) Thing is, though, Krystal’s actually having a <i>positive</i>
effect on him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Stunned, deadpan:) Stop
lying to me, Jane. (Jane grins) I could see the Lane housecleaning yesterday,
since I actually <i>did </i>see it, but now, you’re starting to freak me out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Rolls eyes playfully:)
Then you’re gonna absolutely have a conniption after I tell you the things
she’s got him doing now. (Pauses for effect:) She's going to have him get
rid of his prized blue clunker today for a newer clunker. (Daria’s eyes grow
wide in shock) I know Trent’s gotten a pretty good stash saved up from the
group’s little summer tour, but still, he’d need a miracle to work out a
reasonable deal for Happy Herb to give him something in return.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Closes her eyes, shakes
her head slowly:) This is <i>not </i>happening. (Pauses:) Trent’s really going
to get rid of his Plymouth? (Adds:) Seriously?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Nods quickly, then
suddenly snorts:) Oops. Silly me. He <i>wishes</i> he could get rid of it<i>.</i>
I’m sure he’ll still have it when I return home. (Grins evilly:) I hope on
their way back from being turned down by Happy Herb that Krystal will have to
push it back to the house, like Monique’s had to do on occasion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Small smile, not Mona
Lisa:) This thing we know as &quot;hope&quot; supposedly springs eternal, so it
could happen. (Jane chuckles) What other things have Krystal mesmerized Trent
into doing?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Glances at watch:) Hm.
I’d tell you right now, but the day lasts only 24 hours. Seriously, I’ll spring
the rest on you later. We gotta fill in our spare time in and around classes
while your brother’s castigating Li.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: All too true, I suppose.
(Pauses:) I’m curious, Jane. (Pauses:) Um, why did you allow Quinn to sit up
front with Darren? (Glances off briefly, uncomfortable expression:) I’d figure
that you’d want to—well…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Pauses:) To be honest,
other than deferring to her when she literally was hugging the front passenger
door after we ran out of your home, I think it was to let your sister spend
some personal time with Darren. I don’t mind sharing him with you guys on
occasion while he visits here, (Adds in a quieter tone:) and that goes for your
folks, too. I have plenty of him when <i>I </i>visit him by myself, you know.
(Small smile:) You gotta catch up on those missing 20 years somehow, right? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Stunned expression,
clearly touched, for Daria:) Jane--? I—well, you don’t have to do—(Pauses,
glances off, frowns, low tone:) dammit…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Grins:) Wow. Daria
Morgendorffer, tongue-tied <i>and </i>emotional. Who’d have thunk it? (Daria
glares. Jane smiles, undeterred, shrugs:) Hey, if you want, I’ll let <i>you</i>
ride up front when we leave school today, you know, so you guys can converse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Quickly recovers from
her shock, small smirk:) Funny. I’ll admit you caught me off-guard, there,
Jane. Nice joke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Smirks back for a brief
instant, adds:) Oh, I’m sorry, Daria. Did I <i>sound </i>as if I were joking?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Daria turned to Jane with a
surprised look as Darren, who was putting what appeared to be a small slip of
paper into his shirt pocket, came over with Quinn and the others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: Thanks again for your
dad’s number, Sandi. (Daria and Jane glance at each other, then at Sandi)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>SANDI: (Shrugs, glances at Jane
and Daria, in her usual cool tone:) Like, it’s no problem, Darren. I’m sure my
father will eagerly accept your offer. He's complained about business being
kind of down where he works, anyway. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Inquisitive look with
Daria, cocks an eyebrow:) &quot;Offer&quot;--? Ah, what’s up--?  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Darren was about to answer when
Brittany and her fellow cheerleaders suddenly appeared from behind the building
that led to the parking lot, drawing the group’s attention. They
were dressed as usual in their familiar pep uniforms, holding pom-poms. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Brittany spotted them as well,
showed a brief, dreamy expression when she eyed Darren, quickly shook it
off, and turned to the other cheerleaders, who were now also eyeing Darren
dreamily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Jane couldn’t help but to show
an amused (but also smug) smile at the girls ogling her boyfriend, whereas
Daria merely rolled her eyes in disdain. Quinn frowned, confused with the rest
of the Fashion Club. Darren simply cocked an inquisitive eyebrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: Hey, what’s going on?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Now smirks with Jane,
feigns ignorance:) Beats the hell out of me, sis. Let’s wait and see.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>BRITTANY: (Points via her right
pom-pom:) Okay, girls, there he is, like Daria said! Let’s give him our rousing
welcome cheer! (Heads toward them)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>GIRL: (Shakes out of her
Darren-inspired reverie. It’s Angie, in case you’re interested:) Huh? Oh, yeah,
Brittany, okay! C’mon, girls! (The others also shake out of their own
Darren-inspired reveries, follow her over. Several students notice, and decide
to follow)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Brittany and her fellow
cheerleaders stopped in front of them, and began to wave their pom-poms while
cheering and high-stepping in remarkably precise movements:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><i>Darren! Darren! </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><i>He's our man!</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>The cheerleaders finished their
chant, stopped, and stared expectantly (And dreamily yet again) at Darren,
waiting eagerly for a response, whereas Daria and Jane silently smirked at each
other, and the remaining Fashion Clubbers merely stared, baffled, first at each
other, then at the cheerleaders, and finally at Darren. After a moment, a
tongue-tied and confused Darren realized he should say something. Before he
could, however, Quinn beat him to the punch while glaring at her sister.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: Oh, <i>I</i> see, Daria!
You put Brittany up to this because of what I teased you and Jane about

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>BRITTANY: (Looks at her fellow

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Confused like Sandi and

us...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Mona Lisa smile:) Sorry,
Quinn, but the cheer was indeed all Brittany's idea. Right, Brittany?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>BRITTANY: (Nods, enthused, grins:)
Uh-huh! I told Daria and Jane about it yesterday after school!</p>

the psychic chick, Quinn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (Shudders as Sandi and
Tiffany look at her:) Ugh! It was all just a coincidence, honest, guys! I don't
look in crystal balls, and stuff--(Adds:) unless it's to look at my reflection,
or something. Only those old, ugly, Gypsies with those huge, unfashionable
earrings do that!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>SANDI: (Actually catches onto the duo’s

so, Quinn… (Jane returns the smirk)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Deadpan:) Good of you to
straighten <i>that </i>out, sis. I admit that I sort of fibbed a little about
the science assignment this morning. I just called Brittany to prepare her and
her preppy cohorts for Darren's early arrival.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Smiles, hooks her arm
with Darren's, in her mock-motherly tone:) And what are we supposed to say when
someone does something really nice for us without wanting something in return,
&quot;Darry&quot;?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Returns the smile,
uneasy shrug:) Ah, &quot;sucker&quot;--? (Jane chuckles while Daria smirks)
Seriously, Brittany, everyone, er, thanks for the, uh, “welcome”?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>BRITTANY: (Resumes her dreamy
look with the other cheerleaders, brief, girlish giggle and dreamy tone:) It
was our <i>pleasure</i>, Darren... (Jane tries not to laugh. Darren looks off,
a little red-faced, and uncomfortable)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>At the same instant, Ms. Li,
speaking on her cell phone, exited the front doors of the school, and stopped
after a few steps.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>MS. LI: (Scowls:) <i>Iiiiiii </i>don’t

you reportedly then compared to <i>my</i> efficient running of this school!
(Pauses, sneers:) Oh, so it <i>wasn’t</i> like that, you say? Well, take it up

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>BRITTANY: (Nods her head
rapidly, interrupts, puts her hands on her hips:) --Uh-huh! “Owe” me! Thanks to
<i>you</i>, my poor Kevie’s going to be out of school today, and he probably
won’t be able to go to my party, which is gonna be tomorrow night by the way,
either! I don’t care <i>what </i>he signed on that paper, <i>I </i>didn’t, and
I want recomprehension, or something! (Quinn and the others look at each other,
confused, like Darren. Brittany narrows her eyes at him:) I’ll need a
date to replace him, and I thought--</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Alarmed, quickly
interjects as she literally puts an iron grip on Darren’s free arm. Darren
winces briefly, cocks an eyebrow at her:) --Uh, Brittany, Darren <i>will</i> be
there with me, Daria, “Tim”, and the rest of the Lawndale teen universe, <i>right</i>,
Darren? (Gives him a pointed look. Daria cocks an eyebrow in surprise)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Gives Jane an odd look
for a moment:) We <i>will?</i>  (Jane squeezes his arm again, so
Darren winces again:) Ah! Uhhh, <i>riiight--</i>I'll--be there, (adds, glances
at Jane oddly again:) I <i>guess</i>...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>BRITTANY: (Giggles, delighted,
claps her hands:) Oh, <i>goody!</i> (Turns to her preppy cohorts, grins:) And
we’ll <i>all</i> be wanting to dance with you, too, right, girls? (Jane
suddenly turns pale. Daria sighs)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>GIRLS: (Giggling and grinning as
they eye Darren and nod:) Yeah! That’s right! Make sure you play some
slow-dancing CD’s, too! (Darren gives Jane a look that screams, “What in the <b>world</b>
have you gotten me into?”)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Ignores Darren’s
expression for the moment, narrows eyes, pointed tone:) And then we’ll be <i>even</i>,
right, Brittany?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>BRITTANY: (Pauses, takes note of
Jane’s tone:) Ummmm, sure, Jane! (Holds hand up:) Even Steven!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Through clenched teeth,
looks off:) <i>Fine…</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Before anyone (particularly
Quinn and Darren) could say another word, Ms. Li forced her way through the
small crowd.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>MS. LI: (In an admonishing
tone:) <i>Whaaaat</i> is going on here, students? You <i>knooow</i> I don’t
condone any—(Pauses in shock as she sees Darren, gasps:) <i>Mr. Appleton?</i>
You’re here already? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Slight smirk, switches
his computer notebook to his other hand after releasing Jane, holds out his
free right hand:) Yes, and you must be Ms. Li, the school principal. Please,
call me “Darren”. I decided to come in a little earlier to get our, (Pauses,
looks for the right word:) “transaction” out of the way. I hope that’s not a
problem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>MS. LI: (Recovers quickly,
smiles, shakes his hand:) Oh, of <i>coooourse</i> not! (Adds, almost falling
all over herself:) And please, call <i>me</i> “Angela”. (Snorts, actually
delighted) Oh, this is <i>so</i> exciting!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Thought v.o., disgusted
look with Jane, deadpan: And call <b>me</b> &quot;ill&quot; from listening to
Li's sucking up to Darren. I'd swear that if he bent over right now, she'd probably
be kissing his ass--[Pauses:] along with Brittany and the rest of her Bimbo
Brigade, who I'm sure wouldn't stop there...)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Slight, unconfortable
smile:) Uh, sure. I first need to make a quick, personal phone call, then I'll
meet you in your office in a few minutes, all right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>MS. LI: (Grinning like crazy:)
But of course, Mr. Ap--Darren! Take your time! (Suddenly turns serious, waves
to students:) <i>Leeeet's</i> disperse, everyone! Classes will be starting in a
few minutes! Run along, now! (Some students begin to turn away, the same for
Ms. Li)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (Steps up, concerned
look:) But, Ms. Li! (Ms. Li stops, turns) What about the flowers and the
welcome banner? (Darren's mouth flattens in seriousness as he eyes Li, which
Daria and Jane notice) We wanted to show my brother!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>SANDI: (Ditto, with Tiffany:)
Yes, like, we worked quite hard on that!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>TIFFANY: Yeah...it
took...time...to get...the right...yellow and blue...to match...the hallways...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Deadpan:) Time which was
well-spent, obviously. Those hallways are vitally important, as we all well
know. (Quinn, for once, catches her sarcasm, frowns. Jane tries not to snicker
with Darren)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>SANDI: (Curt nod in agreement,
totally missing the sarcasm:) Daria is quite correct, Ms. Li. Surely, Darren should see the end results of our labor!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Before Ms. Li can
speak, smiles [Or tries not to laugh, take your pick]:) It's okay, Quinn, everyone.
I'll have plenty of time between classes to see them both after I speak to Ms.
Li, I promise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>MS. LI: (Slaps hands together:)
Well! If that's all, I'm going to clear my schedule, and prepare my office--</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Smirks, very low tone to
Daria:) --She means &quot;interrogation room&quot;-- </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>MS. LI: --for your arrival! I'll
see you in a few minutes, Darren! (Leaves in a giddy manner)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (Turns to Sandi and
Tiffany:) Um, you guys go on ahead, okay? (Narrows eyes:) I need to speak to
Daria and Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>SANDI: (Pauses, glances between
them all:) Uh, very well, Quinn. We'll, like, save a spot for you at the
restroom mirror. Come on, Tiffany... (she and Tiffany leave)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Quinn watched her friends leave,
then turned to her siblings and Jane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (Cocks an eyebrow:) What
was <i>that</i> all about with Brittany? What's going on? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (As he dubiously eyes at
Daria and Jane:) Just what <i>I </i>was thinking...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Gives Darren her best
&quot;puppy-dog&quot; look as she begins to back off:) Uh, look, guys, we
promise to you that we <i>will </i>reveal all later--</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Steals a curious look at
Jane, but takes it up:) --But, um, Jane and I really should go in and prepare
for our teacher's usual attempts at mind-wiping us today... (begins to leave
with Jane)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (Frowns, holds arms out:)
But--</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JOEY: (Suddenly arriving from
the side with his fellow J-sters, grinning like an idiot:) Hi, Quinn! (Quickly
adds:) Uh, hi, Darren! (Both Daria and Jane stop, watch for an instant)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JEFFREY: Hey, Quinn! (Ditto:)
Hey, Darren!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JAMIE: (Yes, on both:) Hey,
Quinn and Darren!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (Distracted:) Huh?
(Smiles:) Oh, <i>hiiii</i>, guys!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Narrows eyes, pauses:)
Uhh, hello, &quot;Joey&quot;, &quot;Jeffrey&quot;, <i>annnnnd</i>
&quot;Jenkins&quot;, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JAMIE: (Heartbroken expression:)
Nooo! It's &quot;Jamie&quot;, Darren! &quot;Jamie&quot;!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARREN: (Slowly grins. Inside,
he <b>knows</b> it's &quot;Jamie&quot;:) Sorry, Jamie, just kidding you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JAMIE: (Quickly recovers,
grins:) Oh! I knew that!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>QUINN: (With her feminine ego
meter running high:) So, what's going on, guys--? (The Three J's immediately
blabber flattering gibberish at the same time to her. Darren appears amused at
the three's antics, crosses his arms, shakes his head)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Daria and Jane, forgotten, and
for once grateful to the Three J's for their timely arrival, resumed their
departure. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>However, while walking with
Daria, Jane began to warily eye Brittany and the other cheerleaders, who were
ogling Darren dreamily once more as they were about to walk in the school,
giggling and talking amongst themselves. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>After a moment, Jane developed a
wicked smirk, then wordlessly sauntered back toward Darren, leaving Daria, who
stopped, dropped a curious eyebrow, and watched. She then noticed Brittany and
the other cheerleader's dreamy expressions, and immediately surmised what Jane
was planning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Keeping her smirk,
brushes by them all, breaks in:) 'Scuse me, guys. I forgot to give my boyfriend
a little something before I left. (Suddenly pulls Darren down to her, and gives
him a <b>very</b> deep kiss, wrapping her arms around his neck. The Three J's
stare at the scene, wide-eyed with several more students watching nearby as
well, along with Quinn. Daria simply stares with her &quot;expressionless
expression&quot;, while Brittany and her friends jealously frown at the scene
for a moment, then wordlessly storm into the school)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Ten seconds later, Jane allowed
Darren to come up for air, and wordlessly turned away from them all to return
to Daria, leaving Darren in an apparent swoon. Quinn merely rolled her eyes and
crossed her arms at Jane's impertinence over suddenly kissing her brother,
while the Three J's continued to stare in awe between the retreating Jane and
Darren, their mouths now dropped in shock. Quinn then glanced at her swooning
brother, sighed, then walked up to him, and began rapidly snapping her fingers
in his face, shaking him out of his reverie. Darren stared down at his sister
for an instant, and then at the back of his girlfriend, forming a wry smirk of
appreciation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Jane walked over to Daria, and
the two resumed walking towards the school. Other students wordlessly watched
them, mumbling amongst themselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (In a low voice:) Let me
confirm--you were marking your territory?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Grins, ditto with her
voice:) Damn straight, amiga, (Adds, shrugs:) although I didn't exactly lift my
leg while doing it--</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Smirks:) --Don't you
mean &quot;squat&quot; in <i>our </i>case?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Returns smirk:) I stand
corrected. Anyway, I wanted to drive home the point to Brittany and her friends
that Darren's <i>my</i> boy. They may get him for a few hours at her party for
a dance or two, but that's <i>all</i> they'll get.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: Speaking of
&quot;getting&quot;, why'd you let Brittany sink her claws into getting my
brother for that party? You could've told her to take a hike, you know. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (As they walk inside:) <i>Could
</i>I, Daria? Think about it. Imagine Brittany bitching and moaning all day
over how her &quot;Kevie&quot; was somehow &quot;shortchanged&quot; by Darren,
and demanding her &quot;recomprehension&quot; fee. Take the way most of our
fellow students are brain wise, her popularity, and before you know it, she'd
have <i>them</i> riding us as well. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Slight nod:) Points
taken. I think we underestimated Brittany's determination, in addition to her
brain. It's a tad more functional than Kevin's in comparison.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: All too true. It's like
comparing a worm's brain to an amoeba's. (Pauses, sighs:) Ah, well. Besides,
like I said, it's only for a few hours, and we'll be there as well to enjoy the
party, and to insure no hanky-panky on Brittany and her friends' parts with
Darren. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Pauses, cocks an
eyebrow:) Um, what's this &quot;we&quot; stuff?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Raised eyebrows:) Huh?
What do you mean? (Smiles:) You, me, Darren, and that &quot;Tim&quot; guy
you're going with. (Daria gives a droll look) What's the problem? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: Well, if you'll remember,
I never said <i>outright</i> that I'd go when Brittany made that offer
yesterday, only that it was up to Darren, and I certainly can't speak for
Tim--(slight scowl:) I mean, <i>Tom</i>. He might be busy doing something else,
or for that matter, <i>we</i> might be on our own that night, or I'll just stay
at home if he is. (Slight smirk:) Looks as if you'll have to work overtime to
keep my poor brother out of those vixen's hands, but that shouldn't be a
problem, should it, since you said you didn't mind sharing Darren--? (Jane
narrows an eye at her. Daria's smirk grows a bit wider, adds:) Hey, maybe
Quinn'll help you out, since she'll probably go to it. You could get her to
dance some with Darren.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>Both stopped in front of Daria's
locker. Daria unlocked and opened it to place some of her books in from her
bookbag. Jane leaned against the locker beside Daria's, and crossed her arms,
forming a slight, wry, smirk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: You know, when I think
about it, most of this is <i>your</i> fault, amiga.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Surprised look:) Excuse
me? How is it mostly <i>my </i>fault? (Shuts her locker and locks it)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: <i>You </i>were the one
who came up with the &quot;invisibility&quot; joke about Darren to Kevin and
Brittany in the Pizza King, starting Kevin's obsession with it. <i>You </i>were
the one who yesterday made up the story about Darren coming up with a final
experimental &quot;invisibility formula&quot;--</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Interrupts:) --Which, if
I recall, <i>you</i> went along with--</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Ditto:) --True, hence <i>my</i>
tiny share of the blame, which I accept wholeheartedly, since I said it was
&quot;mostly&quot; your fault, but when I compare it to <i>your</i> share--</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Sighs, concedes, places
her forehead on the locker:) --Okay, okay, <i>fine</i>. (Pauses:) You're right.
I <i>suppose</i> I should come with you tomorrow night, huh?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Grins. She and Daria
begin walking:) No &quot;supposin' &quot; about it. We'll both suffer, along
with Darren, and maybe &quot;Tim&quot;, if, like you said, he has nothing to
do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: Misery loves company.
(Pauses, mild, miserable expression:) And it'll be a company of misery, I
think, at that party for me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>JANE: (Chuckles:) Cheer up,
Daria, it'll be fun. It's not as if you haven't been at Brittany's for a party
before, and you can get in some practice for next year's festivities in
college.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>DARIA: (Deadpan:) I'd rather
practice <i>that</i> next year, thank you very much, preferably at the last
second. Cramming <i>is</i> a tried and true time-tested approach to anything to do
with college, or so I've heard... (both walk into Mr. O'Neill's classroom) </p>
