All right, &quot;Tom&quot; it is, then. Sorry. I forgot you wanted to be called
that from now on. If Tom <i>Sloane</i> happens to be around when you are
though, I think it'll be safe to say that there's going to be some confusion.
(Grins:) Maybe we can work out some nicknames to distinguish you two, or
something, like &quot;Tom One&quot;, or &quot;Tom Two&quot;. (Chuckling is
heard from the other end) I'll contact you after Ms. Li and I finish our
"financial" discussion. Please thank your boss as well again for agreeing to do

text-autospace:none'>Darren dropped his cell phone in his shirt pocket, then
reached down and grabbed his computer notebook, which sat at his feet on the
sidewalk. He glanced at his wristwatch, and then began the trek inside to Ms.
Li's office.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>He chuckled to himself as he walked, recalling when he was
with Quinn and her three &quot;suitors,&quot; Joey, Jeffrey, and Jamie a few
minutes earlier. The three, after inundating Quinn with their usual attentions,
began to turn those same attentions to <i>him</i> right after Quinn had left
during the first tardy bell. They offered to get him anything before he met Ms.
Li, or even providing to be "bodyguards" to Darren between classes while he was
visiting, practically babbling over one another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Needless to say, Darren dropped an eyebrow and wordlessly
gave each of the "Three J's" a <i>very</i> strange look. Other students, who
had overheard as they were walking to their classes, did the same while
whispering amongst themselves, and then giving their <i>own</i> strange looks
to the "Three J's". </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>After a moment of confusion over noticing Darren's
expression, then of sudden realization, Joey, Jeffrey, and Jamie practically
had fallen all over themselves in denial. They frantically waved their arms in
a panic as well, and even gave each other the evil eye in suspicion. They
immediately accused one another of giving Darren the impression that they
&quot;swung that way&quot;, almost coming to blows. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Darren rolled his eyes in light amusement for a brief
moment, sighed, and then after about 10 seconds of verbal assurances of
understanding, (along with a gentle physical intervention of pulling them
apart) they confessed that they simply wanted him to give a positive word about
them to Quinn--and to stay on his &quot;good&quot; side. </p>

over what happened that day in that &quot;Pizza King&quot; place when I first
&quot;met&quot; them--or when they first met <b>me</b>, that is. I'd suspect
that they're still a little afraid of me, and they'd think I'd beat them up
again, especially to keep them from having Quinn's &quot;honor&quot;
besmirched, or something. I wonder if they knew how she felt about her former
tutor. Quinn said she told them she was going to be too busy with her tutoring
to go out on any dates with them during the school week--or with any other boys
her age, it turned out. Daria said Quinn hadn't been out much after David
Sorenson left, studying more at home when she wasn't with her friends...<o:p></o:p></i></p>

this morning when she said she didn't like guys like that &quot;Kevin&quot;
anymore. Once you get a taste of the &quot;real&quot; stuff, you wouldn't want
the &quot;cheap&quot; stuff anymore, I suppose. Silly as it is, I'm guessing
she said nothing to them about Sorenson. I couldn't blame her, after seeing the
way <b>these</b> guys are, though I'm quite sure they're pretty harmless, and
aren't the stalking type--I <b>think</b>. They just want to protect Quinn. I
couldn't fault them for that...</i></p>

text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Darren told them that he couldn't make any promises, but
that he'd do his best to put in a word or two to his "baby" sister for them. He
also apologized once again about what happened in the Pizza King, and added
that he simply wanted to be friends. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The "Three J's" became wildly ecstatic in their gratitude
(and to their personal relief), so much so, that they nearly had given a
combination of potential back and hand sores to Darren from patting and shaking
each so hard repeatedly. Only when the second tardy bell rang, did the three
stop, and immediately left inside for their classes, once again telling Darren
that if he ever needed anything while visiting, to let them know. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Darren merely stared after them, and then shook his head
slowly in disbelief. He wondered how Quinn could have survived their attentions
for so long. After gathering his wits, he had called Tom Griffin's office to
talk about the &quot;offer."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Darren resumed his walk, going inside the high school. In
the front hallway, he did a double-take, immediately noticing the flowers and
banner Quinn had mentioned. Several types of flowers, from roses to carnations
and daisies, had been placed in a huge bundle below the large, blue and gold
colored banner, which read in capital letters, "Welcome to LHS, Darren!"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>Darren stared at the sight for a long moment in disdain,
sighed, and then walked over to garner a closer look. If nothing else, he <i>did</i>
promise his sister and her friends that he would at least look at the
&quot;fruits&quot; of their hard work. He gingerly stepped between the flowers,
glanced up at the banner, hesitated for an instant, then reached up and felt
the banner's bottom middle with his right index finger and thumb. All the while
his eyes were narrowed, examining it carefully.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;

away from the banner.</p>

right side by an eager and scrawny-looking, freckle-faced, redheaded teenager.
This, of course, was Charles Ruttheimer the Third, better known to the denizens
of the school (and around Lawndale, for that matter) as &quot;Upchuck.&quot;
Darren stopped and cocked an eyebrow at him.</p>

it's my job to scour the hallways for any possible late-arriving stragglers to
class, and to report them immediately to our beloved principal, so she can
lecture them on the error of their ways. We have cameras all over the school's
hallways, obviously, (gestures a hand at one down at the far end of the
hallway) but Ms. Li wanted to add a "human" touch as well. </p>

his ribs, which promptly elicited an agonizing scream from Rocco. Next, Krystal
performed a series of well-positioned, viciously hard karate chops/slaps on
Rocco's face in rapid succession as she sat on his chest. She followed this by
her suddenly leaping up, then delivering a viciously hard kick between Rocco's
legs, which caused all of the still-shell shocked males in the club to wince.
Rocco screamed even louder as he balled up like a sleeping baby, releasing a
torrent of expletives. Krystal stared down at him in utter disgust.</p>
