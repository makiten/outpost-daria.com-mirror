   <blockquote>What if Helen and Jake Morgendorffer had a <i>son</i> they thought had been dead for years? How would Daria and Quinn react to having a full-blooded <i>older</i> brother?  How would everyone's lives change, for the better--or for the <i>worse</i>?  Let's find out, shall we? By the way, this is my first fanfic, so please don't be too hard on me if you criticize.  Thank you.</blockquote>

<p><i>Prologue</i></p>
<br>


<p><i>(Somewhere over the Rockies, near Denver:)</i></p>
<br>
   <p>Both engines of the private jet were stalled.  The pilots were frantically preparing for an emergency landing. The jet was dropping at a fast and steep drop rapidly.

    There is a man and a woman in the jet's luxurious compartment, both securely buckled in their seats, with nervous looks on their faces. The man, a tall, balding gray-haired fellow wearing an expensive blue business suit. The woman, also with gray hair, although not as gray as the man's, wearing an expensive green designer dress. The man reached over to hold the woman's hand.</p>


<p>MAN: It'll be all right, dear. <i>(Thought v.o.: I'm not sure I believe my own words...I've got to strong  for her...)</i></p>

<p>WOMAN: O-of course it will be, dear. <i>(Thought v.o.: Oh God, if something happens to us, what will happen to Darren, especially with what happened to him after--after---no, don't go there---it's not over yet.)</i></p>

    <p>As if in <i>answer</i> to the woman's thoughts, the jet suddenly <i>nosedives</i> and plows into a <i>mountain</i>.</p>
<br>


<p>Chapter 1- Discoveries</p>
<br>
<p><i>(Five minutes later...)</i></p>
<br>
     <p>It was a pleasant late Friday evening at the Appleton estate only forty miles northwest of New York City, at least to <i>Darren Appleton</i> it was. He was reading <i>Watership Down</i>, a novel written by Richard Adams. Darren was quite handsome, with wavy reddish-brown hair and deep-blue eyes. He had a jutted jawline, and looked  athletic in build, with broad shoulders. He was wearing his pajamas and housecoat, and was sitting at his desk in his room. The spring semester from Eastward College was over, and summer was now here, all the better to relax from his vigorous and rigorous studying, and to try and get past--<i>her</i>...</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Thought v.o.: I can catch up on this book now, with dad and mom gone to that seminar.)</i></p>


    <p>Suddenly the phone rang beside Darren's bed. Slightly irritated, he looked over at his wall clock and saw that the time was 11:30 p.m.</p> 

   
<p>DARREN: <i>(Thought v.o.: Who's calling this late at night? Everyone should have known that my parents have gone to that seminar. Well, if it's business, dad will <b>skin</b> them alive. Best let Elenor pick it up. I'm too much into the book to stop now.)</i></p>


   <p>Downstairs, <i>Elenor</i> the maid was fixing herself a late-night snack in the mansion's large kitchen. She was a small woman in her early 60's with white hair and a stern, worn look. Looks, however, could deceive. On the inside, she was a softy, at least where Darren was concerned. She picked up the kitchen phone on the third ring.</p>


<p>ELENOR: This is the Appleton estate. Who is speaking?</p>

<p>VOICE: (Cold:) Elenor, this is <i>William Appleton</i>.</p>


   <p>Elenor's face turned into a <i>scowl</i>. She never liked William personally because of his rather brutish, agressive personality, and neither did Darren, for that matter. How <i>dare</i> he call now? She knew that Darren's father, William's brother, gave specific instructions not to call after 10:00 p.m. concerning business. <i>Wait a minute</i>. William <i>knew</i> that his brother and sister-in-law were gone to the seminar in Denver, so <i>why</i> was he calling at the <i>mansion</i>?


<p>ELENOR: (Pause:) Master William, is there something wrong?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: (Still cold voice:) Elenor, will you let me speak to Darren, please? Thank you.</p>

    <p>Elenor thought about saying something else, but decided to wait. For some reason, she felt that now would not be a good time to haggle over William's untimely call.</p>

<p>ELENOR: One moment, Master William.</p>

    <p>Elenor called on the intercom that was connected to Darren's phone in his room upstairs.</p>

<p>ELENOR: Master Darren, I'm sorry to disturb you, but there's a phone call for you from Master William.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Frowns, thought v.o.: What the--who does Uncle Will think he is? This had better be important...)</i> I got it, Elenor. <i>(Switches on receiver button, curt greeting:)</i> Hello, Uncle Will, this is Darren. What do you want?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Pauses, cold voice:)</i> Darren, I don't know exactly how to tell you this---but---</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(A little annoyed, glancing in his book:) Spit</i> it out, Uncle Will.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(In still-cold voice:)</i> I just found out that your parent's jet has <i>crashed</i>---there were <i>no</i> survivors. I'm sorry.</p>


    <p>Downstairs, Elenor began to eat her snack, a tuna sandwich. Before she could bite into it, she heard an <i>anguished</i> scream from Darren's room, a scream so <i>loud</i>, it seemed to <i>resonant</i> throughout the entire mansion. Elenor dropped her sandwich on the floor, startled. She bolted from the kitchen to the upstairs.</p>


<p><i>(The place is Dumas, California circa 1980, the time is about 2:30 a.m. In a house, the scene is chaotic:)</i></p>


<p>DOCTOR: Mrs. Morgendorffer, I'm going to have to perform a <i>cesarean</i> to remove the baby. There's no other way. I'm going to have to put you <i>under</i>.</p> 
                                                                                                   

    <p>Helen Morgendorffer was beside herself. She was laid up on a table and pregnant, screaming for her husband Jake, who was behind her. She reached behind, grabbing him by the front of his shirt.</p>


<p>HELEN: DAMN IT, JAKE! Don't let him do <i>this</i> to me! There has to be some <i>other</i> way!</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Timidly:)</i> Doctor Turley, isn't there some other way to do this? I mean, you're by <i>yourself</i> and all--</p>

<p>DR. TURLEY: <i>(Calmly cuts him off:)</i> --You and your wife came to me in the middle of the night, Mr. Morgendorffer. There's no time to get to the hospital. Both of you did the right thing in coming to my home, trust me. I've done this many times without a midwife. <i>(He puts on his mask--one would think that he's grinning beneath it--he also gives a mask for Jake to put on,)</i> I'm going to require your assistance, however, for some minor things--get me some warm water in my kitchen, please.</p>

 
    <p>Jake, now with his mask on, begins to get the water, but the situation seemingly becomes too much for him, for he faints. Dr. Turley immediately notices, while Helen watches him and sighs loudly.</p>


<p>HELEN: JAKE!! Get up!! <i>Damn</i>!!</p>

<p>DR. TURLEY: <i>(Now suddenly in a hurried voice:)</i> I'm sorry, Mrs. Morgendorffer, but your husband has fainted, and I don't have the time to help him <i>and</i> you, now! If I don't put you under, you could <i>die</i>, the <i>same</i> for your <i>baby</i>! Please!</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(After a quick glare at Jake sprawled out on the floor, now resigned to her fate:)</i> A-all right, Dr. Turley. D-do what you must, just save my baby.</p>

<p>DR. TURLEY: <i>(Calm again:)</i> Of course, Mrs. Morgendorffer, now just relax. <i>(The doctor places an ether-soaked cloth over her mouth,)</i> Now breathe deeply--there you go--breathe now...</p>

   
    <p>Helen's eyes closed. Dr. Turley began.</p>


    <p>The next instant, Helen's eyes came open. She was lying in a bed in Dr. Turley's bedroom. Immediately, she saw her husband looking at her with a unreadable gaze. Helen looked down on herself. She had had the baby.</p>


<p>HELEN: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Jake, where's our baby boy? Let me see him.</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Quiet voice:)</i> Helen, honey, oh God--I'm so sorry--f-forgive me, it's all my fault, I shouldn't have fainted, m-maybe the baby w-would be here-- <i>(Sobs, puts head in hands)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Becomes alarmed:)</i> --Jake, what the HELL are you talking about?! <i>WHERE'S MY BABY?!</i></p>

<p>DR. TURLEY: <i>(While walking into the room, followed by paramedics, slight pause:)</i> I--I'm so sorry, Mrs. Morgendorffer. The baby is--<i>dead</i>.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Eyes wide open:)</i> OH GOD!! NOOOOOOOOOO!!</p>


    <p>Helen suddenly awoke from her nightmare screaming. Jake, lying next to her, jumped up screaming as well. Both hugged each other fiercely.</p>


<p>HELEN: <i>(Sobbing slightly:)</i> JAKE! Oh God, I'm having <i>that</i> dream again!</p>

<p>JAKE: You <i>too</i>, Helen? I thought I was the <i>only</i> one!</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Stunned:)</i> Y-you--had the dream about the <i>baby</i>, too?</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>Baby?</i> Honey, I thought you were talking about my <i>Old Man</i>! <i>(Eyes begin to narrow, looks up:)</i> That selfish <i>bastard</i>--</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Really annoyed:)</i> JAKE! What the <i>hell</i> are you talking about?! I'm talking about losing our baby!</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Confused at first, but it finally hits home:)</i> O--oh, yeah, <i>that</i>.</p>


    <p>About a few moments later, Quinn bursted into their bedroom, followed a few seconds later by Daria. Needless to say, both were not happy campers, at least one could tell by Quinn. Daria, however, was <i>another</i> story.</p>


<p>QUINN: MUH--OOM! What's the <i>matter</i> with you? I need my <i>beauty</i> sleep! I'll get <i>wrinkles</i> and lose my <i>cuteness</i>!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Usual deadpan, sarcastic voice:)</i> Oh <i>yeah</i>. That's <i>definitely</i> a loss for <i>all</i> of us. <i> (Quinn glares at Daria)</i> Look, as much as I would like to see your screaming <i>wake up</i> the dead and <i>terrorize</i> the town, I want to spend my first day of summer fully refreshed, ready to live my life preparing for the hellish boredom and/or relaxation one would expect with this particular season. Please resume your horizontal positions in peace. Thank you. <i>(With this, Daria goes back to her room, while everyone stares at her leaving for a moment.)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(To Quinn:)</i> I'm sorry, sweetie. I just--had a nightmare. It happens.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> Okay, Mom, <i>whatever. (Quinn leaves)</i></p>


     <p>Helen laid back on the bed beside Jake. She looked at the alarm clock beside her bed. It was 3:30 a.m. Jake looked at his wife, worried.</p>


<p>JAKE: Honey, are you all right?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(While looking at the ceiling, sighs:)</i> No, Jake, I'm <i>not</i> all right. Those damn recurring dreams about losing our baby are coming <i>back</i>. <i>(Shutters:)</i> I thought I'd put <i>that</i> behind me forever, or at least had come to grips with it. Now, for <i>some</i> reason they're <i>back</i>, and it scares the hell out of me--again.</p>

 
      <p>Jake, in a rather rare show of decisive movement for him, reached over and embraced his wife. He tenderly held her.</p>


<p>JAKE: <i>(In a quiet tone:)</i> Helen, I know I've said this many times, but if I hadn't <i>fainted</i>--</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(In a soothing voice:)</i> --It wouldn't had made a difference, Jakey. It's okay. I just know I don't want to go back to those <i>psychologists</i>.</p> 

<p>JAKE: <i>(Gathers up the courage:)</i> Helen, uh--maybe we should <i>tell</i> the girls. They have a right to know that they had a brother, even if he was <i>stillborn</i>. They <i>deserve</i> to know. Our families have kept this a <i>secret</i> long enough.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Gently pushes herself away from Jake:)</i> Jake, don't you think I <i>haven't</i> thought about that? It's just--just--they might think that we thought that they were <i>weak</i>, that the girls might think we couldn't <i>trust</i> them with something like this, that they couldn't <i>handle</i> it. God, just the other week Amy asked me the same thing over the phone what you just told me. She said it was like keeping a <i>lie</i> going. W--what will the girls think about us lying to them after all of these <i>years</i>, Jake? About having a baby of their <i>own</i>? They might think this could happen to <i>them</i>! <i>(Wraps her arms around herself)</i></p>

<p>JAKE: Is <i>that</i> what you're afraid of, dear? That the girls might be <i>afraid</i> of having children if you tell them? Uh--well--</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Curious look:)</i>--What, Jake?</p>

<p>JAKE: --Well, Daria's a <i>strong</i> girl, and we can support Quinn if she'd gotten upset over this. But you had Daria and Quinn <i>after</i> what happened that night. You <i>recovered</i>.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Deep in thought:)</i> So I did. <i>(Pauses:)</i> All right, Jake. We'll tell them tomorrow, but listen <i>very</i> carefully--<i>(she looks him dead in the eye with a determined look, one that Jake knows all too well:)</i> do not even <i>think</i> of reading a newspaper when we tell them, because I want your  <i>full</i> attention, <i>got</i> it?</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Timidly:)</i> Y-yes, dear. <i>(Turns on his side away from her:)</i> G-good night, honey.</p>

<p>HELEN: Goodnight, Jake. <i>(Closes her eyes)</i></p>


     <p>Later that morning, Helen and Jake were waiting in the kitchen for their daughters. They sat at the table looking warily at each other, holding hands and not saying a word. There was a newspaper that Jake had retrieved earlier that sat on the table between them, but it was still rolled up in a plastic bag. Fortunately, it was a Saturday, and there was no need to do the usual Morgendorffer two-step-go-to-work-no-time-for-talk performance. Helen had even taken the batteries <i>out</i> of her cell phone! This was a serious moment, indeed.</p> 

     <p>Soon, Quinn came into the kitchen, apparently in a rush.</p>


<p>QUINN: Can't talk now, guys! I've gotta go see the Fashion Club at the mall for a summer fashion meeting---</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(In a firm voice:)</i> Quinn, sit down.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> But Muh--oom--</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(In "back-up" mode to Helen, firm voice as well:)</i> Sweetie, <i>please</i> do what your mom says, this is <i>really</i> important.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Sits down reluctantly:)</i> Look, if this is about my <i>grades</i>, I <i>passed</i>! I <i>barely</i> passed, but I passed! <i>No</i> summer school, right? <i>(Slightly sounding desperate, eyes widening:)</i> <i>Right</i>?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Sighs loudly:)</i> No Quinn, it's <i>not</i> about your grades. It's something <i>else</i>, and it's <i>not</i> about you. Just wait until Daria gets here, okay?</p>


     <p>As if on cue, Daria walked into the kitchen. She noticed that everyone was looking at her.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Usual sarcastic deadpan repartee:)</i> Okay, I'm here. <i>(Pauses:)</i> You may now resume your daily activities. <i>(Waves hands:)</i> No, no, there is no need to rise up for me. I will continue my daily motion of cereal consumption, early morning style. If you wish, you may watch. <i>(Pauses:)</i> No, don't thank me. It's your <i>right</i>.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Sighs even louder and longer:)</i> Daria, <i>please</i> sit down and listen to us. <i>(Daria does so)</i> There is a really important matter your father and I have to tell you and Quinn.</p>

<p>DARIA: It <i>must</i> be. The famed <i>newspaper</i> hasn't been taken out of it's famed <i>plastic bag</i>, and you're not talking on your famed <i>cell phone</i>.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Ignores Daria's remark:)</i> Girls, your father and I have to tell you a secret, a family secret that <i>(Pauses:)</i> we've kept from you for almost <i>twenty</i> years. You see--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Suddenly jumps up & points to Daria:)</i> I <i>knew</i> it! Daria's <i>adopted</i>! You found her <i>real</i> parents! I couldn't <i>possibly</i> be related to <i>her</i>!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Looks directly up at Quinn, sarcastic:)</i> Actually Quinn, I came up with a <i>similar</i> conclusion. <i>(Looks at Helen and Jake, smirks:)</i> Now, tell me who my <i>real</i> parents are, and I can <i>leave</i> you all to go <i>back</i> to them, and away from all of this <i>nonsense</i> that I call a <i>family</i>.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Becoming angry:)</i> GIRLS--</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Jumps up:)</i> DARIA'S--<i>ADOPTED</i>?! OH NO! HELEN, I THOUGHT THIS WAS ABOUT THE BABY WE LOST BEFORE DARIA AND QUINN WERE BORN!</p>


     <p>The stunned silence, needless to say, spoke <i>volumes</i>.</p>



<p><i>(The same morning, at the Appleton mansion, an hour later)</i></p>


<p>WOMAN: You cold-hearted <i>fool</i>! How could you call Darren like <i>that</i>?</p>


     <p>The scene in the foyer of the Appleton mansion was full of tension. There was a woman, a spunky-looking, attractive, late-forties red-haired beauty with a fierce scowl. She glared up into the face of a large, husky, balding black-haired man with thick, bushy eyebrows and an equally fierce scowl. Also in the foyer were Elenor the maid and Claude the butler, standing to the side.</p>



<p>MAN: <i>(Finger pointing in woman's face, angry:)</i> Now see <i>here, Millie</i>--I wanted Darren to find out first, and not let the media get the story out, and let him find out that way by them calling here, or Darren seeing it on TV, or reading it in the paper!</p>

<p>MILLIE: You could've called me and we <i>both</i> could have told him in <i>person</i>! You had <i>no</i> right to leave poor Elenor to console Darren! You've <i>no</i> feelings, William!</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Now enraged:)</i> NO FEELINGS?! Millie, our brother and sister-in-law are <i>dead</i>! You--</p>

<p>ELENOR: <i>(Walking up to both:)</i> Please, Master William and Mistress Millie! Master Darren may wake up and hear you arguing! <i>(Lowers voice:)</i> Besides, <i>Claude</i> got out of bed last night and <i>helped</i> me with Master Darren. <i>(Claude nods frantically)</i> It was all we could do to finally get him to sleep, and that was only a <i>few</i> hours ago!</p>


     <p>Millie and William seemed to calm down after Elenor's tepid intervention, but still glared at each other. Claude, a tall, thin, grey-haired man with a thin mustache, followed Elenor's lead and walked up to both.</p>


<p>CLAUDE: <i>(In a soothing voice:)</i> Master William, Mistress Millie, won't you have something to eat? You need your strength.</p>


     <p>William let out a quick, affirmative grunt and walked to the dining room. Millie glared after William a second more, and then followed him.</p>

     <p>The dining room was large and opulent, with a chandelier hanging from a high ceiling over a twenty-foot long oak table. The walls and ceiling were covered with paneled mirrors that were trimmed in a gold leaf finish. The floors were marble with intricate flower designs. William and Millie sat down in two of the twelve matching oak chairs that surrounded the table, with William sitting at the end of the table and Millie sitting near the end, beside William.</p>


<p>MILLIE: <i>(After staring down at the table a second, looks at William:)</i> I'm--sorry for shouting at you, William. It's just that--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Looks away, calming himself:)</i> --You don't have to apologize, Millie. You're--right, of course. I shouldn't have called like that. I just wasn't thinking.</p> 

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Reaches over and pats William's hand, in an assuring voice:)</i> William, as you've said, we've both <i>just</i> lost our brother and sister-in law. In tragic situations, people do things without thinking clearly. Now we've got to think about Darren. My God, what's going to <i>happen</i> to him?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: Look, Elenor has called his friend Chris--no, <i>Curtis</i>--yes, that's his name--over this morning. Along with us, he'll help Darren get through this. Didn't Darren get over his girlfriend's <i>death</i>? What was her name--</p>

<p>ELENOR: --<i>Stephanie</i>, William. It was Stephanie, and no, Darren <i>didn't</i>. He seemed to be coming out of it a little, but her death only happened a little over a <i>month</i> ago. There's no way he could've gotten over it <i>that</i> quickly, or for that fact, maybe <i>ever</i>.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: What do you mean, Millie?</p>

<p>ELENOR: <i>(Sighs, exasperated:)</i> Wasn't it <i>obvious</i>, William? They were in <i>love</i> with each other.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Rolls his eyes:)</i> <i>Hmph</i>. Love is for the <i>weak</i> at heart. I've <i>no</i> time for it.</p>

<p>MILLIE: No, you <i>don't</i>. <i>(Sarcastic tone:)</i> You're too busy thinking about money, power, and the conglomerate. I think something like love goes <i>over</i> your head.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Now with a low, meanacing tone, talks through clenched teeth:)</i> That's <i>enough</i>, Millie. <i>Someone</i> has to continue to keep Appleton Industries going, and to handle the fallout from this.</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Becoming angry:)</i> <i>Fallout</i>? Is that all you care about, our <i>stockholders</i>?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: Damn it, Millie! <i>Arthur</i> and <i>Lucille</i> would think about the company! They'd want us to put their house in order--<i>(then adding as an afterthought in response to Millie's incredulous look:)</i> <i>after</i> dealing with Darren, of course.</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(More sarcasm:)</i> <i>Of course</i>. Don't you think that's why <i>wills</i> are read? Wills are what put houses in order, don't you <i>forget</i> that.</p>
      
<p>WILLIAM: Oh, I <i>won't</i>. You won't <i>let</i> me.</p>


     <p>A moment later, Claude and Elenor walked in with several covered trays. Beneath the trays were several dishes: two egg omelets, bacon, toast, orange juice, jam, and coffee. William and Millie began to eat. For a few minutes, there was only the sound of eating. William then stopped and looked directly at Millie.</p>


<p>MILLIE: <i>(Mildly frowns:)</i> What?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(While drinking coffee:)</i> There's going to be a press conference a little later this morning at the <I>Peerdale Hotel</I> downtown. The National Transportation Safety Board may have some answers as to <i>why</i> the jet went down. I'm wondering if I should be there to represent the company--</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Sarcastic, cuts him off:)</i> --Yes, William, represent the <i>company</i>, don't worry about the <i>family</i>. Show your <i>true</i> colors. I'm sure there's no one <i>else</i> in the company to do that.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Grows angry again:)</i> <i>Look</i>, Millie--</p>


     <p>The doorbell suddenly rang.</p>


<p>MILLIE: Do you think that's <i>Curtis</i>? The media isn't allowed on the estate's grounds. Did you tell security to let Curtis by?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Rolls his eyes:)</i> Oh, come <i>on</i>, Millie! Of <i>course</i> I let them know! Do you think I'm a <i>complete</i> idiot?</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(While smirking:)</i> No. Just a <i>half-baked</i> one. <i>(Gets up to go to the door)</i></p>


      <p>William glared in silence after Millie, then got up and followed. Claude had already opened the front door.</p>


<p>CLAUDE: Master Curtis, thank you for coming.</p>


     <p>Curtis stood at the doorway. He was a medium-height, athletic-built African-American with his hair cut in a box shape. He had a look of deep concern on his clean-shaven face. He had walked into the foyer just as Millie and William came in.</p>


<p>CURT: Hey Claude, Millie, Mr. Appleton.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(With something of a phony demeaner:)</i> Now, Curtis, there's no need to be so <i>formal</i>. Just call me William. <i>(Reaches out to shake Curtis' hand. Curtis returns his shake with a limp, insincere one.)</i></p>

<p>CURTIS: Yeah, <i>right</i>. <i>(Looks around:)</i> Where's Darren? Is he still asleep?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Shouting in a level-sounding voice:)</i> No, Curtis--I'm awake now.</p>


     <p>Everyone looked up at the top of the stairs. They saw a very weary-looking Darren still in his housecoat and pajamas. He looked down on them, his expression unreadable. He came down the stairs in a slow, drawn out walk.</p>


<p>CURTIS: <i>(Walks up to Darren:)</i> Oh man, I'm so <i>sorry</i>. <i>(He grips Darren's shoulder, gently sqeezing it.)</i> Is--is there anything I can do for you?</p>

<p>DARREN: No, man. I think I'm still in shock, but I also think I'm all cried out. This is <i>surreal</i>. <i>(He then hugs his Aunt,)</i> Aunt Millie, are you and Uncle Will all right?</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>Us</i>? <i>You're</i> the one we're worried about, Darren. 

<p>DARREN: <i>(In a weary voice:)</i> I'll <i>survive</i>. I <i>have</i> to. Right now, I've got to eat something, or at least try. <i>(He walks trudgingly off towards the dining room, then stops and turns around, looks at Claude:)</i> Claude, I've already told Elenor this, and I want to tell you as well--thank you for being there for me with Elenor last night. I don't know <i>what</i> I would've done if either of you weren't there for me. <i>(Claude nods quietly, slightly smiles. Darren begins to walk again, then stops, rolls his eyes, and turns to Curtis:)</i> Where <i>are</i> my manners? Curtis, have you eaten breakfast? Did Aunt Millie and Uncle Will offer you something?</p> 

<p>CURTIS: It's okay, man. I already ate. <i>(Hesitates:)</i> You want to--<i>talk</i> or something?</p>

<p>DARREN: Later. Right now, I just want to <i>eat</i> or something. Come on, just keep me company, and just watch me eat. <i>(Curtis smiles weakly, then walks into the dining room with Darren, followed by Claude.)</i></p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Looks after them, with something of a sneer, in a low voice:)</i> Well, now. I see he had words for <i>me</i>, didn't he?</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Raises her eyebrow at William's rather bitter tone of voice:)</i> He asked if you <i>were</i> all right, William.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: No, Millie, he asked <i>you</i> if I was all right. He didn't say it directly to <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Sighs, rolls her eyes:)</i> <i>Now</i>, William--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Curt:)</i> --<i>Forget it</i>, Millie. Look, I've got to go home to my <i>Park Avenue</i> apartment and get some company papers, and then get to the press conference. I'll see you later. I'll see that security continues to keep the press out. <i>(He immediately leaves, slams the door)</i></p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Looks at the door with a scowl on her face, eyes narrow, talks to herself in a low, hushed tone:)</i> You <i>really</i> push <i>everyone</i> away, don't you, brother? Well, I won't let you try to push and bully Darren in his grief concerning the company, not that he'd <i>let</i> you, I'd suspect. You can count on that, and--oh,no--the <i>secret</i> will be out--my God--Darren, as if everything that has happened to you already <i>wasn't</i> enough...<i>(Millie's face turns pale)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to the Casa de Lane residence, Lawndale, the same morning, Jane's room)</i></p> 



     <p>Jane was packing some clothing into a duffel bag on her dresser, not painting at her easel for a change. Daria sat on Jane's bed, watching her.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(With a stunned look on her face:)</i> You and <I>"Princess Prissy"</I> almost had a <i>WHAT</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: You heard me, a <i>brother</i>. He would have been two years <i>older</i> than me.</p>

<p>JANE: Geez--and run the reason by me <i>again</i> as to <i>why</i> your parents didn't tell you after all this time?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sighs:)</i> Mom and dad, particularly mom, were afraid Quinn and I were going to be afraid of having children of our own after hearing of her losing the baby, or at the least, think of her and dad in such a way that would cause us to <i>lose</i> respect for them for not telling us the truth after all those years, as if I haven't done that <i>already</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: Uh-huh--and what did <I>"Little Miss Cupie Doll"</I>, who <i>(lets out a small snicker:)</i> "accused" your parents of <i>adopting</i> you, do again?</p>

<p>DARIA: She looked <i>completely</i> stunned--she didn't say <i>one</i> word after our parents told us everything, not even asking <i>any</i> questions, then excused herself and went up to her room.</p>

<p>JANE: Whoa. She didn't say <i>one</i> word at all? <i>(Daria shakes her head)</i> And how did <i>you</i> take this?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Pauses, then shrugs:)</i> It was cool with me. I'm used to the <i>standard</i> Morgendorffer lunacy. The self-centered, egomaniacal "cousin", the wimpy, out-of-touch dad, the domineering mom--this is <i>tame</i> stuff.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Pauses packing, skeptical look on her face:)</i> Yeah--<i>right</i>. Now, how did you <i>really</i> feel?</p>


     <p>Daria stared at Jane a second. She slowly put a finger to her mouth and then got up and went to Jane's door. She opened it and looked out into the hallway both ways, then slowly shut the door back. Jane watched her with a slightly arched eyebrow, curious. Daria then leaned back against the door with a bit of a wistful look on her otherwise impassive face. She stared a second more at Jane, and then spoke.</p>


<p>DARIA: Jane, I <i>felt</i> that---for sure I was--<i>(dramatic pause:)</i> <i>adopted</i>. <i>(Mona Lisa smile)</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Frowns slightly, smirks:)</i> Oh, <i>hardy-har-har</i>. <i>Very</i> damn amusing. You're telling me you weren't affected at <i>all</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: Well, I have to admit I was caught off guard there for a second. It would have been--<i>interesting</i> having a big brother, someone to confide in, or to just hang around with.  Quinn <i>doesn't</i> count, of course, so I'll have to settle for <i>you</i>, I guess. <i>(Pauses:)</i> I'm curious though--what's it <i>really</i> like to have Trent as a big brother?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(While resuming her packing:)</i> When he's <i>not</i> sleeping? It's cool. I can rely on him to really be there for me, you know, giving me rides and stuff. I guess he feels like it's his <i>duty</i> to watch out for me since our parents are usually off gallivanting someplace, and I <i>ain't</i> complaining. <i>(Pauses:)</i> I think a brother's role is to be there for you <i>anytime</i>, I guess.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Subtly changing the subject:)</i> Well, your mom's not gallivanting anywhere without you this time. Where are you <i>two</i> going again?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Tries to hide her excitement, but failing somewhat:)</i> We're flying out to the Grand Canyon and are going to some Native American villages in the Southwest. She wants me to experience pottery skills from the locals firsthand for a <i>month</i>, and I can paint some, too. <i>(Smirks:)</i> At least by some small miracle, all of our bills are paid up for now, so we don't have to worry about the house being <i>repossessed</i>. <i>(Pauses, gets a serious look on her face, reflects:)</i> Maybe <i>that's</i> why I'm going with her, so we can have a <i>little</i> time together, to make up for her being everywhere <i>but</i> home--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Looks slightly despondent because her friend's going to be gone, but inwardly happy for Jane, adds her dry wit:)</i>--And <i>nothing</i> like a chance for some good, old-fashioned mother-daughter <i>bonding</i>, right? <i>(Slight smirk)</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Looking a bit sheepish:)</i> Well, I guess--<i>(she then smirks wickedly:)</i> and <i>speaking</i> of bonding, this gives you a chance to bond with <i>Trent</i>! <i>Nobody</i> will be around!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Shakes her head slowly:)</i> Jane, come on, knock it off. Besides, Trent's leaving with Mystik Spiral tomorrow for two weeks on a "find-a-gig-tour" across the country--<i>if</i> he and the band can make it <i>around</i> the country in one piece in the Tank. Why would they come up with a <i>cockamamie</i> idea like that anyway?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> Besides Trent getting an <i>excuse</i> for a cheap vacation from his sleeping? Trent and the boys think that some record agent out there in the "Great Unknown" will spot their "hidden" talent if they play at carnivals or trade shows or something like that. They even actually have a few gigs already locked up. So what's the big deal? You'll have two weeks left when he gets back to make your move. <i>(Realizes something, smirks:)</i> Hey! <i>I</i> didn't tell you that he was leaving for two weeks, at least not yet. How'd <i>you</i> know? Did he tell you <i>himself</i>? Looks like you're <i>already</i> making that <i>first</i> move, girl.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Foiled your plan to tell me at the last minute, eh? C'mon, cut out the <i>yenta</i> act already. Besides, I got that info from your <i>mom</i>, not Trent, and she <i>volunteered</i> it.</p>

<p>JANE: No can do with the yenta act, dear, at least not yet anyway. My plan of getting my mom involved with getting you and Trent together is working <i>perfectly. (She rubs her hands in an evil way, like an evil scientist in a movie, smirks again, and laughs in a mockingly evil way:)</i> WOO-WHO-HA-HA!</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sighs, slightly exasperated:)</i> Yeah, really <i>smooth</i> plan there, Lane. At least you'll have a little reprieve with your mom way off someplace. Me, I'm gonna be stuck with the <i>hell</i> that is my family. My parents are thinking about going to the beach or the mountains. If it's the beach, I can consider <i>drowning</i> Quinn <i>accidently</i>. If it's the mountains, I can consider <i>pushing</i> Quinn off a cliff <i>accidently</i>. <i>(Shakes her head slowly, hand on her cheek:)</i> What a choice, what a choice.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Crosses arms, mocking motherly sympathy:)</i> Awww, poor baby.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Anyway, have a good time. I know I <i>won't</i> here. Don't worry about the house--I'll keep an eye on it while you guys are gone.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Genuine smile:)</i> Thanks, Daria.</p>


     <p>Suddenly, there was a knock at Jane's door. Daria opened it and saw Trent standing there.</p>


<p>TRENT: <i>(In his usual low-key, laid back voice, smiling:)</i> Hey, Daria.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Quietly smiling back:)</i> Hey, Trent.</p>


     <p>Trent walked past Daria and went to Jane.</p>


<p>TRENT: Janey, I can't find my songbook. Have you seen it?</p>

<p>JANE: Don't tell me you lost it when we went to Fremont. Did you check in the Tank?</p>

<p><i>(Note to reader: See, of course, "Speedtrapped")</i></p>

<p>TRENT: Hey, maybe you're right. Jesse said for me to leave it in there so I wouldn't forget it again. I'll call Max and Nick in my room and check. <i>(Turns to leave, walks past Daria:)</i> Take it easy, Daria.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(A bit hesitant:)</i> Um, see you, Trent. Have a good trip, and uh--be <i>careful.</i> <i>(Trent nods to her and goes into his room, shuts his door)</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks, mocking Daria's voice:)</i> <i>"Be careful."</i> Oooh-la-la! Why don't you go to Trent's <i>room</i> and say <i>goodbye</i> to him in your own "special" way?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Blushes slightly, playfully waves her fist:)</i> Why don't I just send you on your vacation in <i>my</i> own "special" way, <i>ahead</i> of your mom, courtesy of "Air Daria", <i>fist</i> class? <i>(Adds her own smirk:)</i> Besides, aren't you going to say goodbye to <i>Tom</i> in <i>your</i> own "special" way?</p>

<p><i>(Of course, dear reader, Jane met Tom in "Jane's Addition")</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Now frowns, finishes her packing:)</i> He and I <i>aren't</i> on speaking terms right now, you <i>know</i> that.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> Oh, come on. Don't tell me you're <i>still</i> mad that he <i>joked</i> about your abstract painting of him yesterday.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Still annoyed, eyes narrowed:)</i> He said it looked like a <i>rodent</i>, Daria--a rodent! To me it <i>wasn't</i> a joke. Come on, Daria, I take my art really, <i>really</i> seriously, right? <i>(Daria nods)</i> When he laughed, it kind of--<i>hurt</i>. I know I shouldn't have <i>shouted</i> at him, but that painting represented my <i>feelings</i> for him, and he didn't seem to appreciate that. <i>(Frowns:)</i> Actually, when I think about it now, this was just <i>another</i> moment in a long line of--<i>(checks herself, says nothing else)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Miffed somewhat, eyebrow cocked:)</i> Another--moment--in a long line of--<i>what</i>?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Shrugs her shoulders, waves it off:)</i> Nah--it's <i>nothing</i>. <i>(Sees Daria's skeptical look:)</i> <i>Really</i>. <i>(Looks away uncomfortably for a moment)</i></p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>Oookay. (In a serious tone now:)</i> Look, Jane--Tom and I aren't still exactly the best of er,--<i>(hesitates:) friends</i>, but I really don't think he meant any harm when he laughed at your painting. Remember, it was of <i>him</i>, and not of say, <i>me</i>. I mean, if he would've laughed at <i>my</i> portrait, you would've been <i>short</i> one boyfriend. <i>(Jane smirks)</i> Just call him and--<i>(sighs:)</i> I can't believe I'm saying this, but--<i>make up</i>.</p>


     <p>Jane looked at the painting of Tom leaning in the corner of her room for a moment, then shrugged.</p>


<p>JANE: Ah, hell. Okay, okay! You're right! <i>(Picks up her phone and dials Tom's number)</i></p>


     <p>The phone rang for about eight times, and then Jane slammed the phone down.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(In a frustrated, angry tone:)</i> DAMN! He's not home!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Trying to sound reassuring:)</i> He could be on his way over here, or maybe he'll be waiting out at the airport to surprise you. Let's not assume that anything's wrong. <i>(Looks at her watch:)</i> Hey, the plane's going to leave in less than an hour. Is your mom ready?</p>

<p>JANE: Dunno, I'll check. <i>(Walks over to door, opens it, and shouts down the hallway:)</i> MOM, ARE YOU READY TO GO?! <i>(Daria winces at Jane's loud voice)</i></p>

<p>AMANDA: <i>(From downstairs in a loud but somehow still-soothing voice:)</i> YES, JANE, I'M WAITING FOR YOU AND TRENT! WHERE <i>IS</i> THAT BROTHER OF YOURS?</p>

<p>JANE: IN HIS ROOM! I'LL SEND DARIA TO GET HIM! <i>(Daria glares at Jane)</i> Hey, you don't <i>have</i> to walk in there. Just knock and he'll comma runnin' out. <i>(Waves her hands in a shooing fashion:)</i> On withya now, girl, gotta get my bag and easel. <i>(Daria goes out in the hallway to Trent's room and knocks)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: Um, Trent? <i>(Silence, she knocks again:)</i> Trent? <i>(No response. Daria tries the doorknob, which turns, and she peeps in to see Trent sprawled out on his bed, stomach first, asleep, and yes, in his regular clothing:)</i> Well, there's a <i>newsflash</i> for you--<i>"Trent's Asleep--Again".</i></p>

     <p>Jane, now carrying her duffel bag by a strap over her shoulder as well as her easel, brushed past Daria and violently pushed open the door to Trent's room, speaking as well in one motion:</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Grins, In a loud, hysterical, hurried voice:)</i> THIS IS A RAID! PUT YOUR HANDS UP WHERE WE CAN SEE THEM! DON'T HIDE THE STASH! <i>(Trent promptly jumps out of his bed, wide-eyed)</i></p>

<p>TRENT: <i>(In a panicked state:)</i> Officer, it's <i>not</i> mine! I didn't--<i>(looks around for a second, then glares at Jane:)</i> Aw, damn it, Janey! I'd wish you'd <i>stop</i> doing that! <i>(Sits back on his bed, starts to put on his shoes)</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Sinister smirk:)</i> Hey, it's the <i>only</i> way to get you up. Come on, we're ready to go to the airport. <i>(Looks at Daria, eyebrow raised:)</i> You sure you can't go with us, Daria?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Looks uncomfortable for a moment:)</i> Nah--I've got to take care of some--<i>personal</i> stuff at home. Be sure to not send me a postcard, I don't want to send it back to you <i>mutilated</i>. <i>(Jane smirks)</i> Remember--don't worry about Tom, like I said before--I'm sure he'll see you off--he's probably at the airport, waiting to surprise you. <i>(Jane looks hopeful, and both girls go downstairs with Trent)</i></p>


<p><i>(The Morgendorffer home, same time, Quinn's room. Quinn is lying on her bed talking to Sandi on the phone)</i></p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(Her typical singy-songy voice:)</i> --Yeah, Sandi, a--uh--family emergency. That's why I couldn't come to the Fashion Club meeting at the mall.</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Usual haughty valley-girl tone:)</i> Well, like, I can <i>excuse</i> that, Quinn. We all have these types of emergencies, like the time I couldn't find the right ruby red lipstick for that white satin dress I bought at <i>Cashman's</i> a few weeks ago. It was <i>terrible</i>, I can tell you.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Fake sympathy:)</i> Ohh, right, Sandy. Uh--I was--uh--curious--</p>

<p>SANDI: Yes, Quinn, like, <i>what</i> is it?</p>

<p>QUINN: I wanted to know--what's it <i>like</i> to have Sam and Chris for brothers?</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Sounding slightly put off by Quinn's question:)</i> What exactly do you <i>mean</i>, Quinn?</p> 

<p>QUINN: <i>(Quickly covers herself:)</i> Ohh--nothing, Sandi! I just wanted to know, you know, since I'm an <i>only</i> child, just what it's like to have um--brothers? I sometimes--<i>think</i> about that.</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(In a suspicious tone:)</i> Hmm--was this, like, the "family emergency" you were talking about, Quinn?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Wonders if she should say this to Sandi, sighs, then decides to tell:)</i> Well, yeah. I just found out that I could 've had an older brother, but he died while being born. You know, I wonder how it would have turned out if he had lived.</p>

<p><i>(Note to reader: Remember "Gifted" and "Daria Dance Party", in which we saw Sandi's brothers at their worse against Sandi? This is going through Sandi's mind after Quinn's remark)</i></p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Sounding bitter:)</i> You're <i>lucky</i>, Quinn.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Taken aback:)</i> H-huh?</p>

<p>SANDI: You <i>heard</i> me. You're <i>lucky</i>. You don't have to put up with bratty, snotty-nosed little monsters who hit and mistreat you, or let you freeze outside! I had to, like, stay out of school for <i>three</i> days because I had a <i>cold</i>, remember?! You don't have to put up with stupid screaming and tattling! You don't have to worry about any of <i>that</i>!</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Slightly shaken by Sandi's tirade:)</i> T-that's <i>terrible</i>, Sandi! There has to be some <i>good</i> things about having brothers, right? <i>(Pauses, no response:)</i> Sandi?</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(After a moment, cold:)</i> No, Quinn, not at <i>all. (Changes the subject abruptly:)</i> Look, Quinn, let me tell you what we talked about at the meeting...</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Thought v.o.: I don't know why she hates them. I don't exactly feel that way about Daria, even though she is a <b>brain</b>. I just don't want to be seen <b>with</b> her--there's a difference--<b>right</b>?)(Speaks as if she understands Sandi's briefing:)</i> Yeah, I see, Sandi, uh-huh...</p>


     <p>Downstairs, Helen was watching television and Jake was beside her on the couch reading the newspaper. Helen had put the batteries back in her cell phone, but no one from her law firm had called yet about any weekend work. She was watching the morning news when a live report broke in.</p>


<p>NEWSPERSON: ---Thanks, Terri. We have a live press conference at the <i>Peerdale Hotel</i> in New York City coming up concerning last night's tragic jet crash near Denver that killed Arthur and Lucille Appleton of Appleton Industries. The National Transportation Safety Board will give their early findings concerning as to how and why the jet crashed. It is expected that because the investigation is in its preliminary stages, there will be very little information, primarily because of the remote location of the wreckage in the mountains, and that the jet's recording device, it's <i>Black Box</i>, hasn't been located yet. Stand by for further information. On a postscript, speculation rages as to what will happen with the Appleton Conglomerate, and how this will affect its performance on Wall Street. There may be a statement from the Vice-Chairman, William Appleton, soon.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Wistful look on her face:)</i> Appleton Industries. Hmm--I've heard that the Appletons had a son--<i>Arthur</i>, I think--I wonder why the report hasn't said anything about that <i>poor</i> young man?</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Looks up at Helen from his newspaper:)</i> Huh? Oh--<i>(points to the article in the front page of the paper:)</i> It says in the paper, honey, that his private life has been pretty well kept under <i>wraps</i>. His family wanted him to not grow up in the <i>"Glare of the spotlight"</i>, or something. Even trying to find a good <i>picture</i> of this <i>"Arthur Jr."</i> guy is <i>extremely</i> rare! I guess they wanted him to have a pretty normal life. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Say, <i>why'd</i> you ask about that?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Glares at Jake, sighs loudly:)</i> Isn't it <i>obvious</i>, Jake? They had a son that will outlive them, someone to carry on the line. <i>(Sad look:)</i> I wonder what would've happened if <i>our</i> son had lived.</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Thinks about when he mentioned to Andrew Landon about having a son <b>[Note to reader-see "Gifted"])</b></i>---You know Helen, <i>(puts down paper, becomes amorous in nature:)</i> we could maybe <i>start</i> on possibly having one. <i>(Begins to put arms around Helen.)</i> It's <i>not</i> too late, you know.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Brushes him off:)</i> No, Jake, not like <i>that</i>. If there's one thing I learned from those damn psychologists is that I shouldn't have a child to simply <i>replace</i> the one that I lost, but to do so out of <i>love</i>. Why do you think we waited awhile to have Daria and Quinn? <i>(Pauses:)</i> Speaking of Quinn, I really should check up on her and see how she's doing. <i>(Gets up to go to Quinn's room, while Jake resumes reading the paper)</i></p>


     <p>Helen went up the stairs to Quinn's room with a slight air of apprehension. When Jake "dropped the ball" about the baby, Daria had an unreadable look on her face, (surprise, surprise) and then, after a pause, asked questions as to what happened and why had Helen and Jake kept such a secret from she and her sister for so long. Quinn, on the other hand, simply looked stunned and said nothing, and then after Daria's questions, excused herself, and went to her room. Then, to Helen and Jake's surprise, Daria offered to talk to Quinn. Helen, however, decided that Quinn needed time to fully digest the news, and that Helen herself would talk to Quinn later. Certainly Jake would be of no help, especially after his incredibly stupid outburst. The <i>last</i> thing Helen needed was <i>his</i> imput.</p>

     <p>Helen heard Quinn talking on the phone, probably to a boy or one of her Fashion Club friends. She hesitated for a moment, wondering if she should knock and interrupt Quinn's conversation, then decided to wait to talk to Quinn later, quietly leaving Quinn's door.</p>



<p><i>(Scene goes back to the Appleton Estate)</i></p>



     <p>After Darren had eaten breakfast, he and Curtis went to the media room and sat down to watch the press conference. It was quite a large space, with a veritable gigantic fifty-inch television screen and CD/VCR/audio center, with hundreds of VHS tapes. It was in fact, a mini-television studio, with real oak paneling along the walls. Millie came in to join them, and tried to gently dissuade Darren from watching it. Darren had refused, insisting that he had to see why such a well-maintained jet could simply crash so easily, and that the sooner he could deal with what happened to his parents head-on, the sooner he could get on with his life. Darren leaned forward and watched the TV intensely.</p>


<p><i>(On the TV screen:)</i></p>


<p>SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD: According to reports from the control tower, the pilots said that they were losing fuel, and that the jet was <i>rapidly</i> losing altitude. Early speculation is that the fuel line just built up too much pressure and began to leak fuel profusely. It was amazing that the jet didn't explode in the <i>air</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Mutters to himself:)</i> No, just the on the <i>ground</i>.</p>

<p>NTSB SPOKESWOMAN: We're still trying to recover the jet's Black Box, and when we do, we'll have more infomation--</p>


     <p>Darren suddenly clicked off the TV with the remote, surprising Curtis and Millie.</p>


<p>DARREN: I've seen <i>enough</i>. <i>(Sighs:)</i> I'm going to go to the workout room and then take a shower. <i>(Gets up and prepares to go)</i></p>

<p>CURTIS: <i>(Along with Millie, gets up, too:)</i> Hey, uh--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(In a weary tone:)</i> It's okay, Curtis. I don't need anything --<i>really</i>. <i>(Looks off in space, narrows eyes:)</i> I--I've got to get ready later for the funeral arrangements after I take the shower. <i>(Pauses, looks at Curtis:)</i> I'll see you later, okay? Thanks for being here, but right now, I need to be alone. <i>(Leaves quickly)</i></p>


     <p>Millie and Curtis watched Darren leave.</p>


<p>CURTIS: <i>(Hand on forehead:)</i> Oh, Lord, Millie. What are we gonna <i>do</i>?</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Turns Curtis to her, looks at him pointedly in the eye:)</i> The only thing we <i>can</i> do, Curtis--<i>be</i> there for him.</p>

<p>CURTIS: <i>(Looking like he wants to cry, slowly shaking his head:)</i> After Stephanie, and now his parents--it's <i>not</i> fair, damn it!</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Pats Curtis on the back, gently, looking like she too, wants to cry:)</i> <i>Life's</i> not fair, Curtis. <i>(Thought v.o.: And it's going to get worse before it gets better, with that damn <b>secret</b> that Darren will find out about soon.)</i></p>

     
     <p>The funeral the following Monday was private, with police and security keeping the media at bay. From a local large church, the large funeral procession ended up on the southeastern part of the 450-acre estate grounds, a beautiful wooded area. Darren remembered that his parents loved this part of the estate, and Millie remembered that her brother and sister-in-law wanted to be buried here. Darren had been remarkably quiet throughout the funeral, more than likely because he had cried himself out, Millie supposed. Neither she nor Curtis left Darren's side. Millie could only dread what was coming next, having known from Lucille the <i>secret</i>. William, meanwhile seemed somewhat <i>impatient</i>. He had gently prodded the pallbearers to go a little faster with the coffins, even offering to leave the bereaved immediate family to help put them in the hearse. Millie noticed this, and she quickly looked over at Darren, who had a brief look of <i>rage</i> on his face while watching William. The looked vanished just as quickly as it came when they had gotten into the limos. After both coffins had been lowered onto the ground, everyone went into the Appleton mansion.</p>
     
     <p>After everyone from the politicians to the business acquaintances of Arthur and Lucille Appleton gave their condolences and left, Darren, Millie, and William went into the huge, book-filled family study, leaving Curtis outside in the hallway. The family lawyer, <i>Leonard Potter</i>, was waiting for them, along with several Appleton business associates. Leonard had the look of one of those scholarly-professor types. He had bushy brown-gray hair, glasses that sat on the edge of his nose, with a stern, business-like, no-nonsensical poise about him. He wore a gray tweed suit, with black elbow pads. Darren respected Leonard for his straight-forward bluntness and honesty concerning the family's legal dealings, and because of the fact that William did <i>not</i> like him. William thought that Leonard was too <i>tepid</i> in legal matters, and had even tried to have Arthur Sr. <i>remove</i> him, which of course, Arthur Sr. did not. Except for Leonard, everyone sat down at a large rectangular mahogany table in the middle of the study. Leonard stood at the head of the table,and after a few seconds of looking at some of his notes, began to speak.</p>


<p>LEONARD: We are here to read the will concerning the business holdings of the Appleton Conglomerate, and <i>only</i> the business holdings. The non-business holdings will be read with other parties, family and otherwise, tomorrow. Only those who have been requested here by the deceased--<i>(pauses, looks at Darren for a moment as if to say, "I'm sorry", Darren nods for him to go on:)</i> holders, Arthur and Lucille Appleton, as per instructions from the will, may attend. <i>(Leonard shifts some papers around, and sighs for a second, then speaks:)</i> <i>Ninety</i> percent of the conglomerate's holdings, including all of Appleton Industries, and the Chairmanship, upon approval of the Board of Directors, shall be given to <i>Darren Appleton</i>--</p>


     <p>At this point, it was safe to say that chaos erupted, with several associates screaming at the same time, and William leaping out his chair, enraged, while Darren looked stunned, completely at a loss for words.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Obviously stunned and enraged:)</i> What-in-the-hell-is-<I>this</I>?! Tell me this is a <i>freaking</i> nightmare! There's no way that <i>he (points at Darren:)</i> is ready to run a <i>billion-dollar plus</i> conglomerate! He's <i>not</i> even a--<i>(checks himself, looks around  foolishly, red-faced:)</i>--er, ah, <i>experienced</i>.</p>

<p>LEONARD: <i>(Completely calm, stern-faced:)</i> William, if you're through making an <i>ass</i> out of yourself, please sit <i>down. (To which William, after a momentary glare at Darren, does)</i> Thank you. Now, as I was going to continue to say, this is <i>not</i> retroactive, so Darren does not have to be Chairman anytime soon. In fact, he has the option of choosing someone <i>else</i> to run the company in his place until he chooses to take the helm himself. The time he chooses is at his own discretion, or he could simply give up the post to someone else <i>permanently</i>.</p>

<p>MILLIE: In essence, Darren can wait until he's <i>good and ready</i> to take over the Chairmanship, <i>no</i> matter the length of time.</p>

<p>LEONARD: Precisely, Millie. The ball's in Darren's court, so to speak. <i>(Looks at Darren, who's still speechless)</i></p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Eyes wide open, hands thrown in air, looks up, talks in a tone of stunned disbelief:)</i> This is <I>un-be-lieve-able</I>. I cannot <i>fathom</i> what was going through Arthur and Lucille's minds when they did this. Our entire conglomerate--at the <i>mercy</i> of Darren's <i>whims</i>? The whole world has gone <i>insane. (Buries head in hands while resting elbows on table, consoled by some associates beside him, while Millie, who is sitting across from him, frowns)</i></p>


      <p>Darren slowly rose up out of his seat and looked at everyone sitting at the table, walking in a deliberately slow motion, with his hands behind his back. Everyone watched him without a word, mesmerized. He walked around the table in silence, gathering his thoughts, then he paused--and spoke.</p>


<p>DARREN: I don't know exactly what to say, so please bear with me for a moment. <i>(Pauses:)</i> I guess I have to make a decision as to what direction this company will take. There's <i>no</i> way I can take over now, that's for sure. I'm just not up to it, with what's just happened and all, and my going to Eastward College, not wanting to end <i>that</i> prematurely. So, I'm going to choose someone with the experience and wherewithal to continue what my parents started, someone who can push the company's goals in a positive direction, one who's been Chairman before: <i>(dramatic pause, sighs:) Uncle Will</i>.</p>


     <p>At this point, it was safe to say that chaos erupted, with several associates screaming at the same time, and William leaping out of his chair, stunned and delighted, while Darren looked expressionless. Millie looked at Darren with stunned disbelief, her mouth agape. Darren glanced and nodded at Millie as if to say, "I can explain", then he spoke again.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks around:)</i> Undoubtedly, some of you are <i>somewhat</i> stunned as to why I chose my Uncle Will on a <i>temporary</i> basis. <i>(Looks impassively at William, who stops congratulating some of the same colleagues who were consoling him only seconds earlier, and stares uneasily at Darren,)</i> Actually, the reason I chose him is quite simple: he is the most qualified person in this company, and--personal feelings aside, he is capable of doing the job, having done it before with a glowing report.  <i>(William beams, his chest is puffed out)</i> My parents always said that <i>personal</i> feelings should never get in the way of doing business because it can disrupt one's ability to condusive reasoning in conducting business with others. <i>(Sighs:)</i> I'm sure my uncle will put the best interests of the company first.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(After getting up, rushes to shake Darren's hand, delighted:)</i> Well said, my boy! Well said! I couldn't have put it better <i>myself</i>! You've made a wise choice! <i>(Darren rolls his eyes:)</i> Don't you worry, Darren--the whole conglomerate is in <i>safe</i> hands!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Shakes hands with fake smile, thought v.o.: It <b>better</b> be, or you'll be hitting the highway, Uncle.)</i></p>


     <p>The rest of the meeting focused on the remaining ten percent of the conglomerate, which consisted of minor holdings. Afterwards, everyone adjourned, save for Darren, Millie, Leonard, and Curtis, who was allowed to come into the study.</p>


<p>LEONARD: Darren, there's something <i>else</i> your parents wanted to give to you--</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Intercedes:)</i> Leonard, can't this wait until <i>later</i>? I wanted to talk to you over the phone yesterday about it, but you were out--</p>

<p>LEONARD: <i>(Calmly:)</i> No, Millie, you <i>know</i> it can't. Arthur and Lucille gave me <i>specific</i> instructions to do this after the reading of the company will. <i>(Begins to pull out a videotape from his briefcase)</i></p>
     
<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks between Millie and Leonard:)</i> Do what? What's going on? What's on that tape, Leonard?</p>

<p>LEONARD: <i>(Gives the tape to Darren:)</i> Just see for yourself, Darren. I can't tell you.  I'll see you tomorrow. <i>(Looks at Millie, then leaves)</i></p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Sighs, gently grabs Curtis:)</i> H-he's right, Darren, just see for yourself. Come on, Curtis, we should leave Darren alone to view the tape. Let's get something to eat in the kitchen. <i>(Curtis looks as if he's about to say something, but the quick glare and head shake from Millie stops him, and, after glancing at Darren once more, leaves.)</i></p>


     <p>Darren watched them leave and stared at the tape. It said, <I>"Truth"</I>. For some reason, he felt <i>queasy</i>, not exactly knowing why. Reluctantly, he went into the media room, and shut the doors. He put the tape into the VCR and turned it and the TV on, and sat down slowly, watching with a sense of uneasiness. The screen went from snowy to black, then his parents sitting in the study faded into view. They had a <i>pained</i> but <i>determined</i> look on their faces, as if what they had to say was going to do something <i>bad</i>, but <i>had</i> to be said anyway. Arthur Appleton spoke.</p>


<p>ARTHUR: <i>(Completely serious tone:)</i> Darren, this is a day that your mother and I have long <i>dreaded</i>--your watching this tape can only mean one thing--that your mother and I are <i>dead</i>. We can only hope that everything good we've taught you in your life will never be forgotten, and that your mother and I loved you very much. <i>(He looks pained--holds his wife's hand, then goes on:)</i> Please never forget that especially, son. We always tried to be there for you, throughout the good and the bad, the thick and the thin, always there supporting you. But--there's something your mother and I kept from you, something we planned to tell you when you turned twenty-two. <i>(Pause, looks at Lucille, then the camera:)</i> Darren, you were--<i>adopted</i>.</p>


     <p>Darren stared at the screen in utter and total <I>disbelief</I>.</p>
