<p>Chapter 2- Searching For Answers</p>


<p><i>(The same moment, at the Morgendorffer residence:)</i></p>


     <p>Quinn went to Daria's room reluctantly. In the past few days, 
Quinn had deliberately avoided talking about  her parent's stunning 
<i>revelation</i> about the stillborn baby to anyone, save for her conversation
 with Sandi. She downplayed how she <i>really</i> felt when Helen finally cornered
 her, waving it off and saying that it really wasn't that important, and that 
<i>"Life goes on."</i> Of course, Quinn wasn't so sure <i>she</i> could go on without a few
 questions--or answers--and, despite their differences, she could only talk about
 something this personal with only one person--<i>Daria</i>. Quinn sighed, then tentatively knocked on
 Daria's door.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(In a quiet tone:)</i> Daria, can I talk to you? It's about--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Lies on her bed, looks at the ceiling:)</i> --The <i>baby</i>, right?</p>


     <p>Shocked, Quinn quickly came into Daria's padded room, shutting the door behind her.</p>


<p>QUINN: Huh? <i>How'd</i> you know?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sighs, gets off her bed, looks at Quinn:)</i> Quinn, it was pretty <i>obvious</i> that you were upset over what our parents said about the baby. I saw how you've been behaving in the last few days. Even for <i>you</i>, I could see that you weren't yourself. <i>(Thought v.o.: And there's not that much "self" there to begin with.)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Hesitates:)</i> Yeah, I guess you could. Mom said you'd even <i>offered</i> to talk to me.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Slightly caught off-guard by Quinn's statement:)</i> Uh, well, it was only a <i>rare</i> moment of weakness. Don't <i>read</i> anything into it. <i>(Crosses arms, changes subject quickly:)</i> So, what did you want to talk about concerning the baby?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Gathers her thoughts:)</i> Daria, what do you think would've happened if our brother had <i>lived</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Thought v.o.: That he's one lucky son-of-a-gun that didn't have to live with the hell that is my immediate family?) (Speaks seriously:)</i> Quinn, to be honest with you, I think our big brother would've made our relationship --<i>(sighs:) better</i>.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Shocked, mouth and eyes wide open:)</i> What? <i>Better</i>? How'd you figure <i>that</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: Think--<i>(pauses for an instant--this is Quinn she's talking to--the word <B>"think"</B> and the name <B>"Quinn"</B> are used rarely together, save for fashions and boys:)</i> about it, Quinn. Our brother could've maybe <i>bridged</i> the galaxy-wide gap between us because I don't think he'd <i>let</i> us fight. He would've played <i>peacemaker</i> and <i>peacekeeper</i> between us, being the older brother we'd look <i>up</i> to. I <i>really</i> believe that. Look at mom and dad. I think mom was so <i>traumatized</i> by our brother's death, she'd decided to <i>bury</i> herself in her work, even after having us, wanting to <I>forget</I> about that <I>terrible</I> moment--and in a way I couldn't <i>blame</i> her if she did. Dad, on the other hand, went into a <i>shell</i>, becoming a ghost of the man he used to be, and not just because of Grampa "Mad Dog" Morgendorffer. I think that because dad fainted at the very point our mom needed him most, he's <i>never</i> really forgiven himself. Both of our parents haven't been there for us as really strong role models, though I suppose they've had their moments. As a result, our sisterly relationship <i>suffered</i> because our parents suffered.  At least that's what <i>I</i> think. What do <i>you</i> think?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(After taking in all Daria has said, decides to take up only one point of Daria's--Quinn has a headache trying to keep up after all--see "Through A Lens Darkly":)</i> Of our brother bringing us <i>closer</i> together? <i>(Smirks, rolls her eyes:)</i> Yeah--<i>right</i>. C'mon, Daria. If anything, I think that if our brother would've lived, you and I'd be driven <i>further</i> apart.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Raised eyebrow:)</i> And just how do you <i>figure</i> that?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>("Well, duh!" tone:)</i> He would've taken <i>my</i> side when we'd argue, making you resent me <i>and</i> him. I mean, why would <I>he</I> want to take the side of a <i>brain</i>?  <i>(Points to self, smug:)</i> With <i>my</i> looks and charm, Big Bro would've obviously agreed with <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Frowning, usual deadpan voice:)</i> In other words, he'd fallen for the <i>"Quinn Morgendorffer Charm-My-Brother-With-Fluttering-Eyebrows-And-Singy-Songy-Voice-That-Other-Boys-Fall-For-All-The-Time-So-Why-Not-My-Brother-Strategy"? Dream on</i>. I don't think <i>he'd</i> be fooled by your shallowness and charm like the <i>equally</i> shallow and charm<i>less</i> boys that you go out with and then <i>dump</i> about as <i>rapidly</i> as the sun <i>rises</i> and <i>sets</i>. Remember, this would've been our <i>brother</i>. He'd know you <i>better</i> than <i>those</i> guys. <i>(Smirks)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Incensed:)</i> You're just <i>jealous</i>, Daria! Our brother would see my <i>superiority</i>--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks even more:)</i>--In <i>empty-headed shallowness</i>? You have me there, <i>"cuz". (Quinn glares at her, then turns around and stomps out of Daria's room, slamming the bedroom door so hard, it opens back, staying slightly ajar.)</i></p>


     <p>Daria walked to the door and overheard Quinn go downstairs and tell their parents she was going to Sandi's house for a fashion party, and then the front door slammed.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(To herself, low voice:)</i> Hmm--now <i>that</i> conversation went rapidly <i>downhill</i>. At least she's <i>back</i> to her normal, annoyingly self-absorbed shallow self. <i>(Leaves her room to go downstairs, sees Helen and Jake in the living room:)</i> Mission <i>accomplished</i>, Mom and Dad--<i>fifty bucks</i>, please. <i>(Holds hand out)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Frowns, hands on her hips while Jake gives Daria the money:) Honestly</i>, Daria! Making money off of your sister's <i>pain</i>! The things we <i>do</i> to get things done around here--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> She's a <i>pain</i>, all right--besides, I <i>did</i> offer to talk to her for <i>free</i>, remember? You wanted to talk to her <i>your</i> way, and look <i>where</i> it got you. I'm going to the library. <i>(Begins to walk out, then stops and sighs, turns back to look at her parents:)</i> Er, before I go, do you guys, um--<i>need</i> anything?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Surprised, after looking at Jake and vice versa:)</i> Uh, no, sweetie, we don't, but--thanks for asking us.</p>


     <p>Daria looked somewhat relieved, then walked out the front door.</p>


<p>JAKE: <i>(Perplexed:)</i> Helen, what was <i>that</i> all about?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Lost in thought:)</i> I don't know, Jake, it seemed as if she--<i>(it starts to dawn on Helen, for she begins to slowly smile)</i></p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Now really curious:)</i> WHAT, WHAT, WHAT? <i>(Helen cuts her eyes at him, annoyed)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Sighs:)</i> Come <i>on</i>, Jakey, and I'll explain it over some tea--<i>(both go into the kitchen)</i></p>



<p><i>(Back to the Appleton mansion-- the media room, the same time)</i></p>



     <p>Darren could not believe what he was hearing. Adopted? <i>ADOPTED</i>? He had gone through the tape once already, and out of disbelief, decided to play it <i>again</i> to make sure that his sanity hadn't gone by the way of the <i>dinosaurs</i>. He had just listened to his father say that word again for the first time, and then heard his mother speak again.</p>


<p>LUCILLE: --That's right, Darren, <i>adopted</i>. We--<i>(looks about to cry, is held by her husband:)</i> couldn't have any children of our own, so we worked through a--<i>(begins crying, her husband continues)</i></p>

<p>ARTHUR: <i>(Grimly:)</i> --An <i>adoption agency</i>, Darren--arranged for us to get a baby--<i>you. (Stops for an instant, composes himself:)</i> When we first saw you, we fell <i>instantly</i> in love with you. You were--<i>(Lucille, having stopped crying, cuts her husband off)</i></p>

<p>LUCILLE: --You were so <i>beautiful</i>, son, we couldn't believe it when we were told that your birth mother <i>didn't</i> want you. The agency said that her family <i>abandoned</i> her when they found out she was pregnant, and that your birth mother thought about getting an <i>abortion</i>, but couldn't do it. Your birth father <i>vanished</i>, according to the what the agency told us, without any clue. The poor dear felt so scared and alone, she gave up her baby, you, to the agency, with the stipulation that she <i>not</i> give her name. We--we paid the agency a fee of <i>$50,000</i> for getting you, so we jumped to the <i>top</i> of the waiting list.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Eyes narrowed, thought v.o., cynical: Whoever said money dosen't buy happiness is a dirty liar.)</i></p>

<p>ARTHUR: <i>(Pauses for his next statement:)</i> We had previously invented a <i>ruse</i>, Darren, a story to cover the fact that we couldn't have children. I announced that your mother and I were going to take off for a <i>year</i>, to see the world. We'd figured during the hiatus, we'd say your mother had <I>"finally"</I> gotten pregnant, and that would cover us.  To our surprise, the round-the-world ruse was <i>easily</i> believed, for no one questioned it. We left your uncle <i>William</i> in charge of the conglomerate during this time. We didn't want to say that you were adopted because of--certain--<i>perceptions</i>--people would think that someone who they thought wasn't a <i>"true"</i> Appleton shouldn't become the head of the conglomerate to haunt you in your <i>youth</i>, son, not until your mother and I thought you were mature enough to handle the <i>scrutiny</i> that we knew was sure to come. That's why we wanted to wait until you were twenty-two to tell you. At least you would have your life ahead of you, with no distractions to disrupt your college education, and that you'd have a <i>normal</i> childhood. We'd even go to great lengths to keep the media <i>away</i> from you, as you yourself know. <i>(Looks into the camera intently:)</i> Darren, as far as your mother and I are concerned, you <i>are</i> an Appleton, in <i>every</i> context. That's also why we gave almost all of the conglomerate to you--it's your <i>birthright</i>. We also put in the clause that you could take over <i>anytime</i> you wanted. You could give yourself time to <i>recover</i> from our deaths, to take time off someplace, to just get your life together.</p>

<p>LUCILLE: Darren, we can only <i>guess</i> what's going through your mind now. <i>(She begins to cry again:)</i> Just please don't <i>hate</i> us. We only wanted what was <i>best</i> for you. <i>(Buries her head in her husband's shoulder, crying softly. Arthur speaks again)</i></p>

<p>ARTHUR: <i>Son</i>--I don't know if you'd want us to call you <i>that</i> anymore, though I hope you <i>do</i>--we'd figured that maybe you'd want to try to find out who your birth mother or father is in the <i>future</i>. The agency--the <i>Barnes Adoption Agency</i> in Los Angeles--wouldn't tell us, naturally, but we found out <i>who</i> gave them you. It was a <i>Doctor Hugo Turley</i> in a town called <i>Dumas</i>, in California. We <i>tried</i> to talk to him about five years ago, but he insisted that we could not find out who the birth mother was out of respect for her <i>privacy</i>. Maybe you'll have better luck than us if you try to find out. May God bless you--<i>son. (The screen fades to black, then goes snowy)</i></p>


     <p>Darren stared at the snowy screen a minute more in silence, then used the remote control to switch off the TV. He slowly rose out of his chair and simply went out of the media room quietly.</p>
 <br>
     <p>In the kitchen, Millie had just broken the news to Curtis. Both were sitting at the table talking over some snacks.</p>


<p>CURTIS: <i>(Stunned:)</i> I can't <i>believe</i> what I'm hearing! Darren's <i>adopted</i>? This has got to be some kinda <i>prime-time soap opera</i>! On <i>top</i> of everything else--this is a freaking <i>nightmare! (Slowly shakes his head)</i></p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(In a quiet tone:)</i> It's <i>no</i> nightmare, Curtis, I can assure you. Darren <i>was</i> adopted.</p> 

<p>CURTIS: God, Millie--how <i>long</i> did you know about this?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Walks into the kitchen, interrupting before Millie has a chance to respond:)</i> Yes, <i>"Aunt"</i> Millie, how long <i>did</i> you know about this?</p>


     <p>Startled, Millie and Curtis looked at Darren. He had something of an unreadable look on his face while watching her intensely. Both Millie and Curtis got up, with Millie walking tentatively over to Darren.</p>


<p>MILLIE: <i>(In a quiet tone after a moment:)</i> A little over a <i>year</i>, Darren. Your--<i>(She hesitates, not entirely sure "mother" is an appropiate word to use in this situation, does so gingerly:) mother</i> told me the whole story at that island resort we went to in the Florida Keys last year for the annual stockholder's meeting. I could tell <i>something</i> was bothering her at the time, and after some gentle coaxing, she told me while crying. My reaction was similiar to Curtis when I first heard it. I wanted her and your father to tell you right then and there, but she <i>begged</i> me not to. She said that she had to tell <i>somebody</i>, that she had to get rid of her <i>guilt</i>, to clear her <i>conscience</i>. Darren, I'm so sorry, I can only hope that you can <i>forgive</i> me someday. <i>(Begins to cry, puts face in hands)</i></p>


     <p>Darren stared at her for a second, then his face softened considerably. He walked up to his aunt and gently hugged her, letting her cry on his shoulder. Curtis watched both of them, smiling, privately relieved that his friend was taking the stunning news in such a way.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(While still hugging her:)</i> It's--it's <i>okay</i>, Aunt Millie. I forgive you <i>now</i>. I can only imagine what <i>you</i> went through this past year.</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Looks up into Darren's eyes, sniffing:)</i> Darren, there were times I wanted to <i>scream</i> the truth to you, but I waited out of respect to your parent's wishes. I just--just thought it wasn't my place to say anything. <i>(Starts to cry again, becomes agitated:)</i> Dear God, Darren, please don't <i>hate</i> your parents! They were only thinking of <i>you</i>!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Cuts her off gently:)</i> Aunt Millie, I--I <i>don't</i> hate my parents, I could <i>never</i> really hate them. They adopted me, and raised me as their own son, being there for me <i>all</i> of the time, loving me. <i>(Pauses:) How</i> could I hate them after <i>that</i>? <i>(Stares in space, frowns for a moment, perplexed:)</i> I only wished they had told me <i>earlier</i>.</p>

<p>MILLIE: I think they were <i>afraid</i> of what you <i>might</i> do, Darren. That you could have thought of yourself as not really being a <i>true</i> Appleton, of not having the <i>confidence</i> of living with such a discovery.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Stares at Millie and Curtis for a moment before answering:)</i> I heard something like that on the tape. Actually, I think my parents had something of a <i>point</i>, though. Maybe I <i>would</i> have done something if I had known <i>earlier, (narrows eyes, determined look on his face:)</i> something that I plan to do <i>after</i> the non-business reading portion of the will tomorrow.</p>

<p>CURTIS: <i>(After he and Millie look at each other:)</i> What's that, Darren?</p>

<p>DARREN: Why, <i>search</i> for my birth parents, of course.</p>

<p>LUCILLE: <i>(Shocked:)</i> B-but <i>why</i>, Darren? You--you <i>don't</i> want to be an Appleton?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Raised eyebrow in surprise, reassuring her:)</i> Aunt Millie, as far as I'm concerned, I <i>am</i> an Appleton. Its just that I've become--<i>curious</i> about who my birth parents were. As I watched the tape twice over, I couldn't help but to <i>wonder</i> about that. <i>Why</i> did my birth father leave my birth mother? Is my birth mother <i>still</i> alive, or my birth father, for that matter? Does she or he ever <i>wonder</i> about me? My parents told me that I might have wanted to try and find my birth mother or father, and I do. <i>(Pauses:)</i> You know, next to my parents being there for me when I needed them throughout the years--as well as <i>you</i>, Auntie, they did something that was almost just as special--they <i>told</i> me I was adopted. My parents didn't have to say <i>anything</i> to me or to you, to <i>anybody</i>. I would've <i>never</i> known. Maybe I need to find this out as some sort of <i>closure</i> for me, so I can get on once and for all with my life, to get past Stephanie's death, my parent's death, and finally, my adoption, to search for my <i>roots</i>. The fall semester won't start at Eastward for three months, so why not take some time to <i>look</i> for them? I don't know if I'll find anything, but hanging around the mansion for the summer and hiding out from the media will drive me <i>stir crazy</i>, and if I'm going to take a trip, it might as well be for something worthwhile.</p>


     <p>Millie was about to say something when William, followed by Elenor, walked into the kitchen. William looked <i>red-faced</i>, as if he was caught in the act of doing something <i>naughty</i>. He glared at Elenor, who <i>promptly</i> returned it.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Looking as confused as Millie and Curtis:) Uncle Will</i>? <i>Elenor</i>? What's going on?</p>

<p>ELENOR: <i>(Still-cold glare at William, accusing look:)</i> Should <i>I</i> tell them, Master William, or should <i>you</i>?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Rolls his eyes at Elenor:)</i> I was going to say <i>something</i>, Elenor. Calm down. Darren, Millie, Curtis, I was about to find Darren once again and thank him personally for choosing me as Appleton Industries' Chairman when I--er, <i>overheard</i> you all talking--</p>

<p>ELENOR: <i>(Angry, looks at Darren then back at William:)</i> --More like he was <i>eavesdropping</i>, Master Darren.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Sputters, indignant:)</i> I did <i>nothing</i> of the sort! I just came upon what you all were doing and wanted to wait until you were <i>finished</i>, that's all! <i>(Exaggerates his arm movements in a wild, twisting motion:)</i> Should I have just walked in, unannounced? Of <i>course</i> not!</p>

<p>ELENOR: <i>(Copies William's arm movements:)</i> Could you have just walked <i>away</i>, unannounced, <i>until</i> they were finished, Master William? Of <i>course</i> you could have! <i>(William really stares daggers at Elenor now, and vice versa.)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Expressionless stare at William, speaks in a monotone voice:)</i> Uncle Will, <i>what</i> did you hear?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Searches for words:)</i> That you were--<i>adopted</i> by your parents? <i>(To this, Elenor looks shocked.)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Sighs:)</i> Yes, both of you, it's true--I <i>am</i> adopted.</p>

<p>ELENOR: <i>(Stunned:)</i> M-Master Darren? A-adopted? H-how--?</p>


     <p>Darren quietly motioned to Millie, and she led Elenor out of the kitchen gently, all the while explaining to Elenor the story of the adoption. Darren and Curtis stayed in the kitchen to talk to William.</p>


<p>DARREN: Yes, Uncle William, I'm adopted. It's a long story, and I--<i>(William puts his palm up, facing Darren) beg your pardon</i>? <i>(Darren and Curtis look at each other, then William, confused)</i></p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(In an almost eerily calm voice:)</i> I <i>already</i> know about the adoption, Darren. Your--<i>father</i> told me about it. <i>Everything. (Darren and Curtis now looked shocked)</i> Obviously, you're surprised, and I guess I can understand <i>why</i>. Your father told me at the annual stockholder's meeting last year <i>also</i>. I see that he wanted to get the guilt of not telling you about the adoption off of <i>his</i> conscience, too. <i>(Looks in the direction where Millie and Elenor walked out:)</i> I must say I didn't know that Millie knew it, too. I followed your father's wishes of not saying anything to you.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Comes out of his stupor along with Curtis:)</i> Uncle Will, <i>you</i> kept this secret for a <i>year</i>, too? <i>(Pauses, looks at his uncle a little uneasily:)</i> To be <i>frank</i> with you, I'm, well--</p>

<p>WILLIAM:--<i>Surprised</i> that I <i>didn't</i> say anything after <i>all</i> this time? It's quite all right, Darren. I can see <i>why</i> you'd think I'd say something to someone, quite the <i>opposite</i> of what your Aunt Millie did. You'd think you and I can't <i>stand</i> one another, and what could be a more perfect way of <i>hurting</i> you than telling someone <i>outside</i> of the family, and causing a media uproar? <i>(Shakes his head slowly, sighs:)</i> Darren, I'd <i>never</i> do that, not even to <i>you</i>. As far as I'm concerned, you <i>are</i> an Appleton, <i>lock, stock, and barrel</i>. If I had any <i>doubts</i> about your loyalty to our family, you proved that by making me Chairman of the conglomerate. <i>(Now Curtis looks shockingly at Darren, who gives him a look similiar to the one he gave Millie that says, "I'll explain later.")</i> I wanted to thank you for that again, Darren, and offer to <i>help</i> you find your birth parent or parents.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Now it's his turn to be shocked:)</i> Y-you're <i>serious</i>, Uncle Will? How?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: By hiring a <i>private detective</i>. He can ask some questions, dig up some facts, that sort of thing.</p>

<p>DARREN: I was planning to do the digging up <i>myself</i>, Uncle, right after tomorrow's non-business reading of the will. <i>(Curtis raises an eyebrow at this)</i></p> 

<p>WILLIAM: Darren, at least let me get a private dectective for you. Although I know you can <i>(makes a finger quote:) "take care"</i> of yourself, the detective can watch out for your <i>back</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Chuckles in a joking manner:)</i> What <i>for</i>, Uncle Will? Do you think someone's going to <i>"attack"</i> me, to keep me from trying to find my birth parents?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: No, of course not, Darren--its just that, well, you're quite <i>wealthy</i>. In addition to helping you find your birth parents, the detective can serve as a <i>bodyguard</i>, to keep someone from, well, possibly trying to <i>kidnap</i> you or something, your being able to <i>"take care"</i> of yourself notwithstanding. <i>Anything</i> could happen. What about the <i>media</i>? If <i>they</i> find out what you're about to do--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Throws hands up, giving in to his uncle's wishes:)</i> Okay, Uncle Will, okay. I'll do it, if nothing else, just to keep you from going <i>on</i> about this. You have anyone in mind?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: Yes, as a matter of fact, I <i>do</i>. Let me get out my cell phone and call him. <i>(He does so, and in the meantime, Curtis pulls Darren aside)</i></p>

<p>CURTIS: <i>(Lowers voice, talks to Darren out of the corner of his mouth while watching William:)</i> Have you gone off the <i>deep</i> end, bud? I'm telling you, he's <i>up</i> to something--probably wants to keep <i>tabs</i> on you for his <i>own</i> reasons. Okay, so the man's <i>thanking</i> you for giving him the reign over the company and everything--speaking of which, I want ask you about <i>that</i>, later--how can you <i>trust</i> him?</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Sighs, his voice lowered also:)</i> Ease up, Curtis. I haven't gone <i>totally</i> over the edge yet, <i>(adds after a pause:)</i> though I think I feel I have <i>every</i> right to be <i>tempted</i> to do so after what's happened to me these past few days. Look, <i>whoever</i> uncle Will gets, I'm not letting them out of my <i>sight</i>. As much as I hate to admit it, though, uncle Will <i>does</i> know people who know people. Dad told me once if the company needed to get anything--and I do mean <i>anything</i> in a hurry--that uncle Will could get someone or something in an <i>instant</i>. I can <i>attest</i> to that. Once, I remember that mom liked a certain dress so much, she wanted to buy into the fashion company that made the dress. I know it sounds <i>frivolous</i>, but the next day, uncle Will had called <i>certain</i> people, and <i>viola</i>! Mom was a <i>major</i> stockholder in that company--later the <i>same</i> day, and eventually, that company <i>merged</i> with the clothing division. The man has <i>"connections"</i>.</p>

<p>CURTIS: <i>(Frowns:)</i> Yeah, and that's what <i>bothers</i> me--what <i>kind</i> of <i>"connections"</i>? Your uncle could know some <i>unscrupulous</i> people, Darren--people who can do some <i>bad</i> things in business--and <i>otherwise</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Sighs:)</i> Don't worry--I'll be <i>careful</i>.</p> 

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(While coming over to Curtis and Darren:)</i> It's done. The detective I found will be able to help you immediately--his name is <i>Gerald Woo</i>, and he has an excellent reputation in his field. I've hired him <i>before</i> in a case concerning our company. He'll be there waiting for you when you arrive in Los Angeles. <i>(Gives Darren a slip of paper)</i> Here's his number for you to call him later before you leave.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Extends out his hand:)</i> Thank you for your help, Uncle Will. I'll have to buy tickets to Los Angeles and--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Shakes Darren's hand, reassuring voice:)</i>--No, <i>thank you</i>, Darren--and I'll handle everything, including the car rental and jet arrangements--<i>private</i>, so as not to draw attention to yourself, as well as the hotel accomodations. You just worry about finding your parents. Consider this as--<i>payment</i> for your faith in my leadership as Chairman of Appleton Industries. I'd better start setting up those arrangements right now. I'll see you tomorrow. <i>(Punches some numbers in phone while leaving)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Okay, see you then. <i>(Goes with Curtis upstairs:)</i> I'd better get Elenor and Claude to help me pack, Curtis. I'm sure Aunt Millie will probably want to help, too.</p>

<p>CURTIS: Hey, do you need me to go <i>with</i> you? I was surprised that you <i>didn't</i> ask me to come along.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Pauses:)</i> Nah, it's okay. <i>(Smiles:)</I> Your being here when I needed a friend was <i>more</i> than enough. Besides, you're supposed to go visit your grandmother in Florida. When you get down there, leave a message here, and I'll call you after I call here. <i>(Smirks:)</i> And let's not forget about <i>Lena</i>, shall we? <i>(Grins:)</i> I'm sure she's wanting to see you again.</p>

<p>CURTIS: <i>(Starry-eyed, thinking, smiles:) Oh, yeah</i>--huh? Hey, man, cut it out! We're just--<i>friends</i>.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Still grinning:) Uh-huh</i>, now tell me <i>another</i> one--</p>


     <p>While Darren and Curtis went upstairs, William went out of the mansion to a waiting limousine out front in the mansion's long driveway, still talking on his cell phone. A chauffeur held the door open while William got in. In the back seat waiting for him was one of the business associates at the reading of the corporate will who had first consoled, and then congratulated William on getting the Chairmanship. He had a sneaky, almost <i>ratlike</i> appearance to him, with a long, protruded nose and slick, greasy, combed-back black hair. He had a mole on the end of his nose, and two big front teeth that stuck out of the top of his mouth. The smirk he had on his face only seemed to <i>exaggerate</i> his features. The limo began to move just as William was finishing up on the phone.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: --That's right, have corporate jet number three fueled and ready to go at my nephew's discretion, and get him the president's suite at the <i>Zenith Hotel</i> in Los Angeles. Make sure it's <i>hush-hush</i>, right? Keep it a secret--we don't want the media to find out what's going on. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Right. Take care of the other arrangements as well. <i>(Pauses:)</i> No, Darren will pay and work with Woo, <i>not</i> me. In fact, I don't want to know <i>anything</i> about what Darren is doing, for this is <i>none</i> of my business. Goodbye. <i>(Pushes off the "talk" button and pulls down the cell phone's antenna, smiles:)</i> Everything's <i>done</i>, Benny. <i>(Reaches into the limo's backseat small refrigerator, pulls out two glasses and a bottle of champagne)</i></p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Frowns, confused:) "Done"?</i> Uh, Boss, <i>what's</i> going on? I'd thought you'd <i>want</i> to keep tabs on Darren about finding his birth parents.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Pours champagne for himself and Benny, shakes his head slowly:) Benny, Benny, Benny</i>--you've got a lot to learn about my--<i>(sounding like a sneer:) "nephew"</i>--he's <i>no</i> fool, although he does have this rather <i>annoying</i> tendency of being <i>nice</i>--like his <i>"father"</i> and <i>"mother"</i>, a <i>weakness</i>, if you ask me. I'm sure he'll ask Woo if he's working for <i>me</i>. I want Darren to find his birth parents on his <i>own</i>. You see, the <i>more</i> time he takes up trying to find them, the more time he stays <i>away</i> from company business, the <i>more</i> time I can <i>consolidate</i> my power in the company. <i>(Narrows eyes, begins to get angry:)</i> The <i>last</i> thing I need is Darren coming to me angry about my <i>"meddling"</i> in his affairs, and then possibly taking the Chairmanship <i>away</i> from me, the Chairmanship that <i>should</i> have been mine when my <i>idiot</i> of a brother <i>and</i> sister-in-law died! I thought for <i>sure</i> that it was <i>mine</i>! Also, I don't have to worry about Darren looking over my <i>shoulder</i> every time I make a decision, sticking his face in <i>my</i> affairs!</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(While drinking the champagne:)</i> Geez, Boss--how'd we know that the will would give control of almost everything to your <i>bastard "nephew"</i>? <i>(Gets an "I've got an idea" look:)</i> Hey! Why not take <i>care</i> of Darren tomorrow like we did his <i>"parents"</i>? I mean, the jet can be--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Quickly becoming enraged:) --YOU IDIOT</i>! <i>(Looks at the driver, who doesn't notice them, for he is still driving, while Benny cringes, spilling some of his champagne:)</i>  You're <i>lucky</i> that this part of the limo is <i>soundproofed</i>! If he had <i>heard</i> us--<i>(begins to calm down:)</i> anyway, Darren's <i>"parents"</i> were just killed by the plane crash <i>we</i> caused! <i>(Stares Benny down eye-to-eye:)</i> Are you so <i>stupid</i> as to think that the authorities won't think that <i>something's</i> going on if the <i>same</i> thing happens to Darren? <i>(Frowns:)</i> Sometimes, I <i>wonder</i> about you, Benny. Besides, the National Transportation Safety Board is still investigating the crash, and it may be <i>months</i> before they issue their final report. We won't be in the <i>clear</i> until they say it was a <i>mechanical</i> malfunction, not sabotage. <i>(Sinister grin:)</i> As for <i>Darren</i>--well, <i>"accidents"</i> can happen--<i>later</i> on down the road.</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Wiping his brow:)</i> Y-yeah, of course, Boss, you're right.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Smug look, drinking more champagne:) Of course</i> I'm right. <i>(Chuckles:)</i> Darren will tell Millie what he's found, and then I'll get the information from her as the <i>"concerned"</i> uncle. Why get it from a detective I'd have to pay myself? Now, I'm in the mood to <i>celebrate. (Reaches over to limo's intercom)</i> Driver, take us to <i>Cherie's</i> downtown. <i>(The driver nods and resumes driving, while William looks at Benny, pulls out and lights up a Cuban cigar, lying back in his seat:)</i> They're some <i>ladies</i> waiting there for us. <i>(Benny grins with a lusty look)</i>  I plan to make some <i>changes</i> in the company, Benny, <i>big</i> changes, but we'll have to go slow to make these changes--no need to raise the <i>ire</i> of the Board of Directors.</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Becoming more comfortable, now chuckling, talking low:)</i> Okay, Boss--er, <i>how</i> did Darren <i>scream</i> again when you told him his <i>(snickers:) "parents"</i> had died?</p> 

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Puffs cigar, eyebrow raised, smirk on face:)</i> You really <i>liked</i> what I had said <i>before</i>, eh, Benny?</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(With an even bigger grin:)</i> Oh, <i>yeah</i>, Boss.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: Very well. <i>(Looks at driver, then screams:) NOOOOOOOHHHHGODNOOOOOOOOOOO</i>!!! <i>(Both men roar out laughing, while the driver, not being able to hear them, obliviously drives on.)</i></p>



<p><i>(The same time, at the Morgendorffer's:)</i></p>



     <p>The cell phone that laid on the coffee table rang in the living room. Daria, sitting on the couch while reading George Orwell's <i>Animal Farm</i>, reached over to answer it.</p>


<p>DARIA: Morgendorffer residence. My time is <i>your</i> time.</p>

<p>VOICE: Daria? I hoped it would be you.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Surprised look:) Aunt Amy</i>?</p>

<p>AMY: <i>(Chuckling sound:) Please</i>, Daria--remember, it's just <i>Amy</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sighs:)</i> Sorry, Amy. I think my <i>usual</i> sharp mind and wit have been <i>dulled</i> by all of the free time this season called summer has given to me.</p>

<p>AMY: In other words, you're <i>bored</i>.</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> That's about the <i>gist</i> of it. Have you called to add some <i>spice</i> to my boredom? You said you hoped it would be me. Well, here I <i>be</i>.</p>

<p>AMY: <i>(Now sounding coy:)</i> That <i>depends</i>. Are you alone?</p>

<p>DARIA: Yeah. Mom and dad are grinding their noses on the wheel at work, and Quinn's out raiding <i>Cashman's</i> with her fellow fashion fiends. What's up?</p>

<p>AMY: Your mother called me yesterday to tell me she and your dad had told you and Quinn about the baby. <i>(Pauses:)</i> I wanted to say that I'm sorry I had a <i>role</i> in keeping it from you. I just hope this doesn't hurt our relationship.</p>

<p>DARIA: Nah, it's okay. I figured you thought it wasn't your <i>place</i> to say anything. Mom said that both her and dad's families <i>knew</i> about her losing the baby. <i>(Raised eyebrow:)</i> Actually, when I think about it, it's kinda <i>strange</i> in a way.</p>

<p>AMY: What?</p>

<p>DARIA: That mom's family would agree on <i>anything</i>. I mean, I'd thought for sure someone would've brought something like this out long <i>ago</i>. For example, if my mom would've been arguing with aunt <i>Rita</i> over whatever childhood "injustice" aunt Rita did to her, then maybe aunt Rita would've blurted out the secret in <i>anger</i> or something.</p>

<p>AMY: <i>(Sighing sound:)</i> I guess I can see what you mean, Daria. It's a <i>miracle</i> that no one said anything after almost twenty years. But maybe just this one time, the whole family came together to help your mother <i>cope</i>, because losing a baby can be <i>devastating</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: Yeah, I figured that out pretty much. Maybe that's why I didn't get <i>really</i> angry with her and dad when they told Quinn and me. My parents must've gone through their own personal <i>hells</i> over this. <i>(Hesitates, looks around for some reason:)</i> I've actually found myself hanging <i>around</i> the ol' homestead when they're here, in case they needed anything. That is <i>definitely not</i> me.</p> 

<p>AMY: <i>(Chuckling sound again:) Uh-huh</i>. That's <i>not</i> you, all right--but I think they <i>appreciate</i> it, anyway. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Speaking of hanging around, where's your friend <i>Jane</i>? I thought she'd be hanging around with you, helping you through your "boredom".</p>

<p>DARIA: She's <i>bonding</i> with her mom on vacation somewhere in the Southwest. I'm <i>trapped</i> alone with my family for a month. I'm thinking by reading, the time will breeze by, and Jane and I can then <i>suffer</i> through our "boredom" together. It's only fair that <i>she</i> gets to go through this, too.</p>

<p>AMY: Or you can make that ol' "boredom" go away by getting a <i>job</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Rolls her eyes:) Please</i>. After my <i>previous</i> stint, a job is <i>not</i> high on my boredom-busting list.</p>

<p><i>(Note to reader: See "It Happened One Nut")</i></p>

<p>AMY: Oh, yes, I'd heard that you had a bad experience. Maybe you can consider doing something more in your field.</p> 

<p>DARIA: If you mean writing, I'm actually thinking about it, but for now, I'm gonna try and turn this boredom into relaxation by reading.</p>

<p>AMY: <i>(Laughing sound:)</i> I see. Anyway, I'm glad we're able to get <i>past</i> this, Daria. I'll call your mother later. Talk to you soon.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Gives her Mona Lisa smile:)</i> Same here, Amy. I'll tell my parents you called. <i>(Clicks off cell phone.)</i></p>


     <p>The doorbell rang, and Daria went to answer it. When she opened the door, <i>Tom</i> was standing there, looking depressed.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(A little surprised, then frowns:)</i> You missed Jane by a few days. Maybe if you'd start right <i>now</i> in that <i>"thing" (motions her head to Tom's blue Pinto parked in front of the Morgendorffers)</i> you call a <i>"car"</i>, you'll be able to catch her in a <i>week</i> or so. I hear the desert is <i>nice</i> this time of year.</p>

<p>TOM: <i>(A bit peeved:) Ha</i>, Daria. <i>Very</i> amusing. Look, my clunker of a car gave out on my way over to Jane's, and by the time I finally got to her house, everyone was gone, the same at the airport. I was hoping she would have called me by <i>now</i>. You see, my answering machine is <i>broken</i>, so the only way I know if she called is for me to be there. <i>(Looking hopeful:)</i> Has she called <i>you</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sighs:)</i> No, Tom, she hasn't called me yet. She's probably way out in the middle of nowhere, and hasn't had the time. I'm sure she'll call you, so don't worry. <i>(Thought v.o.: --But I did tell Jane that you'd be at the airport waiting for her, so what do I know?)</i></p>

<p>TOM: <i>(Looking regretful:)</i> I wish I didn't laugh at her painting now. I should've known she'd get angry. Art is her <i>life</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: Jane's life <i>imitates</i> her art. In your case, when you laughed at <i>one</i>, you laughed at the <i>other</i>. I told her that if you weren't able to come to her house, you'd be at the airport, and I assumed that when she didn't see you there, Jane could've gotten angry all over <i>again</i>.</p>

<p>TOM: <i>(Frowns, perplexed:)</i> What do you mean, <i>"again"</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: She tried to call you at your house and wasn't able to reach you. Jane was getting over what happened with your portrait and wanted to make up with you.</p> 

<p>TOM: <i>(Slaps hand on forehead:) Damn</i>, why haven't I gotten that answering machine fixed yet? Daria, if by <i>any</i> chance Jane calls you because she's not able to reach me, would you <i>please</i> get her to call me at <i>this</i> time? <i>(Gets out a pencil and paper and writes the time down, gives the paper to Daria:)</i> Thanks, I really appreciate it, I've got to get to work. <i>(Leaves)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Watches him go:)</i> Yeah, sure. <i>(Thought v.o.: I'm now officially the human go-between. Maybe I can add buttons and a cord to my body and go into business. Nah, I'd be giving busy signals all the damn time--too unreliable.) (Shuts the door)</i></p>


 
<p><i>(Scene changes to the Appleton estate, the next day)</i></p>



     <p>Almost immediately after the reading of the non-business will, Darren rode in his limo to the local airport, slipping out past the media horde, and promptly boarded a private company jet. As soon as the jet began to leave the runway, Darren thought about how the way his parents died--on <i>another</i> company jet. He shuddered, briefly wondering if the <i>same</i> thing could happen to him, and then just as quickly putting it out of his mind. Darren turned his thoughts to what awaited him in California. He had talked briefly to Woo the night before, and had given Woo the information from the <I>"Truth"</I> tape, and of when Darren's aunt and uncle first found out about Darren being adopted. Was Woo <i>trustworthy</i>, or would Woo go <i>behind</i> his back and talk to Darren's uncle? Darren would have to ask him directly as soon as he saw Woo in Los Angeles.</p>

     <p>The jet stopped over to refuel in Kansas City, then landed in Los Angeles later in the day. As Darren exited his jet and went into the terminal with a bag in hand, he saw a burly, bearded, cheerful-looking Chinese-American man smiling and waving curtly at him. Darren walked up to him and extended his hand to shake, to which the man responded in kind.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Smiles, looking at the man cautiously:)</i> I'm assuming that you're Mr. <i>Gerald Woo</i>?--</p>

<p>WOO: You are correct, Mr. Appleton, but just for the <i>record, (Reaches into his coat flap, and pulls out ID:)</i> here are my credentials.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(After looking over Woo's ID, while feeling a bit foolish over Woo's straightforwardness:)</i> Ah, yes, of course, and please call me Darren. <i>(Thought v.o.: He certainly is up front with his credentials. Uncle Will knows how to pick them.)</i></p>

<p>WOO: Very well, Darren, and please call me <i>Woo. (Darren raises his eyebrow slightly, curious)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smirks:)</i> You don't like <i>"Gerald"</i>?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Grins:)</i> Actually, I <i>hate</i> the name "Gerald". I'm thinking about changing it--much too <i>plain</i>. I favor a more <i>fancy-sounding</i> name, like <i>"Chauncey"</i> or something. <i>(Walks with Darren, who glances at Woo in a strange way for a moment, to a waiting rental car outside:)</i> Do you want me to take your bag?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Distracted:)</i> Hmm? Oh, no, I'm fine--I can handle it. My other bags are being taken to the hotel.</p>

<p>WOO: You are anxious to get started, I see. I have some news for you already.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Genuinely surprised:) Already</i>? You work <i>fast</i>.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Smiles:)</i> That is what you're <i>paying</i> me for, Darren. I will tell you what I have found while driving to the hotel, where you can freshen up, them we can go from there.</p>


     <p>Both men got into the rental car with Woo at the wheel. The car began to slowly pull out of its parking space and unto a nearby street.</p>


<p>WOO: You'd best prepare yourself for the news I'm about to tell you, Darren. Some of it is good, some bad.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Frowns slightly:)</i> Okay, Woo--the <i>bad</i> news first.</p>

<p>WOO: Very well. The Barnes Adoption Agency went out of business <i>five</i> years ago. There was a good reason it did--<i>(pauses:)</i> it was a front for <i>black-market babies</i>. <i>(Darren looks stunned)</i> On the <i>surface</i>, it was <i>legitimate</i>, but <i>underneath</i>, well, there was some alleged backroom <i>wheeling and dealing</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: A-are you <i>saying</i>--</p>

<p>WOO: Yes. You might've been <i>sold illegally</i> as a baby, Darren. <i>(Hesitates:)</i> When you <i>think</i> about it, <i>$50,000</i> is a <i>hell</i> of a lot of money to pay to get to the head of the line, which leads me to wonder if your parents <i>knew</i> what they were getting into.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks at Woo sharply, becoming angry:)</i> Just what <i>are</i> you getting at, Woo? Are you saying that my parents <i>knew</i> that the agency was illegal, yet went on ahead and <i>"bought"</i> me anyway? If you're going in <i>that</i> 
direction--</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Sounding in a placating voice:)</i> No, no Darren! I'm simply stating that your parents, in their <i>desperation</i> to get a baby, were a bit--<i>naive</i> in their dealings with the agency. I've had several cases in which couples who couldn't have children of their own go through the same process, though none with this agency. In most of the cases, a lot of money was paid, but <i>no</i> baby was produced. Your parents were quite fortunate they weren't <i>tricked</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Becoming calmer:)</i> I guess--maybe the agency figured that when that much money was being offered up front, the persons they'd deal with were pretty <i>influential</i>, and they would do just about <i>anything</i> to get the couple, my parents, <i>any</i> baby.</p>

<p>WOO: Probably. Anyway, the police tried to break up the ring, but everyone scattered in <i>several</i> directions. When they <i>did</i> arrest some people, there was not enough evidence to convict. The parents who adopted the babies thought everything was on the up and up, at least on the surface, so they couldn't say anything to help the cops--</p>

<p>DARREN: --Hold it. If <i>that</i> were the case--</p>

<p>WOO: <i>Why</i> didn't the police contact your <i>parents</i>? I checked--they <i>did</i>. Your father said that he and his wife thought everything was legal, even with that $50,000 fee. After an investigation, it was decided <i>no</i> laws were broken, and your parents were in the <i>clear</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>Whoa</i>. Wouldn't have the <i>media</i> discovered what the police were doing or something?</p>

<p>WOO: Maybe--if the case wasn't kept under <i>wraps</i>. Your dad must've had a <i>lot</i> of influence to keep something like this a secret.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Narrows his eyes in deep thought, looks off into space:)</i> Yeah--he had just about as much as my <i>uncle Will. (In a quiet voice:)</i> In a way, it's almost--<i>scary</i>, having that much pull.</p>

<p>WOO: I suppose, but your father was considered to be a most <i>philanthropic</i> man. Having the wealth can cut <i>"both"</i> ways--<i>(pauses:) if</i> you know what I mean.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Frowns at Woo's implied meaning:)</i> That's something I <i>don't</i> want, Woo. I'd like to use my wealth in just <i>one</i> way--the <i>right</i> way. Maybe I'm being a little <i>naive</i>, but I believe that giving money is the way to make it a <i>better</i> world for everyone--as long as it's not <i>wasted</i> on something <i>unimportant</i>.</p> 

<p>WOO: An--<i>admirable</i> goal, Darren--<i>speaking</i> of which, do you think you are wasting <i>your</i> money <i>now</i>?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Confused frown:)</i> I don't <i>follow</i> you, Woo.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Smiles:)</i> I am speaking about the <i>burning</i> question on your mind--<i>"Is Woo working for me or my uncle</i>?"</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Stunned:) H-how</i> did you--</p>

<p>WOO: --<i>Figure</i> it out? <i>(Chuckles:)</i> I not only investigate the <i>cases</i> my clients give me, Darren--I also investigate my <i>clients</i>, you know, to see if I'm being <i>used</i> to cover up anything that my client might be hiding <i>from</i> me, to do <i>wrong</i>? One can't be <i>too</i> careful in my line of work. I found out quickly that you and your uncle were <i>not</i> on the best of terms, that the word <i>"trust"</i> doesn't register between the two of you. That is <i>quite</i> interesting, especially since I have read in the paper of your <i>giving</i> the Chairmanship of the Appleton Conglomerate to your uncle.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Sighs:)</I> You, my aunt Millie, and friend Curtis, and not to mention <i>most</i> of Appleton as well, Woo. Well, I set aside the differences between my uncle and me for the <i>good</i> of the company. He was the <i>most</i> experienced person there. <i>(Frowns slightly at Woo, realizes:)</i> Since you <i>"asked"</i> the question, you can give me the <i>"answer"</i> about working for my uncle.</p>


     <p>The car, which had by now turned onto a nearby freeway, pulled onto the shoulder, and stopped.</p>


<p>WOO: <i>(Looks Darren in the eye, serious tone:)</i> As I have said, Darren--I do <i>not</i> want to be used to do <i>wrong</i>. If I even had an <i>inkling</i> that your uncle was using me, no matter what <i>amount</i> of money he offered to me--I would cut him <i>loose</i> in an <i>instant</i>. I take great <i>pride</i> in my work. Like your wanting to give money away in the right way, I wish to do my work in only one way--the <i>right</i> way. I have my <i>honor</i> and <i>reputation</i> to consider. If you <i>still</i> have any doubts as about whether or not to trust me, I will <i>give</i> you <i>all</i> of what I have found, recommend <i>other</i> detectives I know for you, and then <i>go</i>.</p>


     <p>Darren simply stared at Woo, dumbfounded for a moment, then he slowly smiled, and spoke in a sincere tone.</p>


<p>DARREN: Woo, I would be <i>honored</i> to have you <i>stay</i> on this case, and I am sorry to have even <i>brought up</i> the question.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Breaks out into a smile:)</i> You do not need to apologize, Darren--remember, in my line of work, one cannot be too careful. <i>(Drives car back unto the freeway:)</i> Now, I believe you want the <i>good</i> news--I know <i>where</i> Doctor Turley is, and after you freshen up, we should <i>immediately</i> go and visit him.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Now with a concerned look on his face:)</i> Why <i>immediately</i>, Woo?</p>

<p>WOO: Doctor Turley has <i>terminal</i> cancer that started in his liver, Darren, and has spread throughout his body. He does not have much longer to live in this world, at best he may have a few days, or even <i>less</i> to live.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Reaches for his cell phone located in his bag:)</i> In that case, we should go to Dr. Turley <i>right now</i>. I'll call the Zenith and tell them to hold the room for me later. <i>(Starts to punch in the numbers to the phone)</i></p>

<p>WOO: Very well. Turley is still in Dumas, which is about 100 miles northeast of Los Angeles. We also have discovered that Turley had been in some <i>heavy gambling debts</i> for years, even before he gave you away.  Though even he had gotten <i>rid</i> of them for awhile, the bug caught him <i>again</i>, and he built up his debts again.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Shocked disbelief:) Oh my God</i>--he gave me away just so he could pay up his <i>debts</i>? <i>(Becomes angry:)</i> How <i>sick</i> is <i>that</i>?

<p>WOO: <i>(In a grim tone:)</i> Such is the way of the world that you wish to make <i>better</i>, Darren. <i>(Darren gives Woo a thoughtful look)</i> I suggest you get a nap before you meet the good doctor. We will be there in less than two hours.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(While laying back in the seat, closing his eyes:)</i> There's <i>nothing</i> good about that doctor, Woo.</p>

<p>WOO: Indeed. <i>(After a moment:)</i> I am wondering--<i>how</i> will you get Doctor Turley to tell you who your birth parent or parents are, whereas your father could <i>not</i>?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(After thinking  for a moment:)</i> I'm hoping for some sort of <i>"Last Confession"</i> or something. You know, <i>"I'm dying, so to clear my conscience, I'm going to come clean with everything." (Shrugs:)</i> Yeah, I know it's a <i>long</i> shot, but that's the best thing I can think of, at least for now.</p>

<p>WOO: Perhaps it will work, Darren--let us <i>hope</i>.</p>


     <p>About two hours later, the rental car drove into the parking lot of the <I>County General Hospital</I> near Dumas. Darren and Woo got out and went into the hospital, where they went into the lobby and met a receptionist at the front desk. After checking the patient list, the receptionist told them to go to room 204 of the Terminal Care Ward, where dying patients spent their final days awaiting their fateful meeting with death. As both men walked into the hallway of the ward, there seemed to be a sense of <i>depression</i> in the air, of <i>hopelessness</i>. The walls were a plain grayish-white, with no other colors on them. The steel blue doors projected a feeling of <i>finality</i>, as if to say, <i>"This is it. You have nothing more to look forward to--now die and get it over with."</i> Even the doctors and nurses seemed <i>resigned</i> to the fate of their patients, with monotone looks and conversations with one another. Darren glanced uneasily at Woo, who returned the <i>same</i> look just as quickly. This was a place that did <i>not</i> project cheerfulness or comfort for a patient in their final days.</p>

     <p>Both men came to room 204, and walked quietly in. The depression carried itself into here as well, with the green drapes of the room shut tightly together, as if the sunlight had some <i>gall</i> to dare try and shine itself through them. There was little to almost no light in the room as a result, save for a small, lighted lamp beside the bed, which illuminated a chair that was beside the bed. Darren and Woo's eyes came upon the horrible sight of <i>Turley</i>, who was lying in the bed, propped up. His skin seemed to be <i>deathly</i> pale, and very wrinkled, with intravenous tubes running in his nose and arms. Turley's eyes looked yellowish and bloodshot, and they seemed to be <i>sunk</i> into his face. He was breathing through a respirator, and a heart-monitoring machine was attached to him by sensors on his chest. Turley stared listlessly at the ceiling above both men.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Looking aghast:)</i> Uh--um--Hugo Turley? Doctor Turley?</p>
 

     <p>For a moment, Turley didn't seem to respond to Darren's question. Darren glanced at Woo and was about to ask again when Turley looked directly at Darren, who promptly <i>froze</i>. Turley's stare seemed to go <i>through</i> him, giving Darren the chills, as if death <i>itself</i> were looking at him. Turley then began to speak, suddenly sounding surprisingly <i>clear</i>, even with a breathing mask over his mouth.</p>


<p>TURLEY: <i>(Tired-sounding voice, cynical:)</i> If you're here for the collection payments from me, I'm all tapped out. Maybe you can get something from my life insurance agency, but leave my family the <i>hell</i> alone.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Recovering:)</i> No, Doctor Turley, we're with no collection agency or nothing like that. I've come to ask you about a baby that you delivered about twenty years ago. <i>(Motions to Woo, who's standing beside him:)</i> This is a private detective that I've hired named Gerald Woo, and my name is Darren Appleton.  I have reason to believe from Mr. Woo's investigations that <i>I</i> was that baby.</p>

<p>TURLEY: <i>(Eyes narrowing:) Appleton</i>? <i>(Looks up at the ceiling as if to search his memory:)</i> You mean, as in <i>Arthur</i> Appleton?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looking hopeful:)</i> Yes, sir. I'm his and Lucille Appleton's--<i>adopted</i> son. Arthur is my <i>first</i> name, and I was named of course after my father. To keep from there being <i>confusion</i>, my family and friends call me by my <i>middle</i> name, Darren, which I actually <i>prefer</i>, while people <i>outside</i> of my family and friends call me <i>"Arthur"</i>, officially.</p>
 

     <p>Turley stared at Darren and Woo for a moment, surprised. He then did something that shocked both men: he began to <i>laugh</i>.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Frowns:)</i> I'm sorry, I don't get the <i>joke</i>.</p>

<p>TURLEY: <i>(Still laughing:)</i> Y-yes, I <i>definitely</i> remember now. Your parents paid <i>$50,000</i> to get you. Well, son, I don't see <i>what</i> you're <i>complaining</i> about. You've got it <i>made</i> with all of your money. Why in the <i>hell</i> would you want to find your <i>real</i> parents?</p>  

<p>DARREN: <i>(Glares at Turley:)</i> Because my <i>"real"</i> mother gave me <i>birth</i>. Is <i>that</i> reason enough for you?</p>

<p>TURLEY: <i>(Now smirks:)</i> Actually, I don't really give a <i>damn</i> either way or the other son, about your reasons. I've got <i>my</i> family to think about.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Still glaring:)</i> At least you <i>have</i> your family to think about. My parents are <i>gone</i>, both adoptive <i>and</i> birth.</p>

<p>TURLEY: <i>(Now looks away, suddenly grows quiet:)</i> Oh, <i>right</i>, I heard about the plane crash. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Well, that's <i>tough</i>, son. I mean, I'm gonna die like them soon, so that's <i>life</i>. You don't have money problems like my family's going to have <i>after</i> I die, so you don't understand. I mean, when the bills come in, <i>who's</i> going to pay for them?</p> 
 
<p>DARREN: <i>(Suddenly gets an idea:)</i> How about if <i>I</i> do? <i>(Woo looks at Darren, surprised) Who</i> is your immediate family? <i>(Takes out a checkbook from his pocket, begins to write)</i></p>

<p>TURLEY: <i>(Looking a bit shocked:)</i> Uh, well, my wife Martha and my daughter, <i>Cassie</i>, who's married and has three children. I'm in the hole more than <i>$650,000. (Woo gives himself a quiet whistle, awed at the amount of the debt Turley owes)</i> The <i>I.R.S.</i> has threatened to foreclose on our home, and I know they'll put my debts on my <i>wife</i> after I'm gone.</p>


     <p>Just as Darren was finishing writing the check, a small, white-haired old woman came in with a tray of food. The woman had a <i>haggard</i> look on her face, a look that quickly turned into a <i>scowl</i> when she saw Darren and Woo standing beside Turley's bed.</p>


<p>WOMAN: <i>(Becoming angry:)</i> How <i>dare</i> you come in here and <i>harass</i> my husband? He's ill and you're still trying to get <i>money</i> from him!? If you don't get out right <i>now</i>--</p>

<p>TURLEY: <i>(Weakly holds up his hand:)</i> --It's all right, <i>Martha</i>. These men are here to <i>pay</i> us money, <i>not</i> take any. They're from er--<i>(looks a bit panicked, motions subtly at Darren and Woo to say something)</i></p>

<p>WOO: --The <i>life insurance agency</i>, ma'am. Your husband is--er, <i>cashing out</i> his policy. As you can see, my uh--<i>"partner"</i> here has a check to give to him. <i>(Darren holds up the check)</i></p>

<p>MARTHA: <i>(Stunned, puts hand on chest:)</i> I--I don't know <i>what</i> to say. I'm--<i>sorry</i> for my outburst. We've been under a bit of strain these past several months. May I <i>see</i> the amount?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Reluctant:)</i> Er, certainly. <i>(Gives Martha the check)</i></p>


     <p>Martha looked at the check and her eyes bulged out, and her hands began to <i>tremble</i>.</p>


<p>MARTHA: <i>(Eyes lighting up:) My goodness</i>! This check is for <i>one million dollars</i>!</p>

<p>TURLEY: <i>(Shocked with Woo:)</i> It <i>is</i>? I mean, <i>of course</i> it is! <i>(Now smug:)</i> I told you, dear, that you didn't have to worry about anything! <i>(Pauses:)</i> Now, if you'll excuse us, honey, these gentleman and I have to, um--<i>(motions to both men again)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: --Er, <i>close out the deal</i>, ma'am. We just have to talk about <i>lingering arrangements</i>, you know, that sort of thing.</p>

<p>MARTHA: <i>(Nods her head in an understanding manner:)</i> Oh, of course, I see. <i>(Begins to give back check)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Holds his hands up:)</i> No ma'am, that's <i>your</i> money now.</p> 

<p>MARTHA: Yes, you're right, what was I--<i>(looks at check again, narrows eyes:) --wait a minute</i>. This check is from an <i>Arthur Appleton Jr.</i>, not from a life insurance company. <i>(Looks angrily at her husband:)</i> Hugo, what in the <i>hell</i> is going on here? <i>(Turley looks terrified)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Steps up:)</i> Ma'am, I--</p>

<p>MARTHA: <i>(Cuts him off and staring up at him, eye-to-eye, takes another look at the check:)</i>--Are you this--"Arthur Appleton Jr.", young man?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Pauses:)</i> Yes ma'am, but I go by my middle name Darren.</p>

<p>MARTHA: I see. <i>(Pauses:) Why</i> did you and--<i>(motions to Woo)</i></p> 

<p>WOO: --Gerald Woo, ma'am--</p>

<p>MARTHA: --"Gerald Woo", <i>lie</i>? I know that my husband has lied <i>many</i> times, but why did <i>you</i> do it?</p>


     <p>Darren and Woo looked at each other, and then at Turley, who looked uneasily away.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Decides to come clean:)</i> Mrs. Turley, I'm sorry for lying to you. You see, my parents were killed in a plane crash a few days ago, and then I discovered that they had adopted me via your husband. I hired Mr. Woo here to find my birth parents. Woo found out that your husband was part of--a--well---um--<i>(becomes hesitant, looks at Turley)</i></p>

<p>MARTHA: --It's all right, dear. <i>(She speaks softly now:)</i> I thought that name sounded <i>familiar</i>--and I'm <i>sorry</i> for your loss. <i>(Glares at her now-unconfortable husband:)</i> I know all about the illegal adoptions, for I found out about them two years ago. My husband came clean with me on them when he found out he was first diagnosed with cancer, and after the police had questioned him on his connections to the Barnes Adoption Agency. <i>(Smirks:)</i> He told the police that he had done <i>nothing</i> wrong concerning the adoptions, and they had no solid evidence in any case, just <i>allegations</i> of wrongdoing. I could see that he <i>lied. (Pauses:)</i> You see, my husband had a <i>"thing"</i> for gambling. After all, he's lied to me about it for <i>years</i>, and I can tell now when he does lie about <i>anything</i>. You <i>name</i> it--racing horses and dogs, craps, slot machines, sports games, etc. I only wonder how the man I married could be an obstetrician <i>and</i> a gambler? <i>Quite</i> a <i>combination</i>, eh? I didn't leave him or turn him in right then and there because I guess I <i>still</i> loved him. <i>(Laughs bitterly, looks angrily at her husband:)</i> Oh yes, let's not forget about all of those <i>phone bills</i> you ran up between your patient's visits. <i>(Sneers:)</i> You were calling in <i>bets</i>, right, dear? <i>(Turley closes his eyes as if he is in pain, and not just from his illness) (Martha looks over to Woo:)</i> But I'm sure Mr. Woo here knows all about the gambling debts already, <i>right? (Woo nods slowly)</i> Good. <i>(Looks back to her husband, eyes full of contempt:)</i> If only you knew about the <i>hell</i> he put our daughter and me through--</p>

<p>TURLEY: <i>(Laughs uneasily:)</i> --Now, Martha, I'm sure these gentlemen don't want to hear about <i>our</i> family--</p>

<p>MARTHA: <i>(In a cold tone:)</i> --No, Hugo, they <i>don't</i>. This young man wants to hear about <i>his</i> family--you know--the one you <i>took</i> from him?</p>

<p>DARREN: Uh, pardon me, but I thought my birth mother <i>didn't</i> want me. I just wanted to find her and say I was--<i>(sighs:) okay</i>.</p>

<p>MARTHA: <i>(Glares at her husband:)</i> Is that <i>true</i>, Hugo? Did this young man's mother <i>not</i> want him?</p>


     <p>Turley became silent for a moment, then looked sadly at his wife and Darren.</p>


<p>TURLEY: Well, uh-- <i>(looks reluctantly at Darren, pauses, then speaks:)</i> You see, son, your birth parents think you're--<i>dead.
 (Darren, Woo, and Martha look stunned)</i> Maybe you'd better sit down. <i>(Darren does so reluctantly in the chair beside the bed)</i> Look, you've <i>got</i> 
to understand that at the time, I needed some <i>quick</i> cash, and when your birth parents came to me in the middle of the night, 
it was an unbelievable stroke of <i>luck. (Turley's wife frowns at him, Turley notices:)</i> Aw, <i>crap</i>, honey, I wish you wouldn't
 <i>look</i> at me that way. Just--just let me <i>explain</i>--</p>
