<p>Chapter 3-Establishing Connections</p>




     <p>As the sun was setting, the rental car containing Woo and Darren made its way back down the freeway to Los Angeles. Woo, while at the wheel, kept sneaking <i>concerned</i> glances at Darren, who looked as if he could <i>murder</i> someone.</p>


<p>WOO: You're <i>sure</i> you're all right, Darren?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Glares at Woo, snappy response:)</i> For the <i>one-hundreth</i> time, Woo, <i>YES I AM, DAMN IT! (Looks suddenly remorseful, lays head back in seat and closes his eyes in pain:)</i>--I-I'm <i>sorry</i> I snapped at you, Woo. <i>(Puts hand on forehead:) Oh God</i>, I feel as if my life has <i>fallen apart</i>. I can't believe what that <i>slime</i> Turley told me, and then <i>losing</i> my temper like that, and <i>then</i> I--</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Cuts him off:)</i> --It's okay, Darren. <i>Anyone</i> would've reacted the way you did when you heard what Turley said. Hell, <i>I</i> was tempted to go after him <i>myself</i>. But look--at least you know <i>who</i> your birth parents are now. You can tell them you're <i>alive</i>. I'm going to call my office and see if I can get the ball rolling on finding them. <i>(Picks up cell phone and begins to call:)</i> After we visit the <i>cemetery</i>, I'll drop you off at the Zenith and you can rest up, and the first thing in the morning, we'll go to my office and see if something came up. I guess you'll probably want to call back at your home once we get back to the hotel. <i>(Is silent for a moment, then speaks again:)</i> That was really a very <i>generous</i> thing you did in allowing Mrs. Turley to <i>keep</i> that money, and her agreeing not to tell anyone about your being there was just as generous.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks out the window while still lying back in the seat, in a bitter low voice:)</i> Yeah, thanks. It wasn't <i>her</i> fault that her husband is a piece of <i>sub-human filth</i>. I mean, why should <i>she</i> have to pay for what <i>he</i> did? <i>(Looks up ahead:)</i> Woo, <i>there's</i> the exit Turley told us about.</p>


     <p>The car turned off of the freeway and went down a country road for about five miles. It came to a tiny, abandoned cemetery that was surrounded by an open field. Darren got out of the car alone and went down a small embankment that lead to it, and saw that weeds had grown over almost all of the markers. A gentle breeze filled the air, blowing the weeds. Darren proceeded to carefully look for a particular marker. He cautiously pushed the weeds away from each marker until he came to a very small one, the one he was looking for, near the edge of the cemetery. He looked at the stone marker and put his finger on it, narrowing his eyes to get a better look at it in the approaching twilight. He cursed himself for not having a flashlight, but he could see the inscription on the marker clear enough. Darren took on a sad visage at the message:</p>


                    <p align=center><i><b>To the son we never knew-</b></i></p align=center>

                  <p align=center><i><b>always know that we loved you.</b></i></p align=center>

                  <p align=center><i><b>-Jake and Helen Morgendorffer</b></i></p align=center>
  


<p><i>(Scene changes to the Appleton estate, about two-and-a-half hours later)</i></p>


     <p>As Elenor came into the study to ask if Millie wanted anything before Elenor went to bed, she heard the phone ring. Millie was reading <i>The Diary of Anne Frank</i> and got the phone, waving Elenor off.</p>


<p>MILLIE: Appleton residence.</p>

<p>VOICE: Aunt Millie?</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Eyes light up:) Darren</i>, is that <i>you</i>? Where are you, and why hadn't you called earlier?</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Quietly chuckles:)</i> I'm sorry about that, Aunt Millie--it's been a <i>long</i> day. I'm calling from the Zenith, and I--found out <i>who</i> my birth parents are.</p>


     <p>About this time, the front door rang, and Elenor went to see who it was. Millie looked at Elenor leave for the door.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Pauses:)</i> Aunt Millie? Hello? Are you there?</p>

<p>MILLIE: Sorry, Darren, the doorbell rang and I was distracted for a moment. <i>(Shocked:)</i> Did you say that you found out who your birth parents are? Are they <i>alive</i>? Who--</p>

<p>DARREN: --I don't know if they are, Aunt Millie. Look, I'll tell you more about it tomorrow. For now, I'm tired and hungry. I'm going to eat, and then get some sleep. I'll call you tomorrow and leave a message, Auntie. Goodbye. <i>(Hangs up curtly)</i></p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Surprised look on her face:) Darren</i>? Hello, Darren?</p>


     <p>William and Elenor walked into the study to hear the end of Millie's call.</p>


</p>WILLIAM: <i>(Looking "concerned":)</i> Millie, was that <i>Darren</i>? <i>What</i> did he say? <i>Where</i> is he at?</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Clicks off the cell phone, looking perplexed with a frown on her face:)</i> He's at the Zenith Hotel, William. He sounded a bit--<i>strained</i>. He said he found out who his birth parents are.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Genuinely stunned along with Elenor:)</i> He <i>did</i>? <i>That</i> fast? Who are they?</p>

<p>MILLIE: He didn't say, William. He said he'll tell me about it tomorrow.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(While hiding his disappointment:)</i> I see. Well, I just stopped by on my way from a late night at work to see if you heard anything from Darren. I guess I wasted my time coming up here. Look, let me know when Darren calls. I'm as--<i>worried</i> about his welfare as you are. <i>(Laughs uneasily:)</i> That P.I. I hired really works <i>quick</i>, eh? <i>(Elenor rolls her eyes)</i></p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Looking distracted:)</i> --What?--I suppose, William. I hope nothing's <i>wrong</i> with Darren. <i>(Looks at her watch:)</i> William, it's almost <i>midnight</i>! You came up here from <i>New York City</i> just to ask about Darren? Why didn't you just <i>call</i>?</p> 

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Looks amused, waves Millie off:) Relax</i>, Millie--I took the <i>helicopter</i>. It's just a <i>forty minute</i> ride from the city up to here, and it's <i>waiting</i> for me now on the helipad.</p> 

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Raised eyebrow:)</i> Isn't that a bit <i>much</i>, William?</p> 

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(While leaving, chuckles:)</i> Nothing that we <i>rich</i> people can't afford <i>not</i> to do, dear sister. Be sure to keep me informed about our nephew. Don't bother seeing me out, Elenor. <i>(Elenor looks relieved she doesn't have to)</i></p>

<p>ELENOR: <i>(Looks back at Millie, concerned:)</i> Do you think Master Darren is all right, Mistress Millie? Forgive me for saying so, but for <i>some</i> reason, I have the <i>impression</i> that you're <i>worried</i> about him.</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Resigned look on her face:)</i> I <i>am,</i> Elenor, but I'm sure that <i>whatever</i> it is, Darren will be able to handle it. <i>(Thought v.o.: For someone who just found out who his birth parents are, Darren didn't sound too happy. I just hope this is something he really wants to do.)</i></p>


     <p>William sprinted out to the helicopter on the helipad near the mansion and climbed in. He looked a bit <i>agitated</i>, a look that didn't escape Benny, who was waiting in the helicopter with the pilot.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: <i>(To the pilot:)</i> Take us back to the helipad on top of the Appleton Tower, pilot.</p>

<p>PILOT: Yessir, Mr Appleton. <i>(The helicopter lifts off)</i></p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Raising his voice high enough to be heard over the helicopter's noise, but low enough for the pilot not to hear:)</i> Boss, you look a little <i>worried</i>. Did something happen concerning Darren and his <i>(snickering:) "real"</i> parents?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(In the same level of tone as Benny, watching the pilot:)</i> Yes, Benny, and it may <i>not</i> be good for us. Woo apparently did one <i>hell</i> of a job in finding the names of my <i>"nephew's"</i> birth parents, and <i>before</i> you ask, I didn't get their names. I was hoping it would take awhile for Darren to make any sort of contact with them, but it looks like he could <i>soon</i>.</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Grins sinisterly:)</i> Boss, I could do <i>something</i> to <i>slow</i> him down--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Sharply:) No</i>. I don't want you to do <i>anything</i>. If my <i>"nephew"</i> is as smart as I <i>think</i> he is, he could suspect something <i>amiss</i>, and put me at the <i>top</i> of his list. We'll do <i>nothing</i> for now. <i>(Grins, gets an idea:)</i> Now when I <i>think</i> about it, if anything, this may <i>help</i> us even more. Darren's finding his parents <i>sooner</i> rather than later could keep him occupied with getting to know them sooner, and maybe <i>longer</i>. Who knows? Maybe he'll even become <i>so</i> attached to them, he'll let me <i>have</i> the company <i>outright</i>, wanting to <i>stay</i> with his <i>"real family". (Smirks:)</i> Why, I'd probably feel so happy, I'd even consider <i>allowing</i> Darren to <i>live</i>.</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Looks slightly depressed at this last remark, then raises an eyebrow:)</i> And <i>if</i> he finds them and they <i>don't</i> want him or vice versa?--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Frowns:)</i> --Then, Benny, we may have to move <i>up</i> our timetable on eliminating my <i>"nephew"</i>, investigation or no investigation. I'm <i>sure</i> Darren would want to <i>meddle</i> in company business if things don't work out for him, and that simply won't do, oh, no, <i>I think not</i>. For <i>his</i> sake, he'd <i>better</i> get to know them <i>real</i> well when--or <i>if</i> he finds them.</p>



<p><i>(The Morgendorffer residence, the following morning:)</i></p>

 

     <p>Helen and Jake were preparing to go to work, while Daria , who was eating cereal, and Quinn, who was eating a grapefruit, sat at the kitchen table and watched them. Both Morgendorffer sisters were still in their nightclothes.</p> 

<p><i>(Note to reader: Daria's nightclothes here are her regular blue t-shirt and yellow shorts. She also has the "Mark Twain" pullover pajama shirt from the episode "Lane Miserables". Quinn's nightclothes are what she wore in "The Big House" episode, a yellow pullover pajama shirt, with a pink bunny on the front)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(While getting her briefcase:)</i> Daria! Quinn! Why don't you put on some <i>regular</i> clothing? Surely you two aren't going to <i>stay</i> dressed like that <i>all day</i> while your father and I are gone?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sarcastic deadpan, of course:)</i> Oh, I don't know, Mom--I'm thinking of <i>going out</i> dressed like this. <i>(Looks at Quinn, smirks:)</i> It's the <i>new style</i>, you know.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Panicked, holds both hands to the side of her face:)</i> It <i>is</i>? OH, NO! I gotta check in my newest issue of <i>Waif</i> magazine on this! <i>(Talks to herself:) Damn it</i>, Sandi, why didn't you tell me? <i>(Rushes away from the table)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> Quinn, Daria was just--oh, why do I even <i>bother</i>? <i>(Daria smirks at this)</i> Daria, promise me that you'll not tease your sister mercilessly <i>again</i> while we're at work.</p> 

<p>DARIA: Hey, I gotta do <i>something</i> to relieve my boredom, but, okay, Mom. If Quinn starts <i>something</i>, however, all bets are <i>off</i>. <i>(Sinister smile:)</i> Then it's every gal for <i>herself. (Resumes eating)</i></p>


     <p>Before Helen could respond to this, Jake ran into the kitchen. He was still tying his necktie, and at the same time getting some coffee. He promptly spilled the hot coffee on his ankles.</p>


<p>JAKE: OWWW! DAMN IT ALL TO HELL! Stupid coffee! <i>Wellnotimetochangesocksandshoes!Gottagettoworkandtalktoanewclient! I'llpickupsomethingontheway!Goodbyedear!(Kisses Helen:) Seeyakiddo! TellQuinnIsaidbye!(Grabs briefcase, rushes out the door, starts up Lexus, and is gone, screeching tires in the process, and is heard in the distance, "Get the hell out the way, you wreckless bastards!")</i></p>


     <p>Daria and Helen simply looked at each other, speechless for a moment.</p>


<p>DARIA: Dad has just broken his own <i>record. (Pulls out a pad and pencil, begins to write--see this also on "The Misery Chick")</i> Let's see now--compared to <i>yesterday</i>, there's a difference of--</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Sighs, sits down at the table:)</i> --Daria, please. <i>(Daria stops writing)</i> What are you going to do today, sweetie?</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(While eating her cereal:)</i> I'll probably go to the library again, or just watch some <i>Sick, Sad World</i> on TV, or go up in my room and scheme to do some <i>evil</i>. Hell, who <i>knows</i>? My plate's <i>quite</i> full today. <i>(Raises an eyebrow:)</i> Uh--Mom, why aren't you <i>scampering</i> to work like Dad? Usually, you'd be <i>gone</i> by now.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(While eating a cold Pop Tart:)</i> Believe it or not, Daria, the workload at the firm is a bit <i>light</i> today, with most everyone out for vacation. I can come in a <i>little</i> late.</p>

<p>DARIA: Ripley, eat your <i>tart</i> out.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Quietly:)</i> Actually, I wanted to use this time to <i>thank you</i>, Daria.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Startled slightly:) Huh</i>? What do you mean?</p> 

<p>HELEN: <i>(Finishes eating Pop Tart:)</i> Daria, ever since you saw your friend Jane and her mother Amanda off, you've been here for your father and me when we needed you for <i>anything</i>. I'd guess you were <i>worried</i> about how we were after telling you and Quinn about losing the baby. Honey, <i>thank you</i> for not holding that <i>against</i> us, and talking to Quinn about the baby, even with a--<i>(looks for words:) "financial incentive". (Helen smiles at Daria with a loving look)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Becoming uncomfortable:)</i> Er, Mom, don't get the <i>wrong</i> idea, here. I was <i>bored</i>, and Jane is gone on her vacation with her mom. Usually, I'd be somewhere else with her, and <i>not</i> here, okay?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Smirks, gives a "Yeah, sure, right, if you say so" look:)</i> Whatever you <i>say</i>, dear. Speaking of vacations, your father and I want to get with you and Quinn and talk about going to the mountains or the beach tonight over dinner. We'll both be off for next week. Do you have <i>any</i> ideas?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(In her deadpan mode:)</i> How about we just stay here and <i>pretend</i> we're in <I>both</I> places at once? It can really save on fuel costs. We can get one of those large <i>posters</i> of the beach and of the mountains, some of those fifty-pound bags of sand, and those <i>phony</i> boulders that those movie studios use, and we can put them in the <i>living room</i> and--</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Sighs, getting up:) --Goodbye</i>, Daria. There's frozen microwavable lasagna in the freezer for you and Quinn for lunch. <i>(Smiles:)</i> Thank you <i>again</i>, sweetie. <i>(Leaves out the front door)</i></p>


     <p>Daria stared at the door, and then frowned for a moment.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Thought v.o.: Damn it, Daria, you're getting <B>soft</B>. First your family, then Jane and Tom. You gotta get back your hard edge. I hope I can hold out till Jane gets back. If I don't, I'll go crazy and start smiling and wanting to be with my family, which just won't do, no siree bob. What can I do in the meantime to get back my edge--?)</i></p>


     <p>Daria's thoughts were interrupted by an angry Quinn entering the kitchen and waving the current issue of <i>Waif</i> magazine around.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(Frowns:) DAMN IT, DARIA</i>! I don't see <i>anything</i> in here about wearing nightclothes outside the house! You <i>lied</i> to me! You <i>brains</i> have nothing else better to do than <i>ruin</i> us beautiful <i>and</i> popular people! <i>(In a disgusted voice:)</i> God, Daria, you're such a <i>loser</i>!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Gets a sinister smirk on her face, thought v.o.: <B>That's</B> the ticket!)</i> Why, Quinn--are you trying to <i>start</i> something with me? <i>(Begins to walk toward Quinn, cracking her knuckles:)</i> I <i>do</i> hope you are. <i>(Quinn turns pale, and begins to back up in fear from the approaching menace that is her sister Daria)</i></p>


<p><i>(The front of the Zenith Hotel, Los Angeles, about three hours later:)</i></p>


     <p>The rental car Woo drove came in front of the regal-looking Zenith Hotel, driving around a circular driveway that surrounded a spectacular, marbled, tall, and rounded three-level water fountain with a statue in the middle. The statue was of two winged lions that were face-to-face, poised on their hind legs, with the water shooting through their mouths. The car stopped at the foot of the hotel's rounded steps, where there was a doorman waiting alongside Darren, who was carrying a small briefcase. The doorman opened the car's door and Darren got in, then the car drove off.</p>


<p>WOO: Good morning, Darren. <i>(Whistles:)</i> That's <i>some</i> place you're staying at. What's the rate <i>per night</i> again?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Sighs, sounding resigned, even looking a little embarassed:)</i> Good morning, Woo, and it cost a <i>thousand</i>. I wish my uncle Will would've chosen a <i>less-expensive</i> place. The <i>last</i> thing I need is to draw attention to myself.</p>

<p>WOO: Well, I guess your uncle is <i>used</i> to that sort of living away from home. Look, I've got some <i>great</i> news that'll <i>cheer</i> you up.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looking very hopeful:)</i> What's up? Are my birth parents <i>alive</i>?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Grins:)</i> Yes, Darren. Helen and Jake Morgendorffer <i>are</i> alive, and live in a place called <i>Lawndale</i>, a suburban town. I'll tell you more about it in my office. You also better brace yourself--you have <i>two younger sisters</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Shocked, wide-eyed:) I--have--two--</i></p>    

<p>WOO: <i>(Still grinning:) --Younger</i> sisters, Darren--<i>full-blooded</i> younger sisters.</p> 

     
     <p>Darren sat back in the seat, shellshocked, simply staring forward wordlessly. Woo smirked slightly, and said nothing. Neither man said anything else the rest of the way to Woo's office, only twenty minutes from the hotel by the Santa Monica Freeway. The car came up to a rather plain-looking, two-story, red brick building in a quiet, well-to-do neighborhood of turn-of-the-century homes. The windows were tinted in a green hue, as were the front glass doors, which read <i>Woo Private Detective Agency</i> in white letters. There was a small lawn in the front, with the grass freshly cut. Beyond the lawn was a sidewalk. Woo parked the car in the very front, and both men got out. Darren stared at the building for a moment, then spoke.</p>


<p>DARREN: Hmm--not bad, Woo. This looks like a <i>nice</i> place.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Chuckles:)</i> If you say <i>"nice"</i> by meaning <i>"plain"</i>, then I accept your <i>compliment</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Trying to sound apologetic:)</i> Oh, no, Woo, I meant it looks <i>really</i> nice. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Actually, I kind of expected--well--<i>(voice fades off)</i></p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Laughs:)</i> --I believe the word you're looking for is <i>"dump"</i>, and I can't blame you for <i>thinking</i> that. Most of my clients think of those <i>dime store novels</i> in which we detectives are <i>gumshoes</i> who work in a <i>run down office</i> that has a ceiling fan, and junked-up furniture. Don't feel too bad, Darren, for you <i>won't</i> be the last person I expect to have that stereotypical image of my field.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks back at the building:)</i> I'm curious Woo--this seems to be an awfully <i>large</i> place for what you do. You're <i>not</i> the only one working here, I assume---?</p>

<p>WOO: Oh, no, Darren. I have a secretary, and <i>five</i> people that work under me. Right now, only my secretary is here. The rest are out in the field, two here in the L.A. area, and three elsewhere in the country, all of them working on <i>other</i> cases. They call in every few hours to report in.</p> 


     <p>Both men went into the reception area, and Darren's eyes lit up almost immediately. The interior brick walls were almost covered with plaques and memorabilia, such as glass cases that contained an old gun and a knife, and a picture of <i>Basil Rathbone</i> as <i>Sherlock Holmes</i>. There were African warrior spears and a medivial sword on the wall as well. The carpet was a bright green, with matching lime-colored couches and chairs. Darren looked somewhat awestruck at the walls for a moment more, then turned back to Woo.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Definitely nice <i>inside</i> as well as outside, Woo. I <i>am</i> impressed.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Smiles, with a slight nod:)</i> Thank you very much, Darren--<i>I</i> did the decorating. <i>(Looks around:)</i> Where is my secretary, <i>Carla</i>?</p>


     <p>At that moment, an apparently early-twentyish, attractive blond woman, with a look of intense concentration on an arm full of about fifteen files she was carrying, came out to meet both men from the back.</p>


<p>CARLA: <i>(While looking down at straightening her files:)</i> I'm sorry, Woo, I was in the file room and I didn't hear you.</p> 

<p>WOO: That's okay, Carla. This is that client of mine, Darren Appleton. You can call him Darren.</p>

<p>CARLA: <i>(Looks up and sees Darren, stunned, tries to shift her files around in her arms to shake Darren's hand:)</i> Hello, Darren, um--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smiles, holding up his hands:)</i> --Hey, that's all right, Carla, you don't have to try to shake my hand. I can see you're kind of--<i>busy</i>. Ah, do you need any <i>help</i> with those files--?</p>

<p>CARLA: <i>(Still looking at Darren, this time a bit more on the dreamy side:)</i> Oh, um, that's okay, Darren. <i>(Walks up to him:)</i> Did you want coffee or something for breakfast? I could--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looking a bit confused:)</i> --Oh, er, well, I just ate breakfast at the hotel. That's okay.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Smiling while walking, followed by Darren:)</i> Just coffee for me, Carla, black. Hold all my calls, I'll be in the conference room.</p>

<p>CARLA: Yes, Woo--<i>(glances at Darren again:)</i> do you want me to take <i>any</i> notes? If you need me to go through the Appleton files I laid on the table in the conference room for you, I can.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(After letting Darren into the room first:)</i> That's quite all right, Carla--<i>(then mutters while shutting the door and chuckling:)</i> for <i>some</i> reason, I don't think you'd get <i>much</i> writing or filing done. <i>(Carla mockingly glares at him, then smirks)</i></p>


     <p>Darren was directed by Woo to a small room, eight-foot by ten-foot, connected to Woo's office. It was indeed a conference room, complete with a rectangular table full of documents associated with Darren's case. Both men sat down to go over the information Woo had acquired. The room was sparse, save for the table and two chairs, and a small serving table beside the rectangular table. There was a small window and a potted cactus plant in the corner of the room, with downtown Los Angeles in the distance.</p>

<p>WOO: As you can see, Darren, this is my conference room. I use it to lay out all of my client's casework when I talk with one. I don't like to use my office to confer with a client because it's too small, and it tends to <i>intimidate</i> them. <i>(Frowns for a moment, contemplating:)</i> Strange as it seems, I think the reason is that my office may be a bit too <i>sterile</i> in appearance because there's no window in there. I'm thinking of knocking down the wall that connects the two, and doing a complete redecoration.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Whatever your <i>fancy</i>, Woo--if you can do to this room to what was done to the reception area, I think you'll do okay.</p>

<p>WOO: Ah, thank you, Darren. Now to your birth parents--</p>


     <p>There was a knock at the door, and Carla came into the room with a tray of coffee, with sugar and creme, and bagels. She stole a quick glance at Darren and then put the tray on the serving table.</p>


<p>CARLA: I know you didn't ask for the bagels, Woo, but I thought you and Darren might get a little hungry, just in case. <i>(She stares at Darren again, this time a little longer)</i></p>

<p>WOO: <i>(While shuffling some papers:)</i> Why, thank you, Carla.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looking a bit confused at Carla's staring:)</i> Uh, yes, thank you, Carla.</p>

<p>CARLA: <i>(Still staring at Darren:)</i> Will that be all for now, Woo?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Now looking up, noticing Carla's staring:)</i> Yes, Carla. If I need you, I'll call.</p>

<p>CARLA: <i>(Slowly tearing away her look from Darren:)</i> Um, okay. <i>(Leaves and shuts the door, taking a quick last glance at Darren)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Hesitant to speak, with a perplexed frown:)</i> Woo, was it my <i>imagination</i>, or--<i>(pointing his thumb back at the door)</i></p>

<p>WOO: --No, Darren. <i>(Smirks:)</i> I think my secretary has something of a <i>crush</i> on you. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Now when I think about it, I suspect she is <i>not</i> the only one. It appears that some women find you <i>quite</i> handsome.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Genuinely shocked:)</i> You're--<i>kidding</i>!</p> 

<p>WOO: Nope. You didn't notice that when we were at the airport, some of the females walking by were <i>staring</i> at you? It didn't even occur to me until Carla's staring at you. Then again, I <i>am</i> a detective, and I should've <i>noticed</i> these things. I hope she didn't <i>embarass</i> you.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Chuckles:)</i> No, not at all, Woo. I suppose I should be <i>flattered</i>. I haven't really been with <i>any</i> girl since <i>Steph--(stops with a slightly pained look, then glances down to the files:)</i> can we er, get to what you found, Woo?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(After a pause, quietly:)</i> Of course, Darren. Helen Barksdale and Jake Morgendorffer were married on June 26, 1975, when they just got out of <i>Middleton College</i>. Beforehand, they apparently were part of the <i>hippie</i> culture, wondering around the country before they started to get <i>serious</i> about life, and became part of the <i>"establishment". (Looks at files, puts a finger on a map and begins to trace it:)</i> Your birth parents moved from--<i>here</i>--to Dumas in 1979. Both of your birth parents were five years removed from Middleton College, and your birth mother had just come out of four years of law school, working her own way through by being an <i>intern</i> at a local law firm. Your birth father worked at a <i>consulting firm</i>, then went with your birth mother out to Dumas and started his <i>own</i> consulting firm, which promptly <i>struggled</i> at the time, while she took a job at the <i>Pembrooke law firm</i> in Dumas.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Reminiscent look on face:)</i> Say, I briefly <i>considered</i> going to Middleton, but I heard that their academic standards had gone <i>down</i> in recent years. Eastward had a <i>superior</i> Business Administration degree program.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Laughs:)</i> Perhaps you'd better not <i>tell</i> your birth parents about their alma mater that way, or they might <i>not</i> want to meet you.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(In a quiet tone, looking out the window:) Who's</i> to say that they will <i>want</i> to at all, Woo? It's going to one <i>hell</i> of a shock to them when, or even <i>if</i>, I tell them. <i>(Pauses:)</i> I think I will have some of that coffee, Woo. <i>(Pours some coffee for himself)</i></p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Surprised:)</i> You <i>don't</i> know if you'll tell them now? What happened to maybe make you <i>change</i> your mind? <i>(Eats a bagel)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Still looks out the window, frowning:)</i> I really can't explain it--all I know is just that I <i>couldn't</i> sleep last night, Woo. I kept wondering if I'm doing the <i>right</i> thing. I mean, what right do <i>I</i> have to simply walk into their lives and say, <i>(talks in a mocking tone:) "Hi, I'm the son you should've had, but you thought had died. Let's talk! So what have you been doing these past twenty years? Oh, really? Me? Well, I've been living another life and all, thanks to a doctor who sold me to get out of his gambling debts. See ya! We'll do lunch, okay?" (Then he talks in a quiet tone:)</i> Maybe I should let sleeping dogs <i>lie</i>, go off somewhere to think where do I go from here, and then get <i>on</i> with my life. I don't know these people at <i>all</i>, they might <i>not</i> want to meet me.</p> 

<p>WOO: <i>(After a pause:)</i> Darren, what you decide in the end is up to <i>you</i>. But I think you're being a bit too <i>hard</i> on yourself. At the least, perhaps they <i>should</i> have the right to know that you're <i>alive</i>. From what I have gathered, your birth family is <i>still</i> together and could very well be a very loving, <i>close-knit</i> family. They may want to reach <i>out</i> to you. You sound like you have <i>cold feet</i>, a feeling of fear of <i>rejection</i>, which I might add, is perfectly <i>normal</i> to have. <i>Imagine</i> what your birth parents may have felt when they thought you had <i>died</i>, the terrible <i>trauma</i>, the feeling of <i>helplessnes</i>. If they see you <i>now</i>, all of that might go <i>away</i>, to be replaced with <i>joy, delight, and relief</i>. Do you really want to <i>deny</i> them the opportunity to find out what <i>THEY</i> feel, to deny yourself the opportunity of what <i>YOU</i> feel when, or if, you see them?</p>


     <p>Darren stayed silent for a moment, narrowing his eyes at Woo, deep in thought, then he spoke in a determined tone.</p>


<p>DARREN: Okay, Woo, I've come <i>this</i> far, so I might as well hear you out.</p> 

<p>WOO: <i>(Grins:)</i> Excellent, Darren. Now--<i>(going back to the map:)</i> after what your birth parents thought of as a miscarriage, they moved to <i>Highland, Texas</i> about three weeks later. I suspect they wanted to leave what they thought were <i>terrible</i> memories of what happened in Dumas behind, as well as your birth mother getting an offer from the <i>Henderson law firm</i> there.</p> 

<p>DARREN: Pretty good <i>timing</i> that the offer came then, don't you think? Hmm--<i>Highland, Texas</i>--that place sounds <i>familiar--</i></p>

<p>WOO: I believe that was the place where <i>uranium</i> was found in the drinking water.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Snaps his fingers:)</i> Ah, yes, <i>now</i> I remember.</p>

<p>WOO: Anyway, while your birth mother joined the Henderson law firm, your birth father finally began to see the fruits of his consulting pay off, for he began to <i>make</i> money. They then had another child, to them the <i>first</i> one, a daughter who was named <i>Daria</i>. A year-and-a-half later, they had another daughter named <i>Quinn</i>. Daria is 17, and Quinn is now 15 1/2, but Quinn will be having her birthday in another <i>month</i> or so, while Daria's will be a few months after her sister.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Chuckles, a little excited:) Daria and Quinn</i>, eh? I have two <i>little</i> sisters! Do you have any <i>pictures</i> of my birth family, Woo?</p>

<p>WOO: Just a picture of your birth parents from their Middleton days that I scanned off of the Internet. Be warned--it's a <i>bit</i> fuzzy. <i>(Pulls out picture from file and gives it to Darren)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks hard at the picture, frowns at it, tries to focus:) "Bit"</i>, nothing, Woo--<i>"very"</i> is more like it. I can <i>barely</i> make out their faces.</p> 

<p>WOO: <i>(Shrugs while drinking coffee:)</i> Sorry, Darren. I'm trying to get more pictures of them, but it could take another day or two. I'll try to get them to you should you decide to meet your birth parents.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Puts up his hands in a gentle manner:)</i> That's okay, Woo. You've done so much for me so quickly, I <i>shouldn't</i> complain. So, what happened <i>after</i> Highland?</p> 

<p>WOO: Helen Morgendorffer got another offer at the law firm of--get this, I'm <i>serious</i>, now--<i>Vitale, Davis, Horowitz, Riodan, Schrecter, Schrecter, and Schrecter, (Darren looks at Woo as if to say, "Are you kidding?")</i> and Jake Morgendorffer took his business and their daughters <i>right behind</i> her to Lawndale, which is located--<i>(traces his finger on the map)</i> right <i>here. (Darren looks at the map, mildly surprised)</i></p> 

<p><i>(Note to reader: Yeah, I kind of wimped out on what state I thought Lawndale was in--I'll leave that to your imagination--but you can use your logic, and maybe figure it out!)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Lawndale's <i>here</i>? That's <i>not</i> too far from where I live. I can probably <i>drive</i> there to talk to them. I'll call them after I get back home and arrange some sort of <i>meeting</i>--provided that they <i>will</i> meet me. <i>(Drinks his coffee)</i></p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Raised eyebrow:)</i> Ah, so you <i>are</i> definitely going, Darren?</p>

<p>DARREN: I may as well, Woo. If my birth parents do talk to me and believe my story, we'll probably do some <i>DNA</i> tests to make <i>sure</i> that we're genetically related. <i>(Pauses:)</i> If they <i>don't</i> want to conduct them, <i>I</i> probably will ask for some--just to make <i>sure</i>.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Smirks, half-jokingly:)</i> Oh, <i>after</i> they hear your story, they may not even <i>want</i> to conduct DNA tests, even if you <i>do</i> ask--for they'll probably be very <i>angry</i> at Doctor Turley, and demand his <i>head</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Drinks the rest of his coffee:)</i> Then they'd better get in <i>line</i>, Woo. I'm <i>still</i> angry at what he did, and <i>how</i> he did it, <i>(grits his teeth:)</i> the <i>monster. (Narrows eyes while looking out the window)</i></p>


     <p>Woo silently stared at Darren for a moment, registering the sound of <i>hate</i> in Darren's voice, and began to quietly gather up the files. There was another knock at the door, and Carla, seemingly a bit more under <i>control</i> around Darren this time, came in.</p>


<p>CARLA: <i>(Fights herself to look only at Woo:)</i> Woo, there was a call that just came in--Doctor Turley <i>died</i> ten minutes ago. <i>(Darren glances at her and Woo with an unreadable look)</i> You wanted to know about Turley's <i>condition</i>.</p>

<p>WOO: Thank you, Carla. <i>(Carla hurriedly leaves without looking at Darren)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(A bit sarcastic, bitter:) Hooray, hooray, the monster is dead today. (Looks directly at Woo:)</i> I guess my birth parents <i>won't</i> be able to get his head, Woo--not unless they can make an <i>arrangement</i> with the <i>undertaker</i> over collecting Turley's body parts. <i>(Pauses, then adds quietly:)</i> I should at least send my <i>condolences</i> to Mrs. Turley. <i>(Pulls out a pen and notepad from his briefcase and begins to write a reminder note to himself)</i></p>

<p>WOO: I'll send some flowers to the funeral for the family--will you be going back <i>home</i> now, Darren? I suppose there is nothing <i>more</i> holding you here.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(In a quiet tone:)</i> Yeah, I'd better call the airport and get my jet ready to go back home. <i>(Pulls out a cell phone from briefcase)</i></p>

<p>WOO: Very well. I have the numbers of where both of your parents <i>work</i>, as well as their home in Lawndale in this folder, and a few other minor, <i>personal</i> things on your birth family. <i>(Gives Darren the folder:)</i> Here are some copies of the files on your family. <i>(Darren opens his briefcase and puts the folder in it)</i></p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(While on phone:)</i> Thanks, Woo, and I have something for <i>you</i>, as well--<i>(reaches into briefcase and gives a gold envelope to Woo:)</i> I believe this will <i>cover</i> everything, and <i>then</i> some.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Opens envelope, sees check amount, stunned:)</i> And <i>thank you</i>, Darren. <i>(Smiles:)</i> I hope you will have <i>further</i> use of my services in the future.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Still on phone:)</i> Actually, Woo, I <i>do</i>--I'll tell you about it while we go back to the hotel. Right now, I want to get back there and leave for home--<i>(pauses:)</i> yes, have the jet ready in an <i>hour</i>, thank you. <i>(Clicks off phone, puts it back into his briefcase, thought v.o.: I'll call aunt Millie on the plane ride back home, just so she won't worry--I did hang up on her pretty quickly last night--I'll tell her what Doctor Turley did when I get back home)</i></p>


     <p>Darren and Woo walked out of the conference room and into the reception area, where Carla was at her desk, typing at her computer keyboard. She stopped when she saw them.</p>


<p>WOO: We're leaving, Carla. Darren's going back East. <i>(Carla looks a bit disappointed)</i> I'm going to drive him back to the hotel and then to the airport--page me if our man <i>David</i> calls about any developments on the Snell case, other than that, I'm out.</p> 

<p>CARLA: Okay, Woo. <i>(Looks at Darren sadly, but smiling:)</i> Goodbye, Darren--I hope everything goes well with your birth parents.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smiles back:)</i> Actually, Carla, I plan on <i>meeting</i> them as soon as possible. Thank you and goodbye--it was nice meeting you. <i>(Shakes hands with her, which causes Carla to blush slightly, then leaves with Woo)</i></p>


     <p>Carla leaned from behind her desk to see Darren get in the rental car with Woo and drive off. She sighed <i>dreamily</i> for a second, then began to type again with a <i>melancholy</i> look on her face.</p>



<p><i>(Appleton Tower, New York City, about seven hours later in the executive conference room, 30th floor:)</i></p>


     <p>There were several Appleton executives, along with their assistants, sitting around a long, black marble rectangular table, all talking to each other. The room they were in was almost totally surrounded by tinted glass, which provided a rather panoramic and spectacular view of New York City's famous skyscrapers. William Appleton, followed closely by Benny and a secretary, walked into the room across its ivory-colored ceramic tile floor, and sat down at the table, with the secretary taking notes. Everyone grew quiet.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Completely in a serious business mode, looking down at a stack of papers in front of him:)</i> Good afternoon, everyone. This meeting is called to go over the current status of the conglomerate's divisional holdings for this quarter. <i>(Looks up:)</i> Clothing division, report.</p>

<p>CLOTHING DIVISION SPOKESWOMAN: I'm reporting a 10 percent increase in our Circa clothing line during the first quarter. It's the first increase in the <i>last</i> two quarters, I might add.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>Decent</i>, but shoot for <i>double</i> that next quarter. <i>(Clothing division chief looks miffed)</i> Technology division report.</p>

<p>TECHNOLOGY DIVISION SPOKESMAN: I'm <i>proud</i> to report a 15 percent increase in earnings during the first quarter, with the biggest gains in our personal computer market, particularly our <i>Sharpshooter</i> line of PC's.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: Good, but <i>not</i> good enough. Target an increase up to <i>25 percent</i> for the second quarter. <i>(Technology division chief looks stunned)</i> Food division report.</p>

<p>FOOD DIVISION SPOKESWOMAN: We've had a 22 percent increase in earnings during the first quarter--<i>(smirks before adding:) double</i> what Appleton had during the last quarter.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: Good, so I'll expect it to double <i>again</i> for the <i>next</i> quarter. <i>(Woman looks shocked, turns a bit pale)</i> Media division report.</p>

<p>MEDIA DIVISION SPOKESMAN: <i>(After a quick, uncomfortable glance at the food division chief:)</i> The media division's holdings were a bit--<i>down</i> by 2 percent--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Cuts him off, scowls slightly:) --Reason</i>?

<p>MEDIA DIVISION SPOKESMAN: <i>(Looking a little nervous:)</i> Our acquisition of <i>Tramell Press</i> last year cut into our profits. We haven't seen a return yet on our investment. <i>(Adds quickly:)</i> But of course, we <i>knew</i> that it would take a <i>little</i> time to turn it around--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Again cuts him off, giving a rather ominous look directly at the media division chief:)--If</i> there's no improvement in profits next quarter, then <i>something's</i> going to have to be <i>done</i>, don't you <i>think</i>?</p>

<p>MEDIA DIVISION SPOKESMAN: <i>(Looking a lot nervous now:)</i> O--oh, <i>yessir--definitely</i> something. In fact, I'm looking at <i>other</i> options right now--</p> 

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Smug smile:) --Good</i>. Energy division report.</p>

<p>ENERGY DIVISION SPOKESWOMAN: <i>(Giving a "He's got to be impressed by this" look on her face:)</i> We had a <i>50</i> percent increase in our coal-to-oil, electrical, nuclear, and garbage-burning energy plant profits for the first quarter, a large increase over the last quarter--almost <i>triple</i>.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(After a pause:)</i> I <i>suppose</i> that'll do at the moment. <i>(Energy division chief looks a little peeved)</i> I want you to concentrate on <i>selling</i> our two nuclear plants in the West, they're putting a <i>strain</i> on our garbage-burning profits. I want those plants <i>gone</i> by the <i>next</i> quarter, do you understand? <i>(Energy division chief is shocked, but instead of saying nothing, she responds)</i></p>

<p>ENERGY DIVISION SPOKESWOMAN: <i>(In a forceful manner:)</i> Mr. Appleton, we've <i>tried</i> selling those plants for the last <i>year</i>. Maybe we should sell at the <i>first</i> offer that's given to us. It may <i>not</i> be what we're <i>asking</i> for, but at least--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Cuts her off, looking a little menacing:)</i> --Are you suggesting that we take a <i>loss</i> on this? Oh no, I <i>don't</i> think so. If you <i>can't</i> do the job, then maybe we could find someone <i>else. (The energy division chief looks flustered for a moment, then nods curtly, William then smiles) Good</i>--now that's the <i>get-up-and-go attitude</i> we want at Appleton Industries, speaking of which--<i>(gets up:)</i> I declare this meeting <i>adjourned</i>--all opposed? <i>(No one says anything, looking uncomfortably at each other)</i> Very well, I'll see you all at next week's meeting. <i>(Leaves)</i></p>


     <p>William, after dismissing the secretary, went with Benny into the elevator at the end of the corridor. William pushed the button that would take both men to the roof where the helipad was.</p>
 

<p>BENNY: <i>(After a moment, hesitant:) Geez</i>, Boss--you were awfully <i>agressive</i> in there, even for <i>you</i>.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Looking ahead:)</i> You <i>have</i> to be like that, Benny, or they <i>won't</i> respect you.</p>

<p>BENNY: But, well--do you think that's <i>wise</i>? What if some of the division chiefs go to the Board of Directors to <i>complain</i>? If this gets back to <i>Darren</i>--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Pushing the stop button and simultaneously faces Benny, scowls, Benny cringes a bit:)</i> --It <i>won't</i>, do you hear? <i>(Calms down a bit:)</i> At least not for <i>now</i>. Remember, Benny, I have a <i>grace</i> period, here. The Board will cut me some <i>slack</i>, and I'm using the time to get the <i>message</i> out that William Appleton is <i>more</i> than just a <i>(snorts:) "temporary"</i> figurehead, that I'm determined to keep Appleton Industries <i>profitable</i>. If any of those <i>crybabies</i> go running to the Board, they'll look like they <i>can't</i> take the heat, making them look <i>bad</i> in front of the Board. I know the division chiefs have a lot of <i>pride</i>, for they'll go the <i>extra</i> mile to stay one step <i>ahead</i> of me, and <i>that</i> is the factor for the company to stay profitable. <i>(Smirks:)</i> In other words, I'm <i>motivating</i> them. <i>(Pushes the button to start the elevator again, changes subject:)</i> I called Millie about an <i>hour</i> ago, and she told me Darren's on his way back to the mansion with <i>good</i> news, which I'm hoping is about him meeting his birth family. That's why I wanted to end the divisional holdings meeting <i>early</i>. I plan to be there waiting <i>with</i> her to meet him. In the meantime, I want you to go over the Roeberson acquisition plan while I'm gone for ideas on how we'll proceed on it.</p> 

<p>BENNY: Okay, Boss--I hope everything goes well.</p>


     <p>Benny watched William go out to the waiting helicopter, and it took off to the Appleton mansion. By the time William's helicopter had gotten to the mansion, he had found out from the gardener that Darren had just gotten there. Anxious to see what Darren had to say, William <i>literally</i> jogged out to the service entrance on the side of the kitchen, nearly bowling over Claude and the chef, a small, portly man named <i>Henri</i>, who were carrying some groceries, in the process.</p>
 

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Nearly out of breath, frowns:) Blast it</i>, watch where you're going, Claude, Henri! <i>You</i> two almost ran <i>me</i> over! <i>(Rushes by)</i></p>

<p>CLAUDE: I'm <i>so</i> sorry, sir! <i>(Thought v.o.: Pompous ass!)</i></p> 

<p>HENRI: Pardon <i>me</i>, sir! <i>(Thought v.o.: Pompous ass!)</i></p>


     <p>William bolted to the study and practically threw open the doors, where he found Darren talking to Millie. Both looked at William, startled by his rather loud entrance.</p>


<p>MILLIE: <i>(Concerned:)</i> William, is <i>everything</i> all right?</p> 

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Gasping, leaning against the sofa:)</i> I-I'm <i>f-fine</i> you two, just-just let me catch my breath. Go-go on, Darren.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looking at William strangely:)</i> Er, I just got in, Uncle Will, and haven't started yet. Aunt Millie said that you wanted to be here---<i>(pauses:)</i> so we decided to <i>wait</i> for you. Since you're here, now, I'll tell you what I found out. <i>(Looks at Millie:)</i> You two better sit down, because the story I have to tell you is too <i>incredible</i> to be believed--</p>


     <p>The time passed by after Darren's stunning illegal adoption story and of his birth family, with Millie and William just about too shocked to say anything, save for a few questions. Darren was just finishing his story when both were finally coming out of their stupors.</p>
 

<p>DARREN: --And here I am. I'm planning to call the Morgendorffers after I rest up and talk to Curtis.</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Sniffling, holding back her tears, gets up to hug Darren:) My God</i>, Darren! How could Doctor Turley do somthing so--so <i>horrible</i>?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Quietly, looking down to Millie:)</i> I--don't know, Aunt Millie, but we can't change what's been done now. All I--<i>we</i>--can do is go on.</p> 

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Looking stunned, thought v.o.: <b>Damn</B>, and I thought <b>I</b> was ruthless! Too bad the good doctor is dead. I'd make him pay for <b>cursing</b> us with Darren--then again, I could've used someone like that to--oh, well:)</i> Darren is <i>right</i>, Millie--<i>all</i> we can do is go on--it's water under the bridge, now. <i>(Changes subject and tone, looks at Darren uneasily:)</i> Ah, Darren--are you planning to simply <i>meet</i> these Morgen<i>driffers</i>--</p>

<p>DARREN: --Morgend<i>ORFFERS</i>, Uncle Will--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: --<i>Morgendorffers</i>, Darren--right out of the <i>blue</i>? I mean, what do we <i>really</i> know about these people? You said that your birth mother is a <i>lawyer. (Rolls his eyes:)</i> Heaven <i>knows</i> what <i>that</i> would mean.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Narrows his eyes:)</i> What would <i>what</i> mean, Uncle Will?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Sounding urgent:)</i> She could use legal <i>tactics</i> to get you to give at least <i>some</i> of your money to <i>them. (Both Darren and Millie look stunned) Think</i> about it for a second, okay? Once your birth family finds out how <i>rich</i> you are, your birth mother could say that your--<i>parents</i>--used <i>illegal</i> means to adopt you--<i>(Darren looks like he's about to say something, but William holds up his hands to cut him off:)</i> and <i>we</i> know <i>nothing</i> was done wrong, but <i>how</i> would it <i>look</i>? <i>$50,000</i>? It's possible that <i>any</i> jury in the country could say that your birth family is <i>entitled</i> to a <i>share</i> of your wealth based on <i>that</i> alone, police report or no. Besides, why not get to know your birth family--<i>without</i> the <i>"money factor"</i> coming into play, at least until you get to know them <i>well</i>?</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Confused:) Without</i> the <i>"money factor"</i>, William? Just <i>what</i> are you getting at?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Isn't it <i>obvious</i>, Millie? I'm saying that Darren should <i>pretend</i> he's someone <i>else</i> when he meets these people, you know, a <i>cover</i>. I mean, don't let the <i>wealth</i> of Darren get in the <i>way</i> of knowing his birth family. Why have it as a <i>distraction</i> at the very <i>beginning</i>?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(In a sarcastic tone:) You</i> think wealth is a <i>distraction</i>, Uncle Will? <i>(Rolls eyes, while William slightly scowls:) Please</i>. Look, I don't think it's a good idea to <i>lie</i> to these people, I don't want to be <i>like</i> Turley. I want to establish some sort of <i>trust</i>, some sort of <i>bond</i> with my birth family if they want to meet me--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Sneers:)</i> --Oh, I'm <i>sure</i> once these people <i>see</i> your wealth, they'll <i>want</i> to meet you and establish this <i>"bond"</i> and <i>"trust"</i> that you seem so <i>sure</i> about. Besides, in case you don't know, you're <i>nothing</i> like Turley, compared to <i>what</i> he did. <i>(Sighs:)</i> All I'm saying is if you meet your birth family, do you <i>really</i> believe that the wealth issue <i>won't</i> be a problem, Darren? Sure, your birth family <i>could</i> be honest, but even still, the <i>amount</i> of money that you have is akin to, say, a <i>tornado</i> coming up the road <i>towards</i> you. Do you simply <i>ignore</i> it, and keep going about your business, or do you look for <i>shelter</i>? <i>(Pauses, waits to see if his reasoning is sinking in:)</i> To <i>me</i>, the answer is <i>clear</i>. At least meet me <i>halfway</i> here. I'm not saying you should <i>out-and-out lie</i> to these people, I'm just saying that you should--well--<i>skew</i> the truth a bit, until you know them well enough to tell the <i>whole</i> truth to them, that's all.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Along with Millie has a skeptical look:) "Skew"</i> the truth--and just <i>how</i> do I do that?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: It's <i>simple</i>, Darren--let's take your <i>name</i> for example. You can keep <i>"Darren"</i>, because the public knows you by your first name <i>"Arthur"</i> while you of course don't use it, but add something that would <i>"cover"</i> your <i>last</i> name--<i>(gets an idea:)</i> ah, of course! <i>"Cover-ton"</i>! <i>Darren Coverton</i>!

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Rolls her eyes, chuckles:) "Darren Coverton"</i>? William, you've gone--<i>coo-coo</i>! <i>(Smirks:)</i> How about if they ask who the names of his <i>parents</i> were?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Slight frown:)</i> Millie, Darren can <i>make up</i> a name for them--<i>(pauses:)</i> or maybe <i>not</i>. How about <i>"Walter"</i> and <i>"Grace"</i>? <i>Technically</i>, he won't be lying if he uses <i>those</i> names.</p>

<p>DARREN: My parent's <i>middle</i> names? <i>(Snickers:)</i> What about what their <i>jobs</i> were?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: You could say that your father was a <i>businessman</i>--say, <i>computers</i>. Your father started our computer business first, remember, and then <i>diversified</i> into other branches. Just say he worked in computers, that'll <i>pass</i>--and <i>technically</i>--</p>

<p>DARREN: --<i>Technically</i>, it wouldn't be a lie, Uncle Will--okay, what about my <i>mother</i>?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: For her, you could say she worked in <i>fashion</i>--this is also <i>true</i>. She was the <i>creator</i> and <i>head</i> of the clothing division. Just say that she did something <i>similar</i> to that, because--</p>

<p>DARREN & MILLIE: --<i>"Technically"</i> it's true.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: Exactly! Be <i>creative</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: What about my <i>education</i>? Eastward is a really <i>difficult</i> school to get into academically, and unless one has a <i>lot</i> of money <i>and</i> brains, it's nearly <i>impossible</i> to enroll there.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: Ah, <i>here</i> you can simply say <i>exactly</i> that you go to Eastward. There's nothing <i>wrong</i> with saying you're smart enough to go there, which you <i>are</i>, in fact. As for the <i>money</i> angle, just say your parents could <i>afford</i> it, which of course, <i>is</i> true. Say that your parents were <i>upper middle-class</i>--which is the <i>same</i> as your birth family. The only difference here is that your birth family doesn't know <i>how</i> rich you <i>really</i> are--at least not <i>yet</i>.</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Mocking tone:)</i> What about the story <i>behind</i> Darren's adoption? Should he be <i>"creative"</i> and <i>"technical"</i> about <i>that</i>, too?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Looking exasperated:)</i> Of course <i>not</i>, Millie! Just <i>change</i> the names of his parents! He can tell the <i>entire</i> truth about that, save for the <i>money</i> he gave to Mrs. Turley. He could even talk about the $50,000 <i>fee</i> that his parents paid. He could say that his parents were wanting a baby, which is <i>true</i>, and that the Barnes Adoption Agency offered to give them one, and that his parents <i>didn't</i> know about what Turley did to get them Darren, which is <i>true</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(In a solemn tone:)</i> --And what if they ask about <i>how</i> my parents <i>died</i>, Uncle Will?</p>


     <p>William grew a little <i>pale</i> over this, but quickly recovered.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: <i>(In a faux noble tone:)</i> --That they were killed in an <i>accident</i>, and that you <i>don't</i> want to talk about it. That's <i>true</i> enough, right? If your birth family wants to establish this--<i>"trust"</i>, and <i>"bond"</i> as you say that they might, they <i>won't</i> press you on the matter out of respect for your <i>feelings</i>, and because they'd be so <i>glad</i> to see you.</p>
 

     <p>Darren stared at William for a moment out of stunned disbelief, contemplating what his uncle had said, then looked at his aunt.</p>


<p>DARREN: What do <i>you</i> think about all of this, Aunt Millie?</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Looking at William, uncertain:)</i> I--<i>don't</i> know, Darren. Your uncle seems to have made a--<i>convincing</i> argument. <i>(Darren looks a bit surprised at this)</i> It's possible these people you may meet could be--<i>dishonest</i>, I--really couldn't say for sure. <i>(Looks off, deep in thought)</i></p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Sensing an opening:) Exactly</i> my point, Darren--we <i>don't</i> know. Why not go <i>slow</i> on this and take your <i>time</i>? You know <i>who</i> they are and <i>where</i> they live, so get to know <i>them</i> and let them get to know <i>you</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Still with an unsure look:)</i> Well, maybe I should talk to <i>Curtis</i> and see what <i>he</i> thinks about this--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(A little alarmed:) --Curtis</i>? No offense, but <i>you're</i> the one going through this, <i>not</i> your friend. <i>(In a faux pacifying tone:)</i> Sure, he <i>could</i> say to tell the <i>whole</i> truth to these Morgen<i>daffers</i>--</p>

<p>DARREN: --Morgen<i>DORFFERS</i>, Uncle Will--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Rolls his eyes:) --Morgendorffers</i>, Darren--but what if Curtis turns out to be <i>wrong</i> if he tells you this, and things go <i>awry</i> with your birth family? Your friendship could <i>suffer</i> because of it. <i>(Voice gets low, faux deep concern tone:)</i> I certainly don't know your friend like <i>you</i> do, but with everything you've gone through these past few weeks, my boy, do you <i>want</i> to take the chance of not only losing <i>Stephanie</i> and your <i>parents</i>, but your <i>birth family</i> and <i>Curtis</i>, too? My <i>God</i>, man, how much can one person <i>take</i>? I think you could tell him <i>after</i> you meet your birth parents, at least. <i>(Hesitates:)</i> Just--just <i>consider</i> what I said, and if you <i>still</i> want to tell Curtis, then by all means--<i>(dramatic pause, in a faux pained look to make Darren feel a little guilty:) do so. (Looks at watch:)</i> I've got to go back to work, you two. <i>(Looks at Darren:)</i> Good luck, nephew--I'll call tonight to see what you've decided. <i>(Pats him on the back, and leaves with a dramatic stride)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(After watching William leave, a bit tentative to his aunt:)</i> Aunt Millie, I'm going up to my room and rest for awhile--I've got some <i>serious</i> thinking to do. <i>(Leaves the study)</i></p>

<p>MILLIE: Okay, Darren--have a good sleep. <i>(Thought v.o.: Why couldn't I say anything more? Could William actually be right? Oh, God, please let Darren get to know these "Morgendorffers", and that they're good, honest people who can accept him. I--don't know what could happen to his sanity if they don't.)</i></p>



<p><i>(The Morgendorffer residence, about an hour later:)</i></p>



     <p>The Morgendorffers were sitting around the kitchen table having their customary lasagna dinner while discussing the option of going to the beach or the mountains. Daria stared forward wordlessly, secretly wishing that a <i>meteor</i> from outer space could <i>destroy</i> Jake's Lexus, Helen's SUV, the mountains, and the beach all at the <i>same</i> time so they could go nowhere. As she chewed her food, she watched the others with her usual expressionless detachment, slightly amused by Quinn's standard ranting and raving over the possibilities of meeting boys in either place, and what she should wear when she does. Helen was controlling the conversation as to where they'd go, <i>naturally</i>, and Jake was ocasionally grunting in agreement with Helen while reading the newspaper. <i>Par for the course</i>. It became <i>obvious</i> to Daria that her boredom was <i>defeating</i> her relaxation, and she even briefly wished that school was <i>still</i> in session so she could <i>do</i> something. Fortunately, that rather <i>idiotic</i> and <i>mundane</i> thought came into her head and went right on <i>out</i>.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Thought v.o.: Come on, got to keep my sanity--must--stay--sane--)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Finishing up her reasoning:)</i> --And <i>that's</i> why we should go to the <i>beach. (Cuts her eyes to Daria:)</i> What do <i>you</i> think, Daria, and don't go into your "Why we should go to both places speech" <i>again</i>, young lady.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Before Daria can speak:)</i> Mom, you <i>know</i> that Daria's not gonna care <i>either</i> way. She doesn't care if we don't go <i>anyplace. (Sneers at her:) Right</i>, Daria?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Well, Quinn--<i>you</i> can go to <i>h--</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>--Daria</i>! <i>(The cell phone sitting on the kitchen table begins to ring, Helen answers it in her falsetto voice:) Hellooo</i>? Oh, <i>Jane</i>! How are you? <i>(Pauses:)</i> You <i>are</i>? Good! How is <i>Amanda</i>? <i>(Pauses:)</i> She <i>is</i>? Good! <i>(Casts a quick glare at Daria:)</i> Your <i>timing</i> couldn't have been <i>better</i>, dear. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Yes, here she is. <i>(Gives phone to Daria, who promptly gets up and goes into the living room, sits on the middle couch)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: Hello, <i>stranger. Who</i> did my mom <i>say</i> you were again?</p>

<p>JANE: Okay, okay! I know I haven't called in a little over a <i>week</i>, so <i>sue</i> me.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:) Careful</i>, my mom's a <i>lawyer</i>. I might just take you <i>up</i> on that. <i>(Pauses:)</i> So what's up? You and your mom have decided to become <i>hermits</i>? If you have, I will come to seek out and <i>destroy</i> you for trying to <i>muscle</i> in on my <i>ultimate fantasy</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Snickers:) Gee</i>, and here I thought your "ultimate fantasy" was <i>licking</i> the whipped cream off of <i>Trent's naked body</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Blushes slightly at the thought:)</i> Nope, <i>that</i> one's between you <i>and</i> Tom. Speaking of which--<i>(reaches for paper in her pocket Tom gave her:)</i> Tom says he wants you to call him about 8:00 p.m. He said that his phone's answering machine was broken, so <i>that's</i> why you haven't been able to call him, and that his car broke down on his way to see you. That's why he wasn't at your house or the airport.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Sounding exasperated:) Geez</i>--he <i>still</i> hasn't fixed that <i>crappy</i> answering machine yet? Great, that's just <i>great</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Raised eyebrow:)</i> Say, you <i>okay</i>? You sound a little <i>annoyed</i> with Tom.</p>

<p>JANE: Well--<i>(pauses:)</i> it's just that he seems to have taken a hell of a lot of time to <i>fix</i> a <i>lot</i> of things recently.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Narrows her eyes:)</i> What do you mean, <i>"fix"</i>? Is <i>that</i> what you meant when you said, <i>"Another moment in a long line of--"</i> when you were packing to leave in your room last week to me?</p>

<p>JANE: --Yeah, I guess. Think about it--our relationship, his car, the answering machine. It seems like one <i>feeds</i> on the other. I'm beginning to wonder about whether <i>I</i> want to fix how we <i>feel</i> about each other.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sounding concerned:)</i> Hey, <i>whoa</i>. Maybe you should hear <i>Tom's</i> side out before you consider that. He was <i>really</i> worried that he couldn't get to see you off.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Quiet tone:)</i> I guess. <i>(Chuckling sound:)</i> You know, I can't believe <i>you're</i> speaking up for <i>Tom</i> now. I remember how you felt about him cutting into our <i>time</i> together.</p>

<p><i>(Note to reader: See "Jane's Addition" and "Partner's Complaint" about Daria's attitude over Tom and Jane being together)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Uncomfortable now:)</i> Well, um--Tom's--<i>okay</i>. I realized how much of a <i>jerk</i> I was being when I treated him like a <i>plague</i>. You seemed--<i>happy</i> with him, so I had to eventually <i>accept</i> him being there.</p> 

<p>JANE: <i>Umm-hmm</i>. Listen, I'm calling from a guest room in a house on the Hopi Native American Resevation in Arizona. My mom and I have been staying with some people she knows, and we've been in the <i>desert</i> all of this time, getting in <i>"touch with nature"</i>. Let me give you a number to call me, and the time you can call--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:)</i> --Gosh, <i>that</i> sounds awfully <i>familiar</i>. Go ahead, I have a pen and a pad.</p>

<p>JANE: Okay--it's area code <i>(602) 555-1890</i>. Call after 11:00 p.m. D.S.T., your time zone.</p>

<p>DARIA: Got it. <i>(Phone rings over the line:)</i> Hang on--I have another call.</p>

<p>JANE: Hey, I gotta go, anyway. <i>(Pauses:)</i> I'll call Tom at the time you gave me. Later.</p>

<p>DARIA: Okey-dokey. <i>(Clicks off phone, then back on:)</i> Hello?</p>

<p>VOICE: <i>(Tentatively:)</i> Hello, is a--<i>Helen</i> or a <i>Jake Morgendorffer</i> there?</p>

<p>DARIA: Both of them are here at the <i>ranch</i>. Take your pick.</p>

<p>VOICE: <i>(Slight chuckle:)</i> Ah, Helen Morgendorffer, please.</p>

<p>DARIA: You have chosen one Helen Morgendorrfer, sir. Now, to make the <i>other</i> half of this message officially complete, <i>whom</i> may I ask is calling?</p>

<p>VOICE: <i>(Pause:)</i> Er--<i>Darren Coverton</i>, miss, and <i>you're</i>--?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>--Out of here. (Covers phone, raises voice, smirks:)</i> Mom? One of your <i>clients</i> beckons, or it's one of those pesky <i>telemarketers</i>. His name is a <i>"Darren Coverton". (Helen comes up and takes the phone, while Daria goes back to the kitchen)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(In her "get tough" voice:)</i> Now see <i>here</i>, Mr. Coverton, we're <i>not</i> interested in <i>any</i> product you're selling--</p>

<p>DARREN: --Uh, no ma'am. I'm not selling <i>anything</i>. I'm--</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Now in her falsetto "What can I do for you?" voice:)--Ooooh</i>, you're a <i>client</i>, then. All right, young man, I can--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(A bit more forcefully:)</i> --No ma'am, I'm <i>not</i> a client. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Is this <i>really</i> the <i>Morgendorffer</i> residence? Maybe I've called the <i>wrong</i> number.</p>

<p>HELEN: Young man, I can <i>assure</i> you that this <i>is</i> the Morgendorffer home--<i>wait a minute</i>--if you're <i>not</i> a telemarketer or a client, <i>who</i> are you?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Sighs:)</i> That's what I've been <i>trying</i> to tell you, ma'am, I'm <i>neither. (Gets into a lower voice:)</i> I--I would like to talk to you and your husband about something that happened about <i>twenty</i> years ago, something that you two probably would rather <i>forget</i>.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Now looking uneasy, eyes narrowing:) "Something"</i>, Mr. Coverton? What do you mean, <i>"something"</i>?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Hesitates:)</i> I'm talking about a <i>baby</i> that you lost twenty years ago, Mrs. Morgendorffer.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Now stunned:)</i> W-What about my <i>baby</i>? M--my baby is <i>dead</i>! <i>(Pauses, is starting to become angry:)</i> A-are you some sort of--of an <i>extortionist</i> or something? Because if you <i>are</i>, young man--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(In a pacifying tone:)</i> --No, ma'am, I'm not. Just--<i>please</i> listen to me. <i>(Pauses:)</i> You may want to <i>sit down</i> before you hear this--</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Sitting down slowly, trying to stay calm:)</i> All right, young man, I'm sitting down. Now what do you want to tell me about my baby?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Dramatic pause:)</i> That your baby did <i>not</i> die, Mrs. Morgendorffer. I know that this may sound <i>crazy</i> to you, but I'm--<i>begging</i> you to believe me when I say--<i>I'm</i> that baby.</p>


     <p>Helen turned pale, and stared forward in space with her mouth agape.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Quietly after a polite moment of silence:)</i> Mrs. Morgendorffer, are you <i>there</i>--?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Coming out of her stupor, speaking softly:)</i> I-I'm <i>here</i>, young man--<i>D-Darren. H-how</i> is this possible? My husband and I saw <i>your</i>--the baby's body--</p> 

<p>DARREN: --Mrs. Morgendorffer, I'd like to tell you and your husband the <i>whole</i> story. I know this has to be an <i>absolute shock</i> to you, just as it was for <i>me</i>. If you have your <i>doubts</i>, I can't say that I can <i>blame</i> you. Is--is there any <i>place</i> you and your husband would feel <i>comfortable</i> talking to me about it? It doesn't have to be at your home. <i>(Pauses:)</i> I--I'd really like to <i>meet</i> you both.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Trying not to faint, considers:)</i> Y-yes, Darren--there <i>is</i> a place we can meet--have you heard of a <i>Cranberry Commons</i> shopping mall here in Lawndale?</p>

<p>DARREN: No, ma'am, I haven't, but I know <i>where</i> Lawndale is, and I have a map of your area, so it shouldn't be too hard to find. What day and time do you want to meet?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Pauses, still fighting the urge not to faint:)</i> C-can you meet us <i>tomorrow</i> at 5:00 p.m. in the f-food court area?</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(After a moment:)</i> I can be there, ma'am. <i>(Pauses:)</i> See you then. <i>(Hangs up.)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Realizes something:) Wait</i>! How will we <i>know</i> you when we see--<i>damn</i>! <i>(Clicks off cell phone, gets up quietly, takes a deep breath, and then:) Jake</i>!
Jake! Get the hell in here <i>right</i> now!</p>
