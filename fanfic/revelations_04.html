     <p><i>(To the reader: I've decided to skip the recap. I figured that if you've come this far, you're interested enough to go on, and basically know what's happening--in other words, read it like a <b>book</b>!. Now, on with the story.)</i></p>




<p>Chapter 4 - Contact</p>




     <p>Jake nearly <i>fell</i> out of his chair in the kitchen when he heard Helen's <i>bellowing</i>, whereas Quinn nearly <i>choked</i> on her skim milk. Daria raised an eyebrow and <i>smirked</i> just as she was about to finish eating.</p>

<p>DARIA: Looks like you're <i>busted</i>, Dad.</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(In his usual confused state, looking with a sense of dread at the living room:)</i> But <i>what</i> did I <i>do</i>, Daria? You and Quinn saw me sitting here at the table, reading the paper, and doing <i>nothing</i>!</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Smirks, too:)</i> I don't what's going on, Daddy, but mom sounds like she's really ready to <i>explode</i>! You didn't call that <i>porno</i> service again, did you, and they're trying to make you <i>pay</i> the bill?</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(In a tizzy now:)</i> It was an <i>accident</i>, sweetie! I was trying to call a client, and his number was <i>one</i> number off from that service! I can get the phone bill and <i>prove</i> it--</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(From the living room again:) JAKE</i>! Jake Morgendorffer! Get in here <i>right</i> now!</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Looking sad, resigned to his fate:) Coming</i>, dear! <i>(Gets up slowly from the table and drags himself into the living room)</i></p>


     <p>Jake walked into the living room and was surprised to see Helen sitting on the couch <i>crying</i> softly. He quickly came up to her and sat down beside her, putting his arm around his wife.</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(In a "Please don't kill me" tone:)</i> Honey, I'm <i>sorry</i> about that porno call, but they're <i>wrong</i> about the charging fee! <i>(Begins to get into his "Raging at the Old Man" tone, narrows his eyes:)</i> A guy makes a <i>simple</i> mistake by calling the wrong number, and he <i>keeps</i> paying for it! Just like my <i>Old Man</i>! When <i>I</i> made a mistake, he <i>never</i> let me forget it! I kept <i>on</i> paying--<i>on and on, and--</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> Jake, will you get a <i>grip</i>? I'm <i>not</i> talking about that <i>stupid</i> pornography service call! I just received a phone call from someone who says they're--<i>(looks up to see that Daria and Quinn are standing in the doorway watching her:)</i> they're--wanting to get a--<i>gift</i> for someone we <i>both</i> know! Yes, that's it! A gift! <i>(Grabs Jake's hand:)</i> Come on, honey and <i>help</i> me find one for the person we both know! We'll be back a little later, girls. <i>(Keeps cell phone in her hand, gets keys off counter and pulls Jake out of the front door, Jake pulls front door, slamming it)</i></p>

     <p>Daria and Quinn stared at each other for a moment, then sat down on the middle living room couch.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(While counting on her fingers:)</i> Let's go over the <i>clues</i>, Quinn: (1) Someone named <i>"Darren Coverton"</i> calls here and chooses to talk to mom. (2) Mom talks to this guy and <i>freaks</i> out. (3) Mom calls dad and is about to tell him what's up when she <i>sees</i> us, and suddenly <i>dreams up</i> a <i>lame</i> excuse about getting a <i>"gift"</i> for someone to <i>leave</i> you and me behind, and takes dad <i>with</i> her. Conclusion: something <i>big</i> is <i>definitely</i> going down.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Stares at Daria for a second, then gasps, wide-eyed:) Of course</i>, Daria! That's <i>it</i>! Don't you <i>see</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Confused look on her otherwise passive face:)</i> Um--see <i>what</i>, Quinn?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(In her "duh" tone:)</i> Isn't it <i>obvious</i>? They're gonna get a <i>birthday</i> gift for <i>me</i>! Look at <i>my</i> clues: <i>(Counts on <b>her</b> fingers:)</i> (1) My birthday is in <i>two</i> months. (2) Mom and dad <i>said</i> they <i>both</i> know the person--well, they both know <i>me</i>. (3) Obviously, mom and dad wanted to get out of here as <i>fast</i> as they could so we wouldn't know <i>what</i> gift they were getting me, probably telling this <i>"Darren"</i> fellow, who works at some <i>clothing shop or another</i>--probably <i>Cashman's</i>, 'cause mom an' dad <i>know</i> that it is the <i>only</i> place I'd shop for fashion in Lawndale. <i>(Ponders by looking in the air for a moment:)</i> Gee, maybe I should tell them <i>what</i> I want.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> Quinn, didn't you see how <i>upset</i> mom was? I <i>doubt</i> that she'd be like that over a gift for <i>you--(shrugs, then in an off-handed remark:)</i> unless it was <i>expensive</i>, of course. <i>(Suddenly realizes what she just said and slaps her forehead because she knows what Quinn's going to say)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Really excited now:) EEEEE</i>! That's <i>it</i>, Daria! A gift that costs a <i>lot</i> of money! I gotta tell the <i>Fashion Club</i>! <i>(Grabs the other cell phone from the center couch, runs upstairs)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: Quinn, I was just--<i>(thought v.o.: It's my own damn fault for helping to put that idea in her head--of course, there's plenty of room <b>in</b> her head to put something into, like an empty, barren landscape.) (Goes back into kitchen)</i></p>




<p><i>(Scene changes to the Appleton estate:)</i></p>



     <p>Darren came down the stairs. He joined his aunt, who was reading the newspaper on the couch, in the study.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(While sitting down in a chair beside the couch:)</i> I made the call to my birth parents, and ended up talking to my birth mother.</p>  

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Looks up from her newspaper:)</i> You--<i>talked</i> to her, Darren? What--<i>what</i> did you <i>say</i>?</p> 

<p>DARREN: I told her that I was her <i>son</i>, and that I was <i>alive</i>.</p>

<p>MILLIE: What did <i>she</i> say?</p> 

<p>DARREN: Naturally, she was <i>stunned</i>. I don't know if she <i>believed</i> me--not that I could <i>blame</i> her--but after a moment, she said she'd <i>agree</i> to meet me, along with her husband--my birth <i>father</i>.</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Puts aside her newspaper:)</i> They <i>agreed</i> to meet you? Where?</p>

<p>DARREN: In Lawndale, at a mall called <i>Cranberry Commons</i> at 5:00 tomorrow evening. I've just got off the phone with one of those rental car places. I'll get the car <i>brought</i> to the mansion tomorrow morning, take my bag with me, and drive there. I'll look over the Internet on my computer and see what hotels are in the area that I can stay at.</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Narrows her eyes slightly:)</i> I see--and what <i>name</i> did you use?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Pauses:)</i> Well, for the hotel and the car, it'll be <i>Darren Appleton</i>. In the Morgendorffer's case, <i>Darren Coverton. (Raises eyebrow:)</i> Is there a <i>problem</i> with that? <i>You</i> didn't raise too much of an <i>objection</i> when uncle Will first brought it up.</p>

<p>MILLIE: You're right, I didn't at <i>first</i>, but thinking about it <i>now</i>, are you really <i>comfortable</i> with following your <i>uncle's</i> advice about using this "Coverton" last name ruse and cover story?  I thought you were going to talk to <i>Curtis</i> first.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Sighs:)</i> I tried to talk to Curtis <i>before</i> calling the Morgendorffers, Aunt Millie, but his grandmother said he was out with Lena, and <i>no</i>, I'm <i>not</i> comfortable with taking uncle Will's advice. As much as I <i>hate</i> to admit it, though, he's <i>right</i>. I <i>don't</i> know these Morgendorffers, and I want to <i>get</i> to know them <i>without</i> the money question coming into play. <i>(Chuckles, looks at watch:)</i> Hmm--maybe I need to turn in <i>early</i> because I probably <i>won't</i> be able to sleep tonight, and I'm <i>so</i> excited, I'll need the <i>extra</i> hours to make up for all of my <i>expected</i> tossing and turning.</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(In a thoughtful tone:)</i> You seem really <i>eager</i> to want to know these Morgendorffers, Darren, for <i>obvious</i> reasons, of course, but--<i>(pauses:)</i> what if they're <i>not</i> the people you <i>expect</i> for them to be, and I'm <i>not</i> talking about the money question.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Perplexed frown on his face:) What</i> do you mean, Aunt Millie?</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Hesitates:)</i> I mean, maybe with these Morgendorffers, you're looking perhaps for a <i>new</i> family? Maybe someone to <i>replace</i> your <i>lost</i> family?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Shocked:) How</i> can you <i>say</i> that, Aunt Millie? My parents--</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Quietly cuts him off:) --Adopted</i> parents, Darren.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Now angry:) What</i> do you mean by <i>that</i>, Aunt Millie? They're <i>not</i> my adopted parents--to me, they <i>are</i> my <i>real</i> parents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <i>(Grows solemn, looks away:)</i> I just want to meet the people who gave me <i>birth</i>. They didn't <i>have</i> the chance to <i>raise</i> me, and I felt that I <i>owed</i> them the chance to meet me, the son they <i>thought</i> was <i>dead</i>.</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Reaches over and holds Darren's hand:)</i> Darren, I'm--<i>sorry</i> for saying that. It's just that you're so <i>set</i> on meeting them, and I'm afraid that you're building up your expectations too <i>high</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: Too <i>high</i>, Aunt Millie?</p>

<p>MILLIE: Meeting the Morgendorffers may not be everything you <i>want</i> it to be. They might not <i>take</i> to you as quickly as you'd like, Darren.</p>

<p>DARREN: I'm being <i>realistic</i>, Aunt Millie. Let's face it, things might turn out <i>badly</i>, but I can <i>accept</i> that. After what's happened to me recently, I think I can accept <i>anything. (Pauses:)</i> But that's not the <i>real</i> issue here, is it, Aunt Millie?</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Chuckles softly:)</i> Now what do <i>you</i> mean, Darren?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looking at her completely seriously:)</i> You're <i>afraid</i> you might <i>lose</i> me to the Morgendorffers, aren't you?</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Stunned:) What</i>? No, Darren, that's <i>not</i> true! I--I--<i>(begins to sob softly, then almost in a whisper:) yes</i>. I wanted to believe that meeting the Morgendorffers and getting along with them would be <i>good</i> for you, but, well, you seem so <i>determined</i> to see them--<i>(looks away)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Gets up and goes over to the couch, embracing her:)</i>--Aunt Millie, I told you <i>before</i>, I'm an <i>Appleton</i>, and that <i>won't</i> change. <i>(Smiles:)</i> You're <i>stuck</i> with me as your nephew, so get over it.</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Wipes her tears, and now smiles:)</i> I'm going to <i>hold</i> you to that, nephew.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Grins:)</i> Fair enough. <i>(Takes a deep breath:)</i> Okay --now, I'm going to hold <i>you</i> to something.</p>

<p>MILLIE: Oh, and what's that?</p> 

<p>DARREN: I want you to get <i>away</i> from the mansion for awhile, Aunt Millie. I've been thinking of <i>me</i> these last few days, and I want to think of <i>you</i> now. Why don't you go to <i>Europe</i>? You've been talking about it since last year. This is the <i>perfect</i> time to go, and I'm not taking "no" for an answer.</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Is about to say something, thinks the better of it:)</i> You're a <i>hard</i> taskmaster, nephew.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(In a faux noble tone, with his hand on his chest in a dramatic gesture:)</i> I try, Auntie, I try.</p>

<p>MILLIE: I'll make some calls, and leave after I've heard from your meeting with the Morgendorffers, I promise.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Grins:)</i> Going to <i>take</i> someone, Auntie, or are you going to plan a mysterious <i>rendezvous</i> in Europe?</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Mock glare:) Darren</i>! You know I haven't been with anyone seriously since my <i>divorce</i>!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Well, then, don't you think it's <i>time</i> you did?</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Now with her own smirk:) Look</i> who's talking.</p>

     <p>Darren grew pale for a second, then talked in a quiet voice.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Pained look on his face:)</i> I'm <i>still</i> not over Stephanie, yet, Aunt Millie. I <i>know</i> I've got to move on, but I can't just yet.</p>

<p>MILLIE: Oh, Darren, I <i>didn't</i> mean to--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Gets up:)</i> --It's okay, Auntie. I'm going to check on the computer, and then go to bed. I want to get up early enough to <i>jog</i>--I haven't done that in a few days, and I want to get back in the <i>regimen</i> again, and then get ready to go. I haven't unpacked too many clothes since I returned, so I'll just take those with me. <i>(Kisses aunt on cheek:)</i> I'll see you tomorrow morning, Aunt Millie.</p>

<p>MILLIE: <i>(Sighs:)</i> I'll call William and tell him what you've decided, Darren.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Okay, Auntie. He'll probably be <i>pleased</i> with my decision. <i>(Leaves study)</i></p>


<p><i>(Somewhere in Lawndale, in Helen's red SUV, in an empty parking lot)</i></p>


     <p>Jake sat in the passenger seat, stunned. Helen had told him of the call, and what it was about.</p> 

<p>JAKE: Honey, are you <i>sure</i> about this? I mean, <i>how</i> do we know if this guy is on the <i>level</i>?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Rolls her eyes:) Of course</i> we don't know, Jake! <i>Why</i> do you think I picked <I>Cranberry Commons</I> as the place to <i>meet</i> him? This --<i>Darren</i> wouldn't <i>dare</i> try anything in the open! <i>(Voice grows low:)</i> But, he did seem like such a <i>nice</i> and <i>mannerable</i> young man.</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Eyes light up:)</i> Helen, it just <i>occurred</i> to me--<i>what</i> do we tell the girls?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Narrows eyes:)</i> We'll tell them <i>nothing</i> for the moment, Jake--at least not until we know what <i>exactly</i> is going on here. <i>(Reaches for cell phone:)</i> I'm going to make a call to a place I'd rather <i>not</i> want to remember--<i>(shudders, grimace on her face:) Dumas.</i></p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Looks up to remember:) Dumas</i>--where we lived for awhile? Why, honey?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(While dialing 411 to get number and frowning:)</i> I want to talk to that <i>bastard</i> of a doctor, <i>Turley</i>. He handled the miscarriage, and we <i>couldn't</i> sue him because of that <i>quick</i> malpractice investigation that cleared him of any wrongdoing. I'm wondering if he isn't <i>up</i> to something. <i>(Glares into space:)</i> There was something <i>shady</i> about him, Jake, don't ask me to explain. I mean, the <i>only</i> reason why we went to his house that night was because we were too far from the hospital, and we'd heard about him being an obstetrician from our neighbors. <i>(Talks on phone:)</i> Yes, I'd like the number of a Doctor Hugo Turley in a town named Dumas, in California. Thank you.</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Now following his wife's lead, and getting angry:) Yeah</i>! That--that <i>sadist</i>! <i>(Grows suddenly sad, lowers head:)</i> Aw, Helen --do you <i>really</i> want to go through <i>this</i> again? I mean, the police said <i>nothing</i> was done wrong.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(While still on phone:)</i> Jake, you're <i>not</i> to blame for what happened that night! We've gone over this already!</p>

<p>JAKE: I know, dear, but--</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Cuts him off:)</i> --Not <i>now</i>, dear--yes? <i>What</i>!? <i>(Pause:)</i> Are you <i>sure</i>? <i>(Another pause:)</i> I see. Well, thank you for the information. Goodbye. <i>(Turns off phone, narrows her eyes deep in thought)</i></p>

<p>JAKE: What is it, Helen?</p>

<p>HELEN: They transferred my call to the <i>County General Hospital</i> near Dumas, and I was told Turley <i>died</i> there yesterday morning.</p>

<p>JAKE: Oh. <i>(Pauses:)</i> What <i>of</i>?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Looks as she is going to snap at Jake, but sighs:)</i> It was <i>cancer</i>, Jakey.</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>Oh. (Pauses:)</i> Well, are we still gonna meet this <i>"Darren"</i> guy now, dear?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Starts up her SUV:)</i> Oh, <i>yes</i>, Jake--<i>(looks angry:)</i> and may <i>heaven</i> help this <i>"Darren"</i> if he's doing this as some sort of <i>sick</i> joke. <i>(Roars off in the SUV, throwing Jake backwards)</i></p>


<p><i>(Scene changes to a Park Avenue apartment in New York City about the same time)</i></p>


     <p>Willam Appleton was on his phone talking and grinning. He stood in his posh living room, surrounded by a stunning collection of Ming vases, Colonial-era furniture, and standing on an Oriental rug that covered a hardwood floor. On the marble walls were genuine paintings of Renoir and Rembrandt, and a glass case that contained autographed baseballs by Lou Gehrig, Babe Ruth, and Joe DiMaggio. On the sliding-glass door wall that led to a large balcony was a breathtaking view of the Manhattan skyline.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: That's <i>wonderful</i>, Millie! <i>(Pauses:)</i> And you're <i>sure</i> Darren doesn't <i>need</i> anything? Okay, fine. <i>(Another pause:)</i> You're going on that trip to Europe, <i>too</i>? Good--I'm glad Darren talked you into it, you need to get away for awhile from this. <i>(Pauses:)</i> You'll go right <i>after</i> Darren calls you? I suppose that'll do. Yes, Millie, fine. If Darren needs something, tell him <I>not</I> to hesitate to call me. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Good night, dear sister. <i>(Clicks off phone)</i></p>

<p>VOICE: <i>(Apparently female from William's bedroom, seductive:)</i> C'mooon, honeypot!</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Tosses phone on couch, thought v.o., looks up in a giddy mood: <b>Perfect</b>, this is just perfect! Everything's going according to my plan!)</i> Coming, <i>babydoll</i>, coming! <i>(Goes into his room, shuts the door, muffled laughing is heard)</i></p>



<p><i>(The Morgendorffer home, the next morning:)</i></p>



     <p>Jake and Helen were going through their customary getting-ready-for-work rituals, and Quinn and Daria watched them while sitting at the kitchen table, though this time, both were not in their nightclothes. Daria leaned over to Quinn and spoke.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(In a low voice:)</i> Okay, Quinn--now remember, we <i>know</i> Mom's not going to say anything to us about what's going on, so we'll have to get it out of <i>dad. (Watches Helen go back upstairs:) Now's</i> our chance to get it out of him with mom upstairs.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Also in a low voice, smirks:)</i> Don't worry, Daria--I just <i>know</i> dad will tell me about the <i>gift</i> he and mom are gonna get me. <i>(Gets a "Wait a second" frown on her face:)</i> Hey, why are <i>you</i> helping me get <i>my</i> gift? <i>(Narrows her eyes:)</i> Oh, I <i>see</i>! You want <i>something</i> out of this, too! Well, it's <i>my</i> birthday, so why can't you wait 'till your <i>own</i> birthday to get something, Daria?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(In an exasperated tone:)</i> Quinn for the <i>last</i> time, I'm not--<i>(sees that this approach with Quinn isn't working, so she goes along with Quinn's "conclusion" to achieve the desired result, sighs:)</i> okay, Quinn, you <i>got</i> me. All I wanted to see was what mom and dad were gonna get you for your birthday. I'm just--a little <i>curious</i>, that's all, so how about checking with dad like we planned?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Looks at Daria suspiciously, then relents:)</i> Um, okay. <i>(Sees Jake rushing into the kitchen getting his coffee, goes over to him at the counter, and turns on the charm with her hands behind her back:)</i> Oh, <i>Daaad</i>! I need to talk to you for a minute, <i>pleeease</i>?

<P>JAKE: <I>(While in a rush:)</I> Gotta go, sweetie, Daddy's gonna be late! <I>(Drinks his coffee and gobbles down a doughnut from the pack of a dozen of them on the counter)</I></P>

<P>QUINN: It's just for a minute, okay? <I>(Gets a "puppy dog" look in her eye)</I></P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Relents, not being able to resist:)</I> Okay, sweetie, but only for a minute.</P>

<P>QUINN: Umm--I was wondering what you and mom were gonna get me for my birthday gift?</P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Thinks for a second:)</I> Gee, Quinn, your mom and I haven't thought about getting one for you yet. Did you have anything that you wanted in mind?</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(While looking up:) Weeell</I>...if you go to <I>Cashman's</I> at the <I>mall</I>--</P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Reacting to the word "mall", panics a bit:)</I> --Um, sweetie, <I>how</I> did you know about the <I>mall</I>? You're <I>not</I> supposed to know about the meeting your mom and I will have there at <I>five</I> today! <I>(Daria cocks an eyebrow at this)</I></P> 

<P>QUINN: <I>(Confused now:) Meeting</I>? <I>What</I> meeting? All I wanted was--</P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Really panicking now:) OH, NO</I>! You <I>do</I> know about the meeting? <I>(Looks around, sweats, eyes wide open:)</I> Helen will skin me <I>alive</I>! <I>(Puts both hands on Quinn's shoulders, looks her dead in the eyes:)</I> Quinn, <I>promise</I> me you <I>won't</I> tell your mom about this--<I>(looks over at Daria:)</I> and that goes for you <I>too</I>, Kiddo!</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Smirks:)</I> Don't worry, Dad--Quinn and I <I>certainly</I> won't tell mom.</P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Looking relieved:)</I> Gee, thanks, girls! <I>(Glances at his watch:)</I> Wow, I gotta go! <I>(Rushes out the front door)</I></P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Utterly stunned she wasn't allowed to finish what she wanted to say:)</I> But <I>Daaad--(stomps:) damn it</I>!</P>

     <P>Helen came back downstairs in a rush with her briefcase in hand, barreling by her daughters. She stopped just as she opened the front door, and looked back to the girls.</P>

<P>HELEN: Goodbye, girls! There's--</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Cutting her off:)</I> --Yeah, Mom, we know--<I>frozen microwavable lasagna</I> in the freezer. See ya--and show 'em who's <I>boss. (thought v.o.: Like you do <b>here</b>)</I></P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Sounding desperate, tries for Helen's ear:)</I> Say, <I>Muh--oom--</I></P>

<P>HELEN: --Can't stop now, sweetie! <I>(Leaves)</I></P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Completely frustrated now:) AAAAGH</I>! I couldn't get to tell them about what gift I wanted!</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Sighs:)</I> Quinn, didn't you hear dad say something about a <I>meeting</I> at
<I>Cranberry Commons</I> today at <I>five</I>? We wanted to know what was going <I>on</I>, remember?</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Baffled:)</I> Yeah, I remember--but how is <I>that</I> a gift to <I>you</I>? I mean, <I>I'm</I> the one getting the gift.</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Smirks:) I</I> can find out what big <i>secret</i> mom and dad are <I>keeping</I> from us--that's <I>my</I> gift.</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Still a bit baffled by what Daria has said, but is suddenly determined not to be left out, narrows eyes:)</I> Oh, <I>no</I>, not without <I>me</I>, you won't! This is <I>my</I> gift, do you hear? <I>Mine</I>!</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Raises an eyebrow at this:)</I> Are you <I>sure</I> you want to come, too? <I>(Smirks:)</I> You're not <I>afraid</I> your fashion <I>"comrades"</I> might see you <I>with</I> me there?</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Ponders this for a second, then:)</I> I'll just say I <I>convinced</I> you to give fashion make-overs a <I>try</I>, and they'll believe that! <I>(Shrugs as an afterthought:)</I> Besides, Sandi just left town with her family and won't be back until early next week, and Tiffany and Stacy also just left town with <I>their</I> families, and won't be back until the day <I>after</I> Sandi comes back, and if anyone <I>else</I> asks, I can just use the <I>same</I> excuse.</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Rolls her eyes, usual deadpan:)</I> Ah, I see you've gotten all of your <I>bases</I> covered, haven't you?</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Shakes her head slowly in a "She just doesn't get it" way:)</I> Daria, this isn't <I>football</I> we're talking about here! I'm just watching out for what gift I'm getting, and when I find out what it is, I can tell Sandi and the <I>rest</I> of the Fashion Club!</P>

<P>DARIA: Don't you mean brag about what your "gift" is to <I>Sandi--(smirks:)</I>?</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(In a faux "Why, what do you mean?" voice, slightly annoyed:) Dariaaaa</I>, for the <I>last</I> time, Sandi and I aren't <I>rivals</I>, we're <I>friends</I>!</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Usual deadpan:)</I> Yeah, like <I>Caesar and Brutus</I>, and <I>Lee and Grant</I>.</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>Exactly</I>! Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna <I>catalog</I> all of the clothes in my closet--gotta make <i>room</i> for that gift! <I>(Leaves to go upstairs)</I></P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Thought v.o.: There is <b>no</b> excuse for you, <b>"cuz"</b>. Oh well, at least I can relieve my boredom a little by finding out about this clandestine meeting mom and dad are having with this "Darren" guy.) (Goes upstairs to her room)</I></P>


<P><I>(Scene changes to the Appleton mansion, at the same time)</I></P>


     <P>Darren, in a hooded dark blue sweatsuit, was almost finishing his usual morning jog around the mansion's grounds thinking about today, a day that could <I>change</I> his life, possibly <I>forever</I>. It was a beautiful and clear summer morning, and the birds chirped their beautiful and clear melodies. Darren thought about the dense woods that surrounded the estate, which provided the perfect cover for him to do all the jogging he wanted without any prying from the media hordes that, while thinning out, were still surrounding the front gate of the Appleton property. He chuckled grimly to himself over the <I>"cover"</I> part, for in a way, the word "cover" was <I>symbolic</I>, as he was about to meet the two people that gave him birth, and he was going to meet them under the <I>cover</I> of a thin disguise. He felt <I>uneasy</I> about this, especially after his call to Helen Morgendorffer the previous night. Darren thought about the <I>misgivings</I> he had read in her conversation, and now he was going to meet her and his birth father, Jake Morgendorffer, under <I>less</I> than truthful circumstances. He quickly put this thought in the back of his mind when he saw the mansion coming into view.</P>

     <P>Darren jogged right up to the front door and rang the bell. Elenor let him into the foyer while holding a towel.</P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(While breathing in and out slowly to decrease his heart rate:)</I> Hello, Elenor. It's a <I>great</I> day today, isn't it?</P>

<P>ELENOR: <I>(Smiles, and hands him the towel:)</I> It is, indeed, Master Darren, and hopefully it will be for your meeting with your birth parents. By the way, Master Curtis called while you were out. He wanted you to call him as soon as you came in.</P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(While wiping his face:)</I> Ah, thank you, Elenor. I'll call him right now, and then take a shower and change. I'll eat breakfast afterwards. <I>(Hangs towel around his neck)</I></P>

<P>ELENOR: Very good, Master Darren. <I>(Leaves)</I></P>

     <P>Darren went to his room upstairs to call Curtis. As soon as the first ring was heard, he could hear Curtis' excited voice on the other end.</P>

<P>CURTIS: Hey, <I>"scrub"</I>, I see you got that customary jog in!</P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(Grins:)</I> Sure did--and did you get your "friend" <I>Lena</I> in, too? I just hope it wasn't in the <I>early</I> morning, or her daddy would've <I>skinned</I> you alive!</P>

<P>CURTIS: <I>(Chuckles:)</I> Nope, I hate to <I>disappoint</I> you, but I got her to her house <I>just</I> under her curfew, so I get to live yet <I>another</I> day. Now, <I>what happened</I>? Did you <I>find</I> your birth parents?</P>


     <P>Darren told the entire story about how he was illegally adopted and what Turley had done to bring it about, and of his birth parents.</P>


<P>CURTIS: <I>(Sounding angry:)</I> I can't believe that a doctor could <I>do</I> something like <I>that</I> for <I>money</I>! That--that <I>sick son of a--</I></P>

<P>DARREN: --<I>Whoa</I> there, compadre. I'm still <I>peeved</I> at the "bad" doctor myself, but there's <I>nothing</I> that can be done about it now. I'm going to go on with living for the <I>future</I>. Besides, Turley's <I>dead</I>, and I can't <I>keep</I> hating a dead man.</P>

<P>CURTIS: <I>(Voice grows quiet:)</I> Nah, I guess not. <I>(Lightens his tone:)</I> At least you can now meet these--<I>Morgendorffers</I>, and your two <I>sisters</I>! <I>(Chuckles:)</I> You <I>do</I> realize if you get <I>tight</I> with this <I>"Daria"</I> and <I>"Quinn"</I>, you'll <I>have</I> to keep the boys at <I>bay</I>, because <I>(gets into a masculine "protective" voice:) "No one's good enough for my little sisters".</I></P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(Laughs:)</I> Oh no, uh-uh, don't <I>go</I> there. I've figured if they've lived their lives on their own <I>without</I> me for <I>this</I> long, they can take care of <I>themselves</I>. You're telling me this from your <I>own</I> experiences, Mr. <I>Watley</I> that you've had with <I>your</I> two sisters, <I>Juanita</I> and <I>Laflita</I>, so count me out, my good man.</P>

<P>CURTIS: <I>Bah</I>, it was worth a <I>try. (Pauses:)</I> So, <I>when</I> are you going to meet your birth parents?</P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(Hesitant:)</I> Er, um--<I>today</I>. In fact, I'm going to be leaving right after breakfast.</P>

<P>CURTIS: <I>(Sounding surprised:) Oh</I>. Well, I don't want to keep you then--good luck with your meeting and call me later, okay?</P>

<P>DARREN: Sure, and--<I>Curtis? (Gets a pained look on his face)</I></P>

<P>CURTIS: Hmm? What?</P>

<P>DARREN: Umm--<I>nothing</I>, it can wait until later. Take it easy, bud.</P>

<P>CURTIS: <I>(Pauses:)</I> Chill. <I>(Hangs up)</I></P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(Frowns, thought v.o. after hanging up: Nice going, you <b>idiot</b>. You didn't tell him of your little <b>ruse</b> that you have planned for the Morgendorffers. What are you <b>afraid</b> of--them getting their hands on your <b>money</b>? Maybe you think Curtis would tell you you're <b>crazy</b> and <b>wrong</b> for doing this, and that he might be <b>right</b>? Well, you're deep in it now, old boy, so you might as well go on with it, and let the chips fall where they may.) (Gets up in a huff and goes into his bathroom)</I></P>



<P><I>(Scene swicthes to Helen Morgendorffer's law office in Lawndale, about an hour later)</I></P>


     <P>In her office, Helen was probably more <I>agitated</I> and <I>nervous</I> than she had ever been before in her life <I>(if that was at all possible)</I>, far worse than even the night before she took her bar exam. She could barely concentrate on her work, nearly <I>snapped</I> at her secretary <I>Marianne</I> for a typing error over a summons correspondence, and almost forgetting to meet with <I>Eric</I> over a deposition with a client. She sat at her desk, frowning in thought and rubbing her temples, bothered by what lie ahead with meeting this <I>"Darren"</I> person. <I>Would</I> he even come, and if so, what would he <I>say</I>? Would she <I>recognize</I> him? <I>(Helen dismissed Jake possibly doing this for some reason,)</I> In a moment, her main thought hit her like a ton of bricks: <I>What if he really was the son she thought had died almost twenty years ago in childbirth?</I> Helen shook her head quickly and and closed off her mind from <I>that</I> frame of thought.</P> 


<P>HELEN: <I>(Thought v.o.: It's impossible Helen, the police had investigated for any mistakes on Turley's part, and finding none on that <b>bastard</b>, had cleared him. Your baby is <b>dead. Gone</b>. Turley's dead and gone, too. Oh, God...)</I></P>

     <P>The pressure became too much to bear as she suddenly got up and went to Marianne.</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(In her falsetto sweet voice:)</I> Marianne, could you <I>please</I> tell Eric I'm <I>leaving</I> for the rest of the day? Something <I>really</I> personal and important has just come up that I couldn't <I>possibly</I> ignore any longer. <I>(Leaves:)</I> Tell him I'll call later to explain, <I>thank you</I>, dear!</P>

<P>MARIANNE: <I>(While typing:)</I> All right, Helen. <I>(Thought v.o., sighs: Thank God she's gone! I don't know how much more of that I could've taken!)</I></P>


<P><I>(Scene changes to Jake's office, about ten minutes later)</I></P>


     <P>Jake was half-heartedly listening to a male client talk about an idea for a <i>liquid-filled drink coaster</i>, occasionally nodding his head as if he were listening. The other half of his mind was on the pending meeting with this <I>"Darren"</I> fellow. Could it be possible this young man <I>was</I> his son? What would <I>he</I>--check that, <I>Helen</I> say? He was frowning, trying to figure out what to do when his client spoke.</P>

<P>CLIENT: <I>(Excited:)</I> --And that's what <I>I</I> think about it, Jake. What do <I>you</I> think? Is it a <I>plausible</I> idea?</P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Startled, coming out of his stupor:) Huh</I>? Oh yeah, it could work if you sell it right. <I>(Looks at watch:)</I> Uh--can we talk about this more <I>tomorrow</I> before I go on vacation? I--just remembered a--<I>family</I> errand I gotta attend to, and it can't wait.</P>

<P>CLIENT: Eh? Oh, sure. <I>(Gets up:)</I> Same time, then?</P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Getting up too:)</I> Sure, okay. <I>(Shakes client's hand, client leaves)</I></P>

     <P>After a few minutes of gathering some papers in his briefcase, Jake was about to leave himself when he opened his door to find Helen coming up.</P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Pleasantly surprised:) Helen</I>! I was just thinking about coming to <I>you</I> to talk about--</P>

<P>HELEN: --The <I>meeting</I>, Jakey? Me too--I can't get <I>any</I> work done, either. Maybe we should talk about what this--<I>"Darren's"</I> going to say to us, and what will be said to <I>him</I>.</P>

<P>JAKE: Yeah! Where do you wanna go?</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Narrows her eyes:)</I> We don't <I>dare</I> go home, that's for <I>sure. (Looks at watch:)</I> We've got about <I>six</I> hours until he shows up. <I>(Thinks for a second:) I know</I>! Let's go to the <I>Sedimentary Rock Country Club and Links</I>! It's out of the way, and we can rent out a <I>guest</I> room there for a few hours to freshen up. We'll call the girls and tell them we'll be late coming home, and we'll follow each other in our cars to the club, and then to the mall.</P>

<P><I>(Note to reader: see the "Daria Diaries" for the location of the links)</I></P>

<P>JAKE: <I>All right</I>! I can rent some clubs and get in a few holes on my golf game! <I>(Helen frowns at him)</I> Oh <I>c'mon</I>, honey, <I>pleeeease</I>? It'll help me think and relax, and I haven't played in a few weeks! <I>(Gives "puppy dog" look Quinn gave him earlier)</I></P> 

<P>HELEN: <I>(Rolls her eyes, sighs:) Jake</I>, even if I <I>allowed</I> you to do so, <I>how</I> would you play the links? You don't have <I>any</I> golfing clothing! Now,
I know you played <I>Windsor Hills</I> in your <I>suit</I> following Erin's <I>wedding--(begins to get angry, talks through clenched teeth:)</I> at <I>night</I>--but this is almost the <I>middle of the day in the heat of the summer</I>! You'll <I>burn up</I>!</P>

<P><I>(Note to reader: for the "Suit & golf" thing, see the episode "I Don't")</I></P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Swallows hard, gathers the courage to speak:)</I> D-don't worry, honey! I have a locker there with golf clothes and shoes, and some <I>extra</I> clothes! so can I play? <I>(Begins to sound like a kid begging his mom to want something:) Huh? Huh? Huh? Hu--</I></P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Throws her arms in the air:)</I> All <I>right</I>, Jake, all right! You can play some <I>damn</I> holes!</P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Giddy with delight:) YAHOO</I>! <I>(Hugs and kisses Helen:)</I> Thanks, honey! You're the <I>greatest</I>! Last one there is a <I>rotten egg</I>! <I>(Runs out)</I></P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Sighs, closes Jake's door behind her, following Jake, thought v.o.: At least Jakey will be relaxed when we meet this "Darren". Too bad I can't say the same for myself.)</I></P>


<P><I>(The Appleton mansion, at the same time)</I></P>


     <P>Darren walked down the stairs with his bags and other belongings in hand. When he went outside, he was surprised to see the mansion's entire staff waiting for him in the front along with his aunt and uncle. Elenor and Claude took his bags.</P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(Smiles, looks around at everyone:)</I> I see you're all here to see me off.</P>

<P>MILLIE: <I>(Walks up to Darren, hugs him:)</I> We <I>all</I> wanted to wish you good luck, Darren.</P>

<P>WILLIAM: <I>(Walks up to Darren, shakes his hand:) I</I> want to wish you good luck as well, Darren.</P> 

<P>DARREN: Thanks, Aunt Millie, Uncle Will. <I>(Goes up to a sobbing Elenor and hugs her:)</I> Goodbye, Elenor--take care. Hey, don't cry--I'll be back soon.</P>

<P>ELENOR: <I>(Wipes her eyes:)</I> I <I>know</I> that, Master Darren--it's just I'm so <I>happy</I> for you to get to meet your birth parents.</P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(Smiles, in a soft voice:)</I> Thank you, Elenor.</P> 

     <P>Darren shook Claude and the rest of the staff's hands, and they in turn wished him luck. Darren then looked around frowning, perplexed.</P>

<P>DARREN: Say, <I>where's</I> the rental car? I thought it would be out in front--?</P>

<P>WILLIAM: Ah, sorry, Darren--it's located about <I>five</I> miles from here. We wanted to <I>slip</I> you by the horde of reporters out front, and I don't think the limo will <I>work</I> this time.</P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(Cocks an eyebrow:)</I> Then <I>how</I> will I get to the car, Uncle Will?</P>

<P>WILLIAM: Why, by the <I>helicopter</I>, of course. The car is sitting by an open field with our security team waiting for you. I figured that the reporters won't be able to <I>follow</I> you if you go by that manner. Besides, <I>I'm</I> going to--<I>occupy</I> their attention while you get away. <I>(Motions to the waiting helicopter, which begins to warm up:)</I> It's all <I>yours</I>, my boy, and once again, good luck.</P>

<P>MILLIE: Be sure to <I>call</I> after your meeting, Darren--I <I>won't</I> go to bed until you do. <I>(Hugs him one more time)</I></P>

<P>DARREN: Okay, Aunt Millie, and <I>you</I> be sure to take off for <I>Europe</I> after I do.</P>

<P>WILLIAM: <I>(Steps in, grins:)</I> Don't worry, Darren--<I>I'll</I> make sure she does.</P>

     <P>Darren walked out to the helicopter after Claude, Elenor, and the pilot put his bags in it, and got on, waving goodbye one more time. The helicopter then slowly lifted off the mansion's helipad and flew over the trees and out of sight.</P>

<P>MILLIE: <I>(Looking downcast:) Surely</I> he'll be all right, William?</P>

<P>WILLIAM: <I>(Smugly, comes up beside Millie, and puts his arm around her shoulder while looking in the direction of the helicopter:)</I> Not a <I>doubt</I> of it, Millie. <I>(Looks at the front of the mansion gates:)</I> Well, I best get to those reporters and tell them to leave <I>"Arthur Jr."</I> alone. <I>(Thought v.o.: And let them concentrate on <b>me</b>.) (Gets into back of waiting limo nearby, and it leaves)</I></P>


     <P>Darren had requested a very <I>"ordinary-looking"</I> car to rent so as not to draw attention to himself (as well as deciding not to fly into the airport near Lawndale via the private jet), and he got his wish when he got out of the helicopter and found out it was a green <I>Chevy Impala</I>. After shaking the hands of each of the members of his security team, he got in the car and went on his way to Lawndale, and no one other than his aunt and uncle, Curtis, Elenor, and Claude, knew where he was going. (Everyone else thought he was going on a "long vacation".) Darren glanced over in the front seat to the <I>new</I> pictures Woo had scanned and sent to him over the Internet just an hour earlier. He now knew <I>how</I> Helen and Jake Morgendorffer looked, but he <I>still</I> didn't have any pictures of <I>Daria</I> and <I>Quinn</I>. He figured if things went well, though, he'd <I>see</I> his--<i>sisters</i> soon enough.</P>


<P><I>(The Morgendorffer home, about six-and-a-half hours later:)</I></P>


     <P>Daria was sitting on her bed watching <I>Sick, Sad World</I>.</P>

<P>TV ANNOUNCER: <I>(While theme music is playing:)</I> Can your pets control your <I>mind</I> while you're <I>asleep</I>? A <I>Sick, Sad World</I> exclusive, next!</P>

     <P>There was a knock on Daria's door.</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Clicks off TV, deadpan:)</I> I'm <I>hibernating</I>. Come back in <I>200 years</I>.</P>

     <P>Quinn came into Daria's room, exausted.</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Wipes her face with a cloth, wearing a pink sweatsuit:) Whew</I>! Well, I'm <I>finished</I>!</P>

<P>DARIA: If only that were <I>true</I>.</P>

<P>QUINN: Daria, are you ready to go to the mall? We don't have much time, you know.</P>

<P>DARIA: Yeah, I know. Don't worry--I've called a <I>cab</I> to take us there, since mom and dad have both cars.</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Shocked:)</I> Daria, are you <I>nuts</I>? Cabs cost <I>money</I>!</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(In her most sardonic, deadpan, monotonic voice:)</I> Wow, you <I>don't</I> say--and here I'm thinking they were <I>free. Silly me</I>--I'd better call the cab place and <I>demand</I> to know <I>why</I> I have to <I>pay</I> them for picking us up, the <I>bastards</I>.</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Rolls her eyes:)</I> You <I>know</I> what I'm talking about. <I>Why</I> don't we take the <I>bus</I>?</P>

<P>DARIA: Because the last bus scheduled to leave Cranberry Commons is at <I>5:30</I>, an <I>hour</I> from now, and we don't know how long this <I>"meeting"</I> will last.</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Annoyed:) I</I> could've gotten a guy to take us there and back, you know--<I>Larry</I> called a few hours ago to <i>confirm</i> our date for tonight, an' I could've had <i>him</i> to do all th' driving, an' he'd have us there an' back without mom an' dad knowing anything!</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Infamous dry wit:)</I> But you were having so much <I>fun</I> with your clothes <I>"cataloging"</I>. I didn't want to take you away from <I>that</I>.</P> 

<P>QUINN: <I>(Thinks Daria paid her a compliment, touched:)</I> Gee, that's <I>okay</I>, Daria, I wouldn't have <I>minded</I>.</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Shakes her head slowly, gives up trying to understand Quinn:)</I> Look, we'll <I>share</I> on the fare, okay?</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Becomes hesitant, looking around uncomfortably:)</I> Um--gosh, Daria, I don't think I'll have enough money to cover <I>my</I> half--</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Smirks:)</I> Nice try, <I>"Slick"</I>, but I checked between your <I>matresses</I> yesterday, and you have <I>plenty</I> saved up, since mom and dad finally <I>cracked down</I> and <i>forced</i> you to save <i>more</i> of the money you get from them for your allowance.</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Furious now:)</I> You--you looked <I>there</I>? How <I>dare</I> you? <I>(Turns around, preparing to leave:)</I> Just for <I>that</I>, you can--</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Grins now:)</I> --Go by <I>myself,</I> and find out about the <I>"gift"</I>?</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Turns around, calms down:) Okay</I>, okay! Let me change! <I>(Mutters to herself, leaving:)</I> Gotta find a <I>better</I> place to hide--</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Gets up, goes to the door, and looking out to Quinn in the hallway, raising her voice, deadpan:)</I> --Like the <I>secret</I> place behind your <I>dresser</I>?</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Shuts her eyes, frowns:) AAARGH</I>! <I>(Slams her door)</I></P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Goes up to Quinn's door, voice the same:)</I> How about the place behind your <I>mirrors</I>?</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(From her room, muffled:) Shut up</I>, Daria!</P>

     <P>Smirking, Daria went back to her room to call the cab company to say when she and Quinn wanted to be picked up. She was about to get the cell phone laying on her bed when it rang on its own, and she grabbed it and turned it on.</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Deadpan:)</I> Hello--<I>hell</I> headquarters.</P>

<P>VOICE: <I>(Ignoring Daria's comment:)</I> Daria, it's me. Your father and I are--um, going to go <I>out</I> tonight, and we may be a little late. You and Quinn can get that <I>extra frozen microwavable lasagna</I> out of the freezer and have it for dinner tonight. Be good, sweetie. <I>(Hangs up)</I></P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(To herself:) "That"</I> again? She's <I>got</I> to be kidding. </I>(Pauses, smirks:) <I>Me</I>? <I>Good</I>? Yeah, <I>right. (Turns off the cell phone, then back on to call the cab company)</I></P>

<P><I>(Scene changes to the Sendimentary Rock Country Club and Links, rented guest room in the club)</I></P>

     <P>Sitting on the bed, Helen turned off her cell phone and looked over at Jake, who had played a nine-hole round of golf and had showered and put on some more clothes. He was laying on his back across the covers on the other side of the queen-sized bed, snoring with a happy look on his face. She rolled her eyes and got up to stretch, then reached over to shake and wake up her husband.</P>

<P>HELEN: Jake! <I>JAKE</I>! It's time to go! Wake up!</P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Groggy:)</I> Hmmyeah, I'mup. <I>(Goes back to sleep)</I></P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Angry:)</I> JAKE, <I>WAKE UP</I>! <I>(Jake leaps up off the bed)</I></P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Looks around, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed:)</I> I'm up, Helen! Hey, did you call the girls?</P> 

<P>HELEN: <I>(Sighs:) Yes</I>, Jake--I told them we'd be late coming in, and for them to get dinner out of the freezer.</P>

<P>JAKE: Good! <I>(Pauses:)</I> Um--ready to <I>go</I>, dear?</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Glares at Jake:)</I> As ready as I'll <I>ever</I> be, Jakey. <I>(Gets up:)</I> Let's go, and <I>remember</I>, let <I>me</I> do the talking. Pay the desk on our way out.</P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Frustrated:)</I> Aw, gee, honey--can't I say <I>anything</I> to this guy?</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(While opening the door out of the room, sounding annoyed:) Yes</I>, Jake--you can say <I>hello. (Leaves out with Jake)</I></P>

<P>JAKE: <I>All rig</I>--geez, Helen, <I>just</I> "hello"?</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Stops in her tracks really angry, Jake almost runs over her:)</I> Yes, Jake--<I>just</I> hello! Now, be <I>quiet</I> and follow me there, okay?!</P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Quietly, a little timidly:) O-okay</I>, dear. <I>(Looks down sadly)</I></P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Sighs, walks up to hug Jake:)</I> I'm--I'm <I>sorry</I> for shouting at you, Jakey--I guess I'm a little--<I>nervous. (Frowns, becoming angry:)</I> How <I>dare</I> this--this--<I>"Darren"</I> do this to us, by <I>dragging</I> up those <I>horrible</I> memories like this? Our baby is <I>dead</I>! We <I>saw</I> the body!</P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Reluctantly speaking:)</I> Helen--well--uh--</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Inquisitive look:)</I> What, Jake?</P>

<P>JAKE: --Well, what if this <I>"Darren"</I> guy <I>is</I>--</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Suddenly in Jake's face, enraged:) --DON'T YOU <b>DARE</b> GO THERE, JAKE! OUR BABY IS DEAD! DO YOU HEAR?! DEAD! (Helen's screaming draws the attention of some of the other guests, who are looking out of their rooms, and she notices:) WHAT-IN-THE-HELL-ARE-YOU-ALL-LOOKING-AT?! (All the doors shut at the <b>same</b> time)</I> Now, let's get the <I>hell</I> out of here, and put this <I>"Darren"</I> guy in his <I>place</I>, Jake! <I>(She storms off, and a quivering Jake follows Helen down the hallway)</I></P>


<P><I>(In the "Stopover Motel", beside a highway near Lawndale, about the same time)</I></P>


     <P>Darren stepped out of his room with a map of Lawndale and Woo's pictures of his birth parents, and took a deep breath. He put on his sunglasses, looked at his watch, went out to his car, and got in.</P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(Thought v.o.: This is it, hop to it.) (Starts up the car and drives out of the motel's parking lot)</I></P>


<P><I>(Scene is now at Cranberry Commons mall, about 15 minutes later)</I></P>


     <P>Darren walked into the mall's food court area and looked around. It was a large, open, and airy space, with several angled glass panes in the ceiling above the seating area. The area was surrounded by tall interior trees that were embedded in separate plant beds that encompassed the area on three sides. Beyond this, there were benches on each side. Darren looked at his watch, and saw that he had come a little early, so he decided to get a snack at a nearby food stand while waiting. It was called <I>It's A Nutty, Nutty, Nutty World</I>. He ordered a soda and some peanuts, looked <I>strangely</I> at the cashier, who had given the company's customary <I>greeting</I>, and went to find a seat at one of the tables in the middle of the area, so that the Morgendorffers would be able to see him.</P>

<P><I>(Note to reader: Of course, for the "greeting", see "It Happened One Nut")</I></P>

     
     <P>Helen and Jake walked into the mall's main shopping area and began to make their way to the food area.</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(While hurrying along, frowning:)</I> Now, <I>remember</I>, Jake--let <I>me</I> do the talking to this--this--<I>phony</I>.</P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Staying at Helen's pace, silly grin on his face:) Okay</I>, Helen!</P>

     
     <P>Meanwhile, on the other end of the mall, Daria and Quinn were just coming in.</P>

<P>QUINN: Daria, <I>how</I> do we find mom and dad?</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Deadpan:)</I> You could <I>hone</I> in on mom's <I>purse</I> and dad's <I>wallet</I>, and we'd be there in <I>no</I> time flat.</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Glares at Daria:) Ha</I>.</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(In a serious tone:)</I> I guess we should put ourselves in their place and wonder, <I>"If we're gonna meet someone, where would we go"?</I> I'm thinking one of the restaurants or the <I>food court. (Considers:)</I> Let's check out the food court first. It's open, and we can see them easily from far away without them seeing us first. <I>(Begins to walk in the direction of the food court)</I></P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Becomes excited, walks with Daria:)</I> I can't wait to see what <I>gift</I> they're gonna get me! I hope it's something that I really <I>deserve</I>!</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(More deadpan, looks around in a faux concerned way:)</I> I don't know if they can fit a <I>firing squad</I> in here, Quinn--now a <I>guillotine</I>, that's <I>feasible</I>. Or, perhaps a <I>stretch rack</I>--maybe--</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Angry:)</I> --Oh, be <I>quiet</I>, Daria! <I>(Rolls her eyes while Daria smirks)</I></P>


     <P>Darren was chewing the peanuts from his bag when he caught a wide-eyed glimpse of his birth parents, <I>nearly</I> choking on the peanuts. He quickly gulped down the soda and stood up to get their attention.</P>


     <P>Helen and Jake were walking into the food court when they saw a young man standing in the middle of the area looking at them. Helen <I>gasped</I>, wide-eyed, while Jake, much as she expected, stopped and looked at his wife without noticing what was going on.</P>


<P>JAKE: <I>(Confused:)</I> Helen, what's <I>wrong</I>?</P>


     <P>Helen said nothing. She simply stared at this young fellow, and slowly walked up to him, with Jake in tow. He looked <I>quite</I> tall and handsome, with broad shoulders, and a chin that looked <I>somewhat</I> like Jake's, but not as <I>pronounced</I>. He had a full head of wavy reddish-brownish hair, and deep-blue eyes. <I>Her</I> eyes. In fact, he looked a lot like <I>her</I> from the chin up.</P>

                                                                                       <P><I>(Note to reader: Draw that, you fanfiction-artists--please?)</I></P>


<P>HELEN: <I>(Stares at him, completely at a loss for words:)</I> I--I--oh my <I>God</I>. Are--are you--<I>Darren</I>? <I>(Reaches out to shake his hand, trembling)</I></P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(Himself a bit nervous, shakes her hand:)</I> Y-yes, ma'am. <I>(Also looks at Jake:)</I> I'm the person you talked to last night, Mrs. Morgendorffer. <I>(Reaches out to shake Jake's hand:)</I> And <I>you're</I> Mr. Morgendorffer, sir?</P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Shakes Darren's hand:) Huh</I>? Oh, yeah. <I>(Looks at Helen, in a low, sly voice:) Get'em</I>, honey. <I>(Helen glares at Jake, Darren frowns at him, perplexed)</I></P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(Confused:)</I> I'm sorry, but--?</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Coming out of her stupor:) DAMN IT, JAKE</I>! <I>(Begins to cry:)</I> Can't you see he's our <I>son</I>? <I>Look</I> at him! I was <I>wrong</I>! <I>Thank God</I> I was wrong! <I>(To Darren's surprise, she grabs him in a fierce hug, Darren stands there, stunned)</I></P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Stares hard at Darren, eyes narrow, then suddenly wide-open:)</I> Oh my God, Helen, you're <I>RIGHT</I>! <I>(He hugs both Helen and the still-stunned Darren, and starts to cry as well, while some nearby shoppers gawk at the scene for a moment, and then go about their business)</I></P>

     
     <P>Daria and Quinn arrived at the edge of the food court just in time to see both their parents hugging what appeared to be a young man. From their vantage point, however, they could only see the <I>back</I> of the man's head. Both were still too far away to get too close without their parents spotting them, so Daria stopped, (as did Quinn) and watched in stunned silence.</P>


<P>DARIA: <I>(Eyelids slightly going wide:)</I> What the <I>hell</I>--?</P>


<p>QUINN: <I>(Narrows her eyes:) EWWWW</I>! What're mom and dad <I>doing</I> with that guy? <I>(Does a bit of a double-take, gasps:)</I> I <I>can't</I> see his face, but I'll bet he's <I>cute</I>! <I>(Daria rolls her eyes and approaches Quinn, gently taking her arm) Huh</I>? What--</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Index finger on her mouth, speaking in a low voice:) Shhh</I>! You want mom and dad, and that <I>"Darren"</I> guy to <I>notice</I> us? Let's find a place around here where they <I>can't</I> see us.</P>


     <P>Both Quinn and Daria sat down at one of the benches behind the trees. They saw the young man, with his back still to them, sit down at a table with their parents, who were facing both Morgendorffer sisters. Daria looked around in frustration.</P>


<P>DARIA: <I>Damn</I>! We can't <I>risk</I> getting any closer without our parents seeing us.</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Looks at the back of the head of the young man dreamily, sighs:)</I> That's <I>okay</I>, Daria. I could sit here and <I>watch</I> this guy <I>all night</I>.</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Raises an eyebrow, deadpan:)</i> Quinn, you <I>can't</I> see this guy's <i>face</i>, remember? How do you know what he <I>looks</I> like?</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Still in a dreamy voice:)</I> Oh, I <I>know</I>, Daria--</I>trust</I> me, I know. <I>(Daria gives a "Why do I even bother to ask"? look at her)</I></P>


     <P>Darren sat down at the table wide-eyed with his birth parents a bit <I>shaken</I>. He had half-expected his birth mother and father to be <I>skeptical</I> over seeing him and hearing what he was going to say, but their reaction caught him totally <I>off-guard</I>. He took a deep breath and began to speak.</P>


<P>DARREN: Hello, er--<I>(looks for words:)</I> this is a little <I>awkward</I>, you understand--what should I <I>call</I> you two?</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Wipes her eyes, now a little lost for words herself:)</I> Um, well--that's a <I>good</I> question, er--<I>Darren</I>--do you want to call us just--well--</P>

<P>DARREN: --No, uh, offense, ma'am--but would you and your husband mind if I just called you <I>Helen</I> and <I>Jake</I>?</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Looks slightly disappointed he didn't say "Mom" and "Dad", but agrees:)</I> Oh--sure we don't! <I>(Looks at Jake:) Right</I>, Jake?</P>


     <P>Jake simply stared at Darren with a <I>fatherly</I> glaze in his eyes, slightly smiling. Darren looked at Jake a little <I>uneasily</I>.</P>


<P>JAKE: <I>(Thought v.o.: I can't believe what I'm seeing. A son. My son. Take <b>that</b>, Old Man--)</I></P>

<P>HELEN: --<I>JAKE! (Jake snaps out of his trance)</I> Jake, Darren <I>asked</I> if we wouldn't mind if he called us by our <I>first</I> names! You don't <I>mind</I>, do you?</P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Looks slightly disappointed Darren doesn't want to call them "Mom" and "Dad", agrees:)</I> Oh--<I>sure</I>, honey! <I>No problem! (Holds a thumb up at Darren, with a silly grin on his face)</i></p>


     <P>Darren looked at the two with a quick, strange look on his face, eyebrow raised, as if to say, <I>"What in the world is going on with these people?"</I>, then reluctantly went on. He talked to them about the deaths of his (adopted) parents (making sure to <i>change</i> their names), and saying quickly that he didn't want to talk about <i>how</i> it happened, at least not right now. Helen cried over their son's loss, saying she <i>now</i> understood why Darren would want to call her and Jake by their <i>first</i> names <i>(Jake nodded in agreement)</i>, for Darren felt he would <i>disrespect</i> his deceased (adopted) parents otherwise. Darren then talked about the tape his (adopted) parents made, (with some <i>alterations</i>) and about the <i>Barnes Adoption Agency</i>, and of hiring <i>Woo</i> (using some of the money his parents "left" him from their will) to find out what was going on. He then began to talk about his and Woo's trip to the hospital, and of finding a sick and dying Turley. All of what was told was <i>stunning</i> to Helen and Jake, who had not said a word up to this point. Helen now spoke up.</p>


<p>HELEN: <i>(Completely shocked:)</i> An adoption agency that looked legitimate on the <i>surface</i>, but was illegitimate <i>underneath</i>? B-but <i>how</i> did you get to be <i>adopted</i>, Darren--<i>(frowns:)</i> and what does that dead <i>bastard</i> Turley have to do with it?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looking slightly surprised:)</i> You <i>know</i> Turley's <i>dead</i>? <i>(Both Helen and Jake nod, Helen tells Darren about the call she made last night)</i> Hmm--now when I <i>think</i> about it, I suppose you <i>would've</i> called to find out about Turley. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Well, you two had best <i>prepare</i> yourselves for what I'm about to tell you the night I was born. I can only hope you can keep <i>control</i> of your <i>anger</i>, though I won't blame you if you <i>can't. (Helen's eyes get wide, looks at Jake, who immediately responds)</i></p>

<p>JAKE: Don't worry, Helen--I <i>promise</i> not to go <i>crazy</i> over this. I won't make a <i>scene</i>, dear. <i>(Looks at Darren seriously, talking in a quiet tone:)</i> He's our <i>son</i>.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Stares at Jake, almost in rare admiration:)</i> Very well, Jake--go on, Darren.</p>

<p>DARREN: All right--oh, and <i>one</i> more thing--this story is <i>difficult</i> enough to tell as it <i>is</i>. I'd like to ask if both of you could please not <i>interrupt</i> me to ask questions while I'm talking. <i>(Both nod, Darren goes on)</i></p>


<p><i>(Flashback: Turley's hospital room with Darren sitting by the bed, Turley in it, Martha and Woo standing beside it)</i></p>


<p>TURLEY: <i>(Looking at his wife, Martha:)</i> --Honey, it happened while you were out of town visiting some of your friends. <i>(Looks back and forth between Darren, Martha, and Woo:)</i> You see, I was in some serious gambling <i>debts</i> with some loan sharks, and I was counting on a pregnant <i>runaway</i> the "agency" had sent to me to have a baby that she wanted to <i>give away</i>. I heard that some people wanted to pay up to <i>$50,000</i> for a baby to the "agency", and with my standard <i>50% cut</i>, I could settle up easily with the loan sharks and have <i>plenty</i> left over for that trip you wanted us to take to <i>Aruba</i>, remember, dear? <i>(Martha rolls her eyes)</i> It was supposed to be the <i>usual</i> thing: The mother has the baby for the "agency", which pays a small "fee" to the mother, give the baby to the "agency", and the "parents" pay the "agency" money and <i>take</i> the baby. No <i>muss</i>, no <i>fuss</i>--like <i>clockwock</i>.</p> 
                         

<p><i>(Present: Helen narrows her eyes in anger at this "trade"--Darren continues)</i></p>

     
     <p>Turley looked down for a second, then continued.</p>


<p>TURLEY: Only <i>this</i> time, something went <i>wrong</i>. When the baby, a boy, was born, it was <i>already</i> dead, deprived of oxygen. I was stunned, I couldn't believe it. The young woman then told me she had been <i>drinking</i> and <i>smoking</i> like there was <i>no</i> tomorrow. I wanted to <i>beat the hell</i> out of her for what she had done--I mean, <i>how</i> could someone <i>do</i> something like <i>that</i>, right? <i>(Darren and the others  roll their eyes at Turley's hypocrisy)</i> I figured it would draw the cop's attention, though, if I did, so I backed off. Besides, it was no skin off of her, she had said, she <i>didn't</i> want the baby anyway, but then, she had the <i>nerve</i> to demand some sort of <i>"compensation"</i> for her <i>"trouble"</i>. I gave her a <i>hundred</i> bucks, and told her to beat it. I was in some deep <i>crap</i> now. The sharks had told me to have the money day after tomorrow, or they'd <i>kill</i> me--or <i>you</i>, honey. <i>(Martha looks stunned)</i> I couldn't let them do <i>that</i>, could I? <i>(Pauses:)</i> Anyway, I was at my wit's end. I put the dead baby's body in a <i>plastic bag</i> to <i>throw away</i> for later, and cleaned up the place.</p>                                                                                                                                          


<p><i>(Present: Darren stops for a moment to gather his thoughts. Helen and Jake look horrified. Darren then continues.)</i></p>


<p>TURLEY: <i>(Looking at a horrified Darren:)</i> Hey, look--the baby eventually got a <i>decent</i> burial--but I'm getting <i>ahead</i> of myself. It was getting late, and I was getting <i>desperate</i>. What in the <i>hell</i> was I going to <i>do</i>? I sat in the middle of the floor, staring at nothing. I don't know how <i>long</i> I was out of it, but then I heard a car coming up outside, and that snapped me out of it. A fella and his pregnant wife got out of the car and came up to the house. It was clear to me that she was really in labor, and she about to have the baby any <i>second. (Sees Darren narrow his eyes, angered)</i> I know <i>what</i> you're <i>thinking</i>, so take it <i>easy</i> son, if you want to know <i>who</i> your parents are, okay? <i>(Pauses:)</i> I had to make a split-second decision. Yeah, it all came to me right <i>then and there</i>.</p> 

<p><i>(Present: Helen and Jake look at each other in a <b>terrible</b> realization--they begin to get a sinking feeling in their stomachs--Darren keeps talking)</i></p>


<p>TURLEY: These people named--let's see,--a--Helen--and--a--Jake Morgendiff--no, wait--<i>Morgendorffer</i>, yeah, Morgendorffer--that's it--came up to my home. I saw the clock and it was about <i>2:20 a.m.</i> The father was completely <i>crazy</i>, I'd say a <i>nut</i>, even more than most fathers usually are when they're gonna be daddies. <i>(Present: Jake frowns, but says nothing)</i> The mother was a <i>little</i> calmer, at least. Well, anyway, they said they had heard of me from their <i>neighbors</i>, and so they came to me, seeing as they were so far from the hospital, and that the paramedics couldn't get to them in time. I told them they made the <i>right</i> choice, and prepared everything to get Mrs. Morgendorffer ready to have her baby. Her husband and I laid her her up on the table, and I then--<i>(looks around at everyone:) made up</i> a diagnosis that she needed to have a <i>cesarean</i>.</p>               


<p><i>(Present: Helen looks as she is about to faint, but Jake holds her steady, looking enraged, but to his credit, says nothing--Darren continues)</i></p>


<p>TURLEY: Of course, for my plan to work, I needed the <i>father</i> out of the way. So I poured a <i>little</i> of the ether for the <i>"surgery"</i> on Mrs. Morgendorffer on the <i>mask</i> I gave to him, just enough that he couldn't <i>smell</i> it, but enough to knock him <i>out</i>.</p> 


<p><i>(Present: Jake's eyes begin to turn red from being so angry, but Helen turns his head to her and mouths, "Control, Jakey, control"--it seems to work, for Jake calms down--Darren looks a bit apprehensive, but continues)</i></p>


<p>TURLEY: Mrs. Morgendorffer <i>flipped</i> when she saw her husband fall. I guess she figured he was something of a <i>wimp</i>, and didn't seem surprised.</p> 


<p><i>(Present: Jake's back up to "Explode Mode", now. Darren looks at him, slightly concerned, but Helen, holding Jake, nods at Darren to continue--which he reluctantly does)</i></p>


<p>TURLEY: I then went into <i>"emergency overdrive"</i>, telling her that her husband had fainted, and I couldn't help him <i>and</i> her. Under that pressure, I guessed she'd <i>crack</i>, which she <i>did</i>.</p>


<p><i>(Present: Now it's Helen's turn to get angry, with Jake holding her tightly, and motioning to Darren to continue the story, and he does with a slight pause)</i></p>


<p>TURLEY: After I put Mrs. Morgendorffer out with the ether, I performed the cesarean cut on her to make it <i>look</i> legitimate and took the baby out--<i>you</i>, Darren. You were crying and pretty healthy. I put a little <i>more</i> ether on Mr. Morgendorffer's face to keep him out a little longer, and then called the "agency". Someone came over from the illegitmate side of the "agency", and I <i>gave</i> them the baby--<i>you</i>. The legitimate side of the "agency" got the <i>story</i> of the runaway mother and the unwanted baby, which they gave to your adoptive parents, Darren. I then took the dead baby and told the Morgendorffers it--<i>their</i> baby--had <i>died</i>. No one, save for your birth parents, really questioned what happened to it. I simply told the authorities the baby died from a lack of oxygen, that and my <i>reputation</i> as a good obstetrician saved me from being exposed. The Morgendorffers were natually <i>devastated</i>, of course, but I figured they were young enough to have <i>more</i> kids, you would be going to a <i>(Present: Darren almost says <b>"rich"</b>, but changes it to) good</i> family, and the dead baby would have a <i>decent</i> funeral, whereas I would get my <i>money</i>. The way I saw it, <i>everyone</i> would come out on <i>top</i>, eh? <i>(Slight smile while Darren grows <b>furious</b>)</i></p>


     <p>Helen was softly crying now, with Jake holding her tenderly in his arms and thinking about ripping Turley's <i>spine</i> out of his back.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Pauses:)</i> At that moment, I--<i>lost</i> it. I <i>grabbed</i> Doctor Turley's <i>neck</i> and began to <i>choke</i> him. If Woo and Mrs. Turley hadn't <i>pulled</i> me away from him, I might've--<i>(grows quiet, looks down, closes eyes in pain)</i></p>


     <p>Helen got up suddenly and went to Darren's side, hugging him. At first, Darren grew <i>rigid</i>, but then he began to hug her <i>back</i>. Jake got up and put a hand on Helen and Darren's backs.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Recovers:)</i> Turley told me about the <i>cemetary</i> where you buried the baby you <i>thought</i> was me. <i>(Helen leans against Jake, sobbing)</i> It was <i>abandoned</i>--I figured you'd want to <i>forget</i> about what happened as soon as possible when I discovered you wanted to leave Dumas.</p> 

<p>HELEN: <i>(Looks alarmed through her tears:)</i> It's <i>true</i> we wanted to get <i>away</i> from Dumas, but we <i>didn't</i> forget <i>you</i>, Darren! We just--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Cuts her off gently:)</i> --You just didn't want to <i>remember</i> the <i>pain</i>. It's okay--<i>really</i>. I don't want to remember the <i>deaths</i> of my (adopted) parents. I <i>know</i> how you feel, <i>believe</i> me.</p>



     <p>Daria had watched her parents go through a <i>gamut</i> of emotions with almost a sense of <i>morbid</i> curiousity. From what appeared to be <i>joy</i> for some reason or another, turned into <i>anger</i>, and then to <i>sorrow</i>. Perhaps for the <i>first</i> time in her life, Daria was thoroughly and utterly <i>confused</i>. <i>What</i> had been said to her parents from this--<i>"Darren"</i> that had done such a <i>number</i> on them like <i>this</i>? She looked over to Quinn, and for the first time, saw <i>confusion</i> on her face, too.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(Looks lost:)</i> Daria, <i>what's</i> going on? <i>Why</i> are mom and dad so <i>sad</i>? What did that handsome guy <i>say</i> to them?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Searches for words, then looks determined, frowns:)</i> I don't know, Quinn, but I'm sure as <i>hell</i> am gonna go and <i>find</i> out--<i>(gets up)</i></p>


     <p>At this moment, <i>Jodie</i> and <i>Mack</i> arrived behind Daria and Quinn just as Daria was about to go over to the food court.</p>


<p>JODIE: Hey, Daria, Quinn. <i>(Daria and Quinn are shaken a bit, Jodie and Mack are taken aback for an instant:)</i> Hey, are you two <i>all right</i>? We didn't mean to <i>scare</i> you guys.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Looks at Quinn:)</i> No, um--we were just a little <i>startled</i>, that's all, <i>right</i>, Quinn?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Gets Daria's "signal":)</i> Uh, yeah, right, <i>startled. (Looks back at the food court, then back to the group)</i></p>


     <p>Jodie looked between the two and surmised <i>immediately</i> that something wasn't <i>quite</i> right, but decided to not press the issue right now. Mack then spoke.</p>


<p>MACK: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Hey, you two just <i>hanging out</i>, or what? Jodie and I wanted to get out of our home <i>prisons</i>, so we came down here to look around.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Resumes her expressionless tone:)</i> Quinn and I came to the mall to just look around like you. You know, I thought with the summer coming into full <i>bloom</i>, you guys would be gone on vacation just about like everyone <i>else</i> in Lawndale. Jane and her mom went to Arizona, and my parents are planning to take Quinn and <i>force</i> me <i>kicking</i> and <i>screaming</i> to the beach next week.</p>

<p>MACK: <i>(Smirks:) Kevin and Brittany's</i> not here--at least for a week, and <i>that's</i> vacation enough for me. <i>(Everyone snickers at this)</i> Thank God for <i>combination football and cheerleading camps.</i> Hopefully, when they get <i>back</i>, me and my family will be gone to California to visit my grandparents.</p>

<p>JODIE: I'm going to a <i>college</i> expo in Seattle for two weeks next month. You know my dad--<i>push, push, push</i> for college. I figure I can get in some sightseeing and visit my aunt in nearby <i>Redmond</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:) Redmond</i>, eh? See if you can go by that <i>video game company</i> and pick up a copy of <i>Cyberkron II</i>. I've been itching to find out if it's good as the original. <i>(Jodie smirks at this)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(In a bit of a rush, steals glances at the food court:)</i> Um, Daria, I'm gonna use the <i>restroom</i>, okay?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Occupied with talking to Jodie and Mack:)</i> Sure, Quinn--<i>(smirking:)</i> don't <i>fall</i> in. <i>(Mack and Jodie laugh at this, while Quinn gives Daria a quick glare, and goes on)</i></p>

     
     <p>Darren and his birth parents were walking toward the outside front of the mall.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Surprised:)</i>--A <i>DNA</i> test? I guess I can call the hospital and <i>arrange</i> for one--but I can take one <i>look</i> at you and <i>know</i> you're <i>our</i> son! <i>Why</i> do you want one?</p> 

<p>JAKE: <i>(Same reaction:)</i> Yeah, <i>why</i>? <i>(Leans over to Helen, low voice:) What's</i> DNA, honey? <i>(Helen looks up and sighs)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: I just want it to be <i>official</i>, that's all. Sounds a little <i>crazy</i>, I know, but I want everything to be on the <i>level</i>, with <i>no</i> doubts. <i>(Grins:)</i> Besides, wouldn't you want my <i>sisters</i> or any <i>extended</i> family members to have no <i>lingering</i> questions about whether or not I'm related to both of you by <i>blood</i>?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Eyes grow large:) OHMYGOSH</i>! The <i>girls</i>! <i>How</i> will they <i>react</i> to <i>this</i>, Jake?</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Gosh, Helen, I think they're gonna be <i>happy</i>! <i>(Looks at Darren, laughs:)</i> I know <i>I</i> am!</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Chuckles:)</i> I suppose you're <i>right</i>, Jakey. <i>(Turns to Darren, gasps:)</i> Oh, my <i>goodness</i>! Are you staying at a <i>hotel</i> or something? Because if you are, you can come stay with <i>us</i>, young man, and I'm <i>not</i> taking <i>"no"</i> for an answer! We have a guest room for you!</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>("Back up" mode:)</i> Yeah, <i>damn</i> straight! My son's not gonna stay in some out-of-the-way-dump!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Actually, it's at a nice motel by the highway--the <i>Stopover Motel</i>. Let me go to my motel room, check out, and come to your home.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Ponders:)</i> The <i>Stopover Motel</i>, yes, Jake and I know where that is--do you know where we <i>live</i>, Darren? We can <i>follow</i> you, and--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>--1111 Glen Oaks Lane</i>, Helen. <i>(Shows Helen and Jake his map:)</i> See, I've even <i>circled</i> it. I found <i>Cranberry Commons</i> with no trouble, so your home shouldn't be any problem to get to, either. I can drive by the motel, get my stuff and check out. I'll meet you at your house in a while.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Considers:)</i> Well, all right, Darren, if that's what you think is best. <i>(Grabs Jake's arm:)</i> Come on, Jakey, and then we can tell the girls that they have a--<i>(sobs, hugs a startled Darren again:)</i> a--<i>brother</i>!</p> 

<p>JAKE: <i>(Grins like an idiot:)</i> Okay, Helen, but can we get some <i>groceries</i> first? <i>(Looks at Darren:)</i> Since he'll be staying <i>with</i> us for a while, don't you think we'll need more <i>food</i> in the house? <i>(Helen rolls her eyes)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Exasperated sigh at Jake:)</i> I <i>suppose</i>, Jakey.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Begins to reach for his wallet:)</i> I can <i>help</i> pay--</p>

<p>JAKE & HELEN: <i>(Adamant tone:) Absolutely not</i>!</p>

<p>DARREN: But--</p>

<p>HELEN & JAKE: <i>(Same tone:) NO</i>! <i>(Both leave)</i></p>


     <p>Shaking his head slowly and chuckling, Darren watched Helen and Jake leave through the front doors, and then he went to the mall's side doors to get to his car. He had walked about a minute when he saw a bright-reddish long-haired young girl wearing a long-sleeved pink shirt with a yellow butterfly on the front of it, and blue jeans approaching him with a <i>"cute"</i> smile on her face, and her arms behind her back. Darren <i>sighed</i> to himself. <i>Another</i> girl attracted to him. When he had thought about it, <i>several</i> girls had asked <i>him</i> out at Eastward since Stephanie died, and he had turned them all <i>down</i> because he was <i>still</i> in mourning. Didn't they <i>understand</i> that he needed time to get <i>past</i> what had happened? It wasn't until Woo had pointed out his <i>looks</i> that it had occured to him about those times with the girls. Darren kindly gave the girl a <i>"Here we go again"</i> look as she spoke.</p>


<p>GIRL: <i>(Gasps when she sees his face, goes into her singy-songy, slightly seductive voice:)</i> Hi, I'm <i>Quinn</i>. You're that <i>"Darren"</i> guy, aren't you?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Surprised:)</i> Uh--yes, I am. <i>(Realizes something:)</i> Say, <i>how</i> did you know my name? <i>(Narrows eyes:) Wait a minute</i>. Did you say <i>"Quinn"</i>, as in Quinn <i>Morgendorffer</i>?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Delighted:) Yeah</i>! So, you <i>do</i> know my name, an' who I am! I saw you with my parents at the food court. <i>(Hesitates:)</i> Um, they seemed to be <i>crying</i> an' stuff when you were talkin' to them--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Trying to recover from the fact that he's talking to a girl who could be his sister:)</i> Ah, I can <i>explain</i> that--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Cuts him off:)</i> --No, no, it's <i>okay</i>! I know the <i>whole</i> story!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Shocked:)</i> You <i>DO</i>?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>Sure</i>! You work at <i>Cashman's</i>, right? <i>(Narrows her eyes:)</i> You're probably <i>new</i> there because I <i>definitely</i> would have seen you, since that is <i>the</i> place to go for fashion in Lawndale. You see, I'm guessing you told my parents that you agreed to get the <i>birthday gift</i> they wanted for me--of course, when you told them the <i>price</i> of the gift, they got really <i>upset</i> and began to <i>cry</i>. You calmed them down, and then told them they could pay for it in <i>monthly installments. (Smirks to Darren:)</i> You can tell me <i>what</i> they're gonna get me, you know--maybe over <i>dinner</i> at <i>Chez Pierre</i>?</p>
 

     <p>Darren looked at this girl, eyes wide open and mouth <i>agape</i>, utterly <i>stunned</i>, as if she had gone completely out of her <i>mind. This</i> was his <i>sister</i>?</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(Keeps talking:)</i> You're <i>shocked</i> to be going out with someone like <i>me</i>? Well, I can't <i>blame</i> you, Darren. <i>Lots</i> of guys want to be <i>with</i> me, but I gotta say <i>you</i> might the <i>cutest</i> one I've <i>ever</i> met. <i>(Reaches into her pocket, pulls out a compact:)</i> Wait a second, will you? Gotta put on some rouge. <i>(Begins to fix her face, while Darren continues to look at her, speechless)</i></p>


     <p>Daria looked around for Quinn, <i>annoyed</i>. After talking to Jodie and Mack, she had called for another taxi to pick her and Quinn up. She had then waited for Quinn to come out of the restroom, and when Quinn didn't show, Daria knew something was <i>up</i>. She checked the food court out, and not seeing her parents or that <i>"Darren"</i> fellow, had put it all together. Quinn probably had <i>followed</i> them out, possibly wanting to talk to this
--<i>"Darren"</i> alone about her <i>"gift"</i>--and possibly a <i>date</i>. Daria's suspicion was correct when she came to the side door and found Quinn talking to <i>"Darren"</i>. Upon her <i>first</i> glance of his face, which was somewhat <i>handsome</i>, even though Daria wasn't the type to say something like that <i>outright</i>, save once for <i>Trent</i>, and--<i>nope, that was a <b>passing fancy</b>, so put it out of your mind, Daria</i>--there was something about him that looked <i>familiar</i>, somehow, but she couldn't seem to <i>place</i> it. Daria reluctantly walked up to them.</p>


     <p>Darren was totally confused. This girl, possibly his <i>sister</i>, seemed to think he worked for <i>Cashman's</i> clothing, and was going to get a <i>"gift"</i> for her from her, and possibly his, birth parents! He was about to say something when he looked past Quinn and saw a plain-looking, short girl with brown shoulder-length hair, and wearing large, round-rimmed glasses and a green jacket over a dark orange shirt, with a black skirt and large, black, Doc Marten boots, coming towards them. As Darren watched her, he immediately noticed that she seemed to have a look of <i>no</i> emotion on her face. He became a bit <i>concerned</i> over <i>this</i> latest development--surely <i>she</i> wasn't <i>interested</i> in him as well? Quinn looked at Darren, caught his gaze, and <i>frowned</i>.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>Daria</i>, do you <i>mind</i>? I'm trying to talk to this <i>cute</i> guy Darren about my gift!</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:) Perish</i> the thought. I'm just wanting to tell you that when mom and dad come home and not find us there, they're gonna <i>freak</i> out. <i>(Looks at Darren:)</i> If you don't mind, uh--<i>"Darren"</i>, we've got to go.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks at Daria, eyebrow cocked:) Daria</i>, as in Daria <i>Morgendorffer</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Glances at Darren, a little surprised:)</i> Um, yeah, I'm Quinn's <i>si--</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Panics, cuts her off:) --Cousin</i>! She's my cousin! <i>(Daria frowns at Quinn)</i>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks at Quinn strangely for a second, smiles at Daria:)</i> I talked to you last night over the phone, Daria. You see--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Eyes wide open:)</i> --You don't want to get <i>her</i> gift--Daria's birthday <i>just</i> passed! You're getting <i>my</i> gift, okay?</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Having enough:)</i> Look--I'm <i>sorry</i>, Quinn, but I <i>don't</i> know <i>what</i> you're talking about! I wasn't here to talk to your parents about getting you a <i>"gift"</i> from them! I came here to talk to your parents about a <i>baby</i> they <i>thought</i> they had lost almost <i>twenty</i> years ago!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Narrows her eyes:) Hold it.</i> What do you mean <i>thought</i> they had lost? <i>Our</i> mom and dad <i>(Quinn frantically nods her head "no" to Darren:)</i> told us that we <i>almost</i> had a brother who was born, but died stillborn. What would <i>you</i> know about that?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Dramatic pause:)</i> Because <i>I'm</i> that brother, Daria, and I'm <i>alive</i>.</p>

     <p>Daria and Quinn looked at Darren wide-eyed, speechless, then Quinn <i>fainted</i>.</p>
