<p>Chapter 5 - Getting To Know You</p>



     <p>Quinn walked through a long hallway with doors, giggling, and having the <i>time</i> of her life. As she opened each door, there was a really handsome guy dressed in a suit behind it.</p> 

<p>GUY #1: Quinn, go out with <i>me</i>!</p>

<p>QUINN: Nah, but I'll call you, <i>Guy</i>, okay? <i>(Slams door in his face)</i></p>

<p>GUY #2: Quinn, go out with <i>me</i>!</p>

<p>QUINN: Maybe <i>next</i> week, Guy, okay? <i>(Slams door in his face)</i></p>
 

     <p>The same sequence continued until she reached the end of the hallway and came to a large red door. When she opened it, she saw a <i>really</i> handsome guy standing behind it.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(Completely spellbound, dreamy:) You</i>! I wanna go out with <i>you</i>!</p>                                                                    

<p>GUY: <i>(Hooking his arm around hers:)</i> Of course. By the way, my name's <i>Darren</i>. What's yours?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(In a seductive tone:)</i> It's <i>Quinn</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks stunned:)</i> D-did you say <i>Quinn</i>?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Looks confused:)</i> Um, yeah--so what?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Now delighted:) My God</i>, you're my <i>SISTER</i>!! <i>(Hugs her, kisses her on cheek)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Terrified:)</i> What are you <i>doing</i>? <i>Heelp meee--(everything goes black)</i></p>


     <p>Quinn struggled in the darkness, and then suddenly the blackness began to recede as she opened her eyes. She saw Daria looking down on her with a slight <i>smirk</i>, holding her hand, and Darren looking at her from over Daria's shoulder with more of a <i>concerned</i> look, as well as several other people behind him.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>Wakey, wakey</i>, <i>"cuz"</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: Is she all right, Daria?</p>

<p>DARIA: Eh, she'll <i>live</i>--more or less. Come on, Quinn. <i>(Helps Quinn up)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Motions to the other shoppers:)</i> She'll be fine, thanks. <i>(The shoppers disperse)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Looks at Darren warily, talks in a drained voice:)</i> Then it <i>wasn't</i> a dream. Y-you really <i>are</i> our <i>brother</i>?</p>

<p>DARREN: Pending a <i>DNA test</i> at the hospital tomorrow, by which I'm <i>assuming</i> will be positive, <i>yes</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(In a deadpan, skeptical tone, hiding her shock:)</i> And how, pray tell did this <i>miracle</i> come about? I can't believe mom and dad became <i>necromancers</i> and <i>conjured</i> you up.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Chuckles at Daria:)</i> No, but with what's happened to me these past few <i>weeks</i>, I feel like I've <i>returned</i> from the dead. Look, talk to your parents <i>first</i>. They <i>invited</i> me over to your house to spend the night. <i>(Grows quiet:)</i> I'd--like to get to <i>know</i> both of you better, if you'll <i>let</i> me.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Looking a bit surprised by his frankness:)</i> Um--<i>sure</i>, okay--I--<i>guess</i>.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Very quiet, looks down:)</i> Y-yeah, that sounds <i>good</i>.</p>


     <p>All three stared at each other a little awkwardly, then Daria spoke.</p>


<p>DARIA: Well, we'll see you at our house, then. Come on, Quinn. We have a taxi waiting on us in the front. <i>(Quinn looks at Darren red-faced, completely embarassed, while Darren looks as he wants to say something, but holds back)</i></p>


     <p>Darren watched them go back into the mall, then he went to his car.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Thought v.o., frowns: Well, Darren, why didn't you offer them a <b>ride</b>? That first-time little get-together went swimmingly well--like a sinking <b>rock</b>.) (Starts up car and backs out of parking space)</i></p>


     <p>Daria and Quinn walked out to the front of the mall for their taxi ride and waited in the pick-up zone.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(Still shell-shocked:)</i> I can't <i>believe</i> I came <i>on</i> to a guy who <i>might</i> be my own--own--my own <i>brother</i>! We could've almost--<i>EWWWWW</i>! What do they call <i>that</i>? <i>(Shudders, looks at Daria:) Insects</i>--?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sighs:) Incest</i>, and you're <i>beating</i> yourself up over <i>nothing</i>, Quinn--you didn't know anything about Darren <i>possibly</i> being our brother, <i>(smirks:)</i> and it's like you two didn't <i>kiss</i> or <i>something</i>.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Really disgusted:)</i> ICK! <i>Kissing</i> my <i>brother</i>? On the <i>mouth</i>? <i>EWWWWW! (Eyes grow big:) Something</i> like <i>S-E-X</i>? AAARGH! If this gets out, I'll be an <i>outcast</i> like <i>you</i>!</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> An <i>outcast</i> like <i>me</i>? Ah, just imagine--you, me, and Jane, all against the world of the <i>popular</i> and <i>fashionable</i>! You could make a speech that says, <i>"I saw the light! I now see that my previous life was a <b>lie! Shallow! Meaningless!</b> Throw off your <b>Guccis!</b> Throw off your <b>Pierre Cardins!</b> Become (faux gasp:) <b>BRAINS</b>! Do your homework! Study, baby, study!"</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Upset:)</i> I'm <i>serious</i>, Daria! You don't understand what this would <i>do</i> to my <i>reputation</i>!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> Quinn, no one knows about what you did except <i>me</i> and Darren, and <i>I'm</i> not--going--to--say--any--thing--<i>(realizes something, smiles:)</i> for a <i>price</i>.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Narrows her eyes:) You</i>--I <i>knew</i> it! What do you <i>want</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smug:)</i> You can do my <i>chores</i> around the house for <i>two weeks</i>.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Furious:) Two weeks</i>?! That's--that's--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Pretends like she talking to someone:)</i> --Yeah, <i>Sandi</i>, <i>Tiffany</i>, <i>Stacy</i>--I couldn't believe <i>what</i> Quinn did--all those <i>insects</i>, and--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Glares, stomps:)--All right</i>! <i>Two weeks!</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:) Excellent</i>. Our deal is <i>sealed</i>. I'll let you know later when you can start. <i>(Looks around, then at her watch:) Where</i> is that damn cab? It should have been here <i>20</i> minutes ago. <i>(Notices the sign beside the curb)</i> Oh, <i>hell</i>.</p>

<p>QUINN: Huh? What's the matter? What's on that sign, Daria?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Looks at the sign:)</i> It says that cabs run from here until <i>7:30 p.m.</i> It's <i>7:45 p.m.</i> now.</p> 

<p>QUINN: <i>(Gasps:)</i> Y-you <i>mean</i>--</p>

<p>DARIA: --It means we're <i>stuck</i> here unless we walk off the mall's parking lot and call a cab--or call mom and dad to come <i>back</i> and pick us up--and they'll <i>know</i> we've been out someplace <i>either</i> way.</p> 

<p>QUINN: <i>(Angry:) Damn it</i>, Daria! You and your <i>stupid</i> cabs!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Frowns:)</i> Hey, don't blame <i>me</i> if you <i>wagged</i> your <i>tounge</i> after a guy who <i>may</i> be our brother. <i>(Quinn glares at her like crazy, now)</i> Had you been <i>with</i> me, we could've gotten to the cab in time. <i>(Sighs:)</i> We'd better <i>call</i> mom and dad and get ready for the <i>third</i> degree. It's getting dark, and the parking lot's getting empty, and Mack and Jodie told me they were <i>leaving</i> after talking to me. <i>(Raises eyebrow at Quinn:)</i> I don't suppose <i>you</i> can get one of your <i>hundreds of boyfriends</i> to pick us up?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Frowns right back, arms crossed:)</i> Do I look like a freakin' <i>telephone</i> to you? I only talk <i>on</i> one, and <i>they</i> call me, <i>not</i> the other way around. <i>(Shrugs as an afterthought:)</i> Besides, I don't remember <i>any</i> of <i>Joey</i>, <i>Jeffrey</i>, and <i>Jamall's</i> numbers. Face it, we're <i>screwed</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: --That's <i>Jamie</i>.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Rolls her eyes:) Whatever</i>.</p>


     <p>After a moment, a green car drove from the side of the mall, stopping in front of Daria and Quinn. Both girls looked in and saw Darren at the wheel.</p>


<p>DARREN: Hey, you two. I drove around the lot and was ready to leave when I saw you standing at the front. <i>(Looks around:)</i> Obviously, your cab's not here, yet--?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Before Daria can say anything, still fuming:)</i> An' it <i>won't</i> be here either, at least not anymore tonight.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Concerned:)</i> What do you mean?</p>

<p>DARIA: Take a look at the sign. <i>(Darren does)</i> Unless we call our parents, or go off the lot to someplace else to call the cab, we're going nowhere.</p>

<p>DARREN: Ah, I see. <i>(Thinks for a second:)</i> Well, how about if <i>I</i> take you to your home--that is, if you can go with me to the <i>motel</i> I'm staying at and wait for me to check out and get my things. <i>(Quinn becomes alarmed)</i> Besides, your parents said that they were going to the grocery store before they come home. <i>(Shows phone:) I</i> have a cell phone you can call them on, in case they're at your home already.</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Considers:)</i> Well--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Cuts her off:)</i> --Daria, could you come with me for a <i>second</i>? Excuse us, Darren. <i>(Takes Daria's arm before Daria can say anything, pulls her some ways from the car:)</i> Are you <i>nuts</i>? Now I <i>know</i> this <i>"Darren's" not</i> our brother! He wants to take us to some <i>motel</i> or <i>something</i>! Our <i>brother</i> would <i>never</i> do something like <i>that</i>!</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks, deadpan:) Something</i>, Quinn? You mean like <i>S-E-X? (Quinn nods quickly, eyes wide open) (Looks up in mock thinking:)</i> Hmm--you, me, and him, a <i>threesome</i> in <i>bed</i>. Well, you can take the <i>left</i> side--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Suddenly stomps, frustrated:)--Damn it</i>, Daria! Why can't you take me <i>seriously</i> over a guy who wants to take us in <i>his</i> car?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Serious tone now, frowns:)</i> Now that's <i>ironic</i> coming from someone who <i>picked up</i> a wanna-be country music star on our way to <i>Fremont</i>, and asks guys over what <i>cars</i> they drive <i>all</i> the time. <i>(Note to reader: See of course, "Speedtrapped" for the Fremont comment) Look</i>, Quinn--for <i>some</i> reason, I'm willing to <i>believe</i> he's on the <i>level</i> with us. <i>(Looks over at Darren's car:)</i> He seems <i>genuinely</i> concerned about us, and our parents did <i>hug</i> him, <i>(ugh)</i> so let's give him the <i>benefit</i> of the doubt. He also offered us the use of his <i>phone</i>. Would a guy who wanted to do anything <i>bad</i> to us do something like <i>that</i>? <i>(Sees Quinn still not sure, sighs, reaches in her shirt pocket:)</i> Here--I'll give you my cannister of <i>pepper spray</i> to keep. If he tries <i>anything</i>, you can use it <i>on</i> him--but if he's <i>really</i> our brother and tries <i>nothing</i>, you're gonna feel awfully <i>foolish. (Thought v.o.: Not that you don't already, <B>"Insect Queen"</B>)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(In a rare moment of reflection, looks down, becomes quiet:) No</i>, that's okay, Daria, <i>keep</i> it.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow over Quinn's frankness:)</i> All right, then--now let's go back to Darren and get the hell outta here.</p>


     <p>Darren watched the two girls with a sense of <i>dread</i>. He looked at both of them with a deep, sad look on his face.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Thought v.o.: They don't trust me--I guess I can't blame them. Maybe I can--) (Sees Daria and Quinn coming back to the car, gives a small, hopeful smile)</i></p>


     <p>Daria and Quinn got into the car, with Daria riding shotgun.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Embarassed:)</i> Uh, Darren, we didn't mean to--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Cuts her off gently, smiles:)</i> --It's <i>okay</i>, Daria. I assume your parents told you to never ride with <i>strangers</i>, and to you two, <i>(adds quietly:)</i> I guess <i>I'm</i> one.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Slight smile, not quite Mona Lisa:)</i> Well, then, um--I guess we're going to have to <i>change</i> that, huh?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Chuckles:)</i> I guess. <i>(Gets cell phone from seat, gives it to Daria:)</i> Here, call your parents so they won't be worried, provided they've come from the store. Punch code <i>8-7-2-3-*</i> to activate it. <i>(Drives car out from the front of the mall while Daria does so)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(In a sheepish tone:)</i> Um, Darren?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Glances at her in the interior rearview mirror:)</i> Yes, Quinn?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Red-faced, hesitant:)</i> I-I'm <i>sorry</i> for--you know--what happened back at the mall--uh--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smiles:)</i> --It's <i>forgotten. (Smirks, pause:)</i> You know, I was actually <i>flattered</i> that someone with your <i>looks</i> would come <i>on</i> to <i>me</i>. I'd bet <i>all</i> the guys <i>fight</i> over you, huh?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Now gets back into "Regular Quinn" mode, smirks:) Thanks</i>! Weeeell--<i>yeah</i>. But it's so <i>silly</i> for them to do so--even if I don't <i>really</i> mind when they actually <i>do. (Darren looks at her with a perplexed frown in the mirror, while Daria rolls her eyes)</i> Speaking of which, <i>you've</i> probably have had a <i>lot</i> of <i>dates</i> like <i>me</i>, right? <i>(Smirks:)</i> I bet all the <i>girls</i> are after <i>you</i>, huh?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Sighs, apprehensive, thinking of Stephanie, and what's happened since with other girls:) Yes</i>, Quinn, I guess you <i>can</i> kind of say that the girls <i>have</i> been <i>after</i> me. <i>(Quinn smirks, thinking Darren's having the same "problems" as she does)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(While on Darren's cell phone:)</i> Nobody's home on the range yet. I guess we're still in the clear.</p>

<p>DARREN: Don't worry, you two--<i>I'll</i> speak up <i>for</i> you if they say anything.</p>

<p>DARIA: How far is the motel where you're staying from here?</p>

<p>DARREN: About 15 minutes.</p>

<p>DARIA: Okay--to pass the time, maybe you can tell us <i>why</i> our parents seemed to be really <i>upset</i> when you talked to them. It must've been one <i>hell</i> of a story you gave them about telling them you're their--<i>son--(adds:)</i> and um, our uh--<i>brother</i>.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Frowns deep in thought, glances at Daria:)</i> You might say that. <i>(Sighs:)</i> I'll give you two the <i>lowdown</i>, but I <i>warn</i> you--it's <i>not</i> for the faint of heart. <i>(Quinn shudders in the back seat, while Daria merely shrugs)</i></p>


<p><i>(The "Stopover Motel", about 15 minutes later)</i></p>


     <P>The car arrived in the motel's parking lot. Darren looked back at a <I>crying</I> Quinn, while Daria's expression was <I>(unsurpisingly)</I> unreadable.</P>


<P>DARREN: <I>(Clearly concerned:)</I> Quinn, are you all right? Daria, could you reach in the glove compartment and get some of those fast-food napkins, please? <I>(Daria gets them and gives the napkins to Quinn)</I></P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Takes the napkins while sobbing, and wipes her eyes:)</I> I--it's <I>terrible</I>! That--that--<I>creep</I>! How could someone do <I>that</I>? <I>(Frowns:)</I> I hope--I hope he <I>rots</I> in <I>hell</I>! <I>(Daria looks slightly surprised at that comment)</I></P>

<P>DARREN: Believe me, Quinn--I've had thoughts that were <I>nearly</I> as bad, but what's done is <I>done</I>, and I can't change it. <I>(Pauses, glances over at Daria:)</I> Eh--are <I>you</I> okay, Daria?</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Looks at Darren, no expression on face or voice:)</I> I'm <I>fine</I>.</P>


     <P>Darren stared at her for a second more, trying to read her emotions (fat chance), then glanced back to Quinn.</P>


<P>DARREN: Um--I'll get my stuff and check out. It'll take a few minutes. <I>(Gets out, goes to his room)</I></P>


     <P>Quinn watched Darren leave, then looked in the front seat at Daria, who simply looked forward without saying a word. Quinn hesitated for a moment, then spoke.</P>


<P>QUINN: <I>(Timidly:)</I> D-Daria? Are you <I>sure</I> you're--</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Furious, turns on Quinn:) --Damn it</I>, Quinn, I <I>said</I> I was <I>fine</I>! I mean, <I>Darren's</I> the one you should be asking, <I>not</I> me! <I>(Quinn cringes back in shock:)</I> Why shouldn't both you <I>and</I> me <I>be</I> fine?! <I>We're</I> not the one's who've been <I>deprived</I> from each other by some sick <I>S.O.B.</I>, who kept our brother <I>from</I> us for almost <I>twenty</I> years! A brother who could've been there <I>for</I> us, a brother who <I>never</I> had the chance to <I>live</I> in our family because of a <I>bastard's</I> debt! You--<I>(looks at Quinn, suddenly remorseful, shocked that she could react like that:)</I> oh, God, Quinn--<I>(grows quiet, looks pained:)</I> I--I'm <I>sorry. You</I> didn't do <I>anything</I> to me--I--don't know <I>what</I> came over me--I've <I>never</I> been <I>that</I> angry before.</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Gives a rare genuine smile at her sister, reluctantly puts a hand on her shoulder:)</I> It--it's <I>okay</I>, Daria. <I>(Nervous chuckle:)</I> Geez, remind me to <I>never</I> get you <I>that</I> mad, okay?</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Smirks, resumes normal deadpan tone:) Believe</I> me, you've <I>tempted</I> me a lot of times, <I>"cuz"</I>, but I'll save the <I>usual</I> sibling teasing and tormenting for <I>you. (Frowns, looks off into space:)</I> For that <I>slime</I> Turley, killing would've been too <I>good</I> for him, not that it <I>matters</I> now. Let's see--I would've started with a long, <I>arduous</I>, Turkish torture technique that would've eventually broken his <I>legs</I>. Next, I would've <I>pulled out</I> his <I>fingernails</I>, then--</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Shuts her eyes, shaking her head in disgust:) --EWWWW</I>! Come <I>on</I>, Daria! <I>Stop</I> it! That's <I>too</I> gross!</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Cocks an eyebrow:)</I> Oh, <I>really</I>--and what would <I>you</I> have done to him--recommended an <I>unfashionable makeover</I> on his <I>face</I>?</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Rolls her eyes:) Daaaria</I>! I would've just, well--<I>(grows quiet, reconsiders:)</I> gee, I guess <I>anything</I> you said would've been <I>okay. (Daria again looks surprised at this)</I> We really were <I>depraved</I>--</P>

<P>DARIA: --<I>Deprived</I>--</P>

<P>QUINN: --Yeah, <I>whatever</I>, of our brother, weren't we? <I>(Pauses, grows quiet:)</I> What do we do <I>now</I>, Daria? How do we get to <I>know</I> him?</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Shrugs:)</I> I guess we just <I>talk</I> to him. <I>(Pauses, looks around:)</I> Ah, Quinn, <I>promise</I> me you won't say <I>anything</I> to Darren or our parents about my little <I>outburst</I>, okay? <I>(Smirks:)</I> After all, the <I>"Misery Chick"</I> has a <I>"reputation"</I> to keep.</P>

<P><I>(Note to reader: The term "Misery Chick" comes from the 'Daria' episode of the same name, courtesy of Tommy Sherman, of course--or is that "Sheridan"?)</I></P>

<P>QUINN: Sure, I <I>won't--(gets a scheming smirk on her face:)</I> for a <I>price</I>.</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Narrows her eyes:)</I> Why you <I>little</I>--</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Talks to an imaginary person, smug:)</I> --Sure, <I>mom, dad, Darren</I>-- Daria <I>really</I> showed a <I>lot</I> of <I>emotion</I> over the adoption story, and--</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Curt:)</I> --Okay, <I>fine</I>. I'll <I>drop</I> the two-week chore deal, and we'll call it a <I>draw</I>, capeesh?</P>

<P>QUINN: I don't know what this <I>"capeesh"</I> is exactly, but I heard <I>"draw"</I>, and that's good enough for me. <I>(Smirks:)</I> Our deal is <I>sealed</I>.</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Glares at Quinn:)</I> Okay, then. <I>(Gets Darren's phone:)</I> I'm trying mom and dad again. <I>(Dials, listens to rings:)</I> Hello, <I>Dad? (Flinches:) Whoa</I>, Dad, <I>calm down</I>, we're fine. <I>(Pauses:)</I> Yeah, Quinn's with me, and we're with <I>Darren. (Another pause:)</I> That's right, <I>Darren</I>--you know, the guy who <I>may</I> be Quinn and mine's <I>brother</I>? <I>(Another pause:)</I> After he checks out. Look, we'll <I>explain</I> when we get back, but <I>you</I> guys have some <I>explaining</I> to do, too. <I>(Another pause:)</I> About your <I>little</I> secret you and mom <I>kept</I> from us over your meeting him. What's that, <I>mom</I> wants to <I>talk</I> to me? <I>(Begins to gently tap the phone:)</I> Um, Dad, we're <I>breaking up</I>, I can't hear you anymore. See ya. <I>(Clicks off the cell phone)</I></P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Apprehensive:)</I> I guess they're at <I>home</I>, huh?</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Deadpan:)</I> Your sense of <I>deduction</I> hasn't dulled yet, I see. <I>(Sighs:)</I> Well, I hope Darren can <I>rescue</I> us, because there's gonna be <I>hell</I> to pay if he can't.</P> 


     <P>Darren walked out of the motel with his belongings, and put them in the car's trunk. He got into the car.</P>


<P>DARREN: Everything's taken care of now, you two.</P>

<P>DARIA: If not <I>now</I>, it <I>will</I> be when we get home. I called there, and our parents know we're <I>with</I> you.</P>

<P>DARREN: Hey, it's okay. Like I told you, I'll <I>explain. (Starts up the car:)</I> Since you two are with me, I won't need my map to tell me how to get to your house, so you can show me the way, okay?</P>


     <P>About 15 minutes later, Darren's car came to the Morgendorffer's home base, and Darren, Daria, and Quinn got out. Jake <I>bolted</I> out of the house, excited, while Helen came out, and gave her daughters <I>"The Look"</I>.</P>


<P>JAKE: Hey, <I>Big Guy</I>! Need any <I>help</I> with your stuff?</P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(Opens the trunk:)</I> Uh, sure, but some of what I have is a little <I>heavy</I>, so be--</P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Jumps right in and grabs a bag, and he promptly strains to lift it:) HUURGH</i>! You've--got--a--lot--of--stuff--in--here--don't--you?</P>

<P>DARREN: It's some <I>dumbells</I>. I <I>work out</I>.</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Starts to walk into the house:)</I> But <I>Quinn</I> is out <I>here</I>, not in your bag.</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Glares, follows Daria:) Real</I> funny, Daria.</P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(Quietly chuckles at Daria's remark, sees Jake, goes forward:)</I> Do you need any--</P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Waves him off, struggling with the bags:)</I> --No--no! I--have--it! <I>(Drags bag and himself in the house)</I></P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(After leading everyone into the living room:)</I> Daria! Quinn! <I>How</I> did you know where your father and I were, and <I>why</I> did you follow us, and <I>how</I> did you meet Darren?</P>

<P>DARIA: Sorry, Mom, but Quinn and I are <I>sworn</I> to <I>secrecy</I>--you know, <I>"secrecy"</I>, a word you and dad have become <I>familiar</I> with? <I>(Helen is about to say something, when Jake speaks)</I></P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Very contrite:)</I> Honey, <I>please</I> don't get <I>mad</I> at the girls. I-- <I>accidently</I> let out where we were going this morning while leaving for work.</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Really angry:) JAKE</i>! I <I>knew</I> I--<I>(Darren steps in at this point)</I></P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(Smoothly interjects:)</I>--No offense, but can't we <I>forget</I> about <I>how</I> Daria and Quinn found out what was going on? I told them <I>everything</I> about the adoption and what Doctor Turley did, and quite <I>frankly</I>, they took what I said well. <I>(Pauses:)</I> I just want to <I>enjoy</I> my stay here, okay? <I>(Looks down in Helen's eyes, smiles)</I></P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Softens, hugs Darren:)</I> Oh--well, I <I>suppose</I> it's okay, Darren. <I>(Daria raises an eyebrow, and Quinn looks shocked, Jake sighs in relief)</I> Well, son, what do you <I>think</I> about our home?</P> 

<P>Darren looked around, and then did a bit of a double-take. This place was--<i>huge</i> for an upper-middle class home, with it's high ceilings and wide-open living room. From what he could see of the kitchen and dining room, it was the same thing. Certainly, it was <i>nowhere near</i> the size of the mansion, but it was an impressive-looking interior nevertheless. Maybe it would not be so bad when his birth family, assuming they <i>were</i> his birth family that he expected them to be after the DNA test, found out about his estimated personal fortune. These people <i>seemed</i> well-off. He smiled out of courtesy to Helen, and spoke.</p>

<p>DARREN: It's really a <i>nice</i> place you have here, very--<i>homey</i>.</p> 

<p>HELEN: Thank you, Darren. <i>(Looks at Jake:) JAKE</i>! <i>(Darren flinches at Helen's shout)</i> Don't just <i>stand</i> there! Take Darren's things and show him to his room! I'll serve the lasagna in the dining room, and you all can wash up! <i>(Helen goes back into the kitchen)</i></p>

<p>JAKE: Huh? Oh, right, dear! C'mon, Big Guy, and follow me! <i>(Strains to pick up Darren's bag, while Darren picks up his other bag and follows Jake, with Daria and Quinn in tow)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Talks to Darren in a low tone:)</i> Hey, how did you do <i>that</i> to mom?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Perplexed, glances back:)</i> Eh? Do <i>what</i>?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Same tone as Daria:)</i> You know, <i>calm</i> her down. God, I've <i>never</i> seen <i>anyone</i> do that to her.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>Ding-a-ling's</i> right. Mom seems to have developed a <i>soft</i> spot for you--<i>(adds:)</i> quite <i>impressive</i> for someone who <i>just</i> met her.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Surprised:)</i> Really? Well, if everything's on the <i>level</i> about that DNA test tomorrow, then I am her and your dad's <i>son</i>. She might've responded to me like that for <i>that</i> purpose. Besides, I was just trying to bring in some <i>peace</i> for everyone. <i>(Daria ponders this, then smirks at Quinn)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow at Daria, in the low tone:) What</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Leans back to Quinn:)</i> Just thinking on my little <i>"theory"</i> about if our brother had never <i>"died"</i>, remember? He'd be a <i>"peacemaker"</i>? <i>(After a moment, Quinn gives a look that says, "Ohhh, yeahhh...")</i></p>


     <p>Jake lead Darren, Daria, and Quinn into the guest room. It was a simple space, with a full-sized bed, a dresser, a closet, and a desk and chair. Jake slid the bag beside Darren's bed, and stretched his back in relief.</p>


<p>JAKE: Here you go, son! There are towels and toiletries in the closet, and the bathroom's right across the hall! <i>(Looks eager, gets up in Darren's face:)</i> Do you <i>need</i> anything else?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Recoils from Jake slightly:)</i> Oh, ah, no, this'll <i>do</i>, thank you.</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Thumbs up:) Okay</i>, Big Guy! Don't <i>hesitate</i> to ask for <i>anything</i>! Oh, and <i>dinner</i> is a-comin' up! <i>(Leaves)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Stares after Jake for a moment, looks back at the girls, eyebrows raised:)</i> Is he <i>always</i>--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan, smirks:) --Yep</i>.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Ditto:) --Uh-huh</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks back at where Jake left, slightly concerned, in a whisper:) My God. (Resumes normal tone:)</i> Well, uh, I guess I'll wash up for dinner--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Excited:)</i> --And after dinner, I can <i>show</i> you <i>my</i> room!</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Don't <i>kill</i> him with the <i>cuteness</i> in your room, Quinn--he <i>just</i> got here. <i>(Darren looks at Daria inquisitively)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Rolls her eyes, annoyed:)</i> At least it's better than the <i>schizo</i> room you're living in--you'll probably <i>scare</i> Darren out of there when he <i>sees</i> it. <i>(Darren looks at Quinn, begins to grin)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:) "Schizo"</i>, as in <i>schizophrenia</i>? Hey, you know what my room <i>used</i> to be used for--I, for one, am <i>damned</i> impressed. You haven't been <i>sneaking</i> a peek at the <i>dictionary</i>, have you? <i>(Darren's beginning to chuckle quietly, looks between the two, amused at this exchange)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Makes a disgusted face:) EWWW</i>! You mean like a <i>"brain"</i>? <i>(Waves her off:)</i> Daria, we <i>popular</i> people don't have <i>time</i> for such things--</p>

<p>DARIA: --Of course you popular people don't. You're all so busy being so <i>shallow</i> and <i>phony</i>, and <i>obsessed</i> with your appearance, that even the <i>notion</i> of a looking in a dictionary, possibly opening up those closed-off, <i>peanut-sized</i> brains you all possess would be <i>sacrilegious</i>.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Narrows her eyes at Daria:)</i> I don't know exactly what that <i>means</i>, but--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> --Then look it up in a <i>dictionary</i>. It's between <i>"sacrifice"</i> and <i>"sacrosanct"</i>, and it's an adjective of <i>"sacrilege"</i>. If you wish, I can let you look through <i>mine</i>.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Frustrated, angry:)</i> You're such a <i>loser</i>, Daria! <i>(Looks at Darren:)</i> You see with what <i>I</i> have to put up with? <i>(Leaves Darren's room in a huff)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: Ah, <i>"loser"</i>, the old <i>fallback--(shouts at Quinn in the hallway:)</i> don't <i>ever</i> change, Quinn! <i>(Turns to Darren:)</i> As you can see, Quinn and I get along like <i>typical</i>, teen-age siblings. You can <i>join</i> in on our little <i>disputes</i> anytime you want, you know, to feel right at <i>home</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Laughs:)</i> I think I'll just sit back and <i>watch</i>, okay? I'm kind of <i>new</i> at this sort of thing. <i>(Grows quiet, smiles, thought v.o.: I have two sisters.)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Leaves the room, followed by Darren:)</i> Well, we'd better remove the <i>grit</i> and <i>grime</i> from the <i>ends</i> of our <i>front limbs</i> and join the others to consume <i>nourishment</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Grins:)</i> You mean wash our hands and go to eat?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Hmm--didn't I <i>say</i> that already? <i>(Both go in the bathroom)</i></p>


     <p>Daria and Darren came downstairs to the dining room, where Helen, Jake, and Quinn were sitting at the table waiting for them. Darren and Daria sat down on the same side of the table.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(While sitting down at the table, looks around, deadpan:)</i> Wow, we're back in the <i>acclaimed</i> dining room again for the <i>second</i> time in several months. <i>(Looks at Darren:)</i> You should be so <i>honored</i>--you <i>share</i> this distinction with that <i>phony</i> wanna-be teen-ager fashion editor of <i>Val</i> Magazine--<i>Val. (Helen and Quinn glare at Daria, while Jake continues to look at Darren like a grinning idiot)</i></p>

<p><i>(Note to reader: See "The Lost Girls" for the "Val" thing, obviously)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Yes, I've <i>heard</i> of her. My--<i>(looks at Helen uneasily, checks himself) adopted</i> mother said that she was a bit of a <i>flake</i>. You all <i>met</i> her?</p>

<p>DARIA: Yep--she was an <i>egotisical control freak. (Smirks:)</i> Put her in her <i>place</i>, though. <i>(Gets a portion of lasagna along with Darren)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Curious:)</i> Darren? Did your--<i>(slightly hesitant:) mother</i> work in fashion?</p>

<p>DARREN: Yes ma'am--she was a <i>fashion designer. (Quinn's eyes light up)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Excited:)</i> She <i>was</i>? Wow! What was her <i>name</i>?</p>

<p>DARREN: Um--<i>Grace Coverton</i>.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Looks up:) Grace Coverton</i>--hmm--nope, never heard of her.
Was she with any fashion company?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Feeling a little uncomfortable he's going through with this "cover":)</i> She--worked at <i>Circa</i> clothing.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Really excited now:) Circa</i>? <i>The</i> Circa Fashion Company? The Fashion Club <i>raves</i> over their clothes at <i>Cashman's</i>! I'm thinking of going to the <i>Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising</i> in California after high school myself, and then working <i>at</i> Circa.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(While eating:) "Fashion Club"</i>? You belong to one at your school?</p>

<p>QUINN: Oh, yeah! There's me, the vice-president, <i>Sandi Griffin</i>, the <i>(sounding slightly disgusted)--president</i>, <i>Tiffany Blum-deckler</i>, our treasurer, and <i>Stacy Rowe</i>, our secretary. We watch out for any fashion <i>no-no's</i> at our school--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> --And just about <i>anyone</i> or <i>anything</i> else at school that's a no-no. With <i>your</i> grades, Quinn, going to fashion school is most <i>definitely</i> a <i>no-no</i>. Maybe you should set your sights a little <i>lower</i>, you know, like on <i>packing and stacking</i> clothes in the fashion <i>warehouse</i>? I hear they're <i>always</i> looking for a <i>truck driver</i>, or perhaps you're afraid to break a <i>nail</i> at the wheel or on the <i>pallet jack</i>? <i>(Quinn glares at Daria)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Frowns at Daria:)</i> Daria, that's <i>quite</i> enough. <i>(Looks at Darren, smiles:)</i> Quinn's grades are <i>improving</i>--</p>

<p>DARIA: </i>(Mutters while eating:) --From <i>F's to D's</i>, <i>quite</i> an improvement. <i>(Helen and Quinn look really angry at Daria, while Darren catches this, and tries to diffuse the situation)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Uh, I <i>know</i> some of the people that worked with my mother at Circa. Maybe I can <i>talk</i> with someone there and see if I can get you to work as an <i>intern</i> during the <i>next</i> summer before you go to FIDM, or at a <i>branch</i> of Circa near there.</p> 

<p>QUINN: <i>(Shocked, estatic, gets up and runs around the table to hug a startled Darren:)</i> Oh, <i>thanks</i>, Darren! I can't wait to <i>tell</i> Sandi and the Fashion Club! <i>(Goes back to her seat, sits down)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Stunned and delighted:)</i> Darren, can you <i>really</i> do <i>that</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Before Darren can speak:)</i> He can if he has a <i>staff</i> and is standing in front of the <i>Red Sea. (Darren tries not to laugh at this, while Quinn looks ready to scream murder. Helen gives a look to Daria that says "Strike Two", and Jake keeps staring at Darren like a grinning idiot)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Well, if Quinn has good grades, <i>(Daria smirks a "Yeah, right" look on her face) yes</i>. Let's just say I have some--<i>"clout"</i> with my (adopted) mom's co-workers. <i>(Notices Jake staring at him, looks at Helen and Daria, then quickly looks down at his food:)</i> This is really <i>delicious</i> lasagna--uh, Daria, what do <i>you</i> plan to be?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Before Daria can answer, sneers:)</i> She's just gonna be some <i>dumb</i> writer, or something. <i>(Eats while Helen glares at Quinn)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smiles, inquisitive:)</i> Really? Are you thinking about being a <i>journalist</i> or an <i>author</i>?</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Now a little uncomfortable that she's the center of attention:)</i> Um--maybe a journalist, maybe an author, I'm not sure yet. I've been submitting transcripts to <i>several</i> colleges.</p>

<p>DARREN: Oh? Any one in <i>particular</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Nah, but I'm trying to <i>narrow</i> it down. <i>(Takes another bite)</i></p>

<p>JAKE: Hey, <i>Big Guy</i>! <i>(Darren looks at Jake a bit uneasily over the "Big Guy" comment, Daria notices this and gives a slight smirk)</i> What college are <i>you</i> going to?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>Eastward College</i>. I'm going after a bachelor's degree in <i>business administration. (Daria cocks a slight eyebrow)</i> I had a <i>3.9</i> grade point average for this year. <i>(Daria cocks an impressed eyebrow)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Falsetto surprised voice:) Ohhhh</i>! Eastward College! Do you plan to <i>run</i> your <i>own</i> business someday?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Slight smirk:)</i> Um--you <i>might</i> say that.</p> 

<p>JAKE: Say, what'd your um--<i>dad</i> do?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Quickly searches for words:)</i> He--worked in <i>computers</i>. He was very good in creating programs for them and repairing them.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(After a quick glance at Daria:)</i> Are you involved in any <i>clubs</i> or anything, Darren?</p> 

<p>DARREN: I'm just in one right now--the <i>Eastward Alumni Society</i>. We help those whose who graduate find employment, and stay in touch with the college after they get jobs, and we are active in recruiting new students. I probably will wait until my <i>senior</i> year to get into a few more clubs. Right now, my class schedule is just too much.</p> 

<p>JAKE: Do ya play any <i>sports</i>, Big Guy?</p>

<p>DARREN: Well, in addition to working out with weights and jogging, I play some tennis and <i>golf</i>, and--</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Excited:) --Golf</i>? I <i>love</i> golf! How about you and me <i>play</i> some holes this weekend? <i>(Helen rolls her eyes)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Er, um--sure, I guess.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Smirks, looks at Darren:)</i> I <i>can't</i> wait to tell the <i>Fashion Club</i>--</p>

<p>DARIA: --<i>Especially</i> Sandi--</p>

<p>QUINN: --about <i>you</i>, Darren! They're gonna be <i>so</i> jealous I have a <i>gorgeous</i> brother!</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Slightly blushes:)</i> Ah, thank you, Quinn, I--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Cuts him off:)</i> --Could I um, <i>borrow</i> your phone, Darren? I gotta tell <i>Larry</i> I <i>won't</i> be going out with him tonight. <i>(Daria, Jake, and Helen look stunned over this)</i> I'll just explain to him that he can take me out <i>another</i> night!</p> 

<p>DARREN: Sure, Quinn, it's on its charger in my room. The access code is--</p>

<p>QUINN: --8-7-2-3-*, I know! <i>Thanks</i>! <i>(Gets up, rushes out the kitchen)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Looking annoyed, shouts after Quinn:)</i> Now, <i>Quinn</i>--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> --It's no problem. I guess she wants to get used to having her, uh, <i>big brother</i> help her out.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirking:)</i> Either that, or she's just <i>learning</i> how to <i>use</i> you to help <i>her</i> out.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Frowns, ready to explode:) DARIA</i>--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Getting involved again, smoothly interjects:)</i> --Hey, it's all right. I suppose big brothers are there to <i>help</i> out their little sisters, and I don't mind. <i>Really</i>, I don't. <i>(Reaches across table, puts hand on Helen's, which calms her down. Daria cocks an eyebrow)</i></p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Looks up, grins like a madman, shakes his fist:)</i> You <i>see</i>, Old Man? <i>I</i> have a <i>son</i>! What do ya think of 'ol Jakey, <i>now</i>, you selfish <i>bastard</i>? <i>(Darren follows Jake's lead and looks around at the ceiling, sees nothing, cuts his eyes back down at Jake while keeping his head in the "up" position and glances at him, eyebrow cocked, and feeling a little rattled by Jake's tirade. Daria looks at Darren and smirks again)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: JAKE! Will you <i>stop--(her cell phone rings:) helloooo</i>? Ah, <i>Eric</i>, I'm <i>so</i> glad you returned my message. I want to explain <i>why</i> I left work early today. <i>(Pauses:) Nooooo</i>--of course I can come in <i>Saturday</i> for a few <i>hours</i>--</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Still looking up in his little tirade:)</i> --That's <i>right</i>, you <i>tyrant</i>, I'm the <i>man</i>, now! <i>Bastard</i>! My son is an <i>extension</i> of <i>me</i>! <i>(Darren turns a little pale over that remark)</i> What do you <i>think</i> about </i>that</i>?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(At the same time:)</i> Eric, I have to say--<i>JAKE</i>! Will you stop with the <i>damn</i>--<i>(quickly changes her tone:)</i> oh no, Eric, not <i>you</i>.</p>  

<p>DARIA: <i>(Leans over to Darren, lowers her voice:)</i> Are you <i>sure</i> you want that DNA test to be <i>positive</i>? You may <i>regret</i> it.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Stares ahead, blinking, with a blank look on his face:)</i> Um, ah, will you all <i>excuse</i> me for a moment, please? I--think I--<i>left</i> something out in my car. <i>(Gets up and leaves the table, and the moment he gets out of their sight, rushes out the front door)</i></p>


     <p>Darren ran out to the front yard and looked around the upper-middle class neighborhood. He looked up at the now-nighttime sky and then leaned forward against his car, with his arms stretched out, and his hands on its top, looking down.</p>

     <p>Then he <i>laughed</i>.</p>
                                                                                                                                                             	<p>Not <i>just</i> a laugh, oh no, but <i>a</i> laugh, the type of a laugh that could wake the <i>dead</i>, the type of a laugh that could be heard over a <i>roaring</i> crowd at a football game. A laugh that could not be <i>controlled</i>, nor would the person that was doing it would want it <i>to</i> be controlled. Darren was laughing <i>so</i> hard, his face turned <i>red</i>. He bent over <i>holding</i> his stomach, slowly <i>shaking</i> his head, and <i>tears</i> started to form in his eyes. He turned his back on the side of the car, and <i>slid</i> down slowly until he was sitting on the driveway and laying back against the bottom of the car's door, holding his knees. He was so into his laugh that he didn't see <i>Daria</i> come out of the house and look down on Darren's <i>giggling</i> form.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:) Ahem</i>. Did you find <i>what</i> you were looking for <i>in</i> your car, or did it <i>fall out</i> in the <i>yard</i>?</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Caught in mid-laugh, suddenly looks up at Daria, looking like a deer caught in the headlights:)</i> Oh, eh--<i>Daria</i>! <i>(Jumps up:)</i> Look, I'm <i>sorry</i>! I can <i>explain</i>--</p>

<p>DARIA: --There's <i>no</i> need--it's <i>okay</i>. I <i>officially</i> welcome you to the Morgendorffer <i>lunatic asylum</i>. Of course, if you would have <i>left</i> here, I <i>wouldn't</i> have <i>blamed</i> you.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Glances at her for a second, not sure if she's kidding, then wipes his eyes:)</i> I--<i>how</i> can you--</p>

<p>DARIA: --<i>Survive</i>? <i>(Leans back against Darren's car, crosses her arms:)</i> It's quite <i>simple</i>, actually--I just go into my <i>own</i> little world and totally <i>disdain</i> the <i>insanity</i> and <i>stupidity</i> that confronts me <i>everyday</i> of my life, a <i>hell</i> that has <i>lasted</i> until this <i>very</i> day.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Grins, leans against his car like Daria:)</i> Hmm--<i>that</i> simple, huh?</p>

<p>DARIA: Pretty much. Occasionally, I'll come out it and <i>humor</i> myself with the recommended <i>doses</i> of <i>sarcasm</i> used on the <i>unsuspecting</i> recipients of my verbal barbs. <i>You</i>--?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Wipes his eyes again, with a small smile:)</i> I haven't gone <i>through</i> what you have. <i>(Smile begins to fade:) My</i> hell came on me in the span of about <i>two months</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Grows quiet:)</i> I'm--<i>sorry</i> about your--<i>parents</i> dying, Darren.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks up at the stars, sighs:)</i> Oh, it's not <i>just</i> that. You see, Daria, I had a girlfriend named <i>Stephanie Reardon</i>. I--<i>loved</i> her. She was <i>very</i> beautiful, and--I was about to ask her to <i>marry</i> me.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Stunned, not knowing what to say:)</i> I--um--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Seemingly talking to himself more than Daria while still looking at the night sky:)</i>  --She died of a <i>cerebral hemorrhage</i>. It was so <i>sudden</i>, the bleeding so <i>great</i> on her brain, that the doctors couldn't get to her in time. <i>(Snaps his fingers:) That</i> fast. <i>(Looks now at Daria, with a sad look on his face, voice low:)</i> You know, that happened only a little over a <i>month</i> before my (adopted) parents died.</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Searches for words, looks down, even more shocked:)</i> Darren--I--I don't know what to say--</p>

<p>DARREN: --It's okay. I never told anyone other than my (adopted) parents, best friend, and aunt that I was going to marry her. You're the <i>first</i> person <i>outside</i> of those people to hear that. <i>(Hesitates, stares down at her, frowns to himself for a moment:)</i> I don't know <i>why</i> I told you that, Daria. <i>(Pauses:)</i> I also don't know why I saying this--but, well--there's something about you that I can--<i>trust. (Daria looks down, shocked and blushes a little after hearing this) Silly</i>, isn't it? I mean, I <i>just</i> met you and your family! <i>(Chuckles quietly:)</i> I didn't know what to expect when I did, except I didn't think it was--well, so <i>funny. (Looks off:)</i> I guess I just <i>needed</i> to laugh. I held a lot of <i>pain</i> inside of me for awhile, and my--well--<i>possible</i> birth family provided the <i>impetus</i> to let out my pain by <i>laughter. (Chuckles again, this time a little louder:)</i> I hope you don't think that I've gone off the <i>deep end</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Gets back to her usual sardonic self, Mona Lisa smile:)</i> If you have, I can tell you that you're right at <i>home</i> here--<i>no</i> pun intended there. <i>(Looks at watch while Darren grins:)</i> Hey, it's getting pretty late. You wanna go in, or add some <i>more</i> laughter out here?</p> 

<p>DARREN: Nah. I'm all laughed out like that for tonight--<i>(pauses, looks at Daria uneasily, wonders if he should say something to her about his real identity:)</i> uh, Daria?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(About to walk into the house, turns around:)</i> Yes?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Ponders:)</i> Never mind. I can tell you later. <i>(Daria cocks an eyebrow, then goes into the house, followed by Darren)</i></p>


     <p>Daria and Darren walked into the living room and saw Jake and Helen watching the late news on the TV while sitting on the couch. Both had just cleaned the kitchen up, and had put the dishes in the dishwasher. Daria kept going, and Darren waved at both, who returned the wave. Daria walked upstairs, while Darren, who was about to follow her, stopped at the bottom of the stairs and cocked an eyebrow at what he saw on the screen--it showed <i>William Appleton</i> in the front of the mansion giving a press conference, surrounded by a horde of reporters.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: --And I think that Appleton Industires will continue to <i>thrive</i> with <i>me</i> at the helm.</p>

<p>REPORTER: What's happened to <i>Arthur Appleton, Jr.</i>? Is he going to <i>come back</i> and take over the company <i>from</i> you? Rumor has it that you're a <i>"temporary"</i> figurehead.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Gives a bit of a glare at the reporter, then rapidly regains his composure:)</i> Arthur is on <i>extended leave</i> following the <i>deaths</i> of his parents. My <i>God</i>, what's <i>wrong</i> with you people? My nephew's in <i>pain</i> and all you care about is the <i>company</i>? Look, I ask you all to give my nephew some <i>room</i> to mourn, that's all. Can't you do that for <i>awhile</i>? <i>(Faux dramatic look:) Please</i>?</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Gets angry:)</i> Yeah, <i>damn it</i>, why don't you <i>vultures</i> leave that kid <i>alone</i>?</p>

<p>HELEN: Now, Jakey, I'm <i>sure</i> that they'll give that young Appleton man <i>plenty</i> of space and time to <i>mourn</i>--if they don't, then he can always <i>sue</i> them for <i>harassment. (Pauses:)</i> Hmm--I'd better keep a <i>note</i> on that in case he needs a good <i>law firm</i> to do so. <i>(Gets a pen and pad from her folder and writes it down, notices Darren, voice grows low:)</i> Darren, I suppose you know <i>how</i> that young man <i>feels</i>, don't you? He--</p>

<p>DARREN: --Lost <i>his</i> parents, too. <i>(Grows quiet, goes up stairs:)</i> I know <i>exactly</i> how he feels, Helen. <i>(Helen watches him go up with a sad look on her face)</i></p>


     <p>Darren went down the hallway when he saw an excited Quinn come out of her room and <i>grab</i> his wrist. She practically <i>jerked</i> him in and shut the door just as Daria was coming out of the bathroom and saw what had happened. Daria went up to Quinn's door and spoke.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:) Insects</i>, Quinn! <i>Insects</i>!</p>


     <p>Quinn ran up to the door from her side and promptly returned the verbal barb:</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>Emotions</i>, Daria! <i>Emotions</i>!</p>


     <p>Darren stared at Quinn, completely lost.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(Turns back to Darren:)</i> Um--Daria and I have a <i>joke</i> that we've got going between us, you know. It's kinda--<i>private</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks at Quinn with a perplexed frown on his face:)</i> I--<i>see</i>.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Walks past Darren to the center of her room beside her bed, arms stretched out, twirls around:)</i> Well, what do you think of my room?</p>


     <p>Darren looked around. Daria wasn't far off when she had said Quinn's room was cute, in fact, it seemed to be the <i>epitome</i> of cuteness. There was a pink dresser on his left that had various make-up items lying on it. The room contained several stuffed animals, both on the carpeted floor and on her bed. A bulletin board was on the far wall, with a huge amount of notes on it. In the far corner, there were several mirrors in almost a <i>hexagonial</i> shape (similar to a clothing store), and on his right, a gumball machine. On the right wall above the gumball machine, posters of some handsome young male models and movie stars were proudly displayed, and, in the middle of the room, against the right wall, was a full-sized canopy bed. <i>Pure</i> cuteness, all right. Quinn leaped on her bed and looked at Darren <i>adorably</i> while lying on her stomach and resting her face in the palms of her hands on her elbows, and crossing her legs. Darren looked further to his right and saw a chair, and sat down.</p>

<p><i>(Note to reader: For Quinn's room, see "The Daria Diaries", the same for Daria's room. I wrote this in case someone out there doesn't have the book)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks around:)</i> It--looks--<i>cute</i>, Quinn.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Still excited:)</i> Yeah, I <i>know</i>! Do you want any gumballs, Darren?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks around uncomfortably:)</i> Uh, sure. <i>(Quinn reaches over and gets some out, gives them to Darren, goes back to her previous position)</i> Thank you.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Now, you and me have to <i>really</i> talk, <i>bro</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Eyebrow raised, privately surprised while chewing the gumballs, thought v.o.: Did I just hear Quinn <b>directly</b> call me her <b>"bro"</b>? Should I say something about--no--maybe I should wait until later:)</i> Er--what about, Quinn?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Sing-songy laugh:)</i> About our <i>burdens</i>, silly!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>Burdens</i>? <i>(Confused:) What</i> burdens?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Playfully rolls her eyes:)</i> You knooow--about looking <i>cute</i>! Having everyone liking you because of your <i>looks</i> and everything. Why, I just had to tell this guy Larry that I couldn't go out with him, and he just <i>cried</i>, and I had to kinda <i>calm</i> him down. Is it that way with <i>you</i> when girls ask you <i>out</i>? I think people like us have a <i>curse</i> of being <i>so</i> good looking, we have to <i>beat</i> the <i>ordinary-looking</i> people off, and I--</p>


     <p>Darren just stared at Quinn with a <i>phony</i> grin and inwardly <i>groaned</i>.</p> 


<p></i>(Scene changes to Daria's room, about ten minutes later)</i></p>


     <p>Daria was on her bed, propped up on her pillow. She had her diary and pen that she had taken out of her <i>strongbox</i> that was in her closet, in her hand. She had tried to watch some TV, but there was nothing on, at least not until <i>Sick, Sad World</i> would come on in a few minutes. Daria decided to write in her diary until Darren would arrive.</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Thought v.o.: Leave it to Quinn to shanghi Darren. Oh well, maybe Quinn's boring self-gratification will drive him out before he goes insane. If not, maybe he and I can put Quinn out of her misery.) (Starts writing in her diary:)</i></p>


<blockquote><font face="comic sans ms"><p>From the "so-called" diary of one Daria Morgendorffer:</p>

	<p>How do I put this? Oh yeah. I have a <u>brother</u>, or so it seems that I do, pending a DNA test that he and my parents will take tomorrow. His name is <u>Darren Coverton</u>. I don't know exactly how to put what I feel in words, especially since feeling hasn't been a part of the Daria Morgendorffer vocabulary, or anything else about me, save for my writing. This--"Darren" seems to be a <u>nice</u> guy, which could <u>hurt</u> him from my point of view because "nice" is something that I have a <u>hard</u> time doing when it comes to my family--quite an <u>insane</u> thing for me to do, this--"nice". However, recent events have caused me to question <u>my</u> sanity. Helping out my parents when I found out about what they thought was a miscarriage that mom had. Helping Jane and Tom patch up their differences. My little "outburst" at Quinn. Am I, Daria Morgendorffer, <u>growing</u> nice and/or soft? Please say it ain't so.</p>                                                 	<p>But for some reason, I don't think it'll be so bad having a brother. For one, he can keep Quinn and me apart. I remember telling Quinn that Darren was a <u>peacemaker</u>--his presence in our house has immediately done several things--(1) Quinn broke a date to be with him! Thought I'd never see the day that would happen again since she lucked up on writing that stupid essay on "Academic Imprisonment" by breaking a date with that guy Corey. Quinn also <u>hugged</u> Darren on her own--now that is a story in itself, especially since the only people she lets hug her are the guys she goes out with--and that's only if she <u>allows</u> them to. (2) Mom's behavior. I'd <u>never</u> seen her get so quiet when Darren stepped in and defended us from her wrath. He defended me when mom was about to go ballistic in the kitchen. Hmm--perhaps when I cut all of Quinn's hair off one day, I can <u>hide</u> behind Darren, and mom will <u>forgive</u> me. (3) Dad's behavior. He just looked at Darren without saying a word. Dad didn't even <u>read</u> the newspaper at the table while we were eating tonight. That hasn't happened since our parents told Quinn and I could've had a brother--which, apparently, we <u>do</u>--unless, for some reason, that DNA test turns out negative. Wait'll Jane hears about this--it should be one <u>hell</u> of a story for her to take in.</p>                                                                              	<p>More than anything else, I was shocked over what he said about a girl he knew named <u>Stephanie Reardon</u>, and what he said about her. He's going through more pain than I can imagine. Maybe I can--</p></font></blockquote>


     <p>There was a knock on the door.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Raises her voice:)</i> If it's the guys in the white coats, you can just leave me <i>here</i> and change the plain 'ol wooden door to a <i>12 inch steel</i> one. You can also put the bars <i>back</i> on my windows. I do, however, reserve the right for bathroom privileges, unless you want to send in the bedpan. Now as for <i>food</i>--</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(From outside Daria's door:)</i> Daria! It's your <i>mother</i>, and I have <i>Jane</i> here on the phone!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sighs, talks low to herself:)</i> Crap, I forgot to call her. <i>(Raises voice, gets up:)</i> Hang on. <i>(Puts diary[?] under her pillow:)</i> Come on in. <i>(To which Helen does)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Gives Daria the phone:)</i> Where's Darren?</p>

<p>DARIA: Thanks. <i>Guess</i>--Quinn's <i>kidnapped</i> him in her room and is <i>boring</i> him to death, probably telling him about how <i>cute</i> she is and such--we may have to call the <i>undertaker</i> to come and get him.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Exaggerated sigh at Daria:)</i> I wanted to tell him that his <i>grandmothers</i> and your <i>aunts</i> want to meet him, and they'll be here sometime next week. Your father and I have decided to <i>cancel</i> the trip to the beach. <i>(Daria gives something of a tiny relieved smile)</i> Oh well, I'll wait until he and Quinn <i>bond</i> first. <i>(Starts to leave)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(While covering the speaker part of the phone:)</i> You'd better hope Quinn hasn't tried to bond with him using her so-called <i>"charm"</i>, which is her <i>super glue</i>, otherwise, we'll <i>never</i> get him back. <i>(Helen sighs and rolls her eyes as she shuts Daria's door, and Daria takes her hand off the speaker part of the phone)</i> Hey, sorry I hadn't called you yet--you might say something really <i>big</i> came up.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Sounding subdued:)</i> Yo, it's no problem.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Narrows her eyes:)</i> Um--you <i>okay</i>? You seemed to be sounding a bit <i>down</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Sighing sound:)</i> Yeah, I am--Tom and I--<i>broke up</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Shocked:)</i> What do you mean, <i>"broke up"</i>? Are you <i>serious</i>?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(In a low voice:)</i> Oooh, <i>yeah</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Searches for words:)</i> But--<i>how</i>--<i>why</i>?</p> 

<p>JANE: After I talked to you, I tried to call Tom the next day at the time you told me. He wasn't there. <i>"Okay"</i>, I said, <i>"I'll wait until the next time."</i> The following day, I called again. Finally, he came on, saying that he had to work late, and he couldn't get back to me in time. I offered to give him my number and time to call me, which he took, and we then talked.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>Annnnd</i>--?</p>

<p>JANE: Tom <i>apologized</i> for laughing at my painting of him, which I accepted. He said we shouldn't have argued over such a <i>silly</i> matter, anyway. I told him it <i>wasn't</i> silly, that the painting represented my <i>feelings</i> for him, just as I told you. He kind of <i>chuckled</i> and said that I was kind of <i>overreacting</i>, to which I said that I was doing no <i>such</i> thing.
He told me to <i>calm down</i>, and I--just launched into <i>another</i> area of our relationship.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Perplexed frown:) Another</i> area of your relationship--?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Sounding a little bitter:)</i> Yeah, such as <i>talking out</i> things, like Tom wanting to <i>tell</i> me what college <i>he</i> thought I should go to. He said <i>he</i> thought we agreed on <i>Leeville Community College</i>, you know, someplace near where he worked and not too far from his family, and where he'd go after getting out of <i>prep school</i>. I wondered where in the <i>hell</i> he came up with <i>that</i> idea. He said I <i>told</i> him when we went out one night. I can say <i>clearly</i> that I don't remember that. Tom added that <i>he</i> thought that we should talk about something like this when I got back, and not over the phone, to which I said why he should do <i>all</i> the thinking in our relationship? I mean what am I, some sort of <i>damn brainless puppet</i> for him, lying around to have my <i>strings</i> pulled by <i>him</i>? <i>(Pauses:)</i> It never occurred to me until that instant: Tom likes to <i>control</i> me--maybe he doesn't <i>know</i> that he's actually <i>doing</i> it, but I think that's what's going on here.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> Oh, <i>come on</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: No, <i>think</i> about it, Daria. I remember once when he and I went to the Zen for one of Mystik Spiral's gigs. He <i>told</i> me to not eat those <i>tacos</i> they serve there because they made my breath <i>smell</i>--in and of itself an <i>insensitive</i> thing to say, and guess what? I did <i>anyway</i> just to see what would happen, and he <i>didn't</i> kiss me that night--even after I popped a <i>mint</i> in my mouth.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sarcastic deadpan:)</i> Oh, <i>wow</i>. Because of some <i>tacos</i>, you two are now broken up. I'd <i>sue</i> Taco Bell, if I were you--you wanna let me go and get my <i>mom</i>?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Sounding angry:) Hey</i>! I wanted to <i>add</i> that he didn't kiss me because he was <i>angry</i> that I didn't do what <i>he</i> wanted me to do. I looked at him a little <i>funny</i>, and I let it <i>slide</i>, because at the time, it <i>was</i> trivial. Then there was the time we went to the movies. Tom <i>told</i> me what movie we were going to see, and <i>he</i> thought I'd like it. We ended up seeing <i>his</i> movie--a <i>macho-guy</i> flick. <i>(Adds:)</i> Don't you <i>see</i>, girl? There's a <i>pattern</i> developing here!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Thinks for a moment, then speaks:)</i> Look, maybe you two should let yourselves <i>cool down</i> and talk to each other after you come back. I can't believe you two can't get past this.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(In a quiet tone:)</i> I told him I wanted this relationship to <i>end</i>, and he practically <i>begged</i> me to think it over.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>See</i>? There you have it. Give it a <i>chance</i>, and air out your concerns. Don't <i>throw</i> away a chance that you may <i>regret--(grows pale:) oh, God.</i></p>

<p>JANE: Huh? What?</p>

<p>DARIA: I'm beginning to sound a little like a <i>marriage counselor</i>, or one of those <i>daytime talk show hosts</i>. Look, just talk to him when you get back, okay?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Pauses after a moment:)</i> Um, <i>okay</i>, but I'm <i>not</i> promising anything.</p>

<p>DARIA: Fair enough. <i>(Changes tone:)</i> Now, how's everything going down there in <i>Sandsville</i>?</p>

<p>JANE: Painting and pottery, baby, painting and pottery. Plus, a little sightseeing thrown in. I'll show you my work when I get back, and <i>before</i> you ask, my mom and I are <i>bonding</i>. She showed me how some of the Hopi did their pottery, and some of her Native American friends took me out in the desert to watch a tribal dance. All-in-all, a somewhat <i>rewarding</i> experience. <i>You</i>--?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sounding nonchalant, which is easy for her:)</i> Eh, the usual <i>bug-the-hell-out-of-Quinn-and-my-parents</i>, and reading and writing to get past my boredom. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Oh yeah, and the <i>brother</i> me, Quinn, and my parents <i>thought</i> was dead is actually <i>alive</i> and all grown up, that's <i>all. (Suddenly flinches from the phone because she hears a tapping sound from the other end:)</i> Hey, what the <i>hell</i>--?</p>

<p>JANE: --I'm <i>sorry</i>, I believe we're having a <i>communication problem. (Snickering sound:)</i> I thought I heard you say that the baby who could have been your older brother you and Quinn had thought for dead was actually <i>alive and grown up</i>. That can't be, right?</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Dead serious tone:) No</i> joke, Lane. I'm serious as a <i>heart attack</i>, and I don't mean my <i>dad's</i>. Pending a DNA test tomorrow, it'll be <i>official</i>.</p> 

<p><i>(Note to reader: See "Jake of Hearts" for Jake's heart attack)</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Sounding stunned after a very long pause:)</i> You're--<i>not</i> kidding?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:) Nope</i>. His name's <i>Darren</i>, and to be frank with you, it's a <i>long</i> story, a little <i>too</i> long to talk about it over the phone. You'll have to come back and let me tell you face-to-face, and you can <i>meet</i> him yourself.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Sounding her disbelief:)</i> Well, I'll be <i>damned. (After another long pause:)</i> Um--<i>who</i> does he <i>look</i> like, Helen or Jake?</p>

<p>DARIA: Actually a little more like <i>mom</i>, with a bit of dad's chin. He thinks we're <i>funny</i> and a little <i>crazy</i>, with my <i>family</i> on the crazy part, and <i>me</i> on the funny part. As you can imagine, mom and dad have gone <i>wild</i> over him, and Quinn even--<i>(checks herself:)</i> um--thought he was <i>"nice-looking"</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Snorting sound:) Did</i> she now? It's a wonder <i>"Tinkerbell"</i> didn't <i>come on</i> to him! Now <i>that</i> would've been <i>funny</i>! <i>(Laughs)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks, decides to keep her word to Quinn:)</i> Yeah--<i>funny</i>.</p> 

<p>JANE: So, ah--what do <i>you</i> think of this <i>"Darren"</i> fellow?</p>

<p>DARIA: I think he's--<i>okay</i>. I guess you can say he's a <i>nice</i> guy. He seems to be able to <i>control</i> my mom's <i>belicosity</i>, and <i>mesmerize</i> my dad--there's a <i>stunning surprise</i>, as well as
<i>excite</i> Quinn--little sister plans to use Darren as a <i>club</i> to wield on Sandi Griffin's <i>head</i>, I'm <i>sure</i> about that. <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> She'll probably <i>brag</i> about Darren's <i>"looks"</i> to her <i>"friends"</i>--</p> 

<p>JANE: <i>--Oh, ho</i>! So he really <i>is</i> a <i>looker</i>, eh?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> I'm not worried about <i>you</i> making a <i>move</i> on my brother, Jane--not with <i>"Tommy Boy"</i> in the wings. So, <i>hop</i> to it, my dear, and call him.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Voice snapping to attention like a soldier:) Yes ma'am</i>! I'll get right on it, ma'am! <i>(Wicked snickering sound:)</i> Speaking of calls, has <i>Trent</i> called <i>you</i> yet? You know, to tell you that he's being <i>"careful"</i> out there?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:)</i> Heh. <i>Amusing</i>. No, I haven't heard a <i>word</i> from him since he and Mystik Spiral left on their <i>"Magical Mystery Tour"</i>. It's been pretty quiet around here, save for "Big Brother's" appearance.</p>

<p><i>(Note to reader: The "tour" Daria's talking about is <b>not</b> the same tour based on the excellent series done by one Crazy Nutso--just thought I'd add that note to clear up any confusion you might have, thank you.)</i></p>

<p>JANE: Okay--so noted. That should be one <i>hell</i> of a story about your brother that I want to hear. <i>(Daria smirks at this, having wrote the same thing in her so-called diary)</i> How's the Lane <i>fortress</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: It's okay. I'm checking the locks and I'm feeding the cats. The post office is keeping your mail. That kid that lives next door to you guys is mowing your lawn, and I'm gonna go over there tomorrow morning and go through my customary checks.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Sincere-sounding tone:)</i> Okay. Thanks, Daria--I <i>owe</i> you.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Mona Lisa smile:)</i> No problem--make sure that you send that <i>money order</i> on time, okay?</p> 

<p>JANE: <i>(Laughing sound:)</i> Later. <i>(Hangs up)</i></p>


     <p>Daria was about to go back to writing in her diary(?) when there was a knock on her door.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Raised voice:)</i> Is that you, <i>Death</i>? If it is, I'm ready to go.</p>

<p>VOICE: <i>(Chuckles:)</i> Sorry to <i>disappoint</i> you, but I've been told you're going to live <i>forever</i> trapped with the "hell" that is your family.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks, puts her diary [?] back under her pillow, sits up on her bed:)</i> One more <i>crack</i> like that, and I'll send you <i>back</i> to Quinn. You may enter, <i>Darren</i>.</p>


     <p>Darren entered Daria's room and was immediately <i>shocked</i>--this room was the <i>complete</i> opposite of Quinn's. As he slowly panned around with his eyes <i>and</i> mouth wide open, he noticed that just about the <i>entire</i> room, save for the ceiling, and a part of the right wall, was covered in gray padding. On the part of the wall with no padding, was a <i>poster</i> with the bones of an partially unearthed human on it, and beneath the poster was a support bar. In the far corner of the floor was a box of a human skull and bones. (Darren <i>assumed</i> they weren't real) Above the box, bolted up in the corner, was a TV. Darren noticed that Daria also had a TV on a stand as well. Beside her bed, Daria's dresser had a model of a wedge of swiss cheese, as well as one of the human heart. On the windows, Darren noticed <i>sawed-off bars</i>. Finally, he looked to his left and saw that Daria had a computer on her desk right inside of the door. Darren pulled the chair out and turned it towards Daria, and sat <i>slowly</i> down, at a <i>complete</i> loss for words.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Sinister grin:)</i> Welcome to <i>my</i> world. Before you ask, the TV bolted up in the corner is for <i>decorative</i> purposes only--it doesn't work. Well now--what do you <i>think</i> of my room?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Gathers his thoughts, looks around:)</i> Oh, for <i>some</i> reason, it's <i>you. (Smiles:)</i> Your sense of <i>irony</i> is quite <i>wicked</i>, I've got to admit.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Perplexed:)</i> What do you mean?</p>

<p>DARREN: That while my birth parents and Quinn seem, no offense--<i>wacky</i>, and you seem to be the <i>sane</i> one, that <i>you're</i> the one in here.</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks, deadpan:)</i> Then I've done my job <i>impressing</i> you. I just <i>live</i> for irony.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Chuckles:)</i> I can imagine.</p> 

<p>DARIA: How'd you <i>escape</i> Quinn?</p>

<p>DARREN: Actually, Quinn gave me an <i>out</i>--she got so carried away with talking about herself, guys, and this--"Fashion Club", that she eventually fell <i>asleep</i>. I then slipped out and came in here.</p>

<p>DARIA: Yeah, Quinn never gets tired of talking about those <i>three</i> things. I'm surprised you were able to stand her going on like that.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> I'm used to my professors <i>lecturing</i> in class. Quinn was no different. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Daria, I meant to ask her something, but I wasn't able to get in a word edgewise, so I'll ask you.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Eyebrow cocked:)</i> What?</p>

<p>DARREN: Earlier tonight, when you first saw Quinn and me talking at the mall, you came up and Quinn said you were her <i>cousin</i>. What was <i>that</i> all about?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Looks uncomfortable for a moment, but then a thought v.o.: "Why the hell <b>not</b>?":)</i> Look, Darren, I'll <i>level</i> with you. Quinn believes because of the way I <i>dress</i> and <i>act</i>, I'll somehow <i>embarass</i> her in front of her friends, so she <i>makes up</i> a story, which she uses for everyone at my school, <i>especially</i> in front of her Fashion Club <i>"cohorts"</i>, that I'm her <i>"cousin"</i>. She believes that somehow my <i>"deepness"</i> will <i>corrupt</i> her <i>"shallowness"</i>, and drive <i>away</i> all her friends.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Shocked:)</i> That's--<i>terrible</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: Well, yeah--and the thing about it is, and you'd better not say <i>anything</i> to <i>anyone</i> about this--<i>(Darren shakes his head, "no")</i> but Quinn is a lot <i>smarter</i> than she <i>wants</i> us to think. I think she can do <i>better</i> in school, but she thinks that being a <i>"brain"</i> will affect her <i>"popularity"</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Deep in thought:)</i> I see--but <i>surely</i> she <i>has</i> to know she <i>needs</i> good grades to get into the Fashion Institute? What does she <i>expect</i>, to just <i>waltz</i> in there and enroll with no problem?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sighs:)</i> I don't think Quinn wants to <i>cross</i> that bridge until she gets to it. By that time, it could be too <i>late</i>. Remember when I made that crack at the table about her <i>"improving"</i> grades? I <i>wasn't</i> kidding. For a while there, mom and dad were <i>sweating</i> bullets. I sat back and watched to see if the little <i>sprite</i> would make it or go to summer school, and <i>damned</i> if she didn't <i>barely</i> pass. It was <i>way</i> too close for comfort.</p>

<p>DARREN: Maybe she'll <i>crack down</i> on her books for her <i>junior</i> year--</p>

<p>DARIA: --And maybe I'll just grow a <i>beard</i>, and become a circus <i>oddity</i>. Look, I think Quinn's gonna have to see how <i>rough</i> real life is, and <i>then</i> see the <i>importance</i> of a good education.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Cocked eyebrow:)</i> I--suppose my <i>offer</i> to get her <i>work</i> at Circa was <i>wrong</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: No, I just think Quinn's gonna believe that <i>everything</i> can be <i>handed</i> to her without really <i>working</i> for it. <i>(Narrows her eyes at Darren:)</i> Can you <i>definitely</i> get Quinn that job?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Speaks with a certainty in his voice:)</i> Oh, <i>yes</i> I can--and I <i>really</i> believe that I <i>can</i> help Quinn--</p>

<p>DARIA: --<i>If</i> she wants to help <i>herself</i>.</p> 

<p>DARREN: Well, while I'm here, I'll <i>definitely</i> encourage her to <i>hit</i> her books for her junior year, and stress the <i>importance</i> of getting good grades. <i>(Looks down at Daria's desk, notices college brochures, especially the one for Eastward College on top, delightfully surprised:)</i> You're <i>considering</i> Eastward College?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Looking a little uncomfortable:)</i> Well, <i>yeah</i>. In fact, it's on the <i>top</i> of my list of the colleges I want to <i>go</i> to. I heard it has an <i>excellent</i> journalistic major, and the campus is pretty quiet.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Grins, excited:)</i> Oh, you don't know the <i>half</i> of it. It's in the middle of <i>nowhere</i>, but not so far that you can't go somewhere. It's only <i>25 miles</i> from New York City. The campus is not only quiet, but also very beautiful, located in the middle of a <i>forest</i>. There's also plenty of college <i>activities</i> you can get <i>involved</i> in, if you want.</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Shakes her head slowly:) Nope</i>. I don't do school activities. I'm no <i>joiner</i>. Involvement with <i>any</i> of the popular people is <i>hazardous</i> to my health. <i>Isolation</i>--it's the answer for we of the <i>recluse</i> society. I've found out that participating in such activites have resulted in, shall we say, <i>humiliating</i> personal experiences for myself.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Grows quiet:) Oh. (Thought v.o.: <b>That's</b> why Helen looked over at Daria when Helen asked me about my extracurricular activities at Eastward--she's apparently tried to include Daria in some as well.) (Decides not to press the issue:)</i> To be honest with you, I had the chance to join <i>more</i> clubs, but I'm going <i>very</i> slowly to get into the activities of Eastward. My <i>education</i> is the most <i>important</i> thing to get.</p> 

<p>DARIA: I <i>hear</i> you there. I want to get a good job and get <i>away</i> from and <i>through</i> my teen-age years. For my senior year at Lawndale High, I want to concentrate on more of my writing to submit to colleges. <i>(Looks away:)</i> It's probably a <i>safe</i> bet that I'm <i>not</i> going to Eastward because of the <i>cost</i> of tuition, even <i>with</i> a full scholarship.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Alarmed:)</i> Hey, <i>whoa</i>, hold on there a second. <i>I</i> can talk to some of the <i>alumni</i> there, and they can <i>help</i> you.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Raises an eyebrow, smirks:)</i> First Quinn, and now <i>me</i>? What are you, some sort of <i>"godfather"</i> who just <i>snaps</i> his fingers and gets things done?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Becomes careful here, realizes he may have overstepped his bounds, compensates:)</i> No--no--just--that I <i>can</i> help you--<i>financially. (Adds quickly:)</i> Uh, you know, <i>financial aid</i>, with a <i>Pell Grant</i>. I can get some--<i>information</i> on how you can get enough money to go to Eastward. It's not out of the question to go, don't give up just yet.</p>

<p>DARIA: From what I've heard, Eastward's room-and-board cost <i>per</i> semester can buy a small <i>house</i>, and that <i>doesn't</i> include food. <i>(Ponders for a second:)</i> Say, how can you <i>afford</i> to live on campus?</p> 

<p>DARREN: I--live off campus with my <i>aunt</i>, and my--(adopted) parents had some <i>money</i>, as well as in their will they left for me. We have--<i>plenty</i> of room where we live. <i>(Hesitates, then goes on:)</i> You can live there <i>with</i> us, if you want, you know, while going to Eastward.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Surprised:)</i> Um, I wouldn't want you to put you and your aunt <i>out</i>--

<p>DARREN: <i>(Chuckles at the rather absurd thought:)</i> Oh, you <i>wouldn't</i> put us out, <i>believe</i> me. <i>(Smiles:)</i> At least <i>think</i> about it.</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Hesitates:)</i> Ah--sure, <i>okay. (Searches for words:)</i> Sooo--what's your <i>aunt's</i> name?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Pauses for a moment, decides to tell partly:) Millie</i>--um, Millie <i>Coverton</i>. You might say she's my <i>favorite</i> aunt. She's been living with me and my--(adopted) parents since she was divorced. She had <i>no</i> children--said I was the <i>closest</i> she wanted to <i>having</i> some. Aunt Millie <i>changed</i> her last name back to her <i>maiden</i> name after the divorce.</p>

<p>DARIA: Whoa. I guess the divorce was <i>bitter</i>, huh?</p> 

<p>DARREN: A--<i>little</i>. She and her ex-husband, <i>Jim</i>, who I <i>still</i> consider as my <i>uncle</i>, are now friends.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> So, I guess she doesn't <i>hate</i> men, right?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Perplexed:)</i> Uh, <i>no</i>--I think she's gotten on with her life by seeing <i>other</i> guys--say, <i>why'd</i> you ask that?</p>

<p>DARIA: My science teacher, <i>Ms. Barch</i>, had a hell of a bitter divorce, and since then, has declared <i>war</i> on all of the male species--save for my English teacher, <i>Mr. O'Neill</i>, whom she has a <i>thing</i> for. She gives all of her female students <i>passing</i> marks, while the male students are lucky enough to <i>barely</i> pass.

<p>DARREN: <i>(Mildly frowns:)</i> Now, that doesn't seem <i>fair</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Eh, but at least they're passing, I guess. <i>(Changes subject:)</i> Ah, you said while we were outside the house you had a <i>best friend</i>--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Nods:) --Curtis Watley</i>, my good buddy. He goes to Eastward with me, and we hang out together. He's in Florida now, visiting his grandmother, and his girlfriend, Lena. He's majoring in engineering. You have a buddy?</p>

<p>DARIA: Yeah, <i>Jane Lane</i>, an aspiring artist, and my <i>"Partner In Crime"</i>. She and her mom are out in the Southwest on vacation, and they won't be back for two-and-a-half weeks. Her brother <i>Trent Lane</i>, is a musician for a group he's in, called <i>Mystik Spiral</i>, and they're out on some sort of a self-promotional tour, and won't be back for a few more days. I'm keeping an eye out on their home until they get back.</p>

<p>DARREN: I look forward to meeting your friends. <i>(Looks around:)</i> So, you said you want to be a writer--may I see some of your <i>work</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(A bit nervous, a little wide-eyed:)</i> Um, sure, but I'm going to <i>warn</i> you--my writing is kind of <i>dark. (Gets up, goes to her closet, pulls out a box full of her papers, some in notebook form, and gives it to Darren:)</i> Here you go--enjoy.</p>

<p>DARREN: Thank you. <i>(Gets out a notebook from the box, places it on Daria's desk, sits down, and starts to read it)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: Do you mind if I turn on the TV? I'll keep it down so it won't disturb you.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Reading Daria's writing intensely, barely looks up:)</i> Hmmm? Oh, no, it's okay.</p>


     <p>Daria clicked on <i>Sick, Sad World</i>, and sat back down on her bed.</p>


<p>TV ANNOUNCER: <i>(While theme music is playing:)</i> Will there be an invasion from <i>Atlantis</i>? Finicky Fish People--A <i>Sick, Sad World</i> exclusive, next!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks up at the TV for a moment, grins:)</i> I've seen that show a <i>few</i> times. It's <i>really</i> funny. <i>(Goes back through Daria's work)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: Yeah, funny <i>and</i> pathetic in describing our world. It's my <i>favorite</i> show.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(While still reading:)</i> Daria, this is really <i>good</i>. I like the way you wrote about the <i>"Darkness that tortured your soul"</i>. It really <i>stabs</i> at the heart.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow in surprise, cutting her eyes sideways at Darren:)</i> You're not <i>offended</i> or <i>afraid</i> by what you're reading?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks directly at Daria:) Yes</i>, and that's why I <i>like</i> it. Writing is supposed to <i>move</i> the reader, to create an <i>image</i> in the reader's mind, to <i>convey</i> what's on the writer's mind. <i>This</i> definitely does that. By reading this, I can tell that your vision of the world is clearly one of <i>brutal reality. (Puts aside notebook, gets another one out of the box)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Now looking directly at Darren:)</i> Let me get this straight--you think my work is one of <i>brutal reality</i>?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(While still reading:)</i> Pretty <i>much</i> so--but it's an <i>honest</i> type of brutal reality--something one can <i>appreciate</i>. At least one can know where you <i>stand</i> on an issue.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Looks back to the TV, quietly impressed with Darren's assessment of her writing:)</i> Well, yeah, I guess--you might say honesty is <i>really</i> important to me.</p>


     <p>Darren stared <i>uncomfortably</i> at Daria for a second, then went back to reading. For the next hour, neither said a word until <i>Sick, Sad World</i> went off the air. Daria turned off the TV, while Darren was finishing up reading Daria's work. He put the box back into the closet for her, and prepared to leave Daria's room.</p>


<p>DARREN: Daria, I'm no expert, but I think your writing is <i>terrific</i>. If you'll let me, I would like to run off a few copies to take back with me so I can show some of your writing to the dean of the journalistic department, I think he'll be impressed.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Hesitant:)</i> Well, okay, but promise me that you'll show them to the dean only. I'm--kind of <i>possessive</i> about my work. I know it kind of sounds <i>creepy</i>--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Cuts her off:)</i> --No, no, it's understandable you'd feel that way, because you want to protect your writing from being <i>plagiarized</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> That and the fact that my writing kind of <i>is</i> me. It makes me feel a little--<i>exposed</i> if others see it.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looking sheepish:) Oh</i>. Don't worry--I'll keep it low key. But <i>don't</i> blame me if the word gets out that your writing is wonderful.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Well, if people start breaking out in <i>song</i> and sing their <i>praises</i> unto me, I'm gonna have to go <i>postal</i> and <i>shoot</i> everyone. I think that'll keep my <i>reputation</i> in tact.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Laughs:)</i> Tell me when that occurs--I want to be as far <i>away</i> as possible when you do.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Shakes her head slowly:) No</i> can do. In fact, you'll be <i>front</i> and <i>center</i>--you're the one who <i>started</i> the ball rolling.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Grins:) Hmph</i>. Figures--I get nothing but <i>trouble</i> for my efforts. Thanks a <i>lot</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: Don't mention it. <i>(Looks at alarm clock on her dresser:)</i> Hey, it's almost <i>midnight</i>. You're still gonna get up and <i>drag</i> yourself out of bed to jog tomorrow morning?</p>

<p>DARREN: I try to stay to my <i>regimen</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:)</i> Same here. I have to get ready for <i>my</i> regimen of <i>sarcasm</i> and put downs for tomorrow. <i>(Darren chuckles at this while opening Daria's door)</i> You know, my friend <i>Jane</i> jogs, too.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Raises eyebrows:)</i> Really? <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Well, maybe we can jog <i>together</i>, and she can show me her jogging <i>routes</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Oh, I don't know if her boyfriend <i>Tom</i> will like that.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Gives Daria an "Oh, I see" look:)</i> Ah, of <i>course</i>. I guess I can find my <i>own</i> routes, then. Do the Lanes live far away from here?</p>

<p>DARIA: Nope, just <i>several</i> houses down from us. <i>(Note to reader: Read "The Daria Diaries") (Daria pauses:)</i> Say, I'm going over there tomorrow morning to check on their house while they're gone. You want to come with me when I go, you know, after you finish jogging, and we eat breakfast?</p>

<p>DARREN: Are you sure they won't mind me being there <i>with</i> you?</p>

<p>DARIA: Nah--unless you plan to <i>blow up</i> the place, in which case I'll have to <i>help</i> you. Jane and Trent won't mind, it'll be okay, and I can show you some of Jane's art.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Thinks:)</i> It's set, then--I'm going to have a busy day tomorrow. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Well, I'm going to call my aunt and tell her I'm fine--see you. Goodnight. <i>(Leaves)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: Goodnight. <i>(Shuts door behind him, gives a slight smile)</i></p>

     <p>Daria changed into her "Mark Twain" pullover pajama shirt and pulled out her diary(?) and pen from under her pillow, and began to write again:</p>


     <blockquote><font face="comic sans ms"><p>Maybe I can actually get along with another relative other than my Aunt Amy. Darren told me he <u>likes</u> my writing, and will talk to the dean of journalism on my behalf. Dare I <u>dream</u> to go to Eastward, and even more, with the man who may be my <u>brother</u>? I wonder if Darren can really get Quinn an internship where his--mom worked. Well, I guess anything's possible--and I suppose I'll <u>join</u> the damn Fashion Club tomorrow, and <u>replace</u> Quinn as the vice-president, and scheme to outdo Sandi. Speaking of Quinn, maybe the little <u>princess</u> was right (I write to myself sickeningly,) about the <u>"gift"</u> she thought she was getting from our parents--just that instead of some sort of dumb dress or shoes, it's a <u>brother</u>. If that DNA test is correct, then he <u>is</u> our brother. Until I survive another <u>hell-filled</u> day--well, maybe made a little <u>less</u> hell-filled by Darren, I'll see you tomorrow, my so-called diary.</p></font></blockquote>


     <p>Slightly smirking, Daria locked her diary(?) in her strongbox, and put it back in her closet, then clicked out the light and went to bed.</p>
