<p>Chapter 6 - Odds and Ends</p>



     <p>Darren twisted and turned in his sleep, dreaming of the Morgendorffers discovering his secret and becoming <I>angry</I>. Helen, Jake, Daria, and Quinn, wearing white robes, came through a foggy mist in a dark room, surrounded him, and began to accuse.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Frowns, points at him:)</i> How could you <i>lie</i> to me, your own <i>mother</i>, like that, young man? Just think--I <i>hugged</i> you!</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Frowns, points at him:)</i> Thanks a <i>lot</i>, Big Guy! You had to be a <I>bad</I> son that <i>stabbed</i> me in the back--just like my <i>Old Man</i> in <i>reverse</i>!</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Frowns, points at him:)</i> Congratuations, Big Bro--I'm <i>humiliated</i> because of your <i>lie</i>! Sandi's gonna eat me <i>alive</i>, and it's all <i>your</i> fault!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Frowns, points at him, usual deadpan:) Oooooh, boy</i>, bro--you've broken Daria's <i>Rule of Law #1</i>--Thou shalt not <i>deceive</i> Daria Morgendorffer, and you shall pay <i>accordingly. (Takes out a rope that's tied with a noose at the end, throws it over a branch of a suddenly-appearing tree, and pulls the noose over Darren's head, while Helen, Jake, and Quinn start to laugh at Darren sinisterly)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Panics, wide-eyed:) Wait</i>! I'm sorry for <i>lying</i> to you all! <i>Please</i> give me <i>another</i> chance!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(While shaking her head slowly:) No</i> can do, bro. <i>(Darren looks down and sees he's standing on a trap door, while Daria grins:)</i> See you in <I>hell. (The trap door opens, Darren screams)</i></p>


     <p>Darren suddenly woke in a cold sweat holding his neck, and a <i>hand</i> was laid on his shoulder from the side.</p>


<p>JAKE: <i>(Sitting beside Darren's bed in his pajamas and housecoat, concerned:)</i> Are you <I>okay</I>, son?!</p>

<p>DARREN: Yeah <i>Jake</i>, I--<i>(sees Jake, and falls out of bed, screaming:) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH</i>!! <i>(Now on floor, looks up at Jake stunned:)</i> What are you doing <i>in</i> my room?!</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Gets up out of his chair and waves his hands frantically, tries to reassure Darren:)</i> I'm <i>sorry</i>, Darren! I was just <i>sitting</i> there, <i>looking</i> at you, watching <i>over</i> you! <i>(Narrows his eyes, looking into space:)</i> Unlike my <i>Old Man</i>--that <i>rotten</i> jerk! He left me to fend for <i>myself</i> at military school while he treated my mom like <i>dirt</i>! Well <i>now</i>, I'm <i>not</i> gonna make <i>that</i> mistake, oh, <i>no</i>! I'm gonna <i>be</i> there for <i>my</i> son! <i>(Darren backs slowly away from Jake while still on floor, terrified, [think of "Terminator 2"--Linda Hamilton] and about this time, Helen, Daria, and Quinn, who was now in her nightclothes, come in)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Angry:) JAKE! WHAT IN THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?! (Darren flinches at Helen's shouting)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Confused:)</i> What's going on, Daddy?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:)</i> Dad's just <i>reliving</i> old childhood memories, again. <i>(Pauses, looks at Helen, slight frown:)</i> Didn't we go through this <i>before</i> with you and dad?</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Snaps out of his ranting with Helen's shout, suddenly nervous:) H-huh</i>? Um, Helen, I just, ah--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Now gathers his wits, covers for Jake, looks at Helen:)</i> --He--just heard me having a <i>nightmare</i> while he was out in the hallway passing by my room, and came to see what was going on, that's all. He found me on the floor when you came in. <i>(Jake catches Darren's story, mouths a "thank you" to him)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Now calmed:)</i> Oh, my! You must've had <i>some</i> nightmare, Darren. <I>(Thought v.o.: My poor son--you must've been thinking about <b>your</b> parents, weren't you?)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: I--was dreaming I--fell off a <i>cliff</i>. I saw the ground coming <i>towards</i> me--</p>

<p>DARIA: --And remember, it's <i>not</i> the fall, but the sudden <i>thump</i>--</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Annoyed while Darren tries not to laugh:) --Daria</i>! <i>(Looks at Darren:)</i> Well, if you're all right Darren, Jake and I are going back to bed and get another hour of sleep. <i>(Pushes Jake out of the room)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Looks out the window:)</i> Hey, the sun's coming <i>up</i>--</p>

<p>DARIA: --It's called <i>sunrise</i>, Quinn--you'd be <i>surprised</i> that it does that <i>everyday</i>, and you wouldn't miss it if you'd get up and not sleep <i>half</i> the day away.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>Ha</i>, Daria. I'm gotta get my <i>beauty sleep</i>--not that <i>you'd</i> ever want to get some for <i>yourself. (Looks at Darren:)</i> See you later, <i>bro. (Leaves out of Darren's room)</i></p>


<p>Daria frowned to herself in slight <i>shock</i>. Did Quinn just <i>call</i> Darren her <i>"bro"</i>? She looked over at Darren, who looked at her a bit uneasily. Did <i>he</i> notice it, too? <I>Well, she wouldn't know unless she asked--here goes</I>.</p>


<p>DARIA: Um--Darren?</p>

<p>DARREN: Yes, Daria?</p>

<p>DARIA: Did I just hear Quinn call you--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Cuts her off gently:)</i> --Her <i>"bro"</i>? Yes, I heard that. <i>(Hesitates:)</i> She said the <i>same</i> thing last night while we talked in her room. I was planning to say something about it to her today--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Now cuts him off gently:)</i> --Do you feel--<i>(pauses:)</i> well, uh--<i>uncomfortable</i> with Quinn calling you that?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks at Daria, surprised:)</i> Eh? <i>N-no</i>, of course not--it's just that, well, maybe that we should make <i>sure</i> that her calling me <i>"bro"</i> is true <i>after</i> the DNA test is done today. I wouldn't want her to be, er--<i>embarassed</i> or something if for some reason or another the test comes out, well--<i>negative</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Eyebrow cocked:)</I> You <i>don't</i> think the DNA test will be positive, Darren?</p>


<p>Darren stared at Daria wordlessly for a moment, with no expression. For the briefest of moments, Daria wondered if she said the <i>wrong</i> thing. Darren then spoke.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> I'm <i>assuming</i> that it will be, Daria--we <i>all</i> are. I mean, with the <i>stories</i> that I heard from <i>(pauses:) your</i> parents about what Turley did, and their hearing <i>my</i> story in <i>comparison</i>, it <i>has</i> to be true--<i>(then in a way that sounds like he is trying to convince himself:) right</i>? I'm just wanting to be <i>careful</i> here, that's all. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Do you think I shouldn't say <i>anything</i> to Quinn about her calling me her <i>"bro"</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: To be <i>honest</i> with you-- <i>(sighs:) no</i>, I wouldn't, Darren--at least not until <i>after</i> the test is taken, and if it does turn out negative. I think Quinn's really getting into this <i>"brother"</i> thing, and has <i>accepted</i> it with <i>no</i> questions asked. <i>(Adds:)</i> I mean, <i>our--(catches herself:) my</i> parents think you're their <i>son</i>, so, why not let Quinn think the <i>same</i> sort of thing about you being her bro? <i>(Darren ponders this)</i> I mean, if the test <i>is</i> negative, then, well, she won't be the <i>only</i> one to be disappointed, and mom and dad could be there to <i>help</i> her through that.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Gives a quiet smile:)</i> Would <i>you</i> feel <i>disappointed</i> if the test is <i>negative</i>, Daria?</p>


<p>Daria's eyes grew <i>wide</i> for the shortest possible moment, then she resumed her <i>"expressionless expression"</i>.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Looks for words, shrugs, in a low voice:)</i> I guess I'd be a <i>little</i> disappointed--<i>(smirks:)</i> you know, I couldn't have a bro to <i>tease mercilessly</i> like Quinn--<i>(Darren grins)</i> and I would want to try out some <i>new</i> barbs on <i>another</i> sibling, and I <i>need</i> you to <i>test</i> them on before I use them on anyone else. <i>(Darren laughs)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Well then, I guess we'd better hope that I'm <i>ready</i> for that, huh?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(A little red-faced, Mona Lisa smile:)</i> I guess. <i>(Smirks, changes subject:)</i> So, did dad <i>really</i> catch you in a nightmare?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Glances at Daria:)</i> What do you mean?</p>

<p>DARIA: I mean, dad used to sit down beside Quinn's and my bed when we were little, watching us <i>while</i> we were asleep. When we woke up, he was there <i>staring</i> at us.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Wide-eyed:)</i> You're--<i>kidding</i>!</p>

<p>DARIA: Nuh-uh. He did it occasionally until Quinn and I were about eight years old, and then mom <i>stopped</i> him because she thought he was <i>scaring</i> us. I think he came to us about an <i>hour</i> before we woke up, and just <i>sat</i> there, <i>worried</i> about <i>"his little girls"</i>. Quinn told me once she kind of <i>missed</i> it once in awhile.</p>

<p><i>(Note to reader: Jake did this with an <B>awake</B> Daria-see "Ill")</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looking uncomfortable:)</i> That's--<i>scary</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>Tell</i> me about it--so, <i>did</i> he catch you in the nightmare, or did you wake up and find him there <i>looking</i> at you--<i>(adds, smirks:)</i> and <i>then</i> you thought you were in a <i>real</i> nightmare?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smirks back a little at Daria:) Both</i>. I had the nightmare, and when I woke up, he was there. He put a <i>hand</i> on my shoulder, probably trying to <i>reassure</i> and <i>comfort</i> me, at least from <i>his</i> point of view. I looked right at him and <i>fell</i> out of the bed, <i>hollering</i>, because I was startled at the time.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(With a look that says, "Oh God, he's embarassing the family again":) Yeesh</i>. Look, I'll <i>speak</i> to dad about that so he <i>won't</i> do it again--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Shakes his head:)</i> --No, it's <i>okay</i>. I'm guessing that, to <i>him</i>, at least, that he's trying to <i>make up</i> the time he <i>lost</i> by not having a--<I>son</I>. This may sound <i>crazy</i> to you, and it <i>probably</i> is--but <i>let</i> him <i>keep</i> doing it. <i>(Daria looks surprised)</i> After I got over my <i>initial</i> reaction over what he did, I listened with you all when he talked about <i>his</i> dad, my <i>possible</i> biological grandfather, and I couldn't help but feel a little <i>sorry</i> for him. If it <i>helps</i> him to get to know me <i>better</i> by doing that, it'll be <i>fine</i>--for a <i>while</i> at least. <i>(Narrows eyes:)</i> What sort of <i>"hell"</i> did his "Old Man" put him <i>through</i>? He said something about a <i>military school</i>--?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Looks up to think for a moment:)</i> Hmmm--well, from dad's "rantings", he's told us that grandpa <i>"Mad Dog"</i> Morgendorffer was a real <i>tyrant</i> and <i>bully</i> to him and grandma <i>Ruth</i>. Grandma generally looked the <i>other</i> way and <i>supported</i> grandpa when he <i>rode</i> dad. Grandpa wanted dad to be a <i>"man"</i>, and thusly sent him to the <i>Buxton Ridge Military Academy</i>, which promptly <i>changed</i> dad <i>forever</i>. Dad became <i>bitter</i> over what grandpa did, and even got <i>angry</i> with grandma over not standing up to grandpa. <i>(Note to reader: see "Jake of Hearts")</i> That little <i>"confrontation"</i> dad had with grandma over grandpa came after dad had a mild <i>heart attack. (Sees Darren's concerned look:)</i> I said <i>mild</i>. He's doing okay now, although he has to watch what he eats. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Speaking of which, I'd better <i>warn</i> you that mom's called <i>her</i> mom, grandma <i>Evelyn</i>, and grandma Ruth, along with aunt <i>Rita</i> and aunt <i>Amy</i> to meet you next week.</p>

<p><i>(Note to reader: I got the name of Jake's mom from "Jake of Hearts", and the name of Helen's mom from Kara Wild)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Yes, remember the <i>private eye</i> I told you and Quinn that I <i>hired</i> while going on our way to the motel where I stayed at?  <i>(Daria nods:)</i> Well, he gave me some <i>basic</i> background info that I had some relatives <i>outside</i> of you guys. What are they <i>like</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:) Prepare</i> yourself. Grandmas Ruth and Evelyn hadn't <i>seen</i> each other in <i>years</i>, and there's a <i>good</i> reason for that--they couldn't <i>stand</i> one another then when they had first met.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Cocked eyebrow:)</i> Oh? Why's that?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> What <i>else</i>? <i>"Your son/daughter isn't good enough for my  son/daughter"</i>. Grandma Evelyn at best <i>tolerates</i> dad because she kind of <i>still</i> sees him as the <i>spineless hippie</i> mom had left her family for, and at best tolerates him for <i>mom's</i> sake, while grandma Ruth has <i>never</i> forgiven mom for having the <i>audacity</i> to actually leave the house, and her family, to <i>work. (Smirks some more:)</i> But that's <i>only</i> the beginning. My aunts <I>Rita</I> and <I>Amy</I> are <i>coming</i>, too, and maybe my cousin <i>Erin</i> and her husband <i>Brian</i> will tag along, also. The only one <i>worthy</i> of my attention and respect is <i>my</i> favorite aunt, Amy. By the way, <i>don't</i> call her <i>"Aunt Amy"</i>, just <i>"Amy"</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Chuckles:)</i> Okay, I will--so <i>why</i> is Amy your <i>favorite</i> aunt?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sounding a little like admiration:)</i> Well, she doesn't give a <i>damn</i> about what anyone else thinks, like <i>me</i>. Amy takes <i>no</i> crap from anybody, and speaks her mind when she <i>feels</i> like it, and tells it like it is. She told me at Erin's wedding that when she was little, she was largely <i>ignored</i> by my mom and aunt Rita, who went at each other to <i>compete</i> over grandma Evelyn's attention. Amy told me she was left only with <i>color commentary</i>, and then one day, she found herself all grown-up, and taking no <i>B.S.</i> from anyone--<i>ever</i>.</p>

<p><i>(Note to reader: Of course, this was in "I Don't")</i></p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Holds his breath, letting it out slowly, sounding unsure:)</i> Ooooh--I <i>seeee</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: Ah, <i>don't</i> worry--Amy will <i>probably</i> like you--you're <i>innocent</i> of our family's <i>neurotic</i> tendencies. She likes to use sarcasm just like me to deal with <i>inordinate stupidity</i> when <i>confronted</i> by it. Some in our <i>nutty</i> family say she looks like an <i>older</i> version of me, and with her glasses, I suppose she <i>does</i>. However, <i>I</i> think <i>without</i> her glasses, she looks more like <i>(shudders:) Quinn</i>. Oh well, I guess even our <i>heroes</i> aren't perfect. <i>(Nod to Kara Wild on this one)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: I guess. <i>(Looks at his wind-up alarm clock on a table beside his bed:)</i> Hmm--it's almost <i>6:00 a.m.</i> Good time to go jogging right now--its <i>cool</i> in the morning. <i>You</i> jog?</p>

<p>DARIA: Nope. I tried <i>once</i> with Jane, but after <i>dragging</i> myself home, I vowed to <i>never</i> do it again. There's no way in <i>hell</i> I'd want to <i>kill</i> myself that way. A <i>self-inflicted gunshot to the head</i>, yeah--but <i>no</i> jogging.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Laughs:)</i> That's probably because you simply just <i>jumped</i> out there and jogged. Maybe you might want to start <i>slowly</i> and work your way <i>up</i>, you know, stretching and such, then--</p>

<p>DARIA: --Jane told me the <i>same</i> thing, and I told her to go take a <i>hike</i>. You now have the <i>honor</i> of hearing the <i>same</i> thing--<i>go take a hike. (Smirks)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Grins, holds his palms up, facing Daria:)</i> All right, okay! Well, in the meantime, I'll get the feel of the neighborhood, and see you in about an hour, and by that time, you people will be up and about to let me in.</p>

<p>DARIA: All right--and if by some reason mom and dad <i>die</i> between now and then, <i>I'll</i> let you in. <i>(Yawns:)</i> See you then. <i>(Leaves the room)</i></p>


     <p>Darren changed into tan sweatpants and a white cotton short-sleeved shirt, and quietly slipped out the Morgendorffer's home. He stopped on the front steps, put his hands over his eyes to shield them from the glare of the rising sun, and breathed in the morning air. Darren went out on the driveway to stretch his muscles, and after about ten minutes, began to jog.</p>

     <p>As he jogged, he took in the sites of this tiny suburban town called <i>Lawndale</i>, being careful to remember exactly where he was going, and looking at the street signs and for any particular landmarks. Darren had a small black pouch on a belt around his waist, facing the front. It contained a tiny amount of change, the map of Lawndale with the Morgendorffer's home street circled, and a slip of paper with the Morgendorffer's phone number, in case he got lost. He noticed that few people were up at this time of the morning, and that was <i>fine</i> by him. Darren needed to think, and with no distractions, he could do so at his leisure. He jogged up to a statue of a bearded man, and noticed the sign in front of it, which said <i>"Village Green"</i>. Darren jogged on the sidewalk that encircled the statue, and then stretched some more.</p>
 
     <p>He remembered the call he gave to his aunt the night before, and of her <i>shock</i> after he told her that he was staying with the Morgendorffers--she sounded <i>stunned</i> that they would take him in so quickly. Of course, Darren <i>didn't</i> tell her about his initial <i>impression</i> of them, for fear that she'd <i>scream</i> for him to come home. All he told her was that the Morgendorffers were very nice people who had invited him to stay over their house after they had <i>insisted</i> for him to do so. His aunt had sounded <i>reassured</i>, and said she'd leave for Europe immediately. Darren chuckled to himself over these people who were more than likely his birth family. <i>Helen</i>, the hard-driving attorney and <i>"I-wear-the-pants-in-this-family"</i> mother, who seemed to care more about her <i>job</i> than her family (although Darren was <i>sure</i> this <i>wasn't</i> totally true). <i>Jake</i>, the <i>meek</i> father who appeared to be <i>out</i> of this world (and of <i>reality</i> itself) at times, except when watching over <i>Darren. (Darren shuddered slightly over this thought,) Quinn</i>, the youngest sister who stresses <i>boys, fashion</i>, and <i>popularity</i> over anything else (though perhaps there was <i>more</i> to her than meets the eye).</p>

     <p>Then there was <i>Daria</i>. Darren narrowed his eyes when he thought of her. Where to <i>start</i>? She gives the impression that she's <i>above</i> it all, hiding how she <i>really</i> feels behind her sarcasm and <i>(very)</i> dry wit. <i>No</i> facial expressions. No <i>emotions</i>. Very <i>ordinary-looking</i> in appearance and in dress, but <i>highly</i> intelligent. <i>Not</i> popular--in fact the very <i>opposite</i> of Quinn. <i>How</i> to tell what she <i>really</i> thinks? Then it <i>hit</i> him--her <i>writing</i>. The words Daria wrote were <i>powerful and dark</i>, and contained a force that gave him the <i>chills</i>, in fact, the <i>same</i> sort of chill he had received when he saw <i>Doctor Turley</i> on his deathbed. Darren <i>winced</i> silently to himself when he thought about Daria, giving himself a <i>grim</i> chuckle.</p>

     <p>Darren finished his stretching, and began to jog around the statue again, this time almost retracing his route on his way back to the Morgendorffers. He rounded a corner that was blocked by a tall hedge of bushes and promptly ran <i>into</i> a man, who was wearing a baby blue sweatsuit, and a <i>woman</i>, who was wearing a pink sweatsuit, and jogging in the <i>other</i> direction. All three fell unto the pavement, and the woman got up and promptly <i>screamed</i> at Darren.</p>


<p>WOMAN: <i>(Definitely PO'd:)</i> You <i>MAN</i>! Can't you watch <i>where</i> you're going?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Flinches back slightly, looking up at her:)</i> Er, <i>sorry</i>, ma'am--I didn't see you!</p>

<p>MAN: <i>(While getting up and offering a hand to Darren, sounding very soft-spoken and timid:)</i> Now, <i>Janet</i>, I'm sure that we were just as <i>much</i> at fault as this young man, if not <i>moreso. (Points to a small sign nearby:)</i> See? It says <i>Joggers-One-Way-Only</i>, and that young man <i>(motions his head in Darren's direction:) was</i> going in the <i>right</i> direction. I'm afraid <i>we</i> were going the <i>wrong</i> way.<i>(Helps Darren up)</i></p>

<p>JANET: <i>(Slightly calmed down, but still glares at Darren:)</i> He's a <i>MAN</i>! <i>ALL</i> men are <i>always</i> wrong! <i>(Sees the soft-spoken man wilt slightly over her remark, softens her tone for him)</i> Well, maybe <i>not</i> you, <i>"Skinny". (The soft-spoken man gives a "cute" smile to her)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Remembers what Daria told him last night about a "Ms. Barch", carefully chooses his words:)</i> Uh, may I ask you a <i>question</i>, ma'am?</p>

<p>JANET: <i>(Raises her voice back at Darren, which makes him flinch again:)</i> What <i>sort</i> of question, you <i>MAN</i>?! Oh, I <i>see</i>! You're trying to <i>proposition</i> me, aren't you?! <i>All</i> of you men <i>always</i> want to proposition us women, <i>get</i> what you <i>"want"</i>, and then <i>spit</i> us out--<i>(points into Darren's chest with every word:) just--like--HIM</i>! <i>(The soft-spoken man watching them both cringes back from her ranting)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Fights against the urge to run from this "she-demon", asks:)</i> No ma'am! It's <i>nothing</i> like that, <i>really</i>! <i>(Looks over at the cringing man, who looks ready to about to cry, points at him)</i> I mean, er, I wouldn't have a <i>chance</i> with <i>him</i> around anyway, <i>right</i>? I just want to know something--<i>(narrows eyes:)</i> is your <i>last</i> name <i>Barch</i>?</p>

<p>JANET: <i>(Now surprised:) Hah</i>? <i>(Frowns:) How</i> did you <i>know</i> my name, you <i>man</i>? <i>(Begins to walk towards Darren meanacingly:)</i> Have you been <i>stalking</i> me?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Backs away calmly, holds up his hands:) No ma'am</i>! It's just that my, uh--<i>sister</i> told me about you, that's all!</p>

<p>JANET: <i>(Still scowls, moves forward:)</i> And <i>who</i> might <i>that</i> be, you <i>man</i>?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Pauses:)</i> Um--<i>Daria Morgendorffer</i>.</p>


     <p>Janet Barch and the cringing man looked at each other, stunned, then Ms. Barch turned back to Darren, and <i>really</i> frowned, this time <i>rushing</i> forward towards him.</p>


<P>JANET: Now I <I>know</I> you're <I>lying</I>, you <I>man</I>! Daria Morgendorffer's a student of <I>Timothy O'Neill's</I> and mine, and she has no <I>brothers</I>, only a sister named Quinn! <I>(Takes a swing at Darren, who avoids it, and runs for his life)</I> Come <I>back</I> here, you <I>stalker</I>! <I>(She now chases him)</I></P>


     <P>Darren <I>flew</I> around the corner of a nearby building, with Ms. Barch <I>hot</I> on his heels. Only when he hit the <I>afterburners</I> did he lose her, but not before he heard her shout:</P>


<P>JANET: Wait until I call the <I>police</I>, you <I>scum</I>! There's no place you'll be able to hide from <I>them</I>--or <I>me</I>!</P>


     <P>Darren ran <I>wide-eyed</I>, and did not stop until he was sure he had <I>completely</I> lost that woman--and eventually <I>himself</I>. He looked around for any sort of landmark while leaning against a telephone pole, and gasping for breath. He then scratched his head in confusion--he was <i>lost</i>. Darren took out the map of Lawndale from his pouch and spread it out on a nearby bench, slowly tracing his finger from the street where the Morgendorffers lived relative to his current position. He looked around and saw immediately that he was near some <I>shops</I>. Taking the map with him, Darren followed the street until he saw a street sign that said <I>Dega Street</I>. This was Lawndale's <I>dying</I> shopping district, thanks to <I>Cranberry Commons</I>. He folded up the map and put it back in his pouch, and began to make his way back to the Morgendorffers, all the while <I>watching out</I> for that <I>Barch</I> woman. He paused for a second when he thought about that, and <I>chuckled</I> to himself at at the irony--<I>another</I> female was <I>after</I> him--but <I>this</I> time, wanted to <I>hurt</I> him, not try to <I>like</I> him--quite an--<I>interesting</I> change in a way.</P> 


<P><I>(Scene is back at the Morgendorffer's--the same time)</I></P>


     <P>Helen Morgendorffer was preparing to do the <I>unthinkable</I>--take a <I>half-day</I> off from work, her final day working until she and Jake would be off for vacation all of next week. There was so much to do between now and then, with her mother, mother-in-law, and sisters coming over to see Darren, and in that aspect, her <I>house</I> for the first time, save for Amy, Ruth, and her niece Erin, who had been over before. Then she thought about the <I>DNA test</I> she had arranged for her, Jake, and Darren to take at the <I>Cedars of Lawndale</I> Hospital, a test she thought there was <I>no</I> need for, for from the moment she <I>saw</I> Darren standing up and <I>looking</I> at her and Jake in the food court, she knew <I>immediately</I> that this <I>handsome</I> young man was indeed her and Jake's <I>son</I>. Any trace of <I>doubt</I> or <I>skepticism</I> had <I>vanished</I>--those <I>eyes</I> did the <I>trick</I> for her--the type of eyes that only a <I>mother</I> could understand. Helen thought of what her mother, Amy, and Rita would think when they saw Darren, and <I>smirked</I>. Her mother had <I>no</I> sons, of course, and her dad <I>Howard Barksdale</I> had always wanted one, instead getting Amy, and according to Amy, <I>holding</I> it <I>against</I> her.</P> 

     <P>Then there was <I>Rita</I>. Helen thought about how it seemed how her mother would always <I>favor</I> Rita over her, and all of the <I>fights</I> that would take place between she and her sister. The rivalry was <I>always</I> fierce between the two, vying for their mother's attention, with, from Helen's point of view, <I>Rita</I> coming out on top more than often. Well now, with <I>Darren</I>, the scales could be tipped in <I>her</I> direction, <I>not</I> Rita's. Even with the long <I>talk</I> she and her sisters and mother had had when Helen had <I>separated</I> from Jake for a few days, both <I>still</I> had that rivalry. After all, one simply can't sweep years of <I>resentment</I> under the rug after <I>one</I> talk, right?</P>
                                                                             
<P><I>(Read Kara Wild's terrific fanfics "The Tie That Chokes" for Amy's visit, and "None In The Family" for Helen's father's name, Amy's claim, and the Barksdale-Morgendorffer women's "talk")</I></P>

     <P>Helen smirked <I>again</I> at this thought while she sat at the table and drank her usual cup of coffee, when her cell phone rang. She clicked the phone on.</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(In her falsetto voice:) Helloooo</I>?</P>

<P>VOICE: <I>(Sounding soft and hesitant:) H-hello</I>, M-Mrs. <I>Morgendriffer</I>?</P>


     <P>Helen <I>frowned</I>. She knew <I>immediately</I> who this voice belonged to, having heard it several times concerning her daughters about school. It represented everything she <I>loathed--slow</I>, and <I>unsure</I>, not knowing how to proceed, <I>easily</I> intimidated--something Helen Morgendorffer vowed she'd <I>never</I> go through again, not since that night she had decided to allow that <I>S.O.B.</I> Turley to <I>"operate"</I> on her after she thought Jake had fainted.</P>


<P>HELEN: <I>(Annoyed:)</I> Hello, <I>Mr. O'Neill</I>, and it is Morgen<I>DORFFER</I>, at least get it <I>right</I>! If this is about Quinn's <I>grades</I>, you'd <I>better</I> have one <I>hell</I> of an <I>explanation</I> as to <I>why</I> you're calling about them <I>now</I>! Why did you wait to say there was a <I>mistake</I> in her passing? You <I>do</I> realize--</P>

<P>MR. O'NEILL: <I>(Cuts her off frantically:)</I> --N-no, no, Mrs. Morgendorffer! It's <I>not</I> about Quinn! I'm calling to ask if you've ever heard of a young man who <I>claims</I> to be your and your husband's <I>son</I>--Daria and Quinn's <I>brother</I>!</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Stunned:)</I> H-how did you know about my <I>son</I>, Mr. O'Neill? What in the <I>hell</I> is this all about?!</P>

<P>MR. O'NEILL: <I>(Sounding equally stunned:)</I> Y-you mean that that fellow <I>is</I> your son? B-but <I>how</I>--?</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Now furious:)</I> I <I>ASKED</I> you a <I>question</I>, Mr. O'Neill! <I>How</I> did you <I>know</I> about my son?!</P>

<P>MR. O'NEILL: <I>(In his "I'd-better-hurry-up-or-this-woman-will-kill-me" mode:) Eep!I'msorry,Mrs.Morgendorffer!Ms.BarchandIwerejoggingtogetherandweranintothisyoungmanwhoclaimedthatDariawashissister--</I></P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Rolls her eyes:)</I> He <I>is</I> Jake and mine's son, Mr. O'Neill, and <I>slow down</I>! You said he was jogging when you and Ms. Barch ran into him?</P>

<P>MR. O'NEILL: <I>(Now a bit calmer:)</I> Y-yes, Mrs. Morgendorffer! B-but I-I don't understand--</P>

<P>HELEN: It's <I>quite</I> a <I>long</I> story, Mr. O'Neill, one I <I>can't</I> tell to you over the phone. Now, what <I>happened</I> to him?</P>

<P>MR. O'NEILL: W-well, Mrs. Morgendorffer, after we ran into him, I helped him up. M-Ms. Barch, w-who's <I>standing</I> here beside me at the telephone booth, g-got <I>angry</I> with him, and--<I>(voice changes)</I></P>

<P>MS. BARCH: <I>(Sounding a bit apologetic:)</I> --I thought he was trying to <I>proposition</I> me because he told me my last name, and I'd never seen him before. He said that Daria was his <I>sister</I>, and I said that Daria <I>never</I> had a brother. I--<I>swung</I> at him, but he avoided me, and ran away. I <I>chased</I> him a little bit, but I lost him. I was going to call the <I>police</I>, but <I>Skin</I>--I mean, <I>Mr. O'Neill</I>, wanted me to call your house <I>first</I> to see if that young man's claim was true. <I>(Pauses:)</I> He really <I>is</I> your son?</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Sighs, tries to remain calm:)</I> Yes, Ms. Barch, he is, or I <I>assume</I> will be after my husband and I take a <I>DNA test</I> with him later today. I only hope he didn't get <I>lost</I>.</P>

<P>MS. BARCH: I'm <I>so</I> sorry, Mrs. Morgendorffer. Mr. O'Neill and I plan to resume our jog and keep an eye out for that <I>MAN</I>--I mean, your <I>son</I>. Is there <I>anything</I> we can do?</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Thought v.o.: Haven't you done enough, <b>man-hater</b>?)</I> No, no--<I>wait</I>. Maybe you <I>can</I> do something. I'd like to ask you and Mr. O'Neill to keep <I>quiet</I> over what you heard concerning our son. My husband and I want no unnecessary <I>gossip</I> to <I>spread</I> around the area, and we want to break the news to everyone on our <I>own</I> terms--will you <I>please</I> do that?</P>

<P>MS. BARCH: Of course, dearie--it's the least we can do. <I>(Pauses:)</I> I have <I>one</I> question to ask, though--<I>what</I> is your son's <I>name</I>, in case we spot him while we're out?</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Sounding relieved:)</I> His name is <I>Darren</I>. Thank you, Ms. Barch, goodbye.</P>

<P>MS. BARCH: <I>Darren</I>--goodbye, Mrs. Morgendorffer. <I>(Hangs up)</I></P>

     <P>Helen clicked off her cell phone and sat down at the table a little <I>worried</I>. She thought about telling <I>Jake</I>, who, like her was getting ready to work a half-day, but she held back out of knowing that he'd go <I>berserk</I>, and tear out of the house looking for Darren, the <I>last</I> thing any of them would need right now. She narrowed her eyes, deep in thought. Helen considered that her son seemed to be a responsible young man, and there was no need to panic, at least not yet. She decided to wait at least for at least about <I>twenty</I> minutes, then alert the others. About this time, Jake walked into the kitchen tying his necktie, getting some coffee.</P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Excited:)</I> Hi, honey! <I>(Bends down to kiss Helen's cheek:)</I> Today's the day we get that DNA test thingy! Are ya ready, Helen?</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Tries to sound calm, covers her nervousness to keep Jake in the dark:) What</I>? Oh yes, Jakey. It's a <I>big</I> day, today, yes indeed.</P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Narrows his eyes:)</I> Say, honey, you <I>okay</I>? I heard the phone ringing when I was changing in my clothes in our bedroom, and I knew you were downstairs and let you get it. Something wrong? <I>Who</I> was on the phone?</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Widens her eyes:)</I> It was a--<I>wrong</I> number, Jakey, and <I>nothing's</I> wrong with me! I'm just--a little <I>nervous</I> about the test we're taking today, that's all. I suppose the phone suddenly ringing like that made me a little--<I>jumpy</I>.</P>

<P>JAKE: <I>(Sits down beside Helen, puts his arm around her:)</I> Aw, it's all right, Helen. <I>You're</I> the one who said he's our son, and after looking at him <I>myself</I>, I can see that you're <I>right</I>! That test is just a mere <I>formality. (Chuckles:)</I> Don't tell me you've gotten <I>second</I> thoughts?</P>

<p>HELEN: <i>(With a quick glare at Jake:)</i> No, of course not, Jake. I'm just thinking--<i>(changes the subject:)</i> about, uh--<i>next</i> week, you know, with our mothers, my sisters, and Erin and Brian coming over, and how we'll have to handle the <i>expected</i> chaos over our mothers coming <i>together</i>, and all that.</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Waves Helen off:)</i> Oh--well now, I wouldn't worry too much over <i>that</i>, honey. I'm guessing <i>Darren</i> might be able to help everybody <i>come</i> together and stuff. When our mothers take one <i>look</i> at him, they'll go <i>ga-ga</i>!</p>
 
<p>HELEN: <i>(Glances at the front door in the living room, expecting to see Darren at any moment:)</i> I suppose they will, Jakey--I suppose they will.</p>


     <p>Darren had finally found his way back to the Morgendorffer's, although he had to go around the way he came through before because of that <i>Barch</i> woman. He was into his jogging regimen again and had spotted the Morgendorffer home base, when a beat-up, smoking, early-70's model blue Pinto came driving past him, leaving him in a cloud of smoke, gas, and oil fumes. He coughed and waved his hands, trying to fan the smoke away from him. Darren noticed that the car pulled in <i>front</i> of the Morgendorffer's, and a young man with not-quite shoulder-length brown hair got out of the car. Though he couldn't see the man from a distance too clearly, the man looked <i>worried</i>. Darren picked up his pace going back.</p>

     <p>Helen suddenly heard the doorbell ring. Jake had went back upstairs to finish getting ready for work, so she wouldn't have to worry about him seeing her <i>reaction</i> over Darren coming back. She felt relieved--her <i>baby</i> was okay. Helen rushed to the front door, and reached out to <i>hug and kiss</i> her son.</p>


<p>HELEN: <i>(Sobs slightly, eyes closed:)</i> Oh, <i>son</i>! It's okay! You're <i>home</i>, now! <i>(Kissing the person she <b>thinks</b> is Darren's cheeks)</i></p>

<p>TOM: <i>(Eyes wide open over Helen's fierce hug and cheek kisses:) Mrs. Morgendorffer</i>! <i>Stop</i>! What <i>are</i> you doing?! <i>(Helen's eyes open, grow even bigger than Tom's, and she draws back, horrified)</i></p>

     <p>Darren saw the woman who could be his birth mother <i>hug and kiss</i> this <i>stranger</i>. What in the <i>hell</i> was going on?</p>

     <p>Jake, who had come out of his room with his briefcase, and Daria, who along with Quinn were in their nightclothes, had come out of their rooms and had met their father in the hallway, and then came down the stairs. They became <i>stunned</i> at what they saw. What in the <i>hell</i> was going on?</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Grows furious:)</i> What-the-<i>hell</i>--?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Frowns in disgust:) EWWWWWW</i>!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Stunned for an instant, then smirks while coming down the stairs with Quinn and Jake:)</i> Now, <i>how</i> long has <i>this</i> been going on? What will <i>Jane</i> think? Mom, I didn't know you had it <i>in</i> you! <i>(Begins singing in her sarcastic tone, Mona Lisa smile:) Mom and Tom, sitting in a tree--</i></p>

<p>HELEN & TOM: <i>(Both frantically waving their arms, hollering over each other, Tom wiping his cheeks:) NO, NO</i>! It's <i>not</i> what you think! <i>No</i> way in hell--<i>(both look at each other, red-faced:) no offense! I only like Jane! Jake, I only love you! Nothing happened!</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Quickly steps in front of an <b>angry</b> Jake, who's coming down the stairs past Daria and Quinn, and staring <b>daggers</b> at a <b>frightened</b> Tom:)</i> Take it <i>easy</i> Jake! I thought Tom was <i>Darren</i>!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks in the doorway:) That</i> was for <i>me</i>?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Sees Darren, delighted:)</i> Oh, son! Thank <i>God</i> you're okay! <i>(Runs forward and hugs him, but leaves Tom er, <b>defenseless</b>)</i></p>

<p>TOM: <i>(Eyes <b>really</b> wide open now, because Jake isn't stopping, looks at Helen <b>frantically</b>:)</i> Uh, Mrs. Morgendorffer, <i>help</i> me!</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Takes her attention away from Darren, frowns at Jake:) JAKE</i>! GET A <i>GRIP</i>!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Steps up:)</i> Um, you know, Mom, for <i>some</i> reason that I can't quite <i>gasp</i>, I kind of think that is the <i>worse</i> possible thing you can say to Dad at this <i>critical</i> moment in time--</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Suddenly snaps out of his rage just as he was about to put his hands around Tom's neck:) Huh</i>? <i>(Sees Darren, grins:)</i> Oh, <i>hi</i>, Big Guy! Been joggin', huh? <i>(Tom wipes his head in relief, sighs)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Uh, yes I <i>have. (Looks down at Helen:)</i> Ah, <i>why</i> the sudden show of <i>affection</i>?</p>

<p>HELEN: Mr. O'Neill and Ms. Barch called me this morning and told me you ran into them while jogging. Ms. Barch said she swung at you because she thought you had <i>propositioned</i> her--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(More smirking:) --Wow</i>, Darren, <i>first</i> Mom <i>and</i> Tom, and <i>now</i> you <i>and</i> Ms. Barch? I guess <i>love</i> is <i>truly</i> in the air-- <i>(Darren snickers at this, while Helen and Tom scowl at Daria, red-faced again--even Quinn tries not to laugh, while Jakes stares at Darren like a grinning idiot again)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: --<i>DARIA</i>! <i>(Looks back at Darren:)</i> Anyway, she said you ran off and out of sight, and I thought you might've gotten <i>lost</i> or something. I decided to wait for a little to see if you came in, which you did.</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Snaps out of his "trance", inquisitive:) Hey</i>, Helen! You told me that phone call was a <i>wrong</i> number this morning, <i>not</i> Ms. Barch and Mr. O'Neill!</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Sighs, goes up to Jake, puts her hand on his chest:)</i> I'm sorry, Jakey. I didn't want you to be <i>worried</i>--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:)</i> --Or driving out on the street like a <i>madman</i> looking for Darren--<i>(Helen glares at Daria) what</i>? <i>(Looks at Tom, motions to him to follow her into the den:)</i> C'mon, Tom--I've got the feeling that you've come to talk to me, am I right?</p>

<p>TOM: <i>(While following Daria:)</i> Er, yeah, Daria--did I just <i>hear</i> your parents say that this guy <i>"Darren"</i> is--</p>

<p>DARIA: --Their <i>son</i> and mine and Quinn's <i>bro</i>? Uh-huh, just <i>about</i>--it's kind of a <i>long</i> story. I'll explain in our den, and tell you about Jane's call to me last night. <i>(Both she and Tom disappear in the den)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks at Helen:)</i> Actually, I <i>did</i> get lost--for a few minutes, anyway. But I had the map of Lawndale in my pouch here, <i>(pulls out map to show Helen, Jake, and Quinn:)</i> and I read it, followed it, and it turned out okay.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Walks up to Darren:)</i> Darren, can we go <i>out</i> today? We can go to eat out at <i>Chez Pierre</i>, and--</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Glares at Quinn:)</i> --Now Ouinn, Your father and I are going with Darren to the hospital about 1:30 today for the test. He <i>won't</i> be able to eat lunch with you at <i>Chez Pierre</i>.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Rolls her eyes:) MUH--OOOM</i>! You and dad won't be with Darren at the hospital <i>all</i> day, right? Darren and I can go <i>after</i> you get back
--</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(No-nonsense tone:)</i> --And <i>ruin</i> your appetite for dinner? I <i>don't</i> think so, young lady!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks over at Quinn:)</i> Hey, it's okay, Quinn--we can go to eat at this <i>"Chez Pierre"</i> early next week, or whenever. How about you, me, and Daria go out to eat lunch <i>before</i> I go to the hospital? You know, a cafe or something?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Disappointed, but somewhat pacified:)</i> Oh, okay. <i>(Thinks:)</i> I guess we can go to that <i>Pizza King</i> place that Daria and her <i>weirdo</i> friend Jane go to, and I can get <i>cheeseless</i> pizza, or something.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Satisfied:)</i> Good. You and Daria can <i>bond</i> with Darren, and then he can take you two <i>with</i> him to the hospital. <i>(Looks at her watch:)</i> Oh! I'm late! <i>(Gets her briefcase that was lying near the door:)</i> I'll see you later at the hospital, Jakey, Darren, Quinn. <i>(Leaves out the front)</i></p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Looks at his watch, too:) Yipes</i>! I gotta go, too! Take it easy, you two! <i>(Snatches up his briefcase, and leaves, shuts the door)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Stretches, yawns:)</i> Gee, I'm still tired, Darren. <i>(Goes to kitchen, followed by Darren)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Maybe you wouldn't feel so tired, Quinn, if you excercise <i>and</i> jog.</p>


     <p>Quinn and Darren entered the kitchen.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>Jog</i>? <i>(Shudders:) EEEW</i>! I'd get <i>hot n'sweaty</i> n' stuff! Sweat does <i>not</i> look good on the <i>fashionably correct</i>. It's so--<i>icky</i>. Besides, I watch my weight by eating right and stuff. <i>(Opens refrigerater door, gets out fruit and a diet soda:)</i> See? This is all I need for breakfast. <i>(Sits down at the table while Darren gets a bowl and pours out some cereal, then sits at the table with Quinn)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Shrugs, sits down at the table:)</i> Suit yourself. I meant to tell you about going to the Fashion Institute--you need a <i>good</i> grade point average to get in, Quinn. What was it in high school this year?</p>


     <p>Quinn <i>moaned</i>--this was <i>not</i> a good sign to Darren, who cocked an eyebrow in curiousity.</p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to the den, about 10 minutes later)</i></p>



     <p>Daria had explained to Tom the story about Darren. Tom, of course was just as shocked as she thought he'd be.</p>

<p>TOM: That's--<i>incredible</i>!</p> 

<p>DARIA: Yeah, I know--<i>instant</i> brother--<i>maybe. (Changes subject abruptly:)</i> Look, before you ask, Jane called me last night. <i>(Narrows her eyes:)</i> I was able to convince her to give you <i>another</i> chance, and you <i>damn</i> well <i>better</i> make the <i>most</i> of it, because I'm <i>not</i> gonna keep trying to put you both together.</p>

<p>TOM: <i>(Grows quiet:)</i> Yeah, I see your <i>point</i>. It <i>was</i> stupid of me to think that Jane doesn't take her art <i>seriously</i>, dismissing the argument like that.</p>

<p>DARIA: She also said that you <i>control</i> her.</p>

<p>TOM: <i>(Raises an eyebrow:) What</i>? Hey, I want what <i>Jane</i> wants! I <i>don't</i> control her! <i>Where'd</i> she get that? What in the world is <i>she</i> seeing?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> Hey, we girls see things you guys <i>don't</i>. Maybe if you looked through <i>her</i> eyes, you'd see what <i>she</i> sees. <i>(Pauses, hesitates:)</i> Look, Tom--I'm going to ask you to do <i>one</i> thing for me concerning what's going on between you and Jane.</p>

<p>TOM: And <i>that</i> is---?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sighs:)</i> Leave me <i>out</i> of it from now on, okay? This isn't the <i>"Dating Game"</i>, and I'm not the <i>host. (Goes into a dark tone:)</i> You've gotten <i>one</i> more chance, mister--<i>make</i> it count. Call her <i>tonight</i>.</p>

<p>TOM: <i>(Considers the tone of Daria's words:)</i> Okay, fair enough--no more <i>dragging</i> you in the middle of our problems, Daria. I know you've done <i>more</i> than enough, and I want to <i>thank</i> you for that.</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smiles slightly at him, catches herself, then suddenly frowns:)</i> As you <i>damn</i> well <i>should</i>, Tom. Jane's my friend, and I don't want to see her <i>hurt</i>.</p> 

<p>TOM: Don't worry, Daria--I'd never <i>willingly hurt</i> Jane--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Cocks eyebrow:)</i> --Or otherwise <i>unwillingly</i>, right?</p>

<p>TOM: <i>(Chuckles softly:)</i> Right. <i>(Pauses:)</i> I'd better get to work, then. See you.</p>

<p>DARIA: Okay, then, and good luck--break a <i>leg. (Thought v.o.: Just--just don't break a damn <b>heart</b>.)</i></p>


     <p>Tom and Daria came out of the den just as Quinn and Darren were coming out of the kitchen.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(Frowns:)</i> I have to have at least a <i>"B"</i> average to get in? That's <i>not</i> fair! I'd <i>have</i> to be like a freakin' <i>brain</i> to do <i>that</i>!</p>

<p>DARREN: Sorry, Quinn--that's what I heard about enrolling in the Fashion Institute. We can get into their <i>website</i> later on your <i>laptop</i> and see what they have in their curriculum.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Looks down, pouts:)</i> Oh, <i>all right</i>.</p>

<p>TOM: Hello, Darren. <i>(Extends hand)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Shakes Tom's hand:)</i> Hello, Tom--nice to meet you, although it was under less than--<i>ideal</i> circumstances. <i>(Grins)</i></p>

<p>TOM: <i>(Grins as well:)</i> Sorry you thought I was making a <i>"move"</i> on your <i>mom</i>.</p>


     <p>Darren stopped for a brief moment and thought about Tom's seemingly <i>innocuous</i> remark. His <i>mom</i>? They would all find out later if this were true--for the moment, he let it slide, and spoke.</p>


<p>DARREN: No problem--I don't think she was your <i>"type"</i>, anyway.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks, looks at Tom:)</i> Hey, if you and Jane can't work out your differences, maybe my mom will be <i>available</i> for a <i>torrid</i> affair.</p>

<p>TOM: <i>(Rolls his eyes:)</i> No offense, but <i>that'll</i> be the day. See you all.</p>

<p>DARIA: Adios. <i>(Opens door for Tom, who leaves, then shuts the door, gives a little sigh:)</i> And that is <i>that</i>.</p> 

<p>QUINN: <i>(Disgusted look:) Ugh</i>! Jane sure knows how to <i>pick</i> 'em, huh?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:)</i> Look <i>who's</i> talking. <i>You</i> pick guys about as often as a <i>snot-covered booger</i> is picked out of a <i>nose</i> --by <i>anybody</i>--at </i>anytime</i>. MMM-yum! <i>Brown gold, Texas-tee</i>! <i>(Darren tries to hold it in, but to no avail, for he's laughing out loud)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Now so disgusted, she dosen't notice Darren's reaction:) EWWWWWWW</i>! You're <i>gross</i>, Daria! I'm gettin' out of here! <i>(Goes upstairs)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> I've done it <i>again</i>--Quinn has been <i>driven away. Damn</i>, I'm good. <i>(Looks at a still-laughing Darren:)</i> I <i>do</i> hope I've started <i>your</i> day right, <i>bro</i>--Ms. Barch's little <i>"chase"</i> notwithstanding.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Tries to control his laughing:)</i> O-oh I'm g-getting there, Daria. When do you want to leave for the Lane's?</p> 

<p>DARIA: Let me change out of my pajamas, shower, and I'll be ready in an hour. I'll use the master bath in mom and dad's room.</p>

<p>DARREN: Okay, and I'll use the guest bath--<i>(stops, realizes something, his smile slowly fades, looks directly at Daria:)</i> uh, Daria--?</p>

<p>DARIA: Huh? What is it?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Hesitates:)</i> Ah, I don't know if you <i>noticed</i> this or not--but, well--you just called me, uh--your <i>"bro"</i>.


     <p>Daria's eyes grew <i>wide</i> in realization--Darren was <i>right</i>. She <i>did</i> call him that--and it seemed to come out in a <i>casual</i> way, like it was <i>always</i> so. What just <i>got into</i> her? <i>Why</i> did she <i>say</i> that? For a <i>rare</i> moment, Daria felt <i>exposed</i>, as if her inner <i>weakness</i> had been <i>torn</i> away--she considered herself <i>fortunate</i> that Darren did <i>not</i> know her that well--if it had been <i>Jane</i>, she'd <i>die</i> of embarassment, not that she wasn't feeling it <i>now</i>, at least a little. She quickly developed an <i>excuse</i> to <i>cover</i> herself.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Shrugs, gives a quick little smile:)</i> Well, uh--<i>why not</i>? If <i>Quinn</i> can get <i>away</i> with calling you that, and mom and dad can get away with calling you their <i>son</i>, then I might as well get with the <i>program</i> too. <i>(Turns around quickly:)</i> See you in a few--er, <i>bro. (Leaves up the stairs quickly)</i></p>


     <p>Darren stared up at the stairs for a moment, then slowly <i>smiled</i>. He then started up the stairs as well. He did not know that Daria had quickly went into her room, leaned against her closed door, <i>completely</i> red-faced, and <i>relieved</i> to get past the moment, taking deep breaths.</p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to the Appleton Tower, the same time)</i></p>


     <p>William Appleton stood in the middle of his office, a large, opulent area with a huge oak desk and a white Persian rug in front of the desk. There were two white leather couches that sat perpendicular to the desk in the front of it, and both couches were on either side of the rug, which lay on the black plushy carpet of the entire office floor. Sitting on the rug was an ivory coffee table, and on the table was a silver tray with a silver pot full of tea, some biscuits, and sugar. The walls that surrounded the office on three sides were made of white marble, with tall oak bookcases full of books on two of the walls, and a small oak conference table with four chairs along the other wall. The remaining wall was of tinted glass, with a breathtaking view of the New York City skyline. The office's fluorescent lighting was turned down so that the light that had shown through from the outside was the predominant light. Benny, who was writing on a pad, was sitting on one of the couches, listening to William, who in turn was staring out of the window across his desk.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Deep in thought:)</i> --Yes, Benny, <i>Leonard Potter</i> has to be <i>dealt</i> with as soon as possible. I'm <i>sick</i> and <i>tired</i> of his <i>damn</i> legalistic company nonsense. Every time I make a <i>move</i>, he sticks his nose in, and says <i>(in a mocking tone:) "We can't do this, we can't do that"</i>. I think a <i>transfer</i> way out to our <i>West</i> coast branch will do him some good, as well as us, and then we can put <i>our</i> own legal man in.</p>

<p>BENNY: I'm on it, Boss. <i>(Smirks:)</i> That stiff jerk's as good as gone, but--<i>(hesitates, while William cuts his eyes back to Benny)</i> do you think he'll go <i>willingly</i>, Boss? He might <i>fight</i> it. <i>(William grins at this)</i></p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>Let</i> him. My <i>dream</i> would be to see Leonard <i>quit</i> in protest, but I'll guess that he'd <i>fight</i> it, not that it will do him <i>any</i> good, because we have an opening in the legal department out there that needs to be filled, and I can say that he's the <i>only</i> one that can fill it, based on his <i>experience</i>. If he fights it, I'm within my power to <i>fire</i> that <i>bastard</i>. Either way, I <i>can't</i> lose.</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Grins wickedly:) Shrewd</i>, Boss. <i>(Looks down at some notes on the coffee table:)</i> The <i>energy division chief</i> should be up here soon for that meeting she wants.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Scowls, sits down in the couch opposite of Benny:)</i> That damn <i>know-it-all shrew</i>. I <i>hope</i> she says she <i>can't</i> sell those two nuclear plants so I can <i>fire</i> her. <i>(Looks at Benny with a bit of a reflective look on his face:)</i> You know, Benny--I <i>miss</i> the good old days, when women <i>knew</i> their place, stayed at home, and <i>laid up</i> and had the <i>babies</i>. They'd cook our <i>food</i>, washed our <i>clothes</i>, and raised our <i>children. (Shakes his head slowly:) Damn</i>, I'm glad I <i>didn't</i> marry in this day and age, or <i>ever</i>. My wife would run <i>everything</i>, and I'd have to <i>cower</i> at every <i>rant</i> she'd make. It would have been <i>pathetic--hell</i>, I'd have no <i>backbone</i>, because if I'd ever laid a <i>hand</i> on her in anger, I'd be in <i>jail</i> so fast, my head would spin.</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Nods his head, grows quiet:) Yeah</i>, Boss--those <i>were</i> the days.</p>

     <p>The intercom on William's desk buzzed, and his secretary came on the speaker.</p>

<p>SECRETARY: Mr. Appleton, Ms. <i>Constance Waters</i> is here.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Gets up with Benny:)</i> Very good, send her in.</p>

     <p>The secretary opened the door, and Constance Waters walked in holding a folder. She had been in the divisional meeting a few days before, the one division chief that had <i>stood up</i> to William. Constance had a <i>confident</i> air about her, dressed in a blue power suit, with deep brown eyes, and had brown and gray-streaked, shoulder-length hair. Her face was rather youthful-looking, with what William would classify as something of a--<i>smirk</i>? <i>Could it be--</i>?</p>

<p>CONSTANCE: Thank you for meeting me on such short notice, William. <i>(Shakes his hand)</i></p>

<p>WILLIAM: Well, I was rather <i>curious</i> as to why you'd insist on meeting me so quickly after our divisional meeting. <i>(Manages a faux smile:)</i> Don't tell me you've already <i>sold</i> those plants, eh?</p>

<p>CONSTANCE: <i>(Definitely smirks even more now:)</i> Okay, I <i>won't</i> tell you, William.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Eyes grow as big as saucers:)</i> Y-you <i>DID</i>? <i>(Pauses, narrows his eyes at her:)</i> Did you sell them at a <i>profit</i>?</p>

<p>CONSTANCE: <i>(Gives William the folder:)</i> See for yourself. <i>(William looks in the folder) Fuju</i>, a Japanese energy subsidiary of <i>Tsunama</i>, bought <i>both</i>, and intend to convert them to garbage-burning plants. <i>(Smiles:)</i> Not only <i>that</i>, but they intend to <i>share</i> the cost of converting it with us in return for <i>our</i> investment <i>in</i> Tsunama--we will have a <i>50%</i> share of it--pending approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Federal Trade Commission.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Stunned with Benny:) W-what</i>? H-how? Appleton's been trying for <i>years</i> to get in that area of the Asian market! <i>(Looks in the folder again, with an equally-stunned Benny looking over his shoulder)</i></p>

<p>CONSTANCE: <i>Simple</i>. As I said before, we'd help them convert--for a share of their head company, Tsumana. Garbage-burning plants are <i>very</i> profitable these days, and Fuju wanted a share in the American market as well, so we stepped in <i>their</i> market, and they stepped in <i>ours</i>. I'd like to add we came out <i>ahead</i> in making a profit--at least a <i>33%</i> profit margin for us in terms of investing in their market verses the cost of helping them convert our two plants. Their chairman will be here next week to sign the agreement with you. <i>(William looks up slowly from the folder, with a strained look on his face)</i></p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Shakes his head slowly, faux impressed:)</i> Well, I must say, Constance, I <i>am</i> pleased with this. <i>(Shakes her hand:)</i> Good work, good work indeed. You, of course, <i>will</i> be there for the signing?</p>

<p>CONSTANCE: <i>(Smirks:) Of course</i>. Now, if there's anything else--?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Distracted:)</i> Eh? Oh, no--no, not anything else. Get in touch with my secretary, and I'll see you then. Benny, see Constance out, will you?</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Follows Constance:)</i> Sure thing, Boss.</p>

<p>CONSTANCE: Until then--goodbye. <i>(Benny opens door, she leaves office, Benny shuts door behind her)</i></p>


     <p>William stared at the door for a moment more, then <i>scowled</i>.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Through clenched teeth, throws his arms in the air:) DAMN, DAMN, DAMN</i>! Hell, Benny--<i>I</i> couldn't get Tsunama, but <i>Constance</i> could? What does <i>she</i> have that <i>I</i> don't?</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Beats the <i>hell</i> out of me, Boss--but <i>so</i> what? Appleton will come out on <i>top</i>, and <i>you'll</i> get the <i>credit</i>.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Glares at Benny, who cowers:)</i> That's <i>not</i> the <i>point</i>, you <i>idiot</i>! When the Board <i>and</i> the stockholders hear of this, Constance will score some damn <i>brownie points</i> with them! Hell, she may even <i>challenge</i> my control someday! <i>(Slumps down at his desk, dejected)</i></p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(In a condescending tone:)</i> Boss, maybe you should take it <i>easy</i>--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(In a low tone:)</i> --Get <i>out</i>, and leave me <i>alone</i>, Benny.</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Narrows his eyes, strains to hear:)</i> Sorry, Boss, but <i>what'd</i> you say?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Now enraged, gets up out of his seat:) I SAID GET THE HELL OUT</i>!</p>

     <p>Benny <i>cringed</i> back, and immediately left out.</p>


     <p>William slouched back in his chair, and looked out at the city.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Thought v.o.: No one's going to take Appleton from me--NO one!)</i></p>
