<p>Chapter 9 - "F-Day"</p>




     <p>Darren woke up out of his bed in the early morning, stretching his arms. He suddenly <i>flinched</i>, quickly looking around for <i>Jake</i>. Darren then let out a deep breath, relieved that he wasn't there, for Jake had been sitting beside his bed watching him on and off since Darren first came to the Morgendorffers. Eventually, he'd have to say something to him about that, but he still didn't have the <i>heart</i> to do it just yet. Obviously, the man wanted to just <i>look</i> at the son he had thought he lost all those years ago, and was trying to somehow make up the time. Darren sighed and got out of bed, stretching his legs and arms, loosening himself up for his regular morning jog.</p>

     <p>As Darren started stretching with his dumbells, he thought about the upcoming meeting with his grandmothers and aunts, and how he'd react to them. Helen said they came to the <i>Stopover Motel</i> late last night, and had stayed in four rooms--his grandma Ruth in a room completely on the other side of the motel from the others, his grandma Evelyn and aunt Rita in another room, his cousin Erin and her husband, Brian, and finally, the illustrious <i>aunt Amy</i> in her own room. For some reason, Darren found himself looking forward to meeting her the <i>most</i>. If someone like the <i>cynical</i> Daria could admire this woman, then he'd want to find out for <i>himself</i> what she was like. Darren put on his jogging paraphernalia and went outside for a quicker-than-usual jog--there was <i>no</i> way he'd want to miss any of them coming over.</p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to a bedroom, Los Angeles, about the same time--you can imagine it's pretty early in the morning there)</i></p>



     <p>As the phone kept ringing, an arm came out from under the sheets. The hand on the end of it kept grasping to find and <i>silence</i> the noise the infernal device was making, finally making contact. It quickly seized it, and turned it on. The phone then was pulled to the ear of the tired-looking man that was <i>Gerald Woo</i>.</p>

<p>WOO: Mmmhello?</p>

<p>VOICE: Woo--it's <i>David</i>. Did I <i>wake</i> you?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Looks at the alarm clock:) No</i>, David, you <i>didn't</i> wake me--I <i>always</i> sit here in the early morning <i>waiting</i> for someone to call me--sleep isn't all <i>that</i> important. Why in the <i>hell</i> are you calling me <i>now</i>? The Snell case was <i>solved</i>! You did a <i>great</i> job! <i>(Narrows eyes:)</i> Are you <i>trying</i> to get me to <i>fire</i> you?</p>

<p>DAVID: Woo, this isn't about the Snell case--I couldn't sleep, because I was so <i>excited</i> about the <i>Appleton</i> case--possibly our most <i>lucrative</i> one--so I decided to come down to the office to look in our files and get a head start on investigating that jet crash, and--</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Rolls his eyes, cuts David off:)</i> --David, I've <i>already</i> talked to Darren Appleton about the investigation. The NTSB hasn't found anything out of the ordinary yet--</p>

<p>DAVID: --because the NTSB had investigated that the jet had maintenance at La Guardia International before going out towards Denver that night. They only made a <i>scant</i> check when the jet had been in Los Angeles only a day <i>before</i> going to La Guardia--</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Annoyed, lying on the bed, looks up at the ceiling:)</i> --yes, I <i>know</i> that--what is your <i>point</i>?</p>

<p>DAVID: My point is, I decided to look a little <i>more</i> into the jet's maintenance at Los Angeles International, and I found something <i>very</i> interesting--there was a list of people who had worked on that jet's fuel line. On that list was a <i>"Juan Lopez"</i>--only I found out that Mr. "Lopez" had <i>quit</i> his job the <i>same</i> day after the jet took off for New York City. I kind of thought that was <i>strange</i> because, get this--Mr. "Lopez" had just been on the job for only <i>three</i> days, and he had done <i>nothing</i> to get fired.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Considers, sits up in his bed:)</i> So, a guy who had helped worked on the Appleton jet's fuel line, considered to be the <i>main</i> cause of that crash, had come on for only <i>three</i> days, and had left afterwards, even though his boss said that this "Lopez" guy had done <i>nothing</i> to get fired? <i>(Pauses:)</i> Seems kind of suspicious I must admit, but it could still just be a <i>coincidence</i>, David--</p>

<p>DAVID: <i>(Sounding smug:)</i> --Even if I told you that "Lopez" really <i>isn't</i> this guy's name?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Now fully awake, stunned:) WHAT</i>?</p>

<p>DAVID: Yep. I looked at this guy's I.D. work badge picture, and on a hunch, checked it with the computer <i>criminal profile picture database</i> I <i>hacked</i> into at the L.A.P.D. Seems this "Lopez" is really a fellow named <i>Julio Sanchez</i>. He's got a rap sheet a <i>mile</i> long. Extortion, racketeering, aggravated assault, larceny, and <i>(sounding sarcastic:) no</i> maintenance experience on working on jet planes, but--</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Gets out of his bed, clad in white pajamas:)  --Possibly</i> a hired <i>killer</i>? <i>(Grins:) Excellent</i> work, David! I'm going to change and meet you down there. We'll see if we can <i>locate</i> Mr. Sanchez and ask him some questions as to <i>who</i> may have hired him to sabotage the Appleton's jet and cause it to crash.</p>

<p>DAVID: <i>(Sounding confused:)</i> Er, Woo--shouldn't we take this information to the <i>police</i>?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Curt:) No</i>. Despite your work, all we have here is <i>circumstantial evidence</i>--still not enough to go on. Besides, telling the police could <i>alert</i> whoever did this and put them on their <i>guard</i>. I'm thinking that the person or persons who did this had a motive to <i>eliminate</i> the Appletons--getting the conglomerate. These people could be some <i>seriously</i> powerful folks with a lot of <i>influence</i>--also, Sanchez <i>himself</i> could be put in <i>danger</i> if the person or persons found out what was going on. They'd want to <i>silence</i> him to <i>cover</i> their tracks, and we'll need Sanchez <i>alive</i> to point the finger.</p>

<p>DAVID: <i>(Sounding shocked:)</i> But then, <i>what</i> do we do? Just <i>sit</i> on the evidence, circumstantial, or not?</p>

<P>WOO: <I>(Gets some clothes out of his dresser, holds the phone to his head with his shoulder:)</I> No, of <I>course</I> not. Like I said, we'll locate Sanchez and then we'll get the answers we're looking for, you know, like how he did it, and who hired him. I think he'll tell us because when he sees the <I>"cicumstantial"</i> evidence, he sure as hell won't want to go down <i>alone</i>.</p> 

<p>DAVID: But he could be <i>out</i> of the <i>country</i>!</p> 

<p>WOO: Then <i>we'll</i> go out of the country to <i>get</i> him.</p>

<p>DAVID: <i>(Hesitates:)</i> Woo, do you think <i>Darren Appleton--</i></p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Cuts him off:)</i> --Don't even <i>go</i> there, David. Why <i>kill</i> your parents, and then <i>not</i> take over the business? I <i>know</i> what you're thinking--<i>"Maybe to throw off suspicion?"</i> Look, you know how I am when it comes to <i>knowing</i> my clients. I worked <i>with</i> that young man. He was in <i>pain. Real</i> pain. He couldn't kill his parents anymore than I could kill <i>you</i>. Besides, why hire <i>us</i> to investigate what happened, only to point the finger at <i>himself</i>? Nope, <i>not</i> Darren Appleton.</p>

<p>DAVID: <i>(Pauses, considers:) Millie Appleton</i>?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Rolls his eyes while setting up his ironing board:) Please</i>. Millie Appleton was <i>crazy</i> about her brother and sister-in-law. Yeah, she's in <i>Europe</i>, but she's planning on coming back, and she's been known to have <i>little</i> interest in the conglomerate's inner workings. <i>(Puts shirt on board, plugs up iron)</i> Nope, <i>not</i> Millie Appleton.</p>

<p>DAVID: Um, <i>William Appleton</i>?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Silent for a moment, frowns, perplexed:) Possibly</i>, but he was chosen by <i>Darren Appleton</i> to run the company. If he had a <i>motive</i>, then he would've known he was <i>next</i> in power to take over, and then he would've <i>promptly</i> had his brother and sister-in-law killed. <i>(Pauses, voice grows low:)</i> That doesn't mean he might've <i>not</i> had a hand in this--someone on the <i>Board of Directors</i> or a group of stockholders could've <i>joined</i> William Appleton, though it would seem <i>inconceivable</i> to me that he'd conspire to kill his own <i>brother</i> and <i>sister-in-law. (Voice then becomes serious:)</i> We'll have to check out this Sanchez's old <i>hangouts</i>. Get on it.</p>

<p>DAVID: Will do--<i>(pauses:)</i> er, Woo?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(While ironing:)</i> Yes?</p>

<p>DAVID: Would you mind bringing in some <i>breakfast</i> when you come in? I'm kind of hungry.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Sure--I <i>guess</i> you've earned it. See you then. <i>(Hangs up, thought v.o.: I'll call Darren later and tell him what was discovered--I think he told me when we last talked that he's got his extended family coming in today--best wait until he's had them over--) (Pauses, frowns, continued thought v.o.: --and maybe hold off telling Darren about my wondering on whether or not saying his <b>uncle</b> is a suspect--no telling what could happen if Darren or his uncle would do if they knew that.)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene goes back to the Morgendorffer home, an hour later)</i></p>



     <p>Darren and the Morgendorffers were preparing for the impending arrival of grandma Morgendorffer and the Barksdales/Danielsons. Quinn was primping herself in front of her mirror when Daria walked by Quinn's open door and noticed her.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:)</i> Fix yourself up <i>anymore</i>, and you'll be set for going <i>100,000 miles</i> before you need a <i>tune-up</i>.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Glares at Daria in the mirror:) Look</i>, Daria, just because <i>you</i> don't care about <i>your</i> appearance, don't go an' try to make fun of <i>mine</i>, okay? <i>(Goes back to looking in her mirror:)</i> I want my grandmas an' aunts to see me at my <i>best</i>--</p>

<P>DARIA: --At <I>manipulating</I> their <I>attention--(pauses, realizes something, smirks:)</I> hey, wait a minute--<I>Darren's</I> gonna get their attention. Is <I>that</I> why you're taking even <I>more</I> time in getting ready than <I>usual</I>, sis? You don't want them to <I>forget</I> you?</P>

<P>QUINN: <I>(Rolls her eyes:) Pleeease</I>, Daria! Like I said, I was just <I>trying</I> to look my best! <I>(Annoyed:)</I> Now if you don't <I>mind</I>, I've gotta finish my <I>makeover</I>! <I>(Walks over, shuts her door in Daria's face)</I></P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Smirks, thought v.o.: You need a "makeover" all right, sis--someone to <B>make over</B> you all the time.) (Goes to Darren's room, knocks:)</I> Big Bro, are you about ready to face that sweet, sweet <I>music</I>?</P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(Now showered and dressed in a brown short-sleeved Dockers shirt and those long Dockers shorts that go down to the shins, opens door, grins:) Tah-dah</I>! How do I look, sis?</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Deadpan:)</I> Like a lamb going to the <I>slaughter</I>, bro. <I>(Small smile)</I></P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(Sounding a "little" disappointed:)</I> Um, yeah. <I>(Takes a deep breath, closes eyes for a moment:)</I> Chin up, chin out, hop to it. <I>(Hesitates for a moment, then decides to extend an elbow to Daria:)</I> Shall we proceed, Daria?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Raised eyebrow, looks at his arm, shrugs:)</i> Ah, what the <i>hell. (Hooks her arm with his:)</i> Lead on, bro. <i>(Both start to go downstairs when Quinn comes out of her room)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Frowns slightly when she sees Daria's arm hooked with Darren's:) Hey</i>! What about <i>me</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: It's <i>always</i> about <i>Quinn</i>, isn't it? <i>(Darren chuckles slightly while Quinn gives a quick glare at Daria)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Extends his other elbow, smirks:)</i> There's always room for one more, sis.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Faux smug:)</i> That's <i>better. (Hooks her arm with Darren's, and they all go downstairs)</i></p>


     <p>Helen and Jake were already downstairs and had cleaned up after the family had breakfast. Helen was looking outside through the front window apprehensively, while Jake was finishing the morning edition of the paper, sitting on the middle couch. He looked up and saw his son and two daughters coming down the stairs, arm-in-arm. Jake <i>grinned</i> at the sight.</p>


<p>JAKE: <i>Awww</i>--isn't that <i>cute</i>? <i>(Looks over at Helen, who's still looking out of the window:)</i> Hey, Helen! You gotta see <i>this</i>! Where's the <i>camera</i>? <i>(Looks around)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Not bothering to respond to Jake, still looks through the window:)</i> Not <i>now</i>, Jake! I'm watching for our <i>families</i>!</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Whiny:)</i> But honey--our kids are <i>arm-in-arm</i>! Look! <i>(At this time, Daria, Quinn, and Darren look at each other, smirk, and unhook their arms, all the while looking innocently straight ahead. Jake is still looking at Helen, and doesn't notice what they have done) C'mon</i>, Helen!</p>

<p>HELEN: Oh, for the love of <i>God</i>, Jake--<i>(turns around, exasperated, sees her son and daughters looking straight ahead:)</i> what in the <i>hell</i> are you talking about, Jake? They aren't arm-in-arm! What's <i>wrong</i> with you? <i>(Looks back out the front window)</i></p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Doing a double-take at his son and daughters:) Huh</i>? But I could've <i>sworn--(shakes his head as if to clear it, then shrugs and looks back in his paper)</i></p>


     <p>Darren looked curiously at Helen.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Speaks to his sisters in a low voice:)</i> She's sure <i>anxious</i>, isn't she?</p>

<p>DARIA: I think mom wants to make a <i>good</i> impression on grandma Evelyn and aunt Rita because this is their <i>first</i> visit to our home. Aunt Amy, cousin Erin and her brother Brian, and grandma Ruth have been here before.</p>


<p><i>(Note to reader: As mentioned before--at least in some of the 'Daria' fanfics---Amy visited in "The Tie That Chokes", Erin and Brian in "None In The Family" [Part 2], both done by Kara Wild, and grandma Ruth's visit was on the episode "Jake Of Hearts")</i></p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(Goes up beside Helen, looks out window:) God</i>, what's taking them so <i>long</i> to get here?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Walks up to Helen and Quinn, smirks:)</i> Maybe aunt Amy's taking the <i>long</i> way around to get here--you know, to <i>draw out</i> grandma Evelyn and Ruth's <i>eagerness</i> to see their grandson? <i>I</i> would, if I were her--a <i>slow, arduous, tortuous process</i> to get here. <i>(Helen and Quinn glare at Daria, then look back out the window, while Daria sits down on the far couch, picking up and reading a magazine from the coffee table. The magazine has the "Sick, Sad World" eyeball logo on it.)</i></p>


     <p>Darren walked over to Jake and sat down beside him on the couch, and noticed that Jake had the business section of the <i>Lawndale-Sun Herald</i> clutched beneath the sports section in his hands while reading the paper.</p> 


<p>DARREN: <i>(Speaks low:)</i> Uh, Jake, may I see the business section, please?</p>

<p>JAKE: Huh? Oh, <i>sure</i>, Big Guy--<i>(hands him that section:)</i> here ya go! <i>(Takes on a proud look:)</i> Guess you wanna check out more on your <i>future</i> occupation, huh?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Takes paper:)</i> Thanks, yes--you might say that. <i>(Begins to read it, sees headline in the section, then frowns. He reads a little more of the article under the business headline, then slowly rises up with a troubled look on his face.)</i></p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Notices Darren out of the corner of his eye:)</i> Gosh, you sure finished reading that fast, son.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Distracted:)</i> Eh? Oh, yes--<i>fast. (Looks at the paper again as if to confirm what he read was true:)</i> Will you <i>excuse</i> me for a moment? I have to make a--</i>(Quinn gasps, and Darren and Jake look in her direction:)</i> eh?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Looks out the window with Helen, excited:)</i> They're <i>here</i>! <i>(Jake and Darren get up to see, but Daria keeps reading her magazine)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Perplexed frown:)</i> Hmmm--I see only <i>one</i> car, a yellow taxi. <i>(Becomes excited:)</i> Come on, everyone--let's see who it is! <i>(Leaves out the front door with Quinn and Jake--Darren waits for Daria)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Raises eyebrow, smirks:)</i> Coming, Daria?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Shrugs, sighs, flips magazine to the side:)</i> I guess--why the hell not? <i>(Smirks, gives Darren a sly look:)</i> Now remember, you can't <i>sue</i> me for the introductions.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Laughs:)</i> I'll remember. <i>(Goes out with Daria)</i></p>


     <p>Helen, Jake, and Quinn came out to the curb in front of the house, and saw <i>Ruth Morgendorffer</i> get out the taxi. She was about to pay the driver when Jake gently cut her off and did it himself. He then turned to his mother.</p>


<p>JAKE: <i>(Happy:)</i> Mommy! <i>(Hugs her)</i></p>

<p>RUTH: Hello, Jakey. How's your <i>heart</i>?</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Pats his chest proudly:)</i> It's <i>super-duper</i>, Mom! The doctor told me last month that I was in <i>great</i> shape, and I'm eating <i>lighter</i>, too!</p>

<p>RUTH: <i>(Gives a kind smile to him:)</i> I see. <i>(Looks at Helen with a droll look, gives a curt greeting:) Hello</i>, Helen--with the way you cooked the <i>last</i> time I was here, I'm surprised my son could still eat <i>anything</i> at all--</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Strains to remain civil, cuts her off:) --Hello</i>, Ruth--you're still your usual <i>chipper</i> self, I see. <i>(Sees cab pull off:)</i> I thought my mother and the others were supposed to be <i>with</i> you.</p>

<p>RUTH: <i>(Shrugs her shoulders, faux surprised:)</i> Oh, dear--you mean they haven't shown up yet? How <i>awful</i>! Maybe we got our <i>signals</i> mixed up. <i>(Looks at Quinn:)</i> And how is my <i>beautiful</i> Quinn? <i>(Hugs her)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Giggles and eats it up:)</i> Hi, Grandma Ruth! I'm fine!</p>

<p>RUTH: That's wonderful, Quinn--<i>(chuckles:)</i> and I assume the boys keep coming at you in <i>waves</i>, dear?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Looks away, becomes uneasy:)</i> Um, well--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Comes up with Darren, smirks:)</i> --More like the waves are becoming an <i>undertow</i>, Grandma Ruth, thanks to my <i>bro</i> here. <i>(Quinn frowns at Daria, while Darren looks uncomfortable)</i></p> 

<p>RUTH: <i>(Curious:)</i> Why, what do you mean, Dar--<i>(sees Darren:)</i> oh, my <i>Lord. (Walks slowly up to Darren, mouth agape, and puts her trembling hand on his chest, and then face:)</i> Y-you're m-my <i>grandson</i>, dear?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks down at his grandmother, slightly red-faced:)</i> Er, yes ma'am, I am--<i>(pauses:) Grandma Ruth. (Suddenly gasps as Ruth hugs him tightly)</i></p>

<p>RUTH: <i>(Estatic, grins, looks up into Darren's eyes, about to cry:)</i> My <i>grandson</i>--and quite a <i>handsome</i> grandson, too! <i>(Looks over at Jake:)</i> He looks <i>completely</i> like <i>you</i>, Jakey--but he has <i>my</i> eyes! <i>(Jake's chest is puffed out from being so proud, while Helen scowls at Ruth, then at Jake, who catches it, and quickly deflates)</i> Come into the house, Darren, and we can talk, young man. <i>(Hooks her arm with Darren's, and both go into the house, followed by Jake, Quinn, and a still-scowling Helen. Daria brings up the rear.)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Talks to herself, deadpan:) "Hello, Daria. How are you?" "Oh, I'm fine, Grandma Ruth. I'm still planning on getting some more tattoos."</i> Story of my life. <i>(Goes into house, shuts the door)</i></p>


     <p>Just as everyone came into the house, the cell phone rang, and Helen grabbed it. In the meantime, Ruth and Darren sat down on the middle couch, Jake sat on the left couch, while Quinn and Daria sat on the right couch.</p>


<p>HELEN: <i>(In that falsetto voice:) Hellooo</i>? <i>(Pause:) Mother</i>? <i>(Daria and Quinn look at Helen, while Ruth keeps talking to Darren and Jake)</i> Where <i>are</i> you all? <i>(Pause:)</i> The <i>motel</i>? Why--<i>(pause:)</i> yes, she's here. <i>(Slowly looks over to Ruth, narrows her eyes:)</i> I <i>see. (Pause:)</i> Well, we'll be expecting you in about thirty minutes, Mother. Goodbye. <i>(Clicks off phone, walks over to and sits down beside Jake, and is now frowning at Ruth, who has stopped talking to Darren for the moment because she now sees how Helen is looking at her. Daria, who smirks at this because she suspects what's going on, inquires)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Faux concern:)</i> Mom, <i>who</i> was that on the phone? Was it your <i>job</i>? Don't tell me <i>Eric</i> needs you to come in from your hard-earned vacation? <i>(Darren raises an eyebrow at this, looks curiously at Daria, who smirks at Darren.)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Glares at Daria for a moment, then cooly looks at Ruth, and speaks in a deliberate and cold tone:)</i> That was your grandma <i>Evelyn</i>, Daria. It seems that she was under the <i>impression</i> your Grandma Ruth was at the motel in her own room waiting for my mother and the others to come and pick her up. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Your grandma Evelyn also said that the hotel manager told her that your Grandma Ruth checked out already, and to meet her over here--the only problem was that your Granma Ruth <i>didn't</i> tell them what she was going to do.</p>

<p>RUTH: <i>(Waves off Helen:)</i> Oh, <i>bother. (Pauses:)</i> Well, I <i>told</i> you that we must've had our signals mixed up, Helen. It's not <i>my</i> fault your mother can't seem to <i>grasp</i> what I said to her. We'll just have to wait for them to come in, and in the <i>meantime</i>, I can get to know my grandson. <i>(Helen looks about ready to explode, while Ruth simply looks and smiles at Darren:)</i> Tell me about Eastward College, Darren. <i>(Daria and Quinn look at each other uneasily, and even Jake looks disappointed at what his mother has done)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks at Ruth uneasily, then at everyone else:)</i> Er--perhaps we should wait until my <i>other</i> grandmother and my aunts and cousin get here. I mean, why should I tell you about myself, Grandma Ruth, and then tell it to them <i>again</i>? <i>(Ruth scowls a bit at Darren, who quickly adds:)</i> Uh, it's just that I want to see both of my two <i>beautiful</i> grandmothers, who I can <i>appreciate</i> being here to meet with me. <i>(Gently takes a surprised Ruth's hand, looks at her in the eye, and smiles:) Please</i> do this <i>for</i> me.


     <p>Ruth seemed mesmerized for a moment, and then <i>smiled</i> at Darren.</p>


<p>RUTH: <i>(Blushes somewhat:)</i> Oh, I--well, that is, um--very well, Darren. <i>(Adds, pats her hair, flattered:)</i> Do you <i>really</i> think I'm <i>beautiful</i>?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Of <i>course</i> I do! <i>(Motions in Jake's direction, grins:)</i> Where do you think my birth father got <i>his</i> good looks? <i>(Jake gets puffed up in pride again)</i></p> 

<p>RUTH: <i>(Gets up while grinning herself, and Darren does as well with everyone else:)</i> Oh, my--what a <i>wonderful</i> grandson you are, Darren! <i>(Pinches Darren's cheek:)</i> I'm going to go and freshen up, everyone, and wait for the others! <i>(Actually giggles and leaves for the bathroom)</i></p>


     <p>Everyone simply <i>stared</i> at Darren, who was rubbing his cheek.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Impressed:) Damn</i>, you're good, bro.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Equally so, awed by her brother:)</i> Boy, <i>I'll</i> say!</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Delighted, looks about to cry:)</i> Oh, my son! <i>(Hugs a startled Darren)</i></p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Sticks out his hand:)</i> Put 'er there, Big Guy! <i>(Shakes Darren's hand, getting it in a vice-like grip)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Rubs his hand that Jake nearly crushed, a little baffled by everyone's praise:)</i> All I did was ask her to wait for my other grandmother.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Looks at her son with pride:)</i> It's just that you <i>diffused</i> a difficult situation, Darren.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:) I'll</i> say--from the way <i>mom</i> was looking, you'd think a <i>nuclear bomb</i> was about to go off. <i>(Helen narrows her eyes at Daria)</i></p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Suddenly slaps his hands together:)</i> Well, we might as well have something to drink while we're a-waitin' for the rest of our relatives! Who's for some lemonade? <i>(Leaves for the kitchen)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Follows Jake with Helen:)</i> I'll want some, Daddy--but make sure you put some of that <i>sweetner</i> stuff in mine--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:)</i> --How <i>fitting</i>--phony <i>sweetner</i> for a phony <i>person</i> who <i>pretends</i> she's sweet. <i>(Darren chuckles to himself, while Quinn sticks her tounge out at Daria)</i></p>


     <p>Daria and Darren sat back down, this time on the middle couch.</p> 


<p>DARIA: You ever thought of selling that <i>B.S.</i> you've gave to grandma Ruth, bro? You could make a hell of a lot of <i>money</i>.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow, chuckles to himself, thought v.o.: If you knew how much I had, sis, you wouldn't ask that question:) "B.S."</i>, Daria? I would like to think I was telling the <i>truth. (Sighs:)</i> Sure, I wanted to calm everyone down, but that doesn't mean that I as a grandson can't tell my grandmother that she looks nice. <i>(Grows quiet:)</i> You see, Daria, the grandparents I had <i>thought</i> that were mine in blood have <i>passed</i> away--on <i>both</i> sides of my (adopted) parent's families. <i>(Daria looks at him quietly)</i> Call it <i>corny</i>, but seeing the mothers of my <i>birth</i> parents kind of gives me <i>another</i> chance on seeing <i>more</i> grandparents. <i>(Smirks:)</i> I mean, how many people you know can say they saw <i>more</i> than <i>four</i> grandparents in a <i>lifetime</i>? Not many.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Reflects on what Darren has said, feels a little guilty over her remark:)</i> Um, look--I'm <i>sorry</i> for saying that, Darren--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Shows a melancholic smile:) --Forget</i> it, sis. <i>(Ponders for a moment:)</i> Look, I have to make a <i>quick</i> call up in my room. Could you tell everyone that I'll be back in a few minutes? I'll make sure to be done before our other relatives get here, okay? <i>(Gets up and goes upstairs)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Watches him go up:)</i> Sure, bro. <i>(Thought v.o. while frowning to herself: Nice going, Daria--make light of your brother's pain. Maybe you can twist the knife the other damn way) (Sighs, gets up and goes into the kitchen)</i></p>


     <p>Darren went into his room, and quickly picked up his cell phone. He pushed a few buttons, and waited for a response. He frowned when the operator told him the number he called was no longer in service. He began to push a few more numbers, and finally got an answer.</p>


<p>DARREN: Hello, is this William Appleton's secretary, <i>Lilly</i>?</p>

<p>LILLY: <i>(Sounding nonchalant while typing:)</i> Yes, it is. Who is speaking?</p>

<p>DARREN: This is Darren Appleton. Is Mr. Appleton in conference?</p>

<p>LILLY: <i>(Becomes more alert after hearing who it is:)</i> No sir, Mr. Appleton--he told me that he was going to be <i>late</i> coming in today, and if he was needed, to call him at his <i>apartment</i>. He said he had some <i>personal</i> business to see to.</p>

<p>DARREN: I see. Well, thank you for your help, Lilly. <i>(Clicks off phone, punches some more buttons)</i></p>


<p><i>(Scene changes to William Appleton's Park Avenue apartment, a minute <b>earlier</b>)</i></p>


     <p>William Appleton paced back and forth on his living room floor, looking worried. Benny, standing in the middle of the floor, watched him wordlessly.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: Benny, we've got to figure out what to do about my <i>so-called</i> "nephew". He's no doubt told his <i>"family"</i> who he is, and I'd wager he'll be coming back here soon to <i>meddle</i> in <i>my</i> company affairs--I'm <i>sure</i> of it.</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Grins wickedly:)</i> Arrange some sort of <i>"accident"</i>, Boss?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Distracted:)</i> Hm? Well, I don't know yet, Benny. <i>(Ponders:)</i> I must admit, however, that I'm somewhat baffled as to <i>why</i> we haven't heard anything from the <i>media</i> on this--you know, a large <i>press conference</i> with him on the front of the television screen telling everyone that he was adopted, and how he wants to introduce to the world his <i>"real"</i> family. <i>(Glares into space:)</i> I tell you, Benny, it <i>sickens</i> me to see my damn <i>"nephew"</i> do this crap to <i>embarass</i> me, especially after I'm planning to put my <i>own</i> man to head the legal services of the conglomerate, and then to be free to look for a <i>legal</i> way to wrestle the conglomerate from Darren <i>permanently</i>--unless I decide to have him <i>killed</i> first.</p>

<p>BENNY: Maybe he asked them to keep <i>quiet</i> about it, Boss--Darren can be awfully <i>persuasive</i> when he has to be. <i>(Sneers:)</i> Maybe he promised to <i>pay</i> them some money not to say anything--?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Snorts:)</i> Yeah--<i>right</i>, Benny. My <i>"goody-goody two-shoes"</i> of a <i>"nephew"</i>? Get <i>real</i>. Even though he's <i>lying</i> to his birth family, I'm <i>convinced</i> that his <i>(speaks the word as if is some sort of curse, spits out:)
"conscience"</i> will win out in the end. Looks like I'll have to make a <i>decision--(pauses, looks at Benny with a faux sadness:)</i> poor <i>Millie</i>--I'll have to <i>console</i> her over Darren's impending <i>death</i>, but she's strong, and I'll be there for her. <i>(Benny smirks, delighted)</i> Go ahead and call--</p>


     <p>William's cell phone rang just at that moment, and he <i>snatched</i> it up, clicking it on.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Sounding annoyed:)</i> This had <i>better</i> be an <i>emergency</i>, Lilly.</p>

<p>VOICE: <i>(Sounding equally annoyed:)</i> This isn't Lilly, Uncle Will--and in a way, it <i>is</i> an emergency.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Suddenly sounding "happy":)</i> W-why <i>Darren</i>! <i>(Motions to Benny, who turns on the cell phone's base intercom speaker to listen in)</i> What a <i>pleasant</i> surprise! To what do I owe the <i>pleasure</i> of your call?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>Save</i> it, Uncle Will. I read in the business section of the local paper here that you <i>transferred</i> Leonard Potter out to the West coast branch of the legal services division. Is that <i>true</i>?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Thinks for a moment:)</i> Well, yes, but he <i>chose</i> to go, Darren, and we needed someone of his experience out there to handle our legal matters. He's getting more money, and more responsiblity. <i>(Adds quickly:)</i> I just chose him because of that like <i>you</i> chose me to head the conglomerate--you know, because of his <i>experience</i>? <i>(Stresses this word as if to drive the point home to Darren, then adds faux concern:)</i> Is there something <i>wrong</i>, dear boy?</p>


     <p>There was silence on the other end of the phone, then Darren spoke.</p>


<p>DARREN: Well, I guess <i>not</i>--but I <i>assume</i> you have a replacement?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Smug look on his face:)</i> Of course--<i>Sam Norwood.</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Sounding alarmed:) Sam Norwood</i>?! Didn't I hear dad say once that he made a living off of defending <i>Mafia</i> figures, and that Norwood would <i>never</i> work for Appleton Industries?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Looks cooly at the back of his hand:)</i> Darren, Sam Norwood hasn't represented any of those people for <i>years</i>, and has worked at a <i>prestigious</i> law firm in lower Manhattan for quite awhile now. He is considered to be a <i>very</i> agressive lawyer who will watch out for Appleton's interests like Leonard did. <i>(Pauses:)</i> If you wish, I can give you a number to call and check yourself--<i>(adds, with a little hint of accusation:)</i> since you don't seem to <i>trust</i> me.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Hesitates:)</i> I never <i>said</i> that I don't trust you, Uncle Will, I mean you've done <i>so</i> much for me and all--it's just, well
--<i>(voice fades off)</i></p>

<p>WILLIAM: --It's quite all right, Darren, I only know you have the company's best <i>interests</i> at heart--like <i>I</i> do. <i>(Changes tone, looks at Benny, narrows eyes:)</i> So, I guess you've <i>told</i> your birth family who you <i>really</i> are by now?</p>

<p>DARREN: Um, <i>not</i> yet, Uncle Will. <i>(William smirks, while Benny mouths "Damn")</i> I've decided to wait a bit <i>longer</i> for--<i>personal</i> reasons. Let's just say the time I wanted to tell them wasn't a good one at the moment, but I'll eventually get to doing it. <i>(Lightens tone:)</i> So, have you heard from aunt <i>Millie</i>?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: Yes, I have, Darren--she's doing quite fine. Millie called me yesterday and said she's on a <i>cruise</i> in the Mediterranean this week, and next week, she'll be in <i>Spain</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Sounding pleased:) Excellent</i>, Uncle Will--I'm glad she's having a good time--God only knows she <i>deserves</i> it. Would you tell her that I'm fine, and not to worry about me?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: Of course I will, Darren--<i>(frowns:)</i> anything <i>else</i>?</p> 
                                                                                                                            
<p>DARREN: <i>(Voice becomes low, pauses:)</i> Look, Uncle Will, I'm--<i>sorry</i> for calling you and questioning your decisions, and giving you the <i>impression</i> that I'm looking over your shoulder. <i>(William and Benny look shocked, and Darren is heard chuckling)</i> I know you're probably <i>shocked</i> to hear that. Tell you what--I <i>promise</i> I won't call again unless it's an <i>absolute</i> emergency. I've got to go, take it easy, Uncle--see you later.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Still shocked, weakly gets out his words:)</i> Er, ah, sure, Darren--have a good time with your birth family. <i>(Slowly turns off the phone)</i> Well, I'll be <i>damned</i>.</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Sounding surly:) Crap</i>. What do we do <i>now</i>, Boss?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: For the time being, <i>nothing</i>, Benny. Let my <i>"nephew"</i> have his fun for now--maybe he'll <i>finally</i> understand that I'm the <i>"Man"</i> when it comes to this company. <i>(Smirks:)</i> Let's get back to work and welcome Norwood, Benny.</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Sounding depressed:)</i> Sure, Boss.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: Now, now, Benny--I know you're <i>disappointed</i> you can't get to Darren, but remember, I said <i>"For the time being"</i>. I could very well <i>"address"</i> the matter of Darren in the near future, <i>especially</i> if I hear from him and he <i>meddles</i> in my affairs again, so <i>cheer</i> up! <i>(Slaps Benny on the back, and Benny stumbles forward, which amuses William. Both men leave the apartment)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene is in a small, covered red convertible sportscar driving on a street on the way to the Morgendorffers, about ten minutes later. The car is followed by a taxi.)</i></p>



     <p><i>Amy Barksdale</i> drove her car listening to her mother sitting in the passenger seat ranting about getting <i>back</i> at Ruth Morgendorffer for her deception. Her mother was going at it so much, that Amy secretly wished she could be in the taxi that was following <i>behind</i> them that contained her sister Rita, niece Erin, and Erin's husband Brian--she suddenly shuddered at <i>that</i> thought, frowning slightly to herself. Why in the world would she want to <i>willingly</i> be with <i>any</i> member of her immediate family? God, she must be getting <i>desperate</i> to wish something like that. Too bad <i>Joel</i> wasn't here to act as a <i>firewall</i> of a sort. She smirked at the little plan Ruth had formulated at getting to see her grandson first--too bad Amy <i>herself</i> didn't come to think of it, but at least she could see her nieces <i>and</i> nephew to cushion the blow.</p> 

     <p>A <i>nephew</i>. How was he <i>like</i>? How did he <i>look</i>--like Helen, or Jake? Maybe <i>both</i>? The way Helen had went on about this <i>"Darren"</i> fellow, one would think he could <i>fly</i> or something. She had thought about calling <i>Daria</i> to ask her some questions about Darren, but Amy didn't want to risk <i>stirring</i> back up any feelings of <i>jealousy</i> from Helen when Amy had last visited there. Amy decided to just see for herself her "newest" nephew. Amy wearily glanced at her mother, who was finishing her ranting.</p>


<p><i>(Note to reader: The "jealousy" thing and Amy's beau Joel are from Kara Wild's "The Tie That Chokes", and a little bit of that spilled over into "That Thing You Say", from Kara as well)</i></p>


<p>EVELYN: <i>(Angry:)</i> --And Ruth will be getting an <i>earful</i>, I can tell you that, Amy. <i>(Looks at Amy, concerned:)</i> You seem to be awfully <i>quiet</i>, dear.</p>

<p>AMY: <i>(Comes out her deep thoughts:)</i> What? Oh, I was just thinking about my <i>nephew. (Pauses, considers something for a moment, talks to her mother in a gingerly way:)</i> Mom, I know you're <i>obviously</i> upset over what Mrs. Morgendorffer did, and I don't <i>blame</i> you, but don't you think you should, well, <i>hold off</i> giving her a piece of your mind? <i>(Sees her mother looking at her with a mild look of disbelief:)</i> I mean, do it for your <i>grandson</i>. After all, we should try to give to him the best <i>impression</i> of our family. <i>(Thought v.o.: Oh no, we certainly can't let him know what he's going to get himself into when he sees the <b>lunatics</b> that populate our family. [Smirks:] Not that <b>Daria</b> hasn't probably already <b>warned</b> him of what to expect.)</i></p>

<p>EVELYN: <i>(Ponders her daughter's words:)</i> Well--I'll <i>try</i> for my grandson's sake, Amy, but if Ruth says <i>something</i> to me about the so-called <i>"mix-up"</i>, I can't promise I won't say anything <i>nasty</i> to her.</p>

<p>AMY: <i>(Looks forward, smirks:)</i> Fair enough, Mom. <i>(Cuts her eyes outside the car, looks up at the sky through her windshield:)</i> It looks like it's a nice day. <i>(Cocks an eyebrow at her mother:)</i> Why didn't you want to ride in my car with the top <i>down</i>?</p>

<p>EVELYN: <i>(Gives a surprised look at her daughter, chuckles:)</i> And ruin my <i>hairdo</i>, Amy? I want to look my <i>best</i> for my grandson. Besides, I didn't want to ride with Rita, Erin and Brian--I see <i>enough</i> of them at home--and I wanted to spend at least a little time talking to <i>you. (Amy glances at her mom, shocked)</i></p>

<p>AMY: <i>(Makes sure to keep her eyes on the road:)</i> You're--<i>serious</i>?</p>

<p>EVELYN: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Of <i>course</i> I'm serious, dear. After all, I've <i>never</i> rode in your car before--and being here keeps me from listening to Rita's <i>constant</i> bickering with Erin over Brian having trouble keeping a <i>job</i>.</p>

<p>AMY: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Yeah, especially since she herself can't <i>keep</i> one.</p>

<p>EVELYN: <i>(Glares:) Amy</i>! Your sister is trying to--<i>(sighs:)</i> look, why don't you take some of your <i>own</i> advice, dear--try not to <i>upset</i> your nephew by giving out your--<i>"special"</i> remarks, all right?</p>

<p>AMY: <i>(Gives a mock salute:) All righty-rinny-roo</i>, Mom.</p> 


     <p>In the taxi that was following them, the driver already was getting a <i>headache</i> from listening to <i>Rita Barksdale</i>, who was sitting up front with him, and her daughter, and son-in-law, who were arguing in the rear. He <i>rolled</i> his eyes, and strained to look forward, <i>screaming</i> to himself privately for this ride to end <i>mercifully</i>.</p>


<p>RITA: <i>(Frowns:)</i> --And I can just see Helen <i>bragging</i> about her son to me. Well, she'd better not try to <i>laugh</i> in my face, or I'll--</p>

<p>ERIN: <i>(Exasperated:)</i> --Mother, <i>please</i>! Can't we get along for my <i>cousin's</i> sake? <i>(Smirks:)</i> Quinn called me yesterday and told me her brother was <i>gorgeous</i>! I can't <i>wait</i> to see him!</p>

<p>BRIAN: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow at this:)</i> Hey, should I be <i>jealous</i> over this guy?</p>

<p>ERIN: <i>(Looks at Brian as if he has lost his mind:)</i> You <i>idiot</i>! He's my <i>cousin</i>! Why in the world should you care <i>how</i> he looks? It's not as if I'm going to <i>fall</i> for him or something!</p>

<p>BRIAN: <i>(Looking surly:)</i> Yeah, well--it's just that you've been making such a big deal out of meeting this <i>"Darren"</i> guy, and I feel kind of--<i>neglected</i>.</p>

<p>ERIN: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> Oh, <i>Brian--(hooks her arm with his:)</i> no one can <i>replace</i> you, dear. <i>(Brian looks smugly ahead while Rita shakes her head slowly)</i></p>


     <p>The two vehicles pulled in front of the Morgendorffer's home, and Helen led her family out from the house. Ruth, smirking, had her arm hooked with Darren's as they both came out of the house. Daria gave a small smile when she saw her aunt Amy (and vice-versa), and Quinn suantered up to the taxi to meet Erin and her husband Brian, who had gotten the cab fare from Rita, and was paying the <i>"All-too-ready-to-get-rid-of-these-people"</i> driver. As Amy's car pulled into the Morgendorffer's driveway, Evelyn cast a quick <i>glare</i> at Ruth, but then saw her grandson just as quickly, and her visage grew softer. She got out as soon as Amy had come to a complete stop, and went straight for Darren, only giving a quick <i>wave</i> to a startled Helen as Evelyn walked right <i>past</i> her. Evelyn put her trembling hand on Darren's face and chest, <i>(much to the chagrin of a jealous-looking Ruth)</i> and like Ruth, was overcome with emotion.</p>


<p>EVELYN: <i>(Looks up into her grandson's eyes, about to cry:)</i> S-so you're my grandson, Darren.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(With a still-jealous looking Ruth watching both of them:)</i> Yes ma'am--and you must be my Grandma Evelyn. <i>(Hugs her:)</i> It's a pleasure to meet you.</p>

<p>EVELYN: <i>(Gently caresses her grandson's face, and looks at Helen, who is coming up to them with Jake in tow:)</i> He looks <i>completely</i> like <i>you</i>, Helen--but he has <i>my</i> eyes! <i>(This time, it's <b>Helen's</b> turn to look proud, while Jake looks heartbroken, and Ruth merely glares at Evelyn)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Who catches this, and remembers the same thing was said by Ruth to his birth father, looks for peace:)</i> Actually, I think I look like <i>both</i> of my birth parents--and I have <i>both</i> of your eyes. Wouldn't you <i>all</i> agree? <i>(Jake and Helen look at each other, and smile, while Ruth and Evelyn look at each other, and grudgingly put aside their differences for their grandson's sake, and force a smile towards each other)</i></p>

<p>HELEN & JAKE & EVELYN & RUTH: <i>(All at the same time:)</i> Oh yes, son! Sure, Big Guy! Of course you do, Darren! You're certainly right about that!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks, thought v.o.: And even though "Having both eyes" would mean you would have one <b>blue</b> eye from mom, and one <b>brown</b> eye from dad, you still win them over, Big Bro--way to go.)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Nods his approval:)</i> All right, then, that's settled. <i>(Sees the others coming up to him:)</i> And who have we <i>here</i>? <i>(Looks down at Rita:)</i> My <i>first</i> pretty aunt?</p>

<p>RITA: <i>(Looks up at her nephew, mouth hung open:)</i> Um, I'm--uh, your aunt <i>Rita. (Helen smirks at Rita's behaviour)</i> H-hello, Darren. <i>(Hugs her nephew)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Hello, Aunt Rita. <i>(Rita blushes, and looks at everyone with a bit of a foolish look on her face, steps back)</i> Ah, okay. <i>(Looks at an awestruck Erin, smiling:)</i> And <i>you're</i>--</p>

<p>BRIAN: <i>(Suddenly steps in front of a surprised Erin, tries to give the impression that he's "protecting his woman":) --I'm</i> Brian, and this is Erin, <i>my</i> wife, and your <i>cousin. (Emphasizes the word "cousin" to a partially confused Darren, as if to drive the point home that's <b>all</b> Erin is to Darren--his cousin)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks, stands to the side and watches all of this with Amy and Quinn, leans over to Quinn, speaks in a low voice:)</i> Those <i>"insects"</i> seem to be <i>escaping</i> you and are now entering Brian's <i>brain. (Quinn rolls her eyes at Daria, while Amy cocks an amused eyebrow at both of her nieces)</i></p>

<p>ERIN: <i>(Steps in front of her husband, gives him a quick glare, looks up into Darren's eyes:)</i> We're <i>both</i> pleased to meet you, "cousin" Darren. <i>(Smirks:)</i> Welcome to our family. <i>(Suddenly hugs a stunned Darren, while Brian looks at this scene, boiling mad. Helen, Evelyn, Quinn, Daria, Amy, Rita, and even Ruth smirk at this, while Jake simply looks at the whole thing with a goofy, loving, "Aww, isn't that cute" look in his eyes. Erin stares up at her cousin for a moment, clearly liking the hug, surprising herself, then hesitantly backs off)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Gathers his bearings back, looks at Amy, smirks:)</i> Uh, and I guess you're my <i>Aunt Amy</i>, the <i>second</i> pretty aunt here--?</p>

<p>AMY: <i>(Walks up to Darren and hugs him, smiles:)</i> Yes, Darren, and flattery will get you <i>everywhere</i> with me. <i>(Thought v.o.: Oh, boy, <b>this</b> is my nephew? Damn, he's a <b>hunk</b>!) (Tenatively releases him, steps back and looks him over, smirks:)</i> And it's just <i>Amy</i>, okay? <i>(Darren nods, curses at himself imwardly because he forgot what Daria told him over the "aunt" thing)</i> You ever thought of putting on a <i>pied-piper suit</i> and walking onto the campus of an <i>all-woman's college</i>? I'd bet you'd have them all eating out of your hand. Why, you could probably get them to <i>strip willingly</i> for you--</p>

<p>HELEN & EVELYN: <i>--AMY! (Ruth smirks at this, the same for Daria, and Quinn and Erin--they all suspect that Amy is at least <b>partially</b> right on her barb, while Darren blushes)</i></p>


     <p>After the rest of the customary greetings among the families, everyone went into the house, and the caterer came in soon after. The food was served, and then Darren was called on again to tell the story of the adoption. Evelyn and Ruth sat and watched their grandson, going through the same emotions that Helen and Jake had gone through went they first heard the story--sadness, horror, and anger. Rita was stunned, Erin was crying, and even Brian, who after he had heard the story, had a <i>apologetic</i> look on his face--he realized he had been <i>very</i> hard on Darren, feeling guilty as well as foolish, and decided to be <i>civil</i> to him from now on.</p>

     <p>Amy was <i>seriously</i> PO'd. She also went through the same emotions as everyone else, but something <i>awoke</i> in her--a feeling of pure <i>rage</i> towards the now-deceased Turley, something she had <i>never</i> felt so strongly about before, even against her family in the past. Throughout the story, she had sat on the middle couch with Daria and Quinn, and had exchanged sad glances with both of them. Amy looked over at Darren, who was sitting with Evelyn and Ruth on the opposite couch, feeling completely <i>sorry</i> for him--although she suspected that he didn't <i>want</i> her pity--at least not in that way. Her nephew had gone through <i>hell</i>--and she was determined to help him in any way she could--if he <i>allowed</i> her to. She snapped out of her thinking just as Darren was finishing his story.</p>

     <p>Darren, who had gotten up and stood in the middle of the living room during his story, looked around quietly, trying to gauge his relative's reactions. He didn't have to wait long, for Evelyn and Ruth got up and <i>hugged</i> him on either side, crying. Rita and Erin did the same, Brian looked away quietly for a second, then walked to him and shook his hand, promptly apologizing to Darren for the behavior Brian had treated Darren with, much to the silent pleasure of a pleased Erin. Amy simply walked up to Darren and looked up at him in the eye, holding the sides of his arms, and spoke.</p>

<p>AMY: <i>(Looking and sounding serious:)</i> Darren, I think I can safely speak for everyone here when I say that even though we were <i>denied</i> a chance to get to know you after all these years, that you are a <i>welcome</i> addition to our family, and that we'll do everything we possibly can to make you feel that you belong here, as if you <i>always</i> had been--we're <i>proud</i> of you. <i>(Smiles, hugs him warmly--Daria, after giving a quick look around, gives a tiny Mona Lisa smile, Quinn looks as if she's going to cry again, the same for Helen, and even Jake)</i></p>

     <p>Darren looked down at his aunt, still holding her, and smiled back in kind--with a <i>ton</i> of <i>guilt</i> inside of him. <i>Damn</i>--why don't I just <i>tell</i> them? They'd understand why I couldn't, wouldn't they? He slowly shut his eyes, as if he were in pain, and was about to tell them the <i>truth</i>, when the doorbell <i>rang</i>. Darren quietly cursed it for the intrusion, and himself for not having the <i>courage</i> for saying something. Helen went to answer it while Darren looked back down at his aunt.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks at his aunt lovingly:)</i> Thank you, Au--er, <i>Amy</i>. That really means a <i>lot</i> to me.</p>

<p>AMY: <i>(With the same look:)</i> And I meant <i>every</i> bit of it, Darren--<i>(smirks:)</i> I guess this means that I'll have to <i>scrape</i> up some more <i>money</i> for <i>birthdays--</i></p>

<p>EVELYN: <i>(Mildly annoyed, but chuckling:) Amy! (Slowly smiles:)</i> I, for one, look forward to <i>spoiling</i> another one of my granchildren during the holidays!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks, thought v.o.: You mean Darren can get some socks, bloomers, and other cheap crap too, Grandma?)</i></p>

<p>RUTH: <i>(Cuts in, looks smug, waves her off:) Please</i>, Evelyn--let's not give our grandson the <i>illusion</i> that you'll spoil him like <i>that--</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks, thought v.o.: Oh no, not when you can give him <b>used</b> books, Grandma Ruth--)</i></p>

<p>RUTH: --when <i>I</i> can actually make <i>your</i> spoiling him look, well--rather <i>mundane--(Evelyn frowns, walks up to Ruth, now in her face)</i></p>

<p>EVELYN: Are you saying that I can't <i>out-spoil</i> you when it comes to my grandchildren, you <i>cow</i>?</p>

<p>RUTH: <i>(Now in Evelyn's face, frowning:)</i> What do <i>you</i> think, you <i>sow</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Thought v.o.: <b>How now sow cow</b>? Nah--it'll never catch on.)</i></p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Frantically looking at both:)</i> Grandma Ruth, Grandma Evelyn, <i>please--</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Looks horrified, first at Jake, who's too scared to do anything, then Brian, who does the same, then at Erin and Rita, who step back and watch from the side, looking at each other uneasily, and then at Daria and Amy, who are both smirking:) Do</i> something, Daria, Aunt Amy, this is <i>horrible</i>!</p> 

<p>DARIA: I'll say--we didn't get the caterer to bring any <i>popcorn. (Amy tries not to laugh)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Frowns, shouts:) Damn</i> it, Daria--this isn't funny!</p>


     <p>Both grandmothers heard Quinn, and stopped their bickering long enough to look at her, frowning.</p>


<p>EVELYN & RUTH: <i>(At the same time:) Language</i>, Quinn! <i>(Quinn looks at both of them sheepishly, red-faced)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: Sorry, Grandma Ruth, Grandma Evelyn.</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Looks at Quinn as well, frowns:) Yeah</i>, language, Quinn! <i>(Everyone looks at Jake for a moment, as if to say, "Boy, are you behind the times.")</i></p>


     <p>Ruth and Evelyn turned back to each other, and were about to say something else, when Darren spoke, suddenly putting his arms around both of his grandmothers.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks back and forth between his grandmothers, smiles:)</i> Can't we all try to get along, <i>please</i>? I was told that you both <i>promised</i> you would for <i>my</i> sake. <i>(Both Ruth and Evelyn look at him for a moment, give quick glares at one another, then look back at Darren with a softer glance)</i></p>

<p>RUTH: <i>(Sighs:)</i> For <i>your</i> sake, I will, Darren.</p>

<p>EVELYN: <i>(Sighs as well:)</i> Very well, Darren--for <i>your</i> sake, I will, too.</p>

<p>AMY: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow, impressed, leans over to Daria, talks in a low voice:) Wow</i>. How does he do that?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Talks to Amy in the same voice, smirks:)</i> Remind me to tell you about that later, Amy--he's <i>damn</i> good at diffusing situations.</p>

<p>VOICE: <i>(From the entrance to the living room, sounding feminine, impressed:)</i> You're quite <i>good</i>.</p>


     <p>Everyone looked and saw a petite brunette standing beside Helen. The woman walked up to Darren to introduce herself.</p>


<p>WOMAN: <i>(Extends her hand, looks at Darren a bit flushed:)</i> Oh, um, hello, I'm <i>Meg Rosata</i>, Channel Four news. You're Darren Coverton, I assume--?</p>


<p><i>(Note to reader: Meg Rosata was first seen in "The Lost Girls")</i></p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks slightly alarmed, thought v.o.: Oh, great--the media.) (Shakes the woman's hand:)</i> Er, yes I am, Miss--Ms.--</p>

<p>ROSATA: <i>(Smirks:) Ms.</i> Rosata, but you can call me Meg. <i>(Glances at Darren a second more, then remembers why she's here, shakes her head slightly to clear it:)</i> Oh, yes, I've heard from around our community about you, Mr.--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Gently cuts her off:)</i> --Please call me Darren--</p>

<p>ROSATA: --Darren, and I thought it would be a great <i>human-interest</i> story for our viewers--you know, a long-thought-of dead son who has come back to his birth family.</p> 

<p>HELEN: <i>(Glares at Rosata for a moment, then looks at Darren:)</i> I <i>tried</i> to tell Ms. Rosata--<i>"Meg"</i>, that you weren't ready for an interview, Darren, but she <i>insisted</i> upon asking to hear from you herself.

<p>DARREN: No, it's okay. <i>(Looks at Rosata:)</i> Meg, I'd like to give you your interview, but could it wait a few <i>weeks</i>, at least? <i>(Thought v.o.: By that time, my secret should be out--I <b>hope</b>.)</i> I've had some--<i>troubles</i> in my personal life, and I want to get to know my birth family a little better first--you know how it is.</p>

<p>ROSATA: <i>(Pauses, considers:)</i> All right, Darren, I guess I can wait, but would you promise me that you won't give any interviews to any <i>other</i> media outlets until <i>after</i> you talk to us first?</p>

<p>DARREN: That seems fair, Meg. <i>(Reaches out to shake her hand, which she returns:)</i> Deal?</p>

<p>ROSATA: <i>Deal</i>. It was a--<i>pleasure</i> to meet you, Darren--<i>(Rosata looks at him with a slight dreamy gleam in her eye, which no one but Amy and Daria catch:)</i> I--<i>definitely</i> look forward to the interview. <i>(Hesitates:)</i> Um, good bye, everyone, and thank you all for your time.</p>

<p>HELEN: You're welcome, Meg. I'll see you out. <i>(Leaves with Rosata)</i></p>

<p>AMY: <i>(To Daria in a low tone, smirks:)</i> Did you see how that reporter <i>behaved</i> towards Darren? <i>(Daria slowly nods)</i> She was practically <i>drooling</i> at him! Well, it's <i>official</i> now--if I had <i>any</i> doubts after my little <i>"woman's college"</i> remark, it's <i>long</i> gone. My nephew and your brother can <i>snap</i> his fingers and get <i>any</i> girl he wants. He probably has a whole <i>stash</i> of them somewhere.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Looks at Amy uneasily, speaks in the same tone:)</i> Um, well--that's <i>not</i> exactly true, Amy--</p>

<p>AMY: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow at Daria:)</i> Oh? What do you mean, Daria?</p>

<p>DARIA: Well, um--<i>(Jake, who had slipped out of the living room, comes back with a box full of tapes, interrupts everyone, including Helen, who had just came back from seeing Meg Rosata out)</i></p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Grins like an idiot:)</i> --Hey, everybody! I've got some of our <i>tapes</i> of Daria and Quinn while they were <i>babies</i> and little <i>kids</i>! Let's watch them!</p>


<p><i>(Note to reader: some of the tapes of baby Daria and Quinn were seen in "Monster")</i></p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Chuckles, with both of his grandmothers on each arm:)</i> Hey! You didn't tell <i>me</i> about those tapes since I've been here!</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Smiles, walks up beside Jake, puts her arms around his waist:)</i> We wanted to wait until the rest of our families came to see you, son.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Thought v.o.: And insure my total and complete humiliation.) (Rolls her eyes:)</i> Oh, <i>God</i>. Amy, you don't <i>have</i> to see this--</p>

<p>AMY: <i>(Smirks:)</i> --And <i>miss</i> out on seeing you taking your first <i>baby</i> steps? <i>(Daria gives her a tiny glare) Not</i> on your life! C'mon! <i>(Turns to go back to the living room with the others, thought v.o.: What did Daria mean by "not exactly"? Maybe I should ask her or Darren about that later.)</i></p> 

<p>QUINN: <i>(Delighted to get the attention, looks over to Erin, follows everyone:)</i> Oh, I was <i>so</i> cute when I was little! Now, I know it's incredible, but I'm even <i>cuter</i> today! <i>(Keeps talking to Erin while both of them go into the living room. Daria waits for a moment, sighs, and goes in. She is the last one to come, and sits beside Amy.)</i></p>

     
     <p>After viewing the tapes, (much to Daria's consternation and Quinn's wild delight) the families had looked through the Morgendorffer's family photo album. <i>(Note to reader: See some of the photos in "The Daria Diaries")</i> Darren quietly looked through the photos while Ruth and Evelyn, who were sitting on both sides of him on the middle couch, argued about what clothes that Daria and Quinn were wearing in the photos, and <i>who</i> gave it to them for Christmas, birthdays, and the like. Darren, however, didn't hear them because he was looking at the lives of his birth family pass--<i>without</i> him there with them. When he heard at first about the photos, he thought seeing his sisters growing up wouldn't affect him, but now, going through them made him feel <i>sad</i>. He narrowed his eyes slightly, <i>pretending</i> to place himself as a little boy in those photos with his sisters--but he couldn't. <i>Damn</i> that Turley. Amy noticed him with a concerned look from him that bordered on mild <i>depression</i>. She took the initiative and spoke up.</p>

<p>AMY: Um, Helen--<i>(this interrupts the bickering from Ruth and Evelyn:)</i> why don't you show Mom and Rita around your house? They really haven't had a good look at it since they've been here.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Gasps:)</i> Why, Amy--you're <i>right! (Smirks at her mother and Rita:)</i> Let me show you both around, Mother, Rita--let's start upstairs.</p>

<p>RUTH: <i>(Gets up as well:)</i> I'll go with you all so I can give Helen some decorating <i>tips. (Looks around:)</i> She certainly hasn't <i>done</i> anything since I've last been here, like she said she would! <i>(Helen glares at Ruth with daggers as they go out of the living room, while Evelyn and Rita smirk at each other)</i></p>

<p>AMY: <i>(Looks at Jake:)</i> Jake, didn't you tell me the last time I was here about that car show you were at? <i>(Jake nods)</i> Didn't you have some sort of <i>brochure</i> with a lot of pictures in it from that show?</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Becomes excited:)</i> Hey, <i>yeah</i>! <i>(Looks around, snaps his fingers:)</i> It's in the den on the shelf above the desk!</p>

<p>AMY: Well, why don't you show <i>Brian</i> what's in it? I'm sure he likes cars--right, Brian?</p>

<p>BRIAN: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Sure, I guess. <i>(Gets up and goes out with Jake to the den)</i></p>


     <p>Daria looked at her aunt curiously. It was obvious she was up to something by splitting up everyone, but she wondered what it was. Daria waited with a mischievous sense of guessing who she was going to send off next. She even noticed <i>Darren</i> giving Amy a curious look as well, trying to understand her motives.</p>


<p>AMY: <i>(Looks at Quinn and Erin:)</i> Quinn, didn't you say something to me about the newest issue of <i>Waif</i> magazine? Why don't you show Erin the latest fashions?</p>

<p>QUINN: Sure, I guess--it's up in my room. C'mon, cuz! <i>(Pulls Erin along)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks and watches Quinn and Erin go upstairs, waits until they're out of sight, turns to her aunt:)</i> Okay, Amy, what's <i>up</i>? Why'd you send everybody all over our house?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Raises an eyebrow:)</i> Yes, I'd like to know that, too.</p>

<p>AMY: Actually, I'm not <i>quite</i> finished yet. <i>(Looks at Daria:)</i> Daria, you told me Jane and her mom were coming in late tonight. Why don't <i>you</i> see if you can call her and find out what time she's coming, okay?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Caught a little off guard that Amy would want <b>her</b> gone so that Amy could talk to Darren alone, searches for words:)</i> Um, sure--<i>(looks at watch:)</i> I'll see if she's there. <i>(Leaves)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smirks, watches Daria go, talks in a low tone:)</i> Hmmm--for <i>some</i> reason, I <i>never</i> thought you'd get rid of Daria. <i>(Looks back at Amy:)</i> So, what do you want to talk to me about?</p>

<p>AMY: <i>(Points to the door:) Outside. (Goes out, followed by Darren)</i></p>

     
     <p>Both went out to Amy's car in the driveway. Amy went on the passenger side, and got in. She looked up at a perplexed Darren through the driver's side window, who was standing on the driver's side, and gently motioned for him to get behind the wheel, which he did. Amy gave him the keys, and he started up the car. She turned on a switch that folded down the red sportscar's soft top.</p>


<p>AMY: <i>(Lies back in the seat, closes her eyes:) Drive</i>. Anywhere. Just drive.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks back and backs out the car:)</i> Eh--what about if anyone wants to know <i>where</i> we are?</p>

<p>AMY: <i>(Opens one eye, notices Daria looking at them in the front window:)</i> Oh, I'm sure <i>someone</i> will know we've gone someplace. Drive. <i>(Shuts her eyes, lets her hair blow in the breeze)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Sure. <i>(Car drives off down the street)</i> Now, what's <i>up</i>?</p>

<p>AMY: Oh, I just wanted to get you out of that place before your <i>melancholy</i> feelings took you down for the count.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Keeps his eyes ahead, but cuts them over to Amy occasionally, looking sheepish:)</i> Um--I didn't think <i>anyone</i> noticed--</p>

<p>AMY: --How you were <i>wishing</i> what it could be like to be with your birth sisters and parents as a <i>kid</i> while you were looking at the videos and the photo albums? Hey, it could've been <i>worse</i>--<i>(smirks:)</i> you could've ended up like <i>me</i> in my childhood as a kid.</p>

<p>DARREN: Ah, Daria told me about what it was like for you in your childhood--something about your providing <i>"color commentary"</i> while your sisters fought one another for your mother's attention?</p>

<p>AMY: <i>(Still laying back, eyes closed:) Jack</i> straight. My point is--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Cuts her off:)</i> --Your <i>point</i> is, it could have been worse for <i>me</i>. I told Daria the <i>same</i> thing when she compared her--<i>our</i> family with her friend Jane's. At least Daria and Jane <i>had</i> siblings--and so did <i>you</i>. Okay, maybe in some cases they could be a <i>pain</i>, but from what Daria told me, you and Helen have grown <i>closer</i> to each other recently. <i>My</i> point is, a brother or sister in my childhood could've made me feel a little less--<i>lonely</i>.</p>

<p>AMY: <i>(Opens her eyes, looks at Darren concerned:)</i> Weren't your, um, <i>parents</i> there for you? I mean since you were a only child, and I'd think they'd kind of--</p>

<p>DARREN: --<i>Spoil</i> me? Actually, they <i>didn't</i> do that. Oh, don't get me <i>wrong</i>, my (adopted) parents were there with me <i>every</i> step of the way, really. <i>(Thought v.o.: And even the <b>servants</b>.)</i> But with a brother or a sister, well, we could just hang out and talk, or <i>(chuckles:)</i> get into <i>trouble</i> together, and <i>protect</i> one another from our parent's punishments--</p>

<p>AMY: <i>(Smirks:)</i> --Or get each other <i>into</i> your parent's punishments. <i>(Mimics her voice like a child's:) "I'm gonna tell mama and dada on you!"</i> or <i>"You're gonna get it <b>so</b> bad..." (Darren laughs)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: I stand <i>corrected. (Grows quiet:)</i> I guess it's just one <i>more</i> thing to add to my <i>recently-turned-to-crazy</i> life. <i>(Amy looks at Darren sadly, then puts her hand on his in a reassuring manner. The hand she she pats is shifting the straight gear. She then smiles at him)</i></p>

<p>AMY: I'm <i>sorry. (Pauses, lightens her tone:)</i> That kind of reminds me--earlier today, Daria told me something that <i>surprised</i> me somewhat--you're <i>not</i> a <i>"loverboy"</i>? I'd think you'd be the one just about <i>all</i> the girls would go after.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks uneasy:)</i> Well, you see, I don't want to be that <i>type</i> of a guy. I had only <i>one</i> girlfriend for about <i>two</i> years, and I--uh--well, <i>loved</i> her.</p> 

<p>AMY: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Ah, <i>now</i> I see why you're not like that. I think that's very <i>sweet</i>--and very <i>right</i>. Well, I'd like to <i>meet</i> her, Darren--she's one lucky gal. <i>(Considers something:)</i> Hold it--you said <i>"loved", past</i> tense. Did something happen?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(With a pained expression, hesitates on whether or not to tell Amy, then relents:)</i> You can--<i>say</i> that. Look, Amy, I told Daria about what happened, so I guess I can tell you, but would you kind of keep it to <i>yourself</i>? Eventually, I'll tell everyone else, but what happened is sort of like talking about my (adopted) parents death--I generally <i>don't</i>--it happened not too long ago, you know.</p>

<p>AMY: <i>(Looks at her nephew softly, understands:)</i> Okay, Darren--sure, I promise.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Pauses:)</i> Well, her name was <i>Stephanie Reardon</i>--</p>



<p><i>(Scene is back at the Morgendorffer home, at the same time)</i></p>



     <p>Daria had just watched Darren leave with Amy. She felt a little <i>miffed</i> at being left behind, but then decided that maybe Amy wanted to just have a little time alone with Darren. Daria shrugged, then figured since she was alone for the moment (something Daria fully relished) she might as well <i>really</i> call Jane and see when she'd come in. Daria picked up the cell phone in the kitchen, and started to dial. She wondered briefly if Jane and her mother would spend their final day getting in some last-minute sightseeing, but the phone was answered.</p>


<p>VOICE: Yo!</p>

<p>DARIA: Hey, Jane--did I catch you at a bad time? I know I shouldn't have called this early, but--</p>

<p>JANE: --Nah. My mom and I were a'packing. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Kind to think of it, she seems to be <i>more</i> eager than me to get out of here. That 'ol pottery seminar's calling to her, I guess.</p>

<p>DARIA: When do you guys plan to leave?</p>

<p>JANE: About 3:00 p.m. our time--6:00 p.m. yours. After an hour layover in St. Louis, that means we'll arrive at the local airport about midnight your time--although the Forecast Channel says that some <i>seriously</i> nasty weather is headed your way. That could delay our plane for about an hour or more before landing, so maybe we'll get there about 1:00 a.m. your time if everything goes right.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:) 1:00 a.m.</i>? Do you think Trent will be <i>up</i> at that time? He might be sleeping, and you guys'll end up at the airport waiting for him, or the phone's ringing from trying to call him might not get him awake. Maybe you should get <i>Tom</i> to be there for you.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Pauses for a moment, sounding somewhat <b>disappointed</b>:)</i> Don't <i>start</i> with me about Tom.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:)</i> Huh? What do you mean? <i>(Narrows eyes:)</i> What'd he do <i>now</i>, Jane?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Now sounding hurt:)</i> It's what he <i>didn't</i> do that bothers me, Daria--I called yesterday, and what do you know--his answering machine is <i>now</i> working. I hear on <i>it</i> that he's going to be <i>out</i> of town with some of his prep-school buddies for a few days, saying he needed a <i>vacation</i>, and this was the <i>only</i> time his boss would let him go--even <i>after</i> I told him I'd be coming in for the weekend. He said he'd see me when he came in Monday. <i>(Snorts:)</i> This from the guy who practically <i>begged</i> me to give him <i>another</i> chance, remember?! Why couldn't he have taken <i>some</i> of his vacation with <i>me</i>? He knew <i>when</i> I was coming in! Sure, I went out here with my <i>mom</i> on <i>my</i> vacation, but don't you think that was kind of <i>different</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Considers this for a moment:)</i> Well, you've got a <i>point</i> there. <i>(Pauses, shrugs:)</i> Maybe that was his <i>logic</i>, or something, you know, like, <i>"If she can spend some time with her mom, why not me with my friends?"</i></p>

<p>JANE: Yeah, but <i>now</i>? Daria, this is our <i>relationship</i> at stake, you know, not some sort of <i>guy-oriented excursion</i>! Why should I give Tom the <i>time of day</i> anymore? <i>(Pauses:)</i> Don't tell me you're <i>still defending</i> Tom?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Defensive tone:)</i> It's not that, Jane--<i>(sighs:)</i> out of fairness, he <i>did</i> tell you he'd be in Monday, and he was really relieved when I told him you'd talk to him. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Look, just wait for his <i>explanation</i> when he returns, okay? <i>(Thought v.o.: And he'd damn well better have a good one--I'm getting really tired of this crap.)</i></p>


     <p>There was a <i>very</i> long pause on the other end, then Jane spoke.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(In a quiet but cold tone:)</i> One--more--<i>damn</i>--chance--Daria--that's it. <i>(Gives a long sigh, lightens tone:)</i> Look, <i>enough</i> about me--how's your little <i>"Family Reunion with the Big Bro"</i> going?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Eh, it's actually going okay with Darren here to <i>calm</i> everyone down. The boy has really <i>shown</i> his stuff.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Sounding curious:)</i> Oh? What'd he do?</p>

<p>DARIA: He's just been able to make my grandmas act <i>civil</i> to each other, my aunt Rita to go <i>ga-ga</i> over him, the same for my cousin Erin, and he even made Brian <i>jealous</i> over the way Erin reacted over him. <i>(Pauses:)</i> I think Darren's even <i>won over</i> my aunt Amy, who's out with him now in her car talking about <i>who-knows-what</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>Wow</i>--even your heroine, the <i>"Great Aunt Amy"</i>? I'm <i>definitely</i> looking forward to meeting your bro. <i>(Snickers, sounding half-serious:)</i> Does he have a <i>girlfriend</i>?

<p>DARIA: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow for an instant, then guesses Jane is just <b>joking</b>:) Ho-ho.</i> You just keep that <i>eye</i> of yours on <i>Tom</i>, okay?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Snorts:)</i> Yeah--what <i>little</i> I have of it <i>left</i>, sure. Speaking of <i>eyes</i>, are you keeping <i>your's</i> on <i>Trent</i>? <i>(Daria rolls her eyes, shakes her head slowly:)</i> How's he and Mystik Spiral doing with their newfound <i>"wealth"</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: They bought the "new" used Tank a few days ago, keeping even the <i>same</i> color, as well as their new instruments. Trent called here yesterday and said he and the band are finishing up on a new song that will <i>"thank"</i> their <i>"Mysterious Benefactor"</i>, and will debut at the Zen tomorrow night, so you'll be able to listen to it then. <i>(Deadpan:)</i> Boy, I can't wait for the world <i>"premiere"</i> of <i>that</i> little <i>ditty</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(In her usual playful scolding motherly mode:)</i> Now, now, Daria. Trent called me and my mom yesterday, too, and said he and Mystik Spiral have <i>really</i> been working on this song--in fact, he's <i>very</i> excited about it. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Geez, I wonder <i>who</i> this person is? Ya got any ideas, <i>"Shorty"</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sighs:)</i> Afraid not, <i>"Stick Girl"</i>--although I wonder if this guy--or girl--has some sort of <i>motive</i> in doing this. No offense to Mystik Spiral, but I can't for the <i>life</i> of me figure out why they'd be <i>singled out</i> for this.</p>

<p>JANE: Hey, somebody might just have a <i>good</i> heart--I mean, it's <i>possible</i>, right?</p>

<p>DARIA: Maybe--I don't know. Perhaps it's just my <i>cynical</i> nature that is rearing it's <i>ugly</i> head that's made me wonder about this in that way. <i>(Hears some voices:)</i> Uh-oh, family <i>chaos</i> is approaching. I'd better get off. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Say, maybe Darren and I can pick you guys up if Trent can't make it to the airport.</p>

<p>JANE: Hmm--tell you what--if Trent's not there when mom and I come in, I'll make a beeline to the payphones and call you, okay?</p>

<p>DARIA: Roger.</p>

<p>JANE: Later. <i>(Hangs up)</i></p>


     <p>Daria had just clicked off the phone when Helen, Evelyn, Rita, and Ruth walked into the kitchen. Helen was <i>scowling</i> at Ruth, who was <i>sneering</i>.</p>


<p>RUTH: --And <i>that's</i> what I'd <i>do</i> in the living room. Now as for the kitchen here, I'd definitely change the color of those <i>ugly</i> drapes! <i>(Helen has had just about enough when Evelyn speaks)</i></p>

<p>EVELYN: <i>(Looks at the draped window above the sink:)</i> Yes, Ruth--as much as it <i>pains</i> me to say this--I have to <i>agree</i> with you. <i>(Helen looks at her mother, stunned)</i> Those drapes <i>are</i> the wrong color. How about <i>yellow</i>?</p>

<p>RITA: <i>(Jumps in, figures this is a good way of siding with her mother against Helen for some brownie points:)</i> I favor <i>gold</i>. Yellow's too <i>loud</i>--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan, smirks:)</i> --How about <i>zig-zag orange polka dots with vertical little bananas on a tangerine and purple checkerboard pattern that is in the shape of lightning</i>?</p> 

<p>HELEN: <i>(Glares, shocked:) Daria</i>!</p>

<p>EVELYN: <i>(Considers, looks up:)</i> No, dear--<i>that's</i> too loud, too.</p>

<p>RUTH: <i>(Also looks up, considers:)</i> Hmmm--I <i>agree</i>.</p> 

<p>RITA: <i>(Does the same as the other two:)</i> Oh, most <i>definitely</i> too loud, Daria. <i>(Helen slowly closes her eyes, puts her hand on her forehead and sighs, while Daria smirks even wider)</i></p>

<p>EVELYN: <i>(Looks around:)</i> Where's my grandson and your aunt Amy, Daria?</p>

<p>RUTH: <i>(Jumps in before Daria can say something, slightly frowns at Evelyn:)</i> Don't you mean <i>our</i> grandson, Evelyn?</p>

<p>EVELYN: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> All <i>right</i>, Ruth--<i>our</i> grandson!</p>

<p>DARIA: He and aunt Amy went out in her car, Grandma Evelyn. They didn't say where they were going.</p>

<p>RUTH: <i>(Suddenly glares at Evelyn:)</i> Leave it to your <i>weirdo</i> daughter to take <i>my</i> grandson out on a <i>joyride</i> to <i>God-knows-where</i>!</p>

<p>EVELYN: <i>(Narrows her eyes at Ruth:)</i> How <i>dare</i> you call my daughter <i>"weird"</i>! She's a <i>grown</i> woman who may be a <i>little strange--(Daria gives a slight frown at Evelyn, and Rita smirks)</i> but I seriously doubt that she'd <i>ever</i> let something terrible happen to her own nephew! <i>(Realizes something:)</i> And I thought Darren was <i>our</i> grandson!</p>

<p>RUTH: <i>(Waves Evelyn off:)</i> I don't know if Darren should <i>be</i> your grandson now--he might take up some of <i>your</i> family's <i>bad</i> habits!</p>

<p>EVELYN: <i>(Now becomes furious:) WHAT-IN-THE-HELL DO YOU MEAN--</i></p>


     <p>Helen was about to <i>scream</i>, Rita had stepped back to see the fireworks, and Daria was about to make some microwavable <i>popcorn</i> (she remembered they actually had some, and did not have to wonder anymore if the caterers had any) when Darren and Amy walked into the kitchen. Ruth and Evelyn looked at Darren and both rushed up to him, hugging and kissing him on the cheek. Silently snapping her fingers, and mouthing <i>"Damn"</i>, Daria put the small pack of popcorn back into the cabinet.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Overwhelmed, looks down at his grandmothers:) Whoa</i>! What's going <i>on</i>?</p>

<p>RUTH: <i>(While caressing his face, in a concerned tone:)</i> Oh, my grandson, did <i>she (glares at Amy:)</i> try to drive you into a <i>telephone pole</i>, or something?</p>

<p>AMY: <i>(Smirks, decides to go into sarcastic mode:)</i> No I didn't, but I did try to get him to <i>spin wheelies</i> all over town to <i>incur the wrath</i> of the cops. <i>(Ruth frowns at Amy, while Daria smirks, and Darren tries not to laugh)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(In a soothing tone, gently holds Ruth's hands, much to the consternation of Evelyn:)</i> Calm down, Grandma Ruth, I'm fine, really. Besides, <i>I</i> was doing the driving. We just talked, that's all. <i>(Looks at Amy, smiles:)</i> Amy wanted to let me drive her car, and it was a <i>blast</i>. Great <i>horsepower</i> under the hood! <i>(Amy smirks)</i> We came back in when we saw that the sky was starting to get <i>dark</i>.</p> 

<p>DARIA: I heard that the Forecast Channel has predicted some <i>really</i> bad weather for this evening. <i>(Smirks:)</i> You might be <i>stuck</i> here overnight if you stay here for a couple of hours more.</p>

<p>RUTH: <i>(Looks over at Evelyn, uneasily:)</i> Well, what do <i>you</i> want to do, Evelyn?</p> 

<p>EVELYN: <i>(Considers:)</i> I think we should <i>leave</i> before it comes in. <i>(Looks at Darren, puts her hand on his face:)</i> Now, I'll be back here again soon, Darren.</p>

<p>RUTH: <i>(Nudges past Evelyn, does the same thing:)</i> And so will <i>I</i>, sweetie. <i>(Hugs him)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Well, if you two <i>really</i> have to go, I'll miss you. But, I'll be here until about <i>two</i> weeks before I have to register at Eastward College for the fall semester.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Dumbfounded:)</i> Do you all <i>have</i> to go so <i>soon</i>? We could <i>make</i> some room, and--<i>(Daria shuts her eyes and slowly sighs. Darren catches this, and tries not to laugh, while Amy, who also sees Daria, smirks)</i></p>

<p>EVELYN: Now, now, Helen--I have to be back home by tomorrow for some painters. They said that is the <i>only</i> day can fit my house in for a few <i>months</i>. Rest assured, I'll <i>try</i> to come back before Darren leaves.</p>

<p>RUTH: The <i>same</i> goes for me, Darren. I have a <i>flower</i> show to go to tomorrow. <i>(Looks around:)</i> Helen, will you call two cabs for us, please? <i>(After a moment, Helen grabs her cell phone and starts to call)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Thought v.o.: <b>Now</b> I see, it's all in the family, this <b>"love-em-and-leave-'em thing"</b>. Gee, I look forward to doing that to <b>my</b> family come Graduation Day from good 'ol Lawndale High) (Leaves with everyone into the living room)</i></p>


     <p>Jake and a <i>bored-looking</i> Brian came out of the den, with Jake showing his Middleton College pictures to Brian. Both walked into the living room.</p>


<p>JAKE: <i>(Points in the book, excited:)</i> Those <i>were</i> the days, Brian m'man--<i>(looks off, reminisces:)</i> me and Helen, <i>Coyote, Willow, Ryvre, Lavendar, Serenity, Mook,</i> and even <i>Sebastian</i>! Us against the <i>world--(narrows eyes, goes into ranting mode:)</i> and <i>away</i> from my <i>Old Man</i>! <i>(Sees Ruth:)</i> Yeah, Mom--dad put <i>both</i> of us through some <i>hell</i> didn't he?!</p>

<p><i>(Note to reader: Coyote and Willow come from the episode "That Was Then, This Is Dumb", and Sebastian, Ryvre, Lavendar, Serenity, and Mook come from C.E. Forman's "retrolarious" fanfic "Fireworks")</i></p> 

<p>RUTH: <i>(Gives Jake a sympathetic look:)</i> That he did, Jakey--that he <i>did.</i></p>


     <p>Quinn and Erin came downstairs, chatting and giggling.</p>


<p>QUINN: --And that style looked <i>so</i> silly on her, you <i>know</i> what I mean, Erin?</p>

<p>ERIN: <i>(Rolls her eyes:) Tell</i> me about it, Quinn. That <i>tube dress</i> looked like a <i>rag</i> on her with that dumb <i>peach</i> color.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan, walks up to them:)</i> But I thought her <i>shoes</i> set the dress off <i>perfectly</i>.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Snorts:)</i> Come <i>off</i> of it, Daria--the shoes were <i>dreadful--(realizes something:) hey</i>! You're just <i>kidding</i> me, aren't you?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:) Never</i> let it be said that I <i>ever</i> did that, sis.</p>


     <p>About ten minutes later, everyone said their goodbyes when the two yellow cabs, driven by <i>nervous</i> cab drivers from the <i>same</i> cab company who had drawn <i>straws</i> when they had heard <i>who</i> they were picking up, (because the previous driver had <i>warned</i> his fellow drivers of what to expect) drove up to the front of the Morgendorffer home. Rita grabbed her nephew in a <i>vice-like</i> hug, and kissed Darren on the cheek, saying she looking forward to seeing him again. Erin did the <i>same</i>, but Brian simply <i>shrugged</i> and smiled sheepishly when he saw it this time, and shook Darren's hand. Rita, Erin, and Brian got into their cab in the front. (The driver in this cab <i>crossed</i> his heart and looked up and said a quick <i>prayer</i>)</p>

     <p>Ruth saved Darren for last when she said goodbye, hugging him, and kissing him on the cheek. She then got into the back of the rear cab. (The driver of <i>this</i> cab sighed in <i>relief</i>, believing that Ruth was going to be the <i>only</i> one he was taking back to the motel. He looked at the other driver in front of him and <i>smirked</i>.) After giving her own hug and kiss to Darren, Evelyn informed Amy that she was going back <i>with</i> Ruth so Evelyn could <i>"set Ruth straight"</i> on a few things about the <i>"remarks"</i> Ruth had made about Evelyn's family. Without hearing from Amy, Evelyn promptly got into the back with a surprised Ruth and started to <i>argue</i> with her, much to the now-horrified rear cab driver's chagrin. (The cab driver in the front looked in his rear view mirror and gave his <i>own</i> smirk at the driver in the rear. Daria looked at the cab driver in the rear, smirked, and gave a slow, drawn-out motion with her thumb going across her throat, like a pirate gives the <i>"cut-throat"</i> signal. The driver in the rear <i>glared</i> at Daria for a second before following the other cab away. Amy then got into her car, and <i>winked</i> at Darren, who smiled, and slightly <i>blushed</i>. She then backed her car into the street and took off. Helen, Jake, Quinn, and Daria looked at Darren, inquisitive.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Eyebrow cocked:)</i> What in the hell was <i>that</i> all about, bro?</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Chuckles:)</i> Aunt Amy was giving me some <i>encouragement</i>, sis--that's all. We just talked about a few--<i>personal</i> things. <i>(Starts to go back into the house with the others)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Smirks, half-joking:)</i> Should I be <i>worried</i> about some <i>"competition"</i>, son? <i>(Daria rolls her eyes at this, remembering the last time Amy was here)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Puts his arm around his birth mother, smirks:)</i> Nah--everything's <i>kosher</i>.</p> 

<p>QUINN: <i>(Suddenly grabs her brother's other arm:)</i> C'mon, bro--let me show you what fashions I think are gonna be in for the <i>fall--(pulls Darren away from a surprised Helen)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: --The "fall" of <i>"skorts"</i>, or the "fall" of <i>"schrungies"</i>? What will you do--what <i>will</i> you do? <i>(Darren chuckles)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Annoyed:) Ha</i>, Daria. <i>(Pulls Darren into the house)</i></p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Shouts after Darren:)</i> Hey, Big Guy--don't forget about watching the 'ol baseball game with me after you talk to Quinn!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Being pulled up the stairs with Quinn:)</i> I woooon't! <i>(Goes out of sight upstairs, while Jake goes into the living room)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Looks up the stairs while walking inside with the others:)</i> Well, Quinn certainly seems <i>taken</i> with her brother--</p>

<p>DARIA: --Don't you mean he's being "taken" <i>from</i> us? When he comes out, he'll <i>never</i> be the same again after she finishes <i>boring</i> him to death with her clothes <i>crap</i>.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Frowns:)</i> Now, Daria--Darren has been <i>very</i> supportive of your sister in helping her get the feel of what to expect at Circa for her internship, fashion-wise. You <i>have</i> to admit Quinn is becoming more <i>determined</i> about her grades because of her brother's dogged <i>encouragement</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Grudgingly admits, sighs:)</i> I <i>suppose</i> so. I just hope Quinn doesn't <i>wear</i> him out while Darren's doing it.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Smirks:)</i> I wouldn't <i>underestimate</i> Darren, sweetie--he held up fine after our <i>relatives</i> came to visit us, right?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Stares at her mother for a moment, ponders:)</i> Hmm--you got me there, Mom--anybody who can <i>survive "F-Day"</i> is okay in my book--speaking of which, I've going to read one up in my room. <i>(Goes up the stairs)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Watches her go up:)</i> All right, Daria. <i>(Turns to go into the living room to catch up on a little work Eric wants her to do while finishing up her vacation, then pauses, speaks in a low voice to herself:) "F-Day"</i>? What's <i>that</i>? Oh, well...<i>(shrugs, goes into living room) (Outside in the distance, thunder is heard)</i></p>



<p></i>(The scene is Darren's room, about 11:00 p.m.)</i></p>



     <p>Darren came in, almost <i>exhausted</i>. Between his relative's "visit", (chaos included) Quinn's excitement over the newest fashion craze, and Jake's constant <i>wild</i> hollering at the TV screen during the baseball game (what was shown between the <i>power outages</i> from the <i>ferocious</i> storm outside), Darren found himself in a continual <i>whirlwind</i> of activity, and was grateful that the day was coming to an end. While watching the game, Daria, who had to stop reading occasionally because of the power outages, told him he might have to get up in a few hours if Daria's friend Jane and her mother called to pick them up at the airport, but that was no big deal. All-in-all, an--interesting, if not--<i>fasinating</i> day. He plopped down face-first on the bed, ready to sleep, when his cell phone rang. He looked at it, cocked an eyebrow, and reached to answer it. Probably <i>Curtis</i>. Great--what would he tell his best friend about <i>still</i> not telling the Morgendorffers who he really was? He pondered that for a moment, then decided to <i>definitely</i> tell them <i>tomorrow</i>, so he wouldn't <i>technically</i> be <i>lying</i> to Curtis when he would tell him that he <i>did</i> already. His birth family had a <i>right</i> to know what who he was. Darren sat up on the bed, took a deep breath, and picked up his cell phone, clicking it on.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Talking wearily:)</i> Yeah, Curtis?</p>

<p>VOICE: Actually, Darren, this is <i>not</i> your friend Curtis.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Surprised:) Woo</i>? <i>(Is suddenly startled for a moment from the sound of thunder outside)</i></p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Hears the thunder from over the phone:)</i> Having quite a summer storm, I see.</p>

<p>DARREN: Yes, a real <i>doozy</i> of a storm, Woo--there's already some flooding near Lawndale--we're okay, though.</p>

<p>WOO: Ah, good--did I call at a bad time? You told me that you had your relatives over today when I last talked to you--is anyone there with you?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Now more alert from the thunder and from talking to Woo:)</i> No, everyone's gone home, and I'm in my room alone--what's up? Found <i>something</i>?</p>


<p>WOO: <i>(Grows quiet, takes on a serious tone:)</i> You might <i>say</i> that--<i>brace</i> yourself, Darren--</p>


     <p>About several minutes later, Darren stared at his phone in utter <i>disbelief</i>, his mouth agape. This <i>couldn't</i> be happening. Had to be some sort of <i>nightmare</i>--that's it--when he <i>pinched</i> himself, he'd <i>wake up</i> from it. <i>Wake up, damn it--wake up</i>. First <i>Stephanie</i>. Second, the <i>death</i> of whom he <i>thought</i> were his birth parents. Third, learning he was <i>adopted</i>. Fourth, the <i>way</i> his <i>"adoption"</i> took place. Now, fifth--<i>this</i>. He continued to stare at the phone for a moment more until Woo's <i>shouts</i> shook him out of his daze.</p>

<p>WOO: Darren?! Darren, are you still there?</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Weakly:)</i> Yes, Woo--I'm still here. This is just <i>not</i> possible--this--this <i>"Sanchez"</i> murdering my parents? <i>Hired</i> to make it <i>look</i> like an <i>accident</i>? <i>(Voice grows low, speaks through clenched teeth, angry:) Who--why--how--</i>?</p>

<p>WOO: I don't know, Darren, but as I said, if the police or the NTSB are told, it could <i>alert</i> the person or persons who've done this go <i>after</i> Sanchez, and <i>silence</i> him before we can get to him. Our best hope is <i>finding</i> Sanchez, confronting him, and getting the information out of him. <i>(Pauses:)</i> You said you <i>haven't</i> told the Morgendorffers who you are--maybe it's <i>best</i> if you don't until we find Sanchez because it could <i>drag</i> them into this if that person or persons come <i>after</i> you.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Frustrated tone:)</i> I--I can't believe this, Woo! I was going to tell my birth family who I was <i>tomorrow</i>, and now you're telling me I shouldn't because of <i>this</i>? <i>(Narrows eyes, realizes:) Back up</i> a moment--are you saying that the Morgendorffers could be in <i>danger</i>?

<p>WOO: <i>(Hesitates:) Possibly</i>, Darren, <i>(adds quickly:)</i> though I don't believe they could be in it <i>directly</i>--who <i>knows</i> you're in Lawndale?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Thinks:)</i> Let's see--Curtis, obviously, my aunt Millie, Elenor, Claude, and, oh, yes, my <i>uncle Will</i>. No one else knows, I'm <i>positive. (Becomes alarmed:)</i> Do you think anyone could come after <i>them</i> as well as the Morgendorffers and me?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(After being silent for a moment:)</i> Not your friend Curtis or your servants--they don't poise a threat, and now when I <i>think</i> about it, the Morgendorffers obviously the same. <i>(Darren breathes a small sigh of relief:)</i> Your aunt Millie isn't much into the business, so I can't fathom someone going after her. This is all about getting Appleton Industries, I'm sure.</p>

<p>DARREN: So it comes down to me and uncle Will. <i>(Eyes light up, alarmed:)</i> Maybe I should <i>warn</i> him--</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Sounding alarmed himself:) No</i>, Darren--<i>(calms down:)</i> ah, remember, we don't want to give the person or persons who've done this any opportunity to know that someone knows what they've done. If your uncle finds out, er--he could be on <i>pins and needles</i> like you are, and if whoever did this is on the <i>inside</i> of Appleton, will know by your uncle's sudden change in <i>behavior</i> that something's up. Let us find Sanchez first, and <i>then</i> we can warn your uncle.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Ponders:)</i> Well, okay, Woo--if that's what you think best. <i>(Grows solemn:)</i> I guess--I guess I can keep this to <i>myself</i> for now, and wait to tell the Morgendorffers later.</p>

<p>WOO: Thank you, Darren--and we're checking out Sanchez's hangouts. We're going to be moving as fast as we can on this, so hang in there. Take care.</p>

<p>DARREN: Sure, Woo--and do <i>whatever</i> it takes, okay?</p>

<p>WOO: Of course, Darren. Good night.</p>

<p>DARREN: Good night, Woo. <i>(Clicks off phone) (Thought v.o.: I can't tell <b>anyone</b> about this--not without <b>dragging</b> them into it, and possibly putting their <b>lives</b> in danger. I'm <b>alone</b>, all alone.) (Lays back on the bed, turns off lamp light beside his bed, stares at the ceiling, wide-eyed, still in shock. The thunder, lightning, and heavy rain is still going on outside while Darren is doing this)</i></p>


<p><i>(Scene changes to Woo's office, Los Angeles)</i></p>


     <p>Woo hung up the phone and turned to David, a husky, blond-haired, blue-eyed tanned man with a goatee. David was reading the <i>business</i> section of the paper.</p>


<p>WOO: <i>(Cold, serious sound in his voice:)</i> We've got our work <i>cut out</i> for us, David--but at least we have <i>some</i> place to start--<i>(points at the paper:) Leonard Potter</i>. First thing in the morning, I'm going to pay Appleton's newest West coast legal head a little <i>visit</i>--and find out what in the <i>hell</i> is going on with <i>why</i> William Appleton brought him out here. <i>(David nods his head in the affirmative)</i></p>  


<p><i>(End Part Three)</i></p>
