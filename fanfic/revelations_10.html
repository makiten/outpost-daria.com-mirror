<p><i>(To the reader: Still here, eh? You know the drill--<b>no</b> recaps. Read it like a <b>book</b>! Now, on with the story.)</i></p>



<p>Chapter 10-I.O.U.</p>



     <p>The storm from the previous night had finally abated into a misty rain outside the Morgendorffer home. In his room, Darren slowly opened his eyes, and saw a nodding and snoring <i>Jake Morgendorffer</i> sitting beside the bed, with his arms crossed. By now, Darren had become <i>used</i> to seeing his birth father in this way, not even flinching anymore. Darren quietly chuckled to himself as he slowly slid out of the bed on the other side. He tiptoed around his bed, so as not to disturb Jake, and gently laid Jake, who was mumbling in his sleep about Helen not letting him do anything, (to which Darren cocked a quick, amused eyebrow at this,) down on the bed, covering Jake with the bedsheet. Darren then put on his housecoat over his pajamas, quietly gathered his jogging clothing out of his dresser (he decided to get his red hooded sweatshirt to wear with his white sweatpants after he got a quick look out of the window), socks and shoes, and slipped out of his room.</p>

     <p>Darren went in the bathroom and changed into his jogging clothes. He wished he could've used his dumbells to stretch before he went jogging, but thought the better of it, as it would disturb Jake. Darren carefully folded up his pajamas and housecoat, and put them on top of the clothes hamper. He quietly came out of the bathroom and went down to the living room. Since he wasn't awoken by Daria during the night on going to the local airport to pick up Daria's friend Jane and her mother, he assumed that Trent had picked them up already--with what was on his mind, he was privately <i>grateful</i> for the sleep, which surprisingly was fitful. Darren suspected it was because of the rain that pelted the roof--he could always sleep better at night when it rained.</p> 

     <p>As he stepped out of the house while stretching, Darren immediately saw that the storm had caused some branches from the trees around the neighborhood to fall down on the street and in the yards. He pulled his hood over his head, and stepped out into the damp, misty air, and started to jog. If this had been any other day, Darren would've considered not going out, but he needed to get out and think about what Woo had told him last night.</p> 
     
     <p><i>Murdered</i>. His parents were murdered by a hired killer. This was <i>beyond</i> incredible--and this "Sanchez" <i>bastard</i> was still out there. Darren secretly wished he could <i>find</i> him, and--<i>no</i>. That <i>wasn't</i> him. He had almost went over the <i>edge</i> when Turley told him how Turley switched him for the dead baby by <i>choking</i> Turley--and that <i>scared</i> him.</p>

     <p>But <i>who</i> could have done it? It <i>had</i> to be someone wanting to get control of Appleton Industries, like Woo had speculated. He remembered when he was given the Chairmanship of Appleton Industries through the reading of the business will, and the <i>chaos</i> that ensued immediately afterwards, as well as when he chose his uncle to head everything--the <i>same</i> thing had happened. Could it have been someone <i>there</i>? He thought about the people who had attended the reading of the business will--most of them were <i>ambitious</i>--a good trait to have when it came to wanting to be a success. Maybe one of them went too far with <i>wanting</i> that success? Just thinking about that gave Darren the <i>chills</i>. He suddenly thought about his uncle's right-hand man, <i>Benny Lodell</i>--now <i>there</i> was a man that didn't like Darren for <i>some</i> reason--Darren could <i>feel</i> the <i>hate</i> resonating from Lodell when Darren went around him. Of course, there's always the very real fact that somebody out there doesn't like you, no matter how nice you are to them--Lodell seemed to be that way to Darren. He shook his head quickly as to get the thought out of his mind, and continued to jog.</p>

     <p>Darren's jogging route went from the Morgendorffers, near the Cranberry Commons Mall, past Lawndale High School, by Quinn's favorite restaurant, <i>Chez Pierre</i>, (Where Darren had promised to take Quinn tomorrow afternoon, whereas Daria had respectfully declined to go) and Darren also jogged past the exclusive neighborhood called <i>Crewe Neck</i>, and then proceeded to go near the area's unstable landfill. All throughout the jog, he had to contend with the misty conditions, but it wasn't enough to really slow him down. He saw more tree branches on the ground and on the streets, as well as some minor flooding, with the water receeding into the gutters. Here, he treaded carefully, avoiding the water--good thing his hooded outfit and jogging shoes were waterproofed.</p>

<p><i>(Note to reader: See "The Daria Diaries" for Darren's jogging route--I'm guessing that from looking at the map, Lawndale is about 10 to 20 square miles in size--quite possibly someone in great shape could jog around the tiny suburban town, at least around the shopping district and the homes that surround it)</i></p>

     <p>As he was jogging near the unstable landfill, (Daria had warned him not to go across it, because of the possiblity of <i>sinkholes</i> that could be formed from the old landfill's light soil, epecially after it rains), he heard a <i>scream</i> that sounded like a female's. Responding to it, he rushed onto the landfill, getting some mud on his sneakers and sweatpants, and saw that indeed a sinkhole, about 20 feet in diameter had formed, probably because of the torrential rain from last night, but he could only see on its top edge. He carefully came up to it, and peered over. The sight in front of him made his heart race with <i>fear</i>.</p>

     <p>In the middle of the sinkhole, (about 12 feet deep) there was a mud-covered person, possibly the female, struggling like mad to get out. The person, however, thanks to the mud-covered walls that were collapsing as fast as that person was trying to scale them, was making <i>no</i> headway--in fact, it only made it <i>worse</i> by attempting to do so because the person then began to <i>sink</i> in the thick muddy pool that was in the middle of it. The mud was quickly up to the figure's <i>shoulders</i>, and getting worse. The figure screamed <i>again</i>--definitely a female's voice--a <i>teenager</i>. The young woman then began to sink to her neck, gasping for air in the mud.</p>

     <p>Looking frantically around outside the pit, Darren saw nothing he could use to lower over the edge and use to pull the young woman out of the sinkhole--the whole landfill was one large muddy bed. He looked back into the sinkhole. the head of the young woman had almost gone under, and her arms were still flailing around--but they were slowing down from exaustion.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Screaming and still looking around:)</i> Try to be <i>still</i>! Moving around only makes it <i>worse</i>! The mud is like <i>quicksand</i>! <i>(Focuses on the young woman:)</i> Do you <i>understand</i> me?!</p>


     <p>The mud-covered young woman, apparently so covered now that she couldn't see <i>where</i> the voice had come from, nodded in a direction that was pointed <i>away</i> from Darren for a second, (the mud had kept her from speaking now--it was so thick) but then she started to sink a little <i>more</i>, and then panicked, giving a muffled scream, and the mud started to get <i>higher</i> on her face. Darren looked into the pit and saw something that could help--thanks to the still-collapsing mud walls, a large, long-buried thick tree root was now protruding out from the side of the sinkhole, opposite from him. It was on the side that was a little <i>lower</i> than on Darren's. He rushed to the side where the tree root was sticking out, and carefully slid down the walls, grabbing on the root for support, and effectively putting himself at risk. If the root suddenly fell out, then he and the young woman would be in trouble because the mud-covered walls could keep them <i>both</i> in, for there was no traction to grab onto anything else. He then looked for the head of the young woman.</p>

     <p>There were <i>bubbles</i> in the mud where the head once was. The young woman was <i>gone</i> beneath the mud.</p> 

     <p>Now frantic, he reached over to where the head was, using his right arm and hand to feel around through the thick mud, splashing it around while holding on to the root using his left hand. For a moment, he felt <i>nothing</i>--then his hand <i>grabbed</i> the shoulder of the young woman, and he used his arm to reach under and around her, pulling her out of the mud. The woman was <i>limp</i>. Darren, now himself completely covered with mud, couldn't tell if she was alive. He looked back at the root to see if it had gave, but it didn't--thank <i>God</i> it didn't. He pulled himself and the young woman up the root, and struggled to get both of them out of the sinkhole. For the next 10 seconds or so, it was touch-and-go, but eventually, he got himself and the young woman out. Carrying the young woman in his arms a safe distance away from the edge (in case it collapsed even more, thus possibly causing them to fall back in), he gently laid her on her back, and put his finger on her neck, checking for a pulse--which he did <i>not</i> get. He positioned her head for CPR, breathing in her mouth, and listening for any breathing from her. He did this a few times more, then the young woman suddenly awoke, coughing and spitting up mud out of her lungs, and gasping for air. She fluttered opened her eyes and saw the mud-covered man who had saved her life. She started to sit up.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Immediately speaks in a gentle tone:)</i> Careful, miss--don't get up <i>too</i> quickly. You don't want to get dizzy. <i>(Pauses:)</i> How do you <i>feel</i>?</p>

<p>YOUNG WOMAN: <i>(Still coughing and gasping:)</i> L-like an <i>idiot</i>. I've gone over that area a whole <i>damn</i> number of times, and nothing's <i>ever</i> happened to me like that before. I <i>knew</i> it was <i>unstable</i>, but jogging across it saved me time. Damned <i>landfill--(slaps her leg in disgust, splashing up mud:)</i> damned, damned, <i>DAMNED</i>, landfill! Damned <i>IDIOT</i>!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Slightly taken aback from the young woman's reaction:)</i> Hey, take it <i>easy</i>--you're <i>alive</i> at least--<i>(chuckles:)</i> nothing <i>"idiotic"</i> about <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>YOUNG WOMAN: <i>(Grows quiet, looks directly at the man:)</i> Yeah, I am--thanks to <i>you. (Offers her mud-covered hand:) Jane Lane's</i> my name--your's?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Stunned, shakes her hand:) J-Jane Lane</i>? <i>Daria's</i> friend Jane?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Eyebrow cocked beneath her mud-covered face:) Uh-huh</i>--how do you know Daria? <i>(Pauses:)</i> Hey, are you from Lawndale High?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smiles sheepishly under his mud-covered face:)</i> Ah, no--you see, I'm <i>Darren</i>--Daria and Quinn's <i>brother</i>, and Helen and Jake Morgendorffer's <i>son</i>.</p> 

<p>JANE: <i>(Eyes light up, shocked:)</i> Well, I'll be <i>damned--(smirks:)</i> so <i>you're</i> the <i>"Big Bro". (Starts to get up:)</i> What a way to <i>"meet"</i>, eh? <i>(Thought v.o.: <b>Crap</b>! I can't see how he <i>looks</i> under that all that damn mud--just have to wait until we're cleaned up, I guess.)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Helps Jane up by her arm, sounding a little concerned:) Easy</i>, Jane--don't get up <i>too</i> fast, now. The blood could <i>rush</i> to your head.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Stands up with Darren, a bit unsteady:) Whoa</i>--yeah, I see what you mean. Thanks, Darren.</p>

<p>DARREN: You're welcome, Jane--<i>(gives a quick smile:)</i> I wouldn't want Daria's <i>"Partner In Crime"</i> to hurt herself trying to get up. <i>(Pauses, looks in the direction of the sinkhole:)</i> I suppose we'd better call someone and tell them about that sinkhole, don't you think? We don't want anyone <i>else</i> to fall in.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Looks in the same direction, smirks:)</i> Good idea--one person <i>per</i> sinkhole should be the <i>standard</i> from now on. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Tell ya what--<i>I'll</i> do the callin' when I get home, and before I change, capeesh? <i>(Starts walking with Darren away from the old landfill)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Okay, that sounds reasonable. So--what <i>time</i> did you and your mother get in last night? I'm assuming Trent was waiting for both of you at the airport--?</p>

<p>JANE: Yeah, we got in about <i>1:30</i> this morning--the plane had to <i>circle</i> the airport for about 20 minutes until we could land, it was so stormy. The surprising thing about Trent was that he was wide <i>awake</i> and waiting for us when we got in--<i>(chuckles:)</i> I'm going out on a limb and say it was the thunder and lighting that <i>kept</i> him awake in the airport terminal--<i>(adds as an afterthought:)</i> oh, and I guess he was also kind of <i>worried</i> about us, too.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Laughs:)</i> Uh, yes--Daria told me about Trent's rather--<i>narcoleptic</i> tendencies.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Nods her head, smirks:) Uh-huh</i>. Anyway, my mom and I had our first look at Mystik Spiral's "new" used van, too. Trent's car is in the shop, being repaired, and he's the one using it to drive around until he gets his own car back. As for that van--<i>(in a mock commercial-sounding voice:) "New interior van" fresh smell</i>! <i>No more "pukey-like" aroma</i>! <i>No more "beer-like" stench</i>! <i>(Goes into a faux sorrowful mode:) It just won't be the same's, I tells ya. (Snaps fingers in mock frustration:)</i> Aw shucks--I'm gonna miss not having <i>that</i> in the "new" Tank!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks over at Jane, chuckles, thought v.o.: Daria said Jane had a bit of a <b>twisted</b> sense of humor--let's see if I can add a little of my own--no need to let her have all the fun:)</i> Well, maybe Mystik Spiral needs to <i>break</i> it in, first--who knows? A little <i>beer and vomit</i> here and there, and I'll bet you won't be able to <i>tell</i> the difference! <i>(Looks up, mock ponders:)</i> Oh, give it about, umm, <i>six</i> months, and you'll have that vaunted, old-reliable smell, <i>guaranteed</i>!</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Cuts her eyes over to Darren, smirks, thought v.o.: So, the boy <b>does</b> have a sense of humor--that little "trick" he played on Quinn, notwithstanding:)</i> Oh, I don't know, Darren--Trent said that he and the guys want to keep the "new" Tank <i>clean</i> inside. <i>(Darren cocks an eyebrow in surprise beneath his mud-covered face)</i> I couldn't believe it, but it seems like they're really <i>serious</i> about it--like they have a <i>renewed</i> sense of purpose. Trent told us that the <i>"Mysterious Benefactor's"</i> financial <i>"help"</i> made him and the guys think--<i>hard</i>. He told me that if someone as <i>rich</i> as this person could give them <i>$8,000</i> and tell them to not give up on their <i>dreams</i>, then the guys figure they could at least go <i>all out</i> and not give up, if not for the "benefactor's" sake, then <i>themselves. (Darren smiles to himself over this) (Jane then ponders for a moment:)</i> I told Daria yesterday I wish I knew <i>who</i> this person was--from what I heard from Trent, the way he and the guys have been <i>going</i> since that generous gift, makes me wish I could <i>thank</i> them for doing something like that.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Holds down the satisfaction he feels after hearing Jane:)</i> Daria told me she thought that this "Mysterious Benefactor" had some sort of ulterior <i>motive</i> for doing something like that. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Do <i>you</i> think he or she did?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> I dunno--what would be the <i>point</i>? It's not like Mystik Spiral's <i>successful</i> enough to warrant any special attention, or something. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Daria's just, you know--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Laughs, nods his muddy head slowly:) --Daria</i>, I'm beginning to <i>understand</i> that. Don't take this the wrong way, but is it <i>me</i>, or is she really <i>unyielding</i> when it comes to judging other people when they don't meet up to her <i>standards</i>?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Rolls her eyes:) Oooooh</i> yeah. Daria's standards are <i>unique</i>, to say the least. A <i>cynical</i> outlook when it comes to life, <i>mistrust</i> of authority, the hard, harsh light of <i>reality</i>, etcetera, etcetera--you know, the <i>usual</i> stuff.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Gets quiet:)</i> How are <i>you</i> her friend, Jane? You seem to be more, well--</p>

<p>JANE: --<i>Open</i> to more things in life than she is? I guess you can say that I'm kind of <i>like</i> her--<i>enough</i> to pass her <i>"standards"</i>, but I'm more willing to be <i>tolerant</i> of people's <i>shortcomings</i> than Daria is--don't ask me why, I just am. <i>Underneath</i>, though, I know Daria has a <i>good</i> heart.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Nods in an understanding manner:)</i> Yes, I know. Did Daria tell you about <i>Quinn</i>, and what I'm trying to do with her?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> Yeah! She said that you're gonna perform some sort of <i>"miracle"</i> and help Quinn get into a fashion school--after she becomes an intern on a summer job working at a fashion company, or something.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Grins:)</i> Well, <i>"miracle"</i> may be a bit too <i>strong</i> of a description. Quinn's going to have to do <i>her</i> part. She's going to have to work really <i>hard</i> to get in, school-wise <i>and</i> work-wise. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Believe it or not, I think I'm getting <i>through</i> to her.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Snorts:)</i> Well, good luck with <i>"Quinny-poo"</i>--she's gonna <i>need</i> it. <i>(Darren gives a little snicker at this)</i></p>


     <p>Having seen no one else as of yet, the two walked down the broken branched-covered street in the still-misty morning, they went past the abandoned quarry, and here encountered two county maintenance men who were gathering up the broken branches, and putting them in a garbage truck. The two men, a tall, skinny fellow, and a short, fat fellow, stopped and looked at the mud-covered Jane and Darren, and <i>smirked</i>.</p>


<p>SKINNY MAN: <i>(Starts to laugh, points at Jane and Darren:)</i> W-what in the <i>hell</i> is <i>that</i>, Roy?</p>

<p>FAT MAN: <i>(Ditto:)</i> L-looks like the <i>pigs</i> have escaped their <i>pens</i>, Harry!</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks evilly, leans over to Darren, and speaks in a low voice:) Pigs and pens</i>, huh? Seems like <i>Mutt and Jeff</i> over there are looking at us like we're <i>freaks</i>. I'm gonna <i>scare</i> 'em off, and remind them to mind their <i>own</i> damn business.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks a Jane a little uneasily, speaks in the same low tone as her:)</i> Ah, what are you going to <i>do</i>?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(While walking slowly forward towards the men:) Watch. (Stops about ten feet in front of the two men, and then suddenly starts to jump up and down, and screams:) WAAAUGH</i>! <i>EEEEYARGH</i>! <i>OOGA-BOOGA-BOO</i>! <i>OINK</i>! <i>(Starts to suddenly run at the two wise-guys)</i></p> 


     <p>The eyes of the two men suddenly grew wide, looked at each other terrified, and they dropped the branches they were carrying, and ran for their lives, screaming and shouting all the while, eventually running out of sight. Jane stopped and watched them go, pointing at them and laughing hysterically. Darren looked at her for a second, stunned, then began to <i>join</i> in as well. Both started to continue on their way.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Still laughing:)</i> D-Daria's <i>right</i>--y-you <i>are</i> a <i>wicked</i> woman, Jane--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(While laughing as well:)</i> --And I'm <i>damned</i> proud of it too, <i>"Kimosabe"</i>--'till the day I <i>di--(stops in her tracks, realizes what she was about to say, grows quiet:) God. (Looks up at Darren, suddenly afraid, who has stopped along with Jane, looking at her, baffled:)</i> I-I <i>almost</i> d-did, didn't I? Y-you did <i>save</i> my life. <i>(Pauses:)</i> I-I guess I <i>owe</i> you, huh?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks down at Jane, grows quiet himself, tries to look for words:)</i> Hey, uh--I just did the <i>right</i> thing, Jane, that's all--you don't owe me <i>anything</i>, okay?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Narrows her eyes on her mud-covered face up at Darren, walks up to him, sounding angry:)</i> You're <i>kidding</i>, right? Are you saying my <i>life's</i> not <i>worth</i> anything, Darren?!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Taken aback, slightly stunned, holds up hands:) No, no</i>, Jane! I-I'm just saying that you don't feel like you <i>have</i> to owe anything to me for that, that's all! <i>(Pauses, chuckles uneasily:)</i> Besides, if I didn't think it was <i>worth</i> anything, I wouldn't have tried to <i>preserve</i> it, right? <i>(Starts walking immediately from Jane to try and alleviate the tension in the air:)</i> Um, we'd better <i>hurry</i> up and get on, don't you think? Even though the misty rain is keeping the mud on us moist, I'm <i>still</i> starting to feel uncomfortable, if you know what I mean. <i>(Uses his hands to slide a glob from his arms, plops it on the ground) Ugh.</i></p>


    <p>Jane stared at Darren walking away for a second, then began to follow him.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(Comes up beside Darren, thought v.o.: Don't think you're <b>off</b> the hook, buster--I <b>owe</b> you, and I'm gonna <b>pay</b> you back for saving me.:)</i> Sorry to <i>snap</i> at you like that, Darren, and you're right about thinking enough about it to try and "preserve" it--it's just that the <i>reality</i> of <i>death</i> that's <i>hit</i> me in the <i>face</i>, okay? <i>(Darren gives Jane a sympathetic nod and smile) (Jane pauses, changes tone:)</i> So, um, <i>how</i> did you <i>find</i> Daria and her--<i>your</i> family?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Glances down at Jane sideways, smirks:)</i> You know, I could take that question <i>one</i> of <i>two</i> ways, Jane. <i>(Jane chuckles)</i> In this case, I'm <i>assuming</i> that you're wondering about how I came to <i>discover</i> that the Morgendorffers were my birth family, and how I came to be adopted in the first place. I kind of figured that you'd want to hear my story <i>with</i> Daria in tow. <i>(Pauses, realizes something:)</i> Say--wouldn't  have <i>Trent</i> told you? Daria said that you talked with him occasionally while you were on vacation.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Waves him off:)</i> True--but he said that the story he heard was <i>so</i> unbelievable, that it was too much to get into over the phone--like Daria had told me--and that I should get it from her. Since <i>you're</i> here, however, you can give me the <i>shorthand</i> version if you like, and Daria can help you fill in the blanks later.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Hesitates:)</i> Well--okay, but you'd better <i>prepare</i> yourself, Jane--it isn't a <i>pretty</i> story.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Cocks an inquisitive eyebrow up at Darren:)</i> Somehow, I'm not too <i>surprised</i> to hear that. <i>Shoot</i>.</p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to the Morgendorffer's home, about the same time)</i></p>



     <p>Helen, who had awoke and found that Jake wasn't beside her in bed, got up and looked around for him in the house, stopping only to make a quick call on her cell phone in the kitchen. When she had searched around a little more and found nothing, she had a hunch and peeped into <i>Darren's</i> room. Surely enough, she saw Jake sleeping <i>in</i> Darren's bed. Helen walked up to the bed and gently shook Jake.</p>


<p>HELEN: Jake--Jake--<i>(shakes him a little harder:) JAKE</i>!</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Wakes up:)</i> Wha-huh? <i>(Sees a scowling Helen, becomes meek, pulls sheet up to his chin in fear:)</i> Oh, um, <i>hi</i>, honey!</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> Jake, haven't we gone over this <i>before</i> when I caught you in here a <i>few</i> days ago while Darren had gone on one of his jogs? Darren's too <i>polite</i> to say anything, but you've got to stop watching <i>over</i> our son! He's practically a <i>(sighs:) grown</i> man!</p> 

<p>JAKE: <i>(In his "whiny" mode:)</i> But, Helen, I can't <i>help</i> it! I just wanna be there for him if he <i>needs</i> me! <i>(Becomes solemn, looks down:)</i> I mean, <i>I</i> wasn't there for him all those <i>years</i>, but that <i>"Walter"</i> guy was. <i>(Looks at Helen forlornly:)</i> He calls me <i>"Jake"</i>, and you <i>"Helen", not</i> "Dad" and "Mom" to us! <i>(Frowns, slams the palm of his hand on top of the bed:)</i> It's just not <i>fair</i>, damn it! <i>(Pauses, grows quiet:)</i> Helen, it's just like my Old Man wasn't there for <i>me</i>--except to <i>berate</i> me all the <i>damn</i> time! <i>(Helen sits down beside him, pats Jake on the back gently)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Sighs, gently turns his head to her, looks at him in the eye:)</i> Jakey, it wasn't your fault. <i>(Emphasizes again:) Wasn't-your-fault</i>. Your father <i>chose</i> to treat you the way <i>he</i> wanted to--you didn't have a <i>choice</i> in the matter of raising our son--<i>(looks off in space, narrows eyes:)</i> thanks to that <i>S.O.B. Turley. (Looks back at Jake:)</i> We can be thankful that Darren's here with us <i>now</i>, and that he turned out to be such a <i>fine</i> young man--that's all we can do. <i>(Becomes quiet, looks off again:)</i> Maybe <i>someday</i>, he can call <i>us</i> "Mom" and "Dad". <i>(Looks back at Jake:)</i> For now, dear--I want you to <i>promise</i> me that you won't watch over our son like that again, okay? <i>Please</i>? He's <i>safe</i> right here, and he's not going anywhere.</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Looks away, snorts:) Yeah</i>, Helen--just back to <i>Eastward</i> and then living with his <i>aunt</i>--what's her <i>name</i> again? Oh yeah, <i>Millie</i>, and not with <i>us</i>.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(In a gentle tone:)</i> Now, Jakey--he can come and <i>visit</i> us, and I'm sure that eventually, we can visit <i>him</i>, too.</p> 

<p>JAKE: <i>(Sounds sheepish, slowly looks at Helen:)</i> I guess so, honey--<i>(takes a deep breath, and gets a determined look on his face:)</i> and I promise <i>not</i> to sit beside Darren's <i>bed</i> again!</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Looks up in mock thought, playfully chuckles:) Weeell</i>--I suppose if he gets <i>sick</i> or something, that's okay, Jakey.</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Now back to his usual "chipper" self, giving a thumbs-up:)</i> A-okay, honey!</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Good--now get up and out of that bed, mister--we don't want Darren to find you in here when he comes back from his jog now, do we? <i>(Stands up)</i></p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Gets up as well:) Okey-dokey</i>!</p>


     <p>Daria, who had gotten up to get a glass of water, had been out in the hallway listening to Helen and Jake talk. After cocking a slight eyebrow to her father complaining about Darren calling him and her mother by their <i>first</i> names, she listened a little more, then went back into her room unseen after they had finished.</p>

     <p>Quinn, who was half-dozing in her bed at the time Daria had walked by her room, had become fully awake when she heard Daria. Quinn slipped out of her bed, opening her door <i>ever</i> so slightly and peeked into the hallway where she saw Daria listen to Helen and Jake talk, which by the way, Quinn could also hear herself. She saw Daria turn around from the door when their parents had finished, and Quinn quickly, but quietly, shut the door before Daria could see her. Quinn crawled back into her bed, and lying back on her pillows, put her arms under her head, looking at the ceiling with her eyes narrowed, thinking.</p>


<p><i>(Scene goes back to Jane and Darren, this time in front of the Lane home)</i></p>


     <p>Jane couldn't believe her mud-covered ears. Darren's parents being killed (he didn't say how), and then of his learning of being adopted, and the kicker--being <i>illegally</i> adopted because of some <i>sicko's</i> gambling obsession, and being taken away from the Morgendorffers while just a baby, being substituted for a <i>dead</i> one. It sounded like a <i>nightmare</i>, except it was all <i>too</i> real for Darren. Jane thought that <i>no</i> one had had it harder than she did growing up, because her parents and siblings were all over the place, save for home. Only <i>Trent</i> was there for her--but at least she <i>knew</i> about what her family was all about. Darren <i>never</i> knew about his birth family until his adopted parents were killed. <i>Hell</i> of a way to find out. <i>Damn</i>--listen to this guy, and you can only feel <i>sorry</i> for him. Still, he seems like a genuinely <i>nice</i> fellow, so his adopted parents must've done a good job raising him. Jane briefly wondered if that was a <i>wash</i> either way? Daria said her always-on-the-go parents met <i>Quinn's</i> needs almost all the time <i>before</i> they met hers, and look how <i>"Miss Everything-Revolves-Around-Me"</i> turned out, as opposed to Daria. What <i>kind</i> of <i>"attention"</i> would've <i>Darren</i> gotten from them? <i>Crap--maybe, just maybe, this guy was <B>better off</B> growing up under his adopted parents, Jane. Maybe--</i></p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Waves a hand in front of Jane's face, chuckles:)</i> Uh, <i>"Earth to Jane"</i>--are you <i>there</i>?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Snaps out of her deep thought:) Hah</i>? Oh, um--sorry. I was just thinking over what happened to you. How--how could you <i>stand</i> to go through all of that?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Thought v.o.: You think that's all, Jane? Not by a <b>country</b> mile:)</i> Well, learning about the Morgendorffers helped keep me going, Jane--that and my friend and aunt.</p> 

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks, thinks for a moment:)</i> Tell you what--how about <i>we</i> be friends? <i>(Holds out her muddy right hand)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Shakes her hand with his muddy right one as well, smiles:)</i> Actually, kind of I thought we <i>already</i> were, but I suppose we can make it <i>official</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Strikes a dramatic false poise:)</i> I hereby declare us to be <i>good</i> friends, dear sir! <i>(Laughs)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Grins:)</i> So be it! <i>(Pauses, laughs, jokes:)</i> You don't think this will get Tom <i>jealous</i>, do you?</p>


     <p>Jane <i>slowly</i> stopped laughing, and frowned to herself, deep in thought. Darren caught on to this, and added his own frown, perplexed by Jane's sudden change.</p>


<P>DARREN: <I>(Slowly speaks:)</I> Uh, did I say something <I>wrong</I>?</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Comes out of her deep-thinking mode:)</i> Huh? Oh, no--I was just--<i>thinking</i> about Tom--yes, um, when you said his <i>name</i>--?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Seemingly satisfied with what Jane's explanation:)</i> Ah, okay--I'm sure you really <i>missed</i> him. <i>(Jane looks away for a moment, in deep thoughts again) (Darren pauses:)</i> I guess I'll see you at the Morgendorffer's after we both clean up, then?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Grins:)</i> Wild <i>horses</i> couldn't keep me from going over there, Darren. <i>(Thought v.o.: And I can see how you <b>look</b>, buster.)</i> And then you and Daria can come over here and look at what art I've done while on vacation. Daria said that you saw a little bit of it in the living room when you guys came over our house.</p>

<p>DARREN: Yes, but we didn't stay long because of Trent and Mystik Spiral's <i>"problem"</i>--which of course has apparently been <i>"solved"</i> now. From what I saw, your paintings in the living room displayed a tremendous amount of <i>abstract expressionism</i>--very powerful <i>emotions</i> are being brought out from some of your work. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Were you influenced by artists like <i>Picasso</i> and <i>Goya</i>, by any chance?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow, inwardly impressed by Darren's knowledge of art:) Yeah</i>--you could say that--plus a little of my <i>own</i> emotions thrown in on the side to put on the canvas for all the world to see. <i>(Pauses, smirks:)</i> You're planning to use your business knowledge to become an <i>art critic</i>, bub?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Laughs:)</i> No, not really--you see, I learned from my er, (adopted) dad and uncle about some art. I have a art class at Eastward also, and I've--<i>dabbled</i> in some painting <i>myself</i>, nothing much, mind you.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Hey, art's <i>art</i>, no matter how long or much anyone's done it. Hmm--maybe I can see some of your artwork someday?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Shrugs, smiles back sheepishly:)</i> I guess--<i>someday. (Pauses:)</i> I assume that you plan to go to an art college or university after high school--?</p>

<p>JANE: You betcha--I'm thinking about going to the <i>New York City Art School</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Thinks, looks up:)</i> Yes--that <i>is</i> quite a prestigious art school--about <i>30 minutes</i> from Eastward College, I believe.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Thinks about the close distance for some reason, smirks:) That</i> close, huh?</p>

<p>DARREN: Yes. <i>(Looks off in the direction of the Morgendorffers:)</i> Well, I'd better take off, Jane--see you in an--hour-and-a-half or something---?</p>

<p>JANE: Yeah, sure, okay. <i>(Pauses:)</i> See you then.</p>

<p>DARREN: See you. <i>(Leaves)</i></p>


     <p>Jane watched Darren leave up the misty street, a bit <i>longer</i> than she intended, then walked into her home. Immediately, she saw Trent sprawled out on the couch in the living room, snoring. She looked as if she was about to say something, but she smirked, and shook her head slowly--the boy had <i>earned</i> his rest this time by picking her and her mom up from the airport early this morning--she decided to <i>let</i> him rest. Jane then went up to her room to call about the sinkhole to the authorities--and then to shower and change as quickly as possible to meet the <i>newest</i> member of the Morgendorffer's family.</p>


     <p>Several minutes later, and after enduring some <i>hard</i> stares from the neighbors (at which he had been <i>tempted</i> several times to do what <i>Jane</i> had done to get rid of those people), Darren came up to the Morgendorffer's home. He was about to ring the doorbell as usual when he looked down at himself and remembered that he'd <i>better</i> let someone in the house get a towel to wipe off some of the mud so he would be able to walk in without tracking mud on the rug. Darren took off his mud-soaked socks and shoes, and was about to ring the doorbell when he noticed a man and a woman walking up the driveway. He turned to them.</p>


<p>MAN: <i>(In a syrupy nice voice:)</i> Hi, we're the <i>Gupty's</i>, and we've just come from our <i>vacation</i> last night, and heard about--<i>(looks at Darren strangely:) oh</i>--my--<i>Lord</i>--</p>

<p>WOMAN: <i>(With an equally strange look on her face, and an equally syrupy nice voice:)</i> --W-who--<i>what</i> are you, sir? Why do you look like <i>that</i>?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks down at himself, and then back up at the Guptys:)</i> Oh, no, I can <i>explain</i> this--you see--<i>(starts to come down the front porch)</i></p>

<p>MR. GUPTY: <i>(Becomes concerned, grabs his wife's arm:)</i> --N-never mind, fellow! We'll come back <i>later</i>! Come <i>on</i> dear! <i>(Hurries away from Darren with an equally concerned and afraid Mrs. Gupty)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: No, wait, I--<i>(watches them leave down the street, thought v.o.: These people around here are <b>crazy</b>. I'd better get in the house before someone calls the police, and they arrest me for looking like a <b>dork</b>.) (Goes back up the front porch and rings the doorbell)</i></p>


     <p>All the Morgendorffers were in the living room, fully dressed, with Jake and Daria reading sections of the morning paper, and Helen talking on the phone to Eric about what work Helen would have do when she got back from her vacation for Monday. Quinn was walking by the front door to the kitchen when the doorbell rang, and she went to answer it.</p>


<p>QUINN: I got it! <i>(Opens the door:)</i> Yes? What--<i>(sees a muddy person, becomes horrified, makes a disgusted face:) EWWWWWW</i>! <i>(This makes the rest of the family look up and take notice)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Sighs:)</i> Quinn, it's just <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Looks at him uneasily:) D-Darren</i>? What happened to <i>you</i>? Ick!</p>

<p>DARREN: Long story, sis--could you get me a towel so I can wipe some of this mud off, please?</p>

<p>QUINN: Huh? Oh, sure--be back in a jif. <i>(Leaves up the stairs to the bathroom, while the others see Darren at the door and come up)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Comes up, worried:) Darren</i>?! Oh my <i>word</i>, son--what happened to you?</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Comes up behind Helen, equally worried:)</i> Yeah, Big Guy--what in the heck happened--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Chuckles:)</i> --I think Quinn <i>already</i> asked that question.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Comes from behind both of her parents, smirks:)</i> Yeah, Mom, Dad--we don't want my bro here thinking he's in an <i>echo chamber</i> or something. So, bro--are you trying to <i>make up</i> for all those times that our mom couldn't <i>admonish</i> you for <i>playing in the mud</i> and dirtying up your clothes? <i>(Darren tries to not laugh, as does Jake, who quickly goes silent when Helen looks at him sharply)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Turns her attention back to her son, cocks an eyebrow:)</i> Darren? <i>Explanation</i>?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks at Daria:)</i> It involves your friend <i>Jane. (Quinn comes back from upstairs with a towel and <b>gingerly</b> gives it to Darren by her fingertips, making another disgusted face)</i> Thanks, sis. <i>(Starts to wipe himself off)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Raises an eyebrow:) Jane</i>? What does <i>she</i> have to do with you being in the <i>mud</i>? <i>(Smirks:)</i> For some reason, I'm almost <i>afraid</i> to ask.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(While still wiping himself off, and removing his socks and shoes, cocks a mock-glare eyebrow at Daria, quick smirk:)</i> To be honest with you all, I'd like to shower and change before I say anything else, please--this mud is beginning to make me <i>itch</i>. Besides, I think Jane herself wants to be here when I do, okay? She'll be over here, soon. <i>(Carefully walks in the house after wiping his feet off, and wraps the now-muddy towel around his shoes and socks, gingerly going up the stairs, then halfway up, stops and turns back:)</i> Oh yes--just before I came in, some people called the <i>"Guptys"</i> came up, took one look at me, then <i>shot</i> out of here, saying they'd come back some other time--go <i>figure. (Continues up the stairs)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Alarmed, slaps her forehead:)</i> The <i>Guptys</i>? Oh, no! What will they <i>think</i>? I called them this <i>morning</i> after they came in from their vacation, and wanted to <i>introduce</i> them to Darren--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> --Whom, I believe, they've already had the <i>pleasure</i> of just meeting in all of his muddy <i>"guts and glory".</i></p>

<p>HELEN: I'd better see if I can call them back--excuse me. <i>(Goes into the living room)</i></p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Shrugs his shoulders:)</i> Guess we'll catch them later, huh, girls? <i>(Follows Helen)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Rolls her eyes and smacks her mouth in disgust:) God</i>! I hope they <i>don't</i> want me to <i>babysit</i> their kids again! I used to <i>love</i> going over there an' stuff, but for <i>some</i> reason, they've been real <i>monsters</i> most of th' time, an' the parents can't keep <i>anybody</i> anymore! <i>(Daria smirks at this, and follows Quinn into the living room)</i></p>


<p><i>(Note to reader: See "Pinch Sitter" for the babysitting thing, of course)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene is now in Jane's room, about thirty minutes later)</i></p>


     <p>Jane had put on her regular ensemble of clothes and was combing her hair when there was a knock on her door.</p>
 

<p>JANE: <i>(While looking in the mirror:)</i> C'mon in.</p>


     <p>Trent came into her room, yawning and stretching.</p>


<p>TRENT: <i>(Comes up behind Jane:)</i> Hey, Janey--I went to use the bathroom, and I saw that your jogging outfit and shoes on the floor were kind of <i>muddy. (Pauses:)</i> Did you <i>fall down</i> in the mud or something?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks while still looking in the mirror, catching Trent's reflection in it:)</i> Yeah, you might <i>say</i> that. <i>(Pauses:)</i> You know the old landfill, Trent?</p>

<p>TRENT: Yeah, <i>everybody</i> knows about it--and?</p>

<p>JANE: Well, I was jogging across it as usual to save time in getting home, when the ground suddenly <i>collapsed</i> under me. <i>(Trent cocks an eyebrow)</i> I fell into a damn, deep, mud-filled sinkhole, and I couldn't get out. <i>(Pauses, turns to look at her brother, grows quiet:)</i> Trent, I would've <i>drowned</i> if <i>Darren</i> hadn't risked his <i>life</i> to save <i>mine</i>.</p>

<p>TRENT: <i>(Stunned, walks up to Jane to hug her after she gets out of her chair to allow him to do so:) Darren</i>, Daria's brother, <i>saved</i> you? <i>(Jane nods) Whoa</i>--are you okay, Janey?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smiles while hugging her brother:)</i> Yeah, I was a little <i>shaken</i>, but otherwise, I'm fine--thanks to <i>Darren. (Releases Trent:)</i> I was going over to the Morgendorffers to meet him in the <i>flesh</i> without the muddy covering. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Mom up, yet?</p>

<p>TRENT: Yeah--she <i>left</i> for the seminar while you were in the shower, I guess.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Rolls her eyes:) Hmmph</i>--we come in from vacation, and she goes right off <i>again</i>. Though I knew she'd go to that pottery show when we got back, I didn't know it would be <i>this</i> soon--so what <i>else</i> is new, huh?</p>

<p>TRENT: <i>(Shrugs, his voice gets low:)</i> Yeah. <i>(Ponders:)</i> Hey, I gotta figure out some way to <i>thank</i> Darren for saving you, Janey--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:) --Way</i> ahead of you there, bro--how about if I invite him to come out tonight with Daria and me to the <i>Zen</i> to listen to you guys? You can thank him there, and he can hear your, um--<i>debut</i> song to thank your <i>"Mysterious Benefactor".</i></p>

<p>TRENT: Good idea, Janey--I'm gonna go down to the Zen with the guys for another final practice--<i>(looks up, raises voice, shakes fist:)</i> and then the <i>return</i> of Mystik Spiral will be back in full force! <i>(Coughs)</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Shakes her head slowly, smirks, thought v.o.: And may <b>God</b> help us all.)</i> Okay, bro--we'll see you then. <i>(Trent leaves while Jane sits back down at her dresser and keeps combing her hair)</i></p>


<p><i>(Scene is back at the Morgendorffer's, about ten minutes later)</i></p>


     <p>Darren had goten out of the shower and had changed into some more sweatclothes, this time a gray shirt and pants. He was on his cell phone in his room talking to Curtis.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(In a no-nonsense tone:) --Curtis</i>, I won't <i>argue</i> the point on why I <i>still</i> can't tell the Morgendorffers who I really am, okay? You've got to <i>trust</i> me on this!</p> 

<p>CURTIS: But you haven't told <i>me</i> why you've <i>suddenly</i> changed your mind, bud!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Tries to stay calm:) I-told-you-to-trust-me--</i> I can't say anything more! <i>Please</i>!</p>

<p>CURTIS: <i>(After a long pause, sounding curt:) Fine</i>. I guess you know what you're <i>doing</i>. It's <i>your</i> life, after all. <i>(Suddenly hangs up)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Curtis, wait! I--<i>(stares forward, narrows eyes:) damn</i>! <i>(Thought v.o.: Wonderful--fantastic--that's just <b>great</b>. Risk losing my best friend over something like this--better find something <b>soon</b>, Woo.) (Clicks off, then clicks on cell phone again, punches some numbers)</i></p>


<p><i>(Scene changes to the Appleton estate)</i></p>


     <p>Elenor had just finished cleaning the study from the <i>party</i> William had hosted there last night, and she had <i>hated</i> to be around his so-called <i>"associates"</i> with their constant <i>lewd</i> behavior and <i>drunkeness</i>. She secretly wished that she could hear <i>something</i> from Master Darren or Mistress Millie, for she missed them not being around--for that matter, <i>all</i> of the staff missed them. The mansion just wasn't the same without them--it seemed big and empty.</p>

     <p>Elenor suddenly frowned to herself. Now <i>just a minute</i>--wasn't it <i>selfish</i> to think like that? After all Master Darren had gone through, wasn't he <i>entitled</i> to some time off to be with his "birth" family? Of <i>course</i> he was, the same for Mistress Millie and her vacation. <i>Foolish thinking, Elenor--how could you think like that about them--or only about yourself</i>? She quickly lost herself in thought, cleaning the endtables in the family room, when the phone that was on the one she was cleaning rang. She answered it on the first ring.</p>


<p>ELENOR: This is the Appleton estate. Who is speaking?</p>

<p>VOICE: <i>(Sounding coy:)</i> I'll give you <i>one</i> guess, Elenor.</p>

<p>ELENOR: <i>(Eyes light up, sounding estatic:) Master Darren</i>! <i>(Sees Claude walking by in the foyer:)</i> Claude! It's Master Darren calling! <i>(Claude grins, comes over to the phone, leans to hear in it with Elenor)</i> Oh, Master Darren--it seems like it has been <i>so</i> long since you've been here--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Chuckling sound:)</i> --I know, Elenor, Claude--and I'm <i>sorry</i> for not calling sooner. It's just been so <i>hectic</i> since I came here to stay with my birth parents and sisters for a while.</p>

<p>ELENOR: <i>(Gasps, delighted:)</i> So, you <i>have</i> gotten to know them <i>well</i>, Master Darren? That's <i>wonderful</i>!</p>

<p>CLAUDE: <i>(Speaks over Elenor's shoulder into the phone, happy as well:)</i> Indeed it <i>is</i>, sir!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Now heard laughing:)</i> Thank you--I miss <i>all</i> of you as well, you know.</p>

<p>ELENOR: <i>(Hesitates:)</i> Do you--do you know <i>when</i> you'll be back, Master Darren?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(After a pause, then speaks:)</i> Just about two weeks before Eastward starts--before registration--maybe a little sooner, Elenor, I really can't say for sure.</p>

<p>ELENOR: <i>(Sounding quiet, looks at Claude:)</i> I see. <i>(Lightens up her tone:)</i> Mistress Millie called yesterday, and said she was having a wonderful time in Europe.</p>

<p>DARREN: Yes, uncle Will told me she did, and for that matter, I'm relieved for her. <i>(After a pause:)</i> So, is--everything <i>okay</i> there, you two? <i>(Tries to sound nonchalant, worrying privately about Woo's warning, doesn't want to alarm Elenor or Claude:)</i> You know, the same, old <i>boring</i> sort of stuff that usually happens around the place?</p>

<p>ELENOR: <i>(Makes a disgusted face, rolls her eyes:)</i> Well, Master Darren, we've had some of those <i>wretched</i> reporters try and ask us <i>where</i> you were, but we've told them nothing--</p>

<p>CLAUDE: <i>(Cuts her off, speaks into the phone over Elenor's shoulder:)</i>--We've even had one try and <i>infiltrate</i> the staff to find out where you were! <i>(Frowns:)</i> The absolute <i>nerve</i> of that fellow to say he was one of the <i>groundskeepers</i>! <i>(Darren is heard laughing on the other end)</i> I am <i>proud</i> to say he did not get too far on the grounds before security escorted him off!</p>

<p>DARREN: Excellent work, you two--<i>(is heard sighing:)</i> still, I know it's only a matter of <i>time</i> before they find out what's going on. Just <i>try</i> to hold the "dogs" off a little longer, okay? <i>(Knocking is heard on the other end, Darren has now lowered his voice:)</i> I think one of my birth family members wants to come in. Take care, you two, tell the rest of the staff that I called, and that I'm okay--and--<i>thanks</i>.</p>

<p>ELENOR & CLAUDE: Goodbye, Master Darren! Godspeed, sir! <i>(Elenor hangs up, smiles along with Claude)</i></p>



     <p>Darren quickly clicked off his cell phone and opened his door. He saw a smiling Helen.</p>


<p>DARREN: Hey--sorry, I was on my phone talking to some friends. What's up?</p>

<p>HELEN: That's all right, son. I just wanted to tell you that <i>Jane</i> is downstairs in the living room with Daria and everyone else, waiting for you.</p> 

<p>DARREN: Thanks. <i>(Leaves his room with Helen)</i></p>


<p><i>(The scene is downstairs, at the same time)</i></p>


     <p>Jane had come in, and was waiting for Darren, standing in the middle of the living room with Daria. Jake and Quinn were sitting on the right side couch, watching them. Daria noticed that her friend seemed a bit <i>impatient</i>. Daria cocked an eyebrow at her behavior, curious.</p>


<p>DARIA: You <i>really</i> want to meet my bro pretty <i>badly</i>, don't you?</p> 


<p>JANE: <i>(Now arches her eyebrow at Daria, smirks:)</i> Why <i>shouldn't</i> I, Daria? He's your <i>"Big Bro"</i>, and he <i>sav--(pauses, sighs:)</i> look, you'll find out <i>soon</i> enough.</p>


     <p>Darren came down the stairs behind Helen, and saw a thin, but lithe-shaped young woman, a little taller than Daria, who was standing beside her in the center of the living room. She had short, almost shoulder-length black hair that had been styled with one side <i>slightly</i> longer than the other, and was wearing three earrings in each ear. The young woman wore a red jacket that had its sleeves rolled up to her elbows, and it was worn over a black tee-shirt. She wore short, black pants over black stockings, and had on tall, black Doc Marten boots that were even <i>bigger</i> than Daria's. Darren smirked slightly at this young lady, who he knew <i>had</i> to be Jane--no <i>wonder</i> she and Daria became friends--they seemed to have a similar <i>fashion</i> sense that they shared, as well as a similar view of <i>society</i>. He casually, but quickly allowed a thought to come into his mind as she turned to him--Jane was <i>attractive</i>. Tom was a <i>lucky</i> guy. Darren grinned as he approached Jane, extending his hand.</p>

     <p>Jane turned to see the <i>"newest"</i> member of her best friend's family, and needless to say, was <i>stunned</i>. Her eyes bulged wide-open, and her mouth was agape. This guy was--<i>gorgeous</i>. His reddish-brown hair was thick and wavy. His eyes were a deep blue, and he was quite the athletic <i>specimen</i>, judging by his looks. He wore a gray sweatsuit that covered his body, but it <i>still</i> couldn't quite hide Darren's <i>physique</i>--not that she was <i>complaining</i>. He was not completely as athletic-looking as say, <i>Jesse</i>, but taller, and definitely more built than--than, yeah--<i>Tom</i>. Darren came up to Jane with a sincere <i>grin</i> that could've <i>melted</i> the heart of just about any female, with those <i>perfect-looking</i> straight white teeth he was showing. She quickly snapped out her trance when Darren spoke, reached out and shook his hand.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks down at her:)</i> Hey Jane, sans the mud, right? <i>(Jane nods, smirking)</i> How are you doing?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Looks up at him, now smiles:)</i> I'm--<i>okay</i>, Darren. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Uh--I've called the police, and they've sealed off the landfill area.</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Cocks her eyebrow, curious:)</i> The <i>landfill</i>? <i>(Narrows her eyes, puts her hands on her hips:)</i> All right, you two--we've been patient up to now, so tell us what happened.</p>


     <p>Then and there, Darren and Jane explained about the sinkhole incident.</p>


<p>JANE: --And if it wasn't for Darren, <i>(looks quietly over at him:)</i> I wouldn't be here now. <i>(Darren looks uncomfortable a bit with everyone staring at him in admiration)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Becomes proud of her son, looks as if she's about to cry:)</i> Oh, Darren! <i>(Hugs him:)</i> That was so <i>brave</i> of you to do that for Jane!</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Even more proud, jumps up and hugs his son in a <b>python-type</b> of grip:) Damn</i> straight it was, son! You've done us proud! My boy!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Struggles to breathe:)</i> Thanks--a--lot--now--can--you--let--me--go,--please? <i>(Jake releases him while grinning, Darren takes a big breath inward)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Delighted, jumps up to hug her brother:)</i> Oh, <i>wow</i>! Wait'll the <i>Fashion Club</i> hears about this--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks while hiding her relief that her friend is all right:)</i> --I'm sure they'll want to hear how your <i>"cousin"</i> saved Jane's life, sis. <i>(Jane smirks, while Helen and Jake look at each other in confusion, and Darren glances at Quinn with an unreadable look, then a curious Helen and Jake look at a now-nervous Quinn)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Quickly plays it off, glares at Daria:) Ha</i>, Daria--very funny <i>joke</i> there! <i>(Looks at her watch:)</i> Well, I gotta meet the Fashion Club at Sandi's house, you guys! <i>(Kisses Darren on the cheek:)</i> Good work, bro! See you all later--glad to see you're okay, Jane! <i>(Quickly leaves out of the front door, slams it after her before Helen can say anything)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Looks in Quinn's direction, in her deadpan tone:)</i> And so goes our resident little <i>"getter-outta-troubler". (Everyone looks at Daria strangely)</i> Hey, I think I'm entitled to <i>make up</i> a word every once in awhile--Quinn does it <i>all</i> the time.</p> 

<p>HELEN: <i>(Looks at Daria, exasperated:)</i> Daria-- <i>(Picks up her cell phone:)</i> I'd better see if Eric needs anything <i>else</i> for me to do Monday--you know, looking out for any new <i>cases</i> that might've cropped up while I was out--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> --Yeah, I heard that the <i>ambulance drivers</i> need a <i>new</i> chaser, Mom--we wouldn't want to <i>disappoint</i> them now, would we? <i>(Darren struggles not to laugh while Jane smirks)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Gives a "You're really pushing it, young lady" glare:) Daria</i>--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Gets the message:)</i>--We're gone to Jane's. C'mon, guys. <i>(Leaves with Jane and Darren)</i></p>

     
     <p>The three just got out of the house when Daria held out her arms, stopping them both. Darren and Jane looked at each other, confused.</p>


<p>DARREN: Sis, is something <i>wrong</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Looks around quickly, then gives Darren a slight smile:) Nah</i>--I just wanted to <i>thank</i> you for saving Jane's life--and I didn't want to do it in <i>front</i> of our parents--<i>personal reputation</i> and all, you know.</p> 

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:)</i> In <i>other</i> words, you can't let them see that the <i>"Great Stoneface"</i> that is one Daria Morgendorffer is beginning to really <i>appreciate</i> having a brother, because if your parents <i>do</i>, they'll try and <i>tear down</i> those super-duper high walls that you've created for yourself around them? <i>(Darren smiles at this)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan, smirks at Jane:)</i> Welcome back, <i>"Partner In Crime"</i>--now, when are you going to <i>leave</i> again? Oh, I know--by the <i>seat</i> of your pants from the front of my boot <i>buried</i> in your <i>ass. (Darren grins at the verbal exchange between the two)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks at Daria softly:)</i> You're welcome, sis. <i>(Pauses, looks at both girls, motions in the direction of the Lane's home:)</i> Shall we proceed to Jane's? <i>(Jane gets a <b>wicked</b> smirk on her face)</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Suddenly <b>hooks</b> her arm with a surprised Darren's, something that causes Daria to do a double-take when she notices it)</i> Let's go, good sir--our <i>destiny</i> awaits! <i>(Leaves with him, while Daria follows them with a quick, slightly perplexed expression)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to the Appleton Industries West coast branch legal office, the same time)</i></p>


     <p>Woo came into the large, carpeted glass and concrete reception area and greeted the female receptionist, who put a moving box down on her desk.</p>


<p>WOO: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Hello, I'm Gerald Woo. I believe Mr. Potter is expecting me.</p>

<p>RECEPTIONIST: Yes, Mr. Woo, he is. One moment, please. <i>(Clicks on her desk speaker:)</i> Mr. Potter, Mr. Woo is here to see you.</p>

<p>POTTER: <i>(On speaker:)</i> Very good--send him in.</p>

<p>RECEPTIONIST: Go on in, Mr. Woo--just be careful of the <i>boxes</i> in Mr. Potter's office--he's still moving in. <i>(Points down the hall:)</i> Go through that double-door about three doors down on the left.</p>

<p>WOO: Thank you, I will. <i>(Goes down the hall)</i></p>



     <p>Woo walked into the office and immediately saw what the receptionist was talking about. There were moving boxes, some opened, some unopened, of all sizes strewn about all over the floor and on Potter's desk and the chairs sitting in front of his desk. Packing paper was protruding out of some of the opened boxes. In the middle of the office, Leonard Potter was on his knees, taking out some law books. He saw Woo, and got up. Leonard came over to Woo, smiled, and shook his hand.</p>



<p>LEONARD: Hello, Mr. Woo--<i>(makes a sweeping motion around his office:)</i> sorry about the <i>mess</i> in here. I just came in yesterday, and decided to come in on the weekend to try and get as much unpacking done as possible, and my secretary volunteered to help me out. You've done some work for Appleton <i>before</i>, haven't you?</p>

<p>WOO: Thank you for meeting me this early, Mr. Potter, It's just <i>Woo</i>, and I did do some investigative work for your company concerning some company securities fraud, I believe. William Appleton <i>hired</i> me.</p>

<p>LEONARD: <i>(Ponders:)</i> Yes, I remember--and please call me <i>Leonard. (Pauses:)</i> So, why are you here?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Pulls out a pen and pad, starts to write:)</i> Actually, Leonard, I'm working on a case that I'd prefer to keep <i>confidential</i> for now--the same as to <i>who</i> hired me. At the moment, I want to ask <i>why</i> did Mr. Appleton send you out here?</p> 

<p>LEONARD: <i>(Thinks about what Woo has said, then decides to answer:)</i> The <i>official</i> story is that I <i>"volunteered"</i> to come out here--<i>(frowns:) bull. (Countinues to unpack his law books while talking:)</i> You see, William Appleton didn't <i>appreciate</i> me having the <i>audacity</i> to actually do my <i>job</i>. He felt that I was <i>"hindering"</i> his decision-making efforts concerning the company legally, so he decided to ship me out here in <i>no-man's land</i>, where there's <i>less</i> legal work to do. <i>(Pauses, looks at Woo:)</i> Uh, <i>no</i> offense about the "no-man's land" term--with your <i>living</i> out here, and all.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Smirks, keeps writing:)</i> No problem, Leonard--sometimes I feel like I actually <i>am</i> in a "no-man's land" here, what, with all the <i>smog, fires, mudslides, and earthquakes</i>. So, William Appleton sent you out here because you were getting in his <i>"way"</i>?</p>

<p>LEONARD: <i>(Shrugs while taking out more books:)</i> That about sums it up.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Stops writing for a moment:)</i> I heard that you two <i>didn't</i> get along well, and there were some <i>rumors</i> that Arthur Appleton Sr. had to sometimes keep both of you from a <i>physical</i> confrontation. Is that <i>true</i>?</p>

<p>LEONARD: <i>(Chuckles:)</i> We had only <i>one</i> such incident, Woo--though there were times that I <i>did</i> want to <i>"clean" William's "clock"</i>, sort to speak. You see, as much as I <i>hate</i> to admit it, William Appleton is a <i>brilliant</i> businessman--the problem with him is that he thinks he should be in charge of <i>everything</i>, making <i>all</i> the decisions, having everybody <i>cater</i> to his <i>whims</i>. He <i>always</i> was like that, but on a much <i>smaller</i> scale--<i>(pauses, frowns in perplexity for a moment:)</i> until about a little over a <i>year</i> ago.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Narrows his eyes:)</i> Why more than a <i>year</i> ago, Leonard?</p> 

<p>LEONARD: It was after the <i>annual stockholder's meeting</i> last year in the Florida Keys. <i>(Woo cocks an eyebrow, remembers his conversation with Darren about the same event when they first talked to each other)</i> William seemed--I don't know--<i>changed</i> for some reason. He became more <i>agressive</i>, more of a <i>bully</i>--like he had some sort of a <i>chip</i> on his shoulder, and that everybody had <i>damn</i> well better get <i>used</i> to it. It was like he <i>knew</i> something that no one else knew, not even <i>Arthur Sr.</i> knew what was wrong with him. Once, I heard after a meeting that Arthur Sr. asked William what was going on with his <i>"attitude"</i>. William simply looked at him with something of a <i>sneer</i> and said, <i>"As if you <b>didn't</b> know"</i>, and just left it at that. Arthur couldn't for the <i>life</i> of him figure out what was going on, and said nothing more. William eventually kind of <i>leveled</i> off, enough to keep Arthur Sr. from asking anymore questions, but <i>not</i> back to what he <i>used</i> to be <i>before</i> the shareholder's meeting.</p>


     <p>Woo thought about this for a moment, wrote in his pad, then continued.</p>


<p>WOO: I see. I'm surprised that you didn't go to the Board of Directors and <i>protest</i> William Appleton's decision.</p> 

<p>LEONARD: <i>(Snorts:)</i> Oh, William <i>knew</i> what he was doing with this situation--if I <i>protested</i>, he'd simply say that I <i>refused</i> to go along with the transferal--and that he had <i>no</i> choice but to <i>fire</i> me. He'd be in the <i>"right"</i>, I in the <i>"wrong"</i>, and the Board could see nothing done except me not wanting to do my job.</p>

<p>WOO: Why not <i>quit</i>?</p>

<p>LEONARD: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow at Woo, as if you say, "Are you kidding me?":)</i> And give him the <i>satisfaction</i> that he had <i>beaten</i> me? No way in <i>hell</i> was I going to allow him to do that! <i>(Starts to take out more books:)</i> I'm going to <i>bide</i> my time. I think eventually, William's going to <i>fall</i> anyway.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Raised eyebrows:) Fall</i>? Why?</p>

<p>LEONARD: He's become too <i>paranoid</i> for his own good, Woo--being on top has made him just about <i>jump</i> at every<i>one</i> and every<i>thing</i>. He's convinced <i>Constance Waters</i> is out to get his job--<i>(shrugs:)</i> not that I can <i>blame</i> him in a way. She's quite <i>good</i> in her job. <i>(Pauses, narrows his eyes:)</i> I just hope he <i>does</i> go after her.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Startled:)</i> You <i>do</i>? Why?</p>

<p>LEONARD: To the Board, she's become the <i>darling</i> of the divisional chiefs, thanks to a recent <i>coup</i> over getting a share of a foriegn company. I wonder would would happen if William tries to do something like <i>move</i> her to some other area--you know, like he did <i>me</i>. In Constance's case, however, she poses more of a <i>direct</i> threat to him. The Board could take note and move <i>against</i> William.</p>  

<p>WOO: <i>(Frowns, thinks:)</i> Hmm--what do you think of the man who <i>replaced</i> you on the East coast legal branch, <i>Sam Norwood</i>? I read about it in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> business section last night.</p>

<p>LEONARD: <i>(Rolls his eyes:) Please</i>. All personal <i>bias</i> aside, it's a <i>well-known</i> fact that Norwood worked for <i>organized crime</i> once by representing several <i>crime lords</i> during their trials. I wouldn't be surprised if William didn't <i>pay</i> a so-called <i>"prestigious"</i> law firm money to take Norwood and make him <i>"legit"</i>--either that, or <i>blackmailed</i> them in some way. From what I heard, the Board looked into it, and <i>nothing</i> illegal was found. <i>(Snorts:)</i> William covered his tracks well.</p> 

<p>WOO: <i>(Still writes:)</i> Okay, <i>one</i> more question--in addition to being the executor of the reading of the business will, did you <i>write</i> it up as well?</p>

<p>LEONARD: Yes, I did. Arthur and Lucille worked with me--I was also their <i>personal</i> lawyer, and in case your wondering, <i>no</i> one else knew what was <i>in</i> that will except them and me.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Finishes up his writing, takes pad, flips it closed, and puts it and his pen back in his pocket:)</i> Thank you, Leonard--I may be in touch with you again. <i>(Shakes Leonard's hand)</i></p>

<p>LEONARD: My pleasure--<i>(pauses:)</i> do you mind if I ask <i>you</i> a question?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Gives a quick shrug:)</i> You may do so.</p>

<p>LEONARD: I understand your position of <i>confidentiality</i> concerning your case and client, since I am a lawyer. Based on your questions concerning <i>William Appleton</i>, however, may I <i>assume</i> that you think he's done something <i>wrong</i>, or at least that you <i>suspect</i> he's done something wrong?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Ponders for a moment:)</i> To be honest with you, Leonard, I'm not quite sure if Mr. Appleton's done <i>anything</i> wrong--<i>(then adds as an afterthought:)</i> at least not <i>yet</i>. I <i>can</i> say, however, that he <i>is</i> on my list, and that the information that you just supplied me with <i>will</i> help me decide where to go from here--on <i>some</i> things.</p>

<p>LEONARD: <i>(After a moment, nods head:)</i> All right. <i>(Pauses:)</i> I suppose that'll do--for <i>now</i>. Call me <i>anytime</i> at work, Woo--with the <i>so-called</i> "workload" that is here right now, I think I'll have <i>plenty</i> of time to <i>twiddle</i> my thumbs. <i>(Escorts Woo to the door)</i></p>

<p>WOO: I will, Leonard--and thank you again for your cooperation. <i>(Opens door:)</i> Goodbye.</p>

<p>LEONARD: Goodbye, Woo. <i>(Watches him go down the hall, then goes back into his office)</i></p>


     <p>At that moment, a sinister-looking tall, red-haired thin man, wearing small dark glasses, and with a small, red goatee in a black Armani suit came from around the corner on the opposite end of the hall from the receptionist. He watched Woo leave, looked slowly at Leonard Potter's office, then quietly slipped back around the corner.</p>



<p><i>(Scene is back at the Lane's home in Lawndale, Jane's room)</i></p>



     <p>Jane was showing Daria and Darren her art done from Jane's trip with her mother, as well as some of her current art. While Daria and Darren were looking at the work--Native American pottery, and Native American portraits in the abstract, Jane was finishing unpacking her clothes from her vacation. Darren was clearly impressed, mostly with Jane's paintings.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Sounding excited, looking at one of Jane's paintings:)</i> Jane, this is <i>terrific</i>! Your emotions on <i>this</i> painting really come out <i>at</i> me! <i>(Pauses, raises an eyebrow, looks at Jane:)</i> I'm assuming you have some of your art on <i>display</i> somewhere--?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Feels pleased that her work is being appreciated:)</i> Thanks for the compliment Darren, and yep--at least <i>some</i>. A couple of pieces are in the county art museum. There are also several art shops around the area that I have paintings in, and have <i>sold</i> some as well.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Jane's pretty <i>well known</i> around here--<i>art-wise</i>, that is. Soon, I expect some of her work will be <i>so</i> well-known, it'll be <i>stolen. (Darren laughs, while Jane smirks)</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Snorts, rolls her eyes playfully:)</i> I <i>wish</i>. Right now, any potential thief would probably just pick it up, look at it, turn it upside down, and put it <i>back</i>. I'll never make the <i>news</i> if <i>that</i> happens.</p>


     <p>Darren looked around, and saw Jane's abstract painting of <i>Tom</i> laying in a corner of her room. He went over to it, looked at Jane to get her approval to pick it up, which she gave by a quick nod and smirk, gingerly picked it up by its sides, and looked at it. Daria was about to say who it was, but Jane motioned to her to say <i>nothing</i> by giving a somewhat-surprised Daria a <i>sharp</i> look. Darren was too engrossed into the painting to notice the exchange. After about a minute of silence, he put it carefully back down, and looked at Jane curiously.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Motions his head at the painting:)</i> That's <i>Tom</i>, isn't it?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smiles at Darren, grows quiet:)</i> Yeah, it is. <i>How'd</i> you know?</p>

<p>DARREN: Well, based on the <i>care</i> you put in the detail of your <i>brushstrokes</i>, and the <i>facial features</i> that, while not evident at <i>first</i>, slowly come <i>out</i> of the painting, and form a rather <i>handsome</i> face. <i>(Jane gets a smug look of approval on her face)</i> It's quite clear, Jane, you put a <i>lot</i> of work in this painting. <i>(Looks back at the painting:)</i> I'm <i>sure</i> Tom really <i>appreciated</i> it, am I right?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Now <b>frowns</b>, while Darren is looking at the painting:)</i> Well, to tell you the <i>truth</i>--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Cuts her off:)</i> --It, um, took Tom a <i>little</i> while to see what Jane had done, but once he <i>did</i>, he understood <i>what</i> it was. <i>(Jane looks at Daria, a little miffed)</i></p>


     <p>Darren caught on to Daria's cutting off Jane and the subsequent baffled looks both were giving to one another, but said nothing more. Whatever it was, probably <i>about</i> Tom, he decided that it was <i>none</i> of his concern--God knows he had <i>enough</i> things on his mind already. Perhaps the two needed to talk--time to use an <i>excuse</i>. After an awkward silence for a moment, Darren spoke.</p>


<p>DARREN: Ah--I need to use your bathroom, Jane. Where--?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Cocks her head at her door:)</i> Second door on the left in the hallway.</p>

<p>DARREN: Thank you. <i>(Leaves the room. Daria quietly follows Darren to the door, watches him go into the bathroom, shuts the bedroom door)</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Looks suspiciously at Daria:)</i> Why'd you cut me <i>off</i> like that?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Gives Jane the same look:)</i> I could ask you the <i>same</i> thing.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Hey, <i>I</i> wanted to know if your bro had a good <i>eye</i> for art--you know, if he could tell whether or not if that was Tom, and he did--<i>(frowns:) unlike</i> Tom--<i>(cocks an eyebrow:) you</i>--?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Frowns:) I</i> didn't want Darren to get <i>drawn</i> into your <i>troubles</i> with Tom like I felt <i>I've</i> been, that's all. <i>(Pauses, goes into a serious tone:)</i> Look, Jane--Darren's really been through a lot of <i>hell</i> lately, and I just thought that he needed a <i>break</i> from getting into the middle of something <i>else</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Who now frowns herself, starts to raise her voice:) Look</i>, I--<i>(sighs, lowers her tone:)</i> Daria, I <i>wasn't</i> trying to get Darren into <i>anything</i>, okay? I <i>know</i> he's been through everything under the sun because of the deaths of his adopted parents, <i>whatever</i> happened to them, and the adoption story he told me about--I <i>know</i> I don't want to add any <i>additional</i> grief to what he's gone through, so give me a <i>little</i> credit, okay? It's just that he's gonna <i>know</i> something's up when Tom comes in, and that we're <i>not</i> getting along. I figured that he might as well know about it <i>now</i>, and not <i>later</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Narrows her eyes:)</i> You talk as if you <i>don't</i> expect to get back with Tom at <i>all</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Snorts:)</i> Hey, I'm just being <i>realistic</i>, okay? Remember, Tom <i>left</i> town on <i>his</i> vacation with his friends <i>knowing</i> when I was supposed to come in, and then had the sheer <i>gall</i> to leave the message on his <i>damn</i> now-fixed answering machine, and this after he had <i>begged</i> to ask me to give him another chance!</p>

<p>DARIA: Yes, and you said you'd give him a <i>chance</i> to <i>explain</i> himself. <i>(Pauses:)</i> I'd <i>damn</i> well would like to hear his explanation, too, if you must know--I'm just asking you to <i>not</i> say anything to Darren until <i>after</i> you talk to Tom, okay?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(After staring at Daria for a second:)</i> Sure, okay--but don't expect me to <i>pretend</i> that everything's <i>"hunky-dory"</i> with Tom if Darren asks me about him--<i>deal</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Stares at Jane, sighs:)</i> I suppose that'll <i>have</i> to do--<i>deal</i>.</p>


     <p>There was a knock on the door. Daria opened it, and Darren came in. He could feel a slight <i>tension</i> in the air between the two. Darren paused for a moment, looked at the two, then decided to cut through the tension.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Starts to smile:)</i> Say, I'm hungry. <i>(Looks at his watch:)</i> It's about noontime--anybody want some <i>pizza</i>?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks at Darren:)</i> Daria, your bro's a man after my <i>own</i> heart.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks as well:) Tell</i> me about it. Are <i>you</i> treating, bro?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Of course.</p>

<P>JANE: <I>(Realizes something, snaps her fingers, looks between Daria and Darren:)</I> Oh, yeah! I meant to ask that if Darren has nothing to do tonight, that maybe he could come with you Daria, to the Zen to listen to Mystik Spiral play together for the first time since they had lost their instruments and the original Tank. Trent, who's there now practicing with the guys, wants to thank you for saving me, and he wants you to listen with everybody else the song he and Jesse have been working on, thanking Mystik Spiral's <I>"Mysterious Benefactor". (Walks up slowly to Darren, looks up at him <b>intently</b>, smiles--something that causes Daria to raise her eyebrow ever-so-slightly:)</i> Say that you'll <i>come</i>--?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Ponders, looks down at Jane:) Weeell</i>--I <i>was</i> going to read a book and have a quiet evening at home--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:) --Definitely</i> a man after <i>my</i> own heart--no <i>damn</i> doubts about it now--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks at Daria:)</i> --but since <i>Daria's</i> going, I guess I can go, too.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Swings her fist, triumphant, gets into her "Delores" tone:) Supoirb, kid</i>--see ya at 7:00 tonight?</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Laughs:)</i> 7:00 tonight, it is. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Now, as for that <i>pizza</i>--?</p>

<p>JANE: You guys wanna go to the Pizza King, or call in?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:)</i> Call in this time--let them <i>"come to us".</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Gets her cell phone:)</i> Okay. <i>(Starts to call:)</i> What do you guys want on your pizzas?</p> 

<p>DARIA: You know, and Darren does as well, that I like pepperoni, cheese, and sausage pizza--</p>

<p>JANE: (Smirks:) --With a scoop of <i>ice cream</i> covered with <i>chocolate sauce</i> on top?</p> 

<p>DARIA: You're confusing me with that scruffy-haired, thin kid that has a <i>Great Dane</i> as a pet, and rides in a <i>goofy-looking</i> van with his friends--</p>

<p><i>(Note to reader: This is a sly homage to one Crazy Nutso's downright funny fic, "Daria, Where Are You?")</i></p>

<p>JANE: --<i>Trent and Mystik Spiral</i>? <i>(Darren is amused by this exchange)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:)</i> There's <i>no</i> Great Dane dog with Mystik Spiral, Jane--</p>

<p>JANE: --Unless <i>Jesse</i> is on all <i>fours</i>--and believe me when I said I've seen it <i>before. (Begins to talk on the phone:)</i> Yeah, Pizza King--?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> I don't <i>even</i> want to know. Hey, I'm going to use the bathroom myself--be right back. <i>(Gets ready to leave)</i></p>

<p>JANE: --Right, with sausage, and--wait a second--<i>(looks at Daria just as she's about to leave the room:)</i> Daria, Darren and I will be downstairs in the living room when you come out, okay?</p>

<p>DARIA: Yeah, okay. <i>(Leaves)</i></p>


     <p>Darren watched Daria leave, and then waited for Jane to finish ordering the pizzas on her phone. Both went downstairs to the Lane's living room, and sat on the sofa. He looked at Jane, hesitating to speak for a for a moment. Jane caught his reluctance, and took the initiative.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:) Sooo</i>--you wanna <i>ask</i> me something, Darren? <i>(Thought v.o.: Is he going to ask me about <b>Tom</b>?)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Well, yes, I meant to ask this earlier with you on our way back from the landfill--it kind of got lost in all the <i>"excitement"</i>--but does Daria <i>like</i> Trent? She told me when we left here the first time that her <i>crush</i> on him was in <i>remission</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Surprised look on her face:) Whoa</i>--she actually <i>told</i> you she <i>had</i> a crush on my bro? <i>(Smirks:)</i> Well, now--<i>I</i> never heard her so much as <i>admit</i> it to me before--I'd only <i>seen</i> it in action with all the <i>blushing</i> and stuff when Daria was around Trent at times, at least in the early days. Yeah, she <i>did</i>--and to a certain degree, <i>still</i> does--<i>(narrows her eyes, looks off:)</i> I <i>think, (frowns:)</i> though I'm still not quite <i>sure</i> anymore. You see, about the same time I met--<i>(pauses:) Tom</i>, Daria and I had a school project to do, and we enlisted Trent's help. Trent said he'd have his part ready, but when the time came, he didn't come through for us. Trent had always, <i>bless</i> his heart, been something of a <i>slacker</i>, but Daria basically looked <i>past</i> my bro's faults. When he didn't do his part to <i>help</i> us, well, Daria kind of <i>drifted away</i> from him for awhile because I think she realized his, um, <i>shortcomings</i>. Add that to the fact that Tom and I <i>(frowns slightly:) liked</i> one another, taking away some of her time usually spent with me, and Daria was generally <i>miserable</i> for a time. I don't think she's <i>ever</i> gotten over Trent <i>completely</i>--<i>(pauses, hesitates:)</i> but I <i>could</i> be wrong--with <i>Daria</i>, one can't be too sure. Only recently has she come out of her <i>funk</i>--that and the fact that Trent <i>finally</i> seems to be taking his musical career <i>really</i> seriously in a positive direction, thanks to the <i>"Mysterious Benefactor"</i>--a new push from my bro that <i>hasn't</i> been lost on Daria. <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Of course, she might just be trying to <i>encourage</i> Trent in his musical career, and nothing more, who knows? <i>(Suddenly gives Darren a sheepish, apologetic look:) Sorry</i>, that's the <i>best</i> I can do.</p>

<p><i>(Note to reader: Of course, the "school project" thing, Tom, and Trent's "slacking" happened in the episode "Jane's Addition")</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Er--<i>thank you</i> for <i>"clearing"</i> that up, Jane. <i>(Jane grins:)</i> Um--so does Trent have <i>any</i> feelings for <i>Daria</i>?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> I <i>thought</i> I heard him say to her once that if Daria was a year older, 18, he'd <i>take</i> her out. But when I asked him <i>and</i> Daria, they <i>denied</i> it was real--though to Trent, it seemed to be more of a <i>joke</i>--Daria kind of <i>brushed</i> it off, too. <i>(Note to reader: Trent's statement <b>did</b> happen at the end of the episode "Lane Miserables")</i> Other than that, he seems <i>oblivious</i> to her crush on him. <i>(Gets a <b>scheming</b> look on her face:)</i> Hey, maybe if you <i>helped</i> me--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Cuts her off, shakes his head:) --Uh-uh, no way</i>, Jane--Daria lived her life <i>waaay</i> before I came into it. I want to see her <i>happy</i>, but <i>she's</i> got to make her <i>own</i> decisions, the same for <i>Quinn</i>. If she <i>asks</i> me what I think, I'll give her advice from <i>my</i> relationship with--<i>(stops, realizes he's said too much, looks away for a moment:)</i> er--as her "Big Bro", the only thing I can offer is to be there for her for <i>support</i>.</p>


     <p>Jane cocked an eyebrow at Darren for an <i>instant</i>--he had <i>almost</i> let something out about who she assumed to be his <i>girlfriend</i>, but stopped at the last second--she wondered <i>why</i> he did. For some reason, that near-admission made her feel--<i>disappointed</i>. She guessed he was <i>already</i> spoken for. Hey--where'd <i>that</i> thought come from? Jane quickly shook it from her mind as Daria entered the living room from upstairs. Darren gave a sudden, urgent look at Jane, ever-so-slightly shaking his head at her as if to say, <i>"Keep this talk between us, okay"</i>? Jane gave her own slight, quick nod at Darren, confirming her silence on the matter. Daria, not noticing the subtle jestures between the two, sat down between them on the sofa.</p>
 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Crosses her arms:)</i> Well, while we're waiting for the pizza, why don't we watch some TV?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Gets the remote from the coffee table:)</i> Good idea--I think <i>Sick, Sad World</i> has a midday Saturday afternoon special. <i>(Clicks on TV)</i></p>


     <p>As if on cue, the <i>Sick, Sad World</i> eyeball logo came on the TV screen, and the announcer spoke.</p>


<p>TV ANNOUNCER: <i>(While theme music is playing:)</i> Are some of the <i>trees</i> in your yard actually <i>secret alien beings</i> that are in <i>hibernation</i>, and intend to <i>wake up and take over</i> our planet some day? A <i>Sick, Sad World</i> exclusive, next!</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Laughs at the screen, smiles at Jane:)</i> So you like that <i>funny</i> show too, eh?</p> 

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks at Darren:) Umm-hmm. (Pauses:)</i> So, um--have you seen <i>Sick, Sad World</i> a lot, Darren?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Gives a quick shrug:)</i> Some, though not much, although if I'm watching TV, and I run across it while channel-surfing, I'll stay with it--like I told Daria, I've seen it a <i>few</i> times.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan, lies back, puts her feet on the coffee table in front of the couch:)</i> Nothing like pizza and <i>Sick, Sad World</i> to pass the day away--other than reading a book and writing, that is. <i>(Smirks:)</i> The rest of the whole damn world can do whatever the hell it wants.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Does the same thing as Daria:) Amen</i> to that, sister. <i>(Darren shakes his head slowly as he looks at them and chuckles to himself)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: I suppose everybody has their <i>"priorities". (Sits back on the sofa and watches the TV, but unlike Daria and Jane, doesn't put his legs on the coffee table)</i></p>


<p><i>(Scene changes to the Griffin home, at the same time)</i></p>


     <p>Quinn sat in the living room on a couch with Stacy, while Sandi and Tiffany were standing. Sandi was pointing out the clothes Tiffany was wearing--a white, short-sleeved cotton blouse, with a white "skort".</p>


<p>SANDI: <i>(While making a sweeping jesture at Tiffany:)</i> --And that is, like the way to wear a summer blouse, according to <i>Waif</i> in their summer edition.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(In her "follow-the-Sandi" mode:)</i> Oh, most <i>definitely</i>, Sandi.</p>

<p>TIFFANY: <i>("Yes-woman" mode:)</i> You're...so...right...Sandi.</p>

<p>STACY: <i>(Nods in her "follow-the-Sandi-or-else" agreement:)</i> Loose is the way to go, Sandi! Our skin can <i>breathe</i> and everything, and we <i>don't</i> sweat!</p>

<p>THE ENTIRE FASHION CLUB: <i>(All frown, shake their heads in mild disgust while closing their eyes:) Sweat--EWWWW</i>!</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Gives a curt nod to Tiffany, who sits down beside Stacy:)</i> Very well--Stacy, mark everyone as agreeing to wearing our summer blouses loosely, but not <i>too</i> loosely as to look unfashionable! <i>(Stacy writes in her secretary's book)</i></p>


     <p>Sam and Chris suddenly entered the living room, chasing one another. As soon as they saw <i>Quinn</i>, they stopped and ran up to her, ready to do her bidding.</p>


<p>SAM: <i>(Eager:)</i> Do you need <i>anything</i>, Quinn?</p>

<p>CHRIS: <i>(Eager:)</i> Maybe something to drink?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Looks up, thinks:) Weeell--</i></p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Cuts her off, irritated with her brothers:)</i> --Get out of here, you little <i>monsters</i>, before I call motherrr</i>!</p>

<p>CHRIS: <i>(Licks his tounge out at Sandi:) NYYAAH</i>! <i>(Sandi swings at him, and he ducks, runs while Sandi glares at Sam, who licks his tounge out at her as well, then also runs from her--both go outside, while an angry Sandi stops at the door, watching them go. Quinn secretly <b>smirks</b> at Sandi's annoyance)</i></p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Glares back at Quinn, who has quickly wiped the smirk from her face, while coming back into the living room:)</i> Aren't you like, <i>soooo</i> glad that you <i>don't</i> have any brothers <i>now</i>, Quinn? They can be <i>sooo</i> annoying! <i>(Quinn winces at Sandi's statement)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Sounding uneasy, singy-songy voice:)</i> Yeah, Sandi--<i>(weakly:)</i> like who <i>needs</i> a <i>brother</i>?</p>

<p>STACY: <i>(Giggles, blushes slightly:)</i> I bet you'd wish your <i>cousin</i> Darren was <i>your</i> brother, right, Quinn? <i>(Quinn <b>moans</b> inwardly)</i> He's like, <i>so</i> gorgeous--and like you told us, he even <i>saved</i> your cousin's friend's life! <i>(Sighs:)</i> What a <i>hero</i>!</p>

<p>TIFFANY: <i>(In a dreamy tone, looks in space:)</i> Yeeeah...gorgeous...hero.</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Tries to not blush <b>herself</b> over thinking about Darren, attempts to seize back control:) Staaacy--Tiffannny</i>! Like, come out of that <i>trance</i> both of you are in, and concentrate on the meeting! <i>(Stacy and Tiffany look at each other foolishly for a moment, then get "serious" looks on their faces--stop that laughing!)</i></p>

<p>STACY: <i>(Contrite:)</i> Sorry, Sandi.</p>

<p>TIFFANY: <i>(Contrite:)</i> Yeaaah...soorry.</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Gives another curt nod:)</i> Good. <i>(Thought v.o.: I'll come over to Quinn's house tonight, and have that hero Darren all to myself! He won't be able to resist me!) (Smirks)</i></p>

<p>STACY: <i>(Thought v.o.: I'm gonna go over to Quinn's tonight, and talk to that hunk of a hero <b>cousin</b> Quinn has--I wonder if he has a girlfriend?) (Smirks)</i></p>

<p>TIFFANY: <i>(Thought v.o.: Darren...is...handsome...I'll...meet...him... at...Quinn's...tonight.) (Smirks)</i></p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Suddenly glares at Stacy and Tiffany:) Tiiiiffany</i>! <i>Staaaacy</i>! Like, what are you two <i>thinking</i> about?</p>

<p>STACY: <i>(Looks innocent:) Nothing</i>, Sandi!</p>

<p>TIFFANY: <i>(Looks innocent:) Nothing</i>...Sandi!</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Looks at both suspiciously for a moment, then gives yet another curt nod:) Good. (Quinn simply looks at all three, and rolls her eyes, more in frustration over <b>not</b> being able to tell them Darren's her brother than disgust)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to the Appleton Tower--William Appleton's office)</i></p>



     <p>Benny was talking on the phone while William Appleton was conferring with Appleton's newest employee, <i>Sam Norwood</i>. Norwood was a short, stocky, balding man with black-grayish curly hair. Both were going over Appleton Industries' legal documents concerning the Chairmanship of the conglomerate. It was obvious that this more than a weekend work day. William was sitting at his desk with Norwood looking over his shoulder.</p>


<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Scowls while looking down at the documents:)</i> --Then what in the <i>hell</i> did I hire <i>you</i> for, Norwood? Why did I <i>blackmail</i> that firm to take you and <i>"legitimize"</i> you if you can't see any legal way for me to take over Appleton free and clear?</p>

<p>NORWOOD: <i>(Sweats, and feeling intimidated:)</i> I know you don't want Darren Appleton looking over your <i>shoulder--</i></p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Now glares back and up at Norwood, cuts him off:)</i> --Like what <i>you're</i> doing--</p>

<p>NORWOOD: <i>(Nervous chuckle, goes around to the front of the desk:)</i> --but at the moment, this document Potter drew up has <i>no</i> legal loophole in it. The only way that you can get it all without Darren Appleton as the future Chairman is that he <i>gives</i> it to you <i>willingly</i> or if something <i>happens</i> to him, and the Board puts your nomination up for a vote to the shareholders to replace him. I can keep looking--</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Cuts him off again, rolls his eyes:)</i> --If not for that <i>damn</i> Constance, I'd be seriously <i>tempted</i> to have Darren <i>killed</i> by now. I can't be too sure, but she <i>might</i> have enough votes from the Board to <i>oust</i> me, or at least give me a <i>hard</i> time with some strong support among the Board and some prominent shareholders.</p>

<p>NORWOOD: <i>(Evil smirk:)</i> Why not take <i>"care"</i> of Constance, Boss?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Looks off in space, narrows his eyes:)</i> Too <i>soon</i> after my <i>"nephew's" "parent's"</i> deaths. <i>(Looks at Norwood pointedly:) You</i> don't worry about that, Norwood--just about how I can find a way for Darren to willingly give me the conglomerate. <i>(Grabs up documents, shuts folder, <b>shoves</b> it in Norwood's stomach)</i> Now, get <i>out</i>.</p>

<p>NORWOOD: <i>(Winces, bends over forward from William's sudden move:) S-sure</i>, Boss. <i>(Quickly leaves the office)</i></p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Glares after Norwood, mumbles under his breath:) Idiot. (Scowls, turns to a troubled-looking Benny, who's just gotten off the phone:)</i> And what-in-the-hell is <i>your</i> problem, Benny?</p>

<p>BENNY: That was the man you sent to <i>spy</i> after <i>Leonard Potter</i>, Boss--he said he saw <i>Gerald Woo</i> come out of Potter's office.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(His eyes grow wide, gets up from behind his desk, growls:) WHAT</i>?! <i>(Benny cringes) Woo--was--WHERE</i>?!</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Now cowers a bit:)</i> H-he was in Leonard Potter's office, Boss! That's <i>all</i> he could tell me!</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Through clenched teeth, turns from Benny, paces around in the office, worried:)</i> Why would Potter <i>need</i> Woo, Benny? To get <i>something</i> on <i>me</i>?</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Watches William intently:)</i> Maybe he needs Woo to investigate something out there, Boss, you know, like those recent company reports about an employee <i>stealing</i> some our company secrets from our West coast branch and selling them to our competitors?</p> 

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Waves Benny off, sounding impatient:) Yes</i>, yes, I know all about those reports, Benny--and I know Woo is one of the very <i>best</i> when it comes to getting to the <i>bottom</i> of these things, like hiring him over the company's security fraud case, finding Darren's birth family, and the like--I'm just wondering if I'm <i>missing</i> something here. <i>(Stops in his tracks, pauses, realizes something, turns slowly to Benny:)</i> Oh--<i>hell</i>--could it be <i>that</i>?</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Perplexed:)</i> Uh, Boss--do <i>you</i> know something <i>I</i> don't?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Looks at Benny with contempt:)</i> Benny, I know <i>everything</i> you don't. It just occurred to me--<i>(narrows his eyes at Benny:)</i> what if <i>Darren</i> suspects something about <i>me</i> on the <i>crash</i>? I wondered <i>why</i> he simply decided to leave me alone so <i>suddenly</i> the last time he called. <i>(Gives a questioning look at Benny:)</i> Perhaps he <i>knows</i> something, or is <i>trying</i> to know something by retaining Woo? <i>(Pauses:)</i> It's too much of a <i>coincidence</i> that Woo would go to see Potter so <i>soon</i> after Darren had hired Woo to find Darren's birth parents.</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Grins wickedly:)</i> Do you want me to send a man to this <i>"Lawndale"</i> and <i>"take care"</i> of your <i>"nephew"</i>? You said that if Darren <i>"interfered"</i> with your running the company again, you'd get <i>rid</i> of him.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Now gives Benny a <b>pathetic</b> look, as if to say, "You really <b>are</b> stupid, aren't you?", sighs:)</i> Benny, you <i>imbecilic twit</i>, if Darren did hire Woo to find something on me, don't you think Woo would put <i>me</i> at the <i>top</i> of his list if something happened to Darren so soon after Woo talked to Potter? Besides, we really <i>don't</i> know if my <i>"nephew"</i> knows <i>anything</i>--like you said, this could be about something <i>else</i>. I don't want to play my <i>hand</i> too soon.</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Blinks, looks down foolishly, then back up at William:)</i> Well, how about if you send a man to spy on <i>Woo</i>?</p> 

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Gives Benny a <b>"The numbskull might have a good idea"</b> look:)</i> Yes--you could have <i>something</i> there, Benny--call the man who was spying on Potter to watch <i>Woo</i>--and see if there's any way we can get some <i>surveillance equipment</i> to monitor Woo's phone calls, or to at least <i>bug</i> his office. <i>(Pauses, narrows his eyes at Benny again:)</i> Have another man on <i>standby</i> for my <i>"nephew"</i>--just in case he <i>is</i> involved in this, and tries to <i>pin</i> his <i>"parent's"</i> deaths on me. I want to be ready to <i>eliminate</i> him, too--possibly <i>Woo</i> as well. <i>(Sits down at his desk)</i></p>

<p>BENNY: Right, Boss. <i>(Starts to leave)</i></p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Looks up, eyebrow cocked:)</i> Oh, and Benny--?</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Stops at the door just before he opens it:)</i> Yeah, Boss?</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>Another</i> thought has just occurred to me--do you know where <i>Sanchez</i> is? You said that he wanted to get the <i>second</i> part of his payment, and I'm assuming he left an <i>address</i> for us to contact him after the NTSB has finished their investigation?</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Hesitates:)</i> Uh, actually, Boss--he said he'd get touch with <i>us</i>, not the other way around, and no, he didn't leave any address.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: <i>(Having spun his chair to face the window, thinks while looking out over the city:)</i> Well, <i>find</i> him--I want to make sure to keep an eye on <i>him</i> as well. If he tries to <i>double-cross</i> us, I want him <i>silenced immediately</i>. Got it?</p>

<p>BENNY: <i>(Gives a curt nod:)</i> Right, Boss. <i>(Leaves the office)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene is back in Lawndale, at the Morgendorffers, a few hours later)</i></p>



     <p>Daria and Darren had been back from Jane's for awhile now, and were preparing to get ready to go to the Zen, and it was agreed upon by all parties that Jane would ride with them there. Helen, Jake, and Quinn were sitting at the kitchen table finishing eating the usual lasagna dinner, when Daria and Darren walked into the kitchen. Daria was wearing her usual attire, while Darren wore a modest black short-sleeved shirt and faded blue jeans with Rockport shoes. He put on a faded blue-jean jacket to complete his ensemble.</p>


<p>HELEN: <i>(Notices both:)</i> Are you two <i>sure</i> you won't eat anything before going?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Thought v.o.: Any <b>more</b> lasagna, and I'll turn <b>into</b> one.:)</i> Er, no thanks.</p>

<p>DARIA: Yeah, Mom--we're gonna pick up a burger after we leave the Zen, or get something while we're there.</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Rolls her eyes:)</i> Gee, bro--<i>I</i> wouldn't be caught <i>dead</i> at that <i>loser</i> grunge nightclub--</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan, smirks:)</i> --No, just <i>alive</i> at any <i>other</i> nightclub in Lawndale, at any other <i>time</i>, at any other <i>place</i>. Just ask <i>anyone--"Ms. Illegal I.D.". (Helen and Jake gasp, shocked, and glare at a now-shocked Quinn, while Darren looks up quietly, mouths to himself, "Ooboy".)</i></p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Frowns:)</i> Quinn, is that <i>true</i>?</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Also frowns, in "back-up" mode:)</i> Yeah, <i>is</i> that true?</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Glares a second at Daria, then pleads to her parents:) Muh--oom</i>! I just <i>had</i> to--</p>


     <p>At that moment, the doorbell suddenly rang, and Quinn seized the moment by jumping up to answer it. Everyone followed her out of the kitchen to the living room.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(To Darren while walking:)</i> Saved by the <i>bell. (Darren quietly chuckles)</i></p>


     <p>A relieved Quinn gratefully opened the door and found <i>Sandi</i> standing there. Sandi simply brushed past Quinn and came in.</p>


<p>QUINN: <i>(Stunned, while watching Sandi go by:) Sandi</i>? What are <i>you</i> doing here? I don't remember us agreeing to have <i>another</i> meeting so soon--?</p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Actually Quinn, I can here to see <i>Darren</i>, your--<i>(Quinn grows wide-eyed and pale, because the jig's about <b>up</b>. Sandi's about to find out in front of Quinn's parents that Darren's her brother, which would mean Daria is her sister, and that would mean "Goodbye, Fashion Club")</i></p> 


     <p>Before Sandi could finish her sentence, <i>Stacy</i> came up, followed a moment later by <i>Tiffany</i>--both girls looked at each other, surprised to see the other here at the same time, as well as Sandi. Sandi glared at both as they came up through the Morgendorffer's front door, and into the living room. Daria rolled her eyes in frustration.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Thought v.o.: My "cousin" leads an <b>utterly</b> damned charmed life.)</i></p> 

<p>SANDI: <i>(Really frowns:) Staaacy--Tiiiffany</i>--like, what <i>are</i> you two <i>doooing</i> here? We like, <i>already</i> had our meeting today!</p>

<p>STACY: <i>(Looks nervously at Sandi:)</i> Well, I--uh--wanted to talk to Quinn to--uh--go over something in the meeting that I <i>forgot</i> to ask her!</p>

<p>TIFFANY: <i>(Jumps on the "excuse" bandwagon with Stacy:)</i> Yeeeah...I... wanted...to...talk...to...Quinn...about...something...too.</p>

<p>SANDI: Both of you could have like, <i>called</i>!</p> 

<p>QUINN: <i>(Smirks, not wanting an opportunity to show up Sandi go by, jumps in:)</i> Why did <i>you</i> come again, Sandi--to um, ask Darren <i>"something"</i>--? <i>(Stacy and Tiffany look at Sandi expectantly, both showing a bit of a smirk, while Daria and Darren, and Jake and Helen look at each other, then at Sandi)</i></p>

<p>SANDI: <i>(Glares a little at Quinn, who has the upper hand, if only for a second, gets an idea:)</i> I--um, wanted to ask Darren about your <i>internship</i>, you know, what you <i>told</i> us about, Quinn? I wanted to know if he could get <i>me</i> on at Circa, too? <i>(Quinn rolls her eyes)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Well, like I told Quinn, it depends on your <i>grades</i>. Maybe we can get together next week. Right now, I have an engagement to attend to.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Yeah, you fashion gals will have to wait until then to try and get your <i>claws</i> into my bro. <i>(Pulls a red-faced Darren out, while the Fashion Club, with the exception of Quinn, who's actually <b>smirking</b>, glare at Daria:)</i> See ya. <i>(Shuts the door behind her)</i></p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Turns to the Fashion Club:)</i> Well, since you guys are here, maybe we can go over the next meeting's fashion ideas!</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Steps in, smiles:)</i> Do you girls want something to--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Cuts her off:)</i> --It's okay, Mom--<i>I'll</i> take care of everything. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Don't you gotta get some work to do for <i>Monday</i>, you know, like to <i>prepare</i> for, or something?</p>

<p>HELEN: <i>(Remembers:)</i> Oh my--I suppose I <i>do</i> have <i>some</i> work to do. Excuse me, girls. <i>(Leaves)</i></p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Grins like an idiot:)</i> Hey, girls, <i>I</i> can--</p>

<p>QUINN: <i>(Jumps in, alarmed:)</i> --Like, um, isn't the <i>thingamajig</i> game on TV now, or something, Daddy?</p>

<p>JAKE: <i>(Eyes light up:)</i> Gosh, sweetie, you're <i>RIGHT</i>! Excuse me, girls! <i>(Runs into the living room)</i></p>


     <p>Quinn rolled her eyes, and motioned the Fashion Club up to her room. Pouting, Sandi, Tiffany, and Stacy grudgingly followed Quinn upstairs.</p>

     
     <p>In the meantime, Daria and Darren were in Darren's rented car going to Jane's.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Sighs in relief, glances over at Daria:)</i> Thanks for getting me from those girls, sis--I'm kind of <i>glad</i> I didn't stay tonight now--I would've <i>never</i> had any <i>peace</i> with them there.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Smirks, cuts her eyes at Darren:)</i> No problem, bro--Quinn's fellow
fashion <i>simpletons</i> can say, drive the most <i>ardent anti-death sentence advocate</i> to jump in an <i>electric chair</i> and pull the switch <i>themselves</i> to end their <i>suffering. (Darren laughs)</i></p>


     <p>The car pulled up in front of the Lane's. Jane came out of the house, and got in the back. She leaned over the back seat, giving her <i>full</i> attention to Darren, a moment <i>not</i> lost on Daria.</p>


<p>JANE: Yo, guys--<i>(smirks at Darren:)</i> ready for a rollicking-rip-roaring time at the Zen, Darren?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Shrugs, looks through the rear-view mirror at Jane:)</i> I guess, Jane--<i>(smirks:)</i> just don't blame me if I dance like a <i>log</i>--I generally <i>don't</i> go out much. I'm more of a <i>homebody</i>, you see. <i>(Daria and Jane look at each other, surprised)</i></p> 

<p>DARIA: You generally <i>don't</i> go out much, bro? I thought, well--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Chuckles, gently cuts his sister off:)</i> --You thought with my <i>"looks"</i>, I'd <i>party</i> into the night, sis? <i>(Grins:)</i> And have <i>all</i> the women <i>after</i> me? <i>(Jane smirks)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Rolls her eyes:) No</i>, bro--I know you <i>had</i> a <i>girlf--(stops, checks herself, looks over at Jane, who narrows her eyes at Daria for a moment, while Darren cuts his eyes at Daria, looking pained for an instant, then forward on the street)</i>--your, um, <i>friend</i>. I thought maybe that you'd be out a little <i>more</i>, that's all. You don't seem to be the <i>sheltered-in</i> type. Turn here, bro.</p>


     <p>Upon hearing this, Jane leaned back in the rear seat, <i>laughing</i> so hard, she was holding her stomach.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(Trying to control her laughter:) T-this</i> coming from <i>you</i> of <i>all</i> people, Daria? You, who I had to practically <i>drag</i> out of your house and <i>comfortable</i> room the <i>first</i> time I mentioned about going to see Trent and Mystik Spiral at the Zen? <i>(Daria glares back at Jane)</i> Don't tell me that <i>Quinn's</i> been able to <i>brainwash</i> you into believing that all <i>good-looking people</i> like your <i>brother</i> need to go out and <i>tear up</i> the town because <i>she</i> does? <i>(Darren glances in the mirror at Jane for a second at the word "good-looking", then back on the street)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Defensive tone, frowns:)</i> That's <i>not</i> what I was saying, Jane. I'm just thinking that Darren would be a little more <i>well-travelled</i>, that's all. <i>(Looks at Darren:)</i> I mean, <i>did</i> you go out, you know, anywhere in your <i>spare</i> time, to relax? <i>(Motions, points:)</i> Turn down this street, Darren.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(While turning:)</i> Well, like you two, I did go out to eat at some fast-food outlets, and I also hang out at the <i>gym (thought v.o.: At <b>home</b> that is--:)</i> working out with my friends, and I went to the arcade and such, but with college now, I generally don't have the time to do that. I never thought of myself like a <i>"loverboy"</i>--people who see me for the <i>first</i> time get that impression. I had a <i>few</i> dates, but I <i>never</i> ran around, or anything like that.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Thought v.o., smirks: Geez, the boy's a genuine "cookies-and-milk" guy--wait a second: Did Daria say he <b>had</b> a girlfriend--does that mean--[frowns to herself:] <b>damn</b>! I'm thinking that <b>type</b> of thought again! Get rid of it quick, Jane girl--he doesn't want to talk about what happened with her, except with Daria. I wonder if he has the same problems with her like I'm having with Tom) (Shakes her head to get rid of <b>that</b> thought also)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Gives a quiet, quick smile to Darren:)</i> Yeah, I kind of <i>figured</i> that for <i>some</i> reason. <i>(Changes subject, smirks:)</i> So, what's this I hear about you calling <i>our</i> mom and dad <i>"Helen" and "Jake"</i>? I overheard this morning dad <i>lamenting</i> over that little fact while being in your room <i>again. (Darren looks ahead, wide-eyed, surprised, while Jane leans over the seat, curious, eager to hear)</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:)</i> Now, <i>this</i> is interesting--<i>both</i> subjects, that is, this--<i>"room"</i> and <i>"Helen" and "Jake"</i> thing.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks sheepish, shrugs:)</i> So you know about the <i>"Helen" and "Jake"</i> thing, eh? I couldn't very well call my birth parents <i>"Mom" and "Dad"</i> right off the <i>bat</i> when I found them, could I, Daria? When I first met them, I asked them if I could call them by their <i>first</i> names, because it didn't <i>feel</i> right if I called them that, and not to <i>disrespect</i> my late (adopted) parents. I took care <i>not</i> to call them by their first names in <i>front</i> of you and Quinn to set an <i>example</i>--though I don't think, er, <i>Helen and Jake</i> noticed that. <i>(Smiles:)</i> As for the <i>"room"</i> thing, well, <i>Daria</i> can tell you about that later.</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Ponders:)</i> I suppose that's understandable about mom and dad what you told told us. <i>(Pauses, smirks:)</i> You didn't want me or Quinn to "demand" that we have the right to call <i>Helen</i> "Helen", and <i>Jake</i> "Jake" because we heard that <i>you</i> did? Don't worry--I call them that <i>all</i> the time--just not <i>around</i> them--unless they get me <i>PO'd. (Darren shakes his head slowly, smiles quietly)</i> Relax, bro--they won't hear it from me. Down the end of this street.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Yeah--I don't see what the <i>big</i> deal is, I've called my mom <i>Amanda</i> before, and my dad <i>Vincent--(stops when she sees where they are, gets into an "astronaut's" tone of voice, whatever <b>that</b> sounds like:) "Houston, we have arrived."</i></p>



     <p>Darren's car pulled in front of the Zen, near the shopping district, and they got out. When they walked in, immediately, the sights, smells and sounds of the underground alternative rock nightclub hit Darren full force. The sights and sounds were what he had expected from Daria and Jane's brisk description--young people chatting away, in their late-teens to early twenties, wearing loose, bold, and in some cases, <i>outrageous</i> clothing. Many of them had different colors of hair, such as blue, deep red, green, and pink. <i>Goth</i>, no doubt. Darren looked up and around--the building was obviously an old, converted warehouse. Some rooms on the side were boarded up. No telling what was <i>behind</i> there--one directly in front of him had the walls knocked out, and it had been changed into a food stand, with some hot dogs, tacos, and soda being sold to the long line of hungary teen-agers. The lighting was adequate, though perhaps it could be turned up just a <i>tad</i>. He rolled his eyes at that last thought. <i>Great, Darren--let these people think that you're some sort of <b>fastidious</b> person--that'll fit you in <b>here</b> nicely. You've been in places like this <b>before</b>, just not much--no big deal.</i></p>
     
     <p>He smelled the air, picking up an aroma of beer in addition to the food, and--wait--<i>marijuana</i>? Umm--best not to <i>inhale</i> it if possible. Daria and Jane were ahead of him, and were making their way up to the front through the crowd where Trent and the other band members of Mystik Spiral had set up their instruments. Darren moved forward through the crowd to catch up to them.</p>

     <p>Trent looked up at Jane and Daria as they were coming up, and smiled.</p>


<p>TRENT: Hey, Janey, Daria.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:)</i> Yo, bro.</p>

<p>DARIA: Hey, Trent.</p>

<p>TRENT: <i>(Looks above Daria and Jane:)</i> Hey, where's <i>Darren</i>? Isn't he with you guys?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Looks behind her into the crowd, along with Daria:)</i> Yeah--he <i>was</i> behind us. You see him, Daria?</p>

<p>DARIA: Not yet--<i>(notices him, then smirks:)</i> ah, <i>there's</i> the <i>cassanova magnet.</i></p>


     <p>Darren was almost near the front when <i>several</i> women, who had noticed him, promptly <i>surrounded</i> him. The Goth-looking women were looking at him dreamily, and asking him questions. He looked around at each of them, red-faced, smiling uneasily. <i>Here we go again.</i></p>


<p>GREEN-HAIRED YOUNG WOMAN: <i>(Smiles at him:)</i> I've never seen <i>you</i> around here, dude. You <i>new</i> here, or something?</p>

<p>PINK-HAIRED YOUNG WOMAN: <i>(Smiles at him, speaks before Darren can say anything:)</i> Yeah, you're new here, dude. Do you wanna dance with <i>me</i>?</p>

<p>BLUE-HAIRED YOUNG WOMAN WITH A MOHAWK HAIRCUT: <i>(Grins wickedly:)</i> Hey, c'mon with <i>me. (Darren looks at them all a little panicky)</i></p>

DARREN: (Searches for words:) Well, ah--I'm with--


     <p><i>Jane</i> suddenly came into the circle, brushing past the now-glaring girls, and hooked her arm with Darren's. She pulled him away from them quickly, smirking.</p>


<p>JANE: Sorry gals, but he's with <i>me. (Leaves with Darren)</i></p>

<p>PINK-HAIRED WOMAN: <i>(Frowns, looks at the other two girls with her, who are also frowning:)</i> Geez, I thought she was with that <i>Tom</i> guy. How'd you like <i>that</i>?
<i>(Rolls her eyes, and walks away with the others)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Turns to Jane, sighs:)</i> Thanks. That's the <i>second</i> time tonight I've been saved from the <i>she-wolves. (Chuckles:)</i> Are we <i>even</i> now following the <i>sinkhole</i>?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:) Nope</i>. Sorry, but I still <i>owe</i> you, buster.</p>


     <p>Jane and Darren came up to the front where Trent and the others were waiting for them, and they walked up to Darren to shake his hand. Daria stood on the side with Jane, privately <i>proud</i> of her brother.</p>


<p>TRENT: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Hey, man--you saved my sister's <i>life</i>. I wanna <i>thank</i> you for that, dude. <i>(Shakes his hand)</i></p>

<p>JESSE: Yeah--you're <i>cool</i>, man. <i>(Shakes Darren's hand as well)</i></p>

<p>MAX: You the <i>man</i>! <i>(Slaps Darren's hand in a high-five)</i></p>

<p>NICK: You're the <i>one</i>, son! <i>(Pats him on the back)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(A little embarassed:)</i> Thanks, everybody. I'm just glad I was there when it happened.</p> 

<p>JANE: <i>(Comes up beside Darren, looks up at him, speaks in a quiet tone:)</i> I know <i>I'm</i> glad you were there when it happened. <i>(Smiles, stares up at him, yet <b>another</b> moment that makes Daria raise her eyebrow, wondering)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Thought v.o.: You know, if I didn't know <b>any</b> better--that's <b>stupid</b>, Morgendorffer--put it <b>out</b> of your mind--she's just <b>grateful</b> to him for saving her <b>life</b>--that's it--<b>nothing</b> else.)</i></p>

<p>TRENT: <i>(Breaks the moment:)</i> Okay, then--we'd better get started. <i>(Looks at Darren:)</i> Chill, man, and enjoy yourself. <i>(Goes back to the front with the others, who take their positions, while Trent takes the lead, grabs a microphone and shouts to the crowd:)</i> Let's rock, everybody--Mystik Spiral is back and kickin'! <i>(The crowd goes wild)</i></p>


     <p>The music started, and everyone got into the groove. Mystik Spiral went through several of their old songs <i>(yes, including "Icebox Woman")</i>, and were about to wrap up the evening with their newest song. In the meantime, Darren had stayed with Daria and Jane about in the middle of the large wall-to-wall crowd, with Jane acting as a <i>"shield"</i> to Darren whenever any girl came up to him, saying he was with <i>her</i>, ditto for Daria. <i>(This happened a few times with the <b>green</b>-haired woman, especially)</i> Darren, trying to enjoy the songs without the dreamy-looking girls coming up, played into the act by shrugging his shoulders to each one that did, saying he was with Daria and Jane, and privately grateful for his sister's and her best friend's help. Some of the boyfriends of the girls nearby, while at first <i>frowning</i> because of Darren's somewhat remarkable ability to attract their girlfriends, seemed <i>satisfied</i> that he didn't take an interest in their dates. Trent got on the microphone and began to speak over the wildly cheering crowd.</p>


<p>TRENT: Okay, everybody--we've got one more song to sing, our newest tune that will express our <i>gratitude</i> to our <i>"Mysterious Benefactor"</i>! We call it: <i>"Thank You Mysterious"</i>! <i>(The crowd really cheers wildly, now:)</i> Hey, mysterious dude or dudette--if you're in here <i>now</i>, this one's for <i>you</i>! <i>(Darren smiles quietly. He looks over at Daria and Jane, who have genuine small smiles on their faces)</i> Hit it, everybody! <i>(Music begins to play)</i></p>


                       <blockquote><i>Got stuck in the muck</i></blockquote>
                       <blockquote><i>Ran out of luck</i></blockquote>
                       <blockquote><i>Then you showed with $8,000 bucks</i></blockquote>
                       
                       <blockquote><i>We weren't doing too well</i></blockquote>
                       <blockquote><i>Our lives shot to hell</i></blockquote>
                       <blockquote><i>And even our clothes were starting to smell</i></blockquote>

                       <blockquote><i>So thanks whoever you are</i></blockquote>
                       <blockquote><i>If you're near or far</i></blockquote>
                       <blockquote><i>You helped us to get to this here bar!</i></blockquote>


<p><i>(Note to reader: Kudos to the one and only Austin Covello for the lyrics)</i></p>


     <p>Darren looked at the group as they finished their song (after several more of the same verses, with some slight differences) with an <i>uneasy</i> grin on his face. <i>Ooooh--yeah. Veeery interesting song there</i>. He glanced at Daria and Jane, and they looked back at him with the same look.</p> 

     <p>Yet the crowd went <i>ballistic</i>. Darren, Jane, and Daria looked at each other, stunned. They came close together to talk over the wild cheering.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Shouts:)</i> I guess they <i>liked</i> it--?!</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Shouts:)</i> These people will listen to dead <i>skin</i> being <i>scratched off</i> from the <i>body</i>! What do you expect?!</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Ditto, smirks:)</i> Either <i>that</i>, or they'd listen to old <i>paint</i> that's <i>scraped off</i> from the side of a <i>house</i>! <i>(Darren laughs)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: Seeing all of these people <i>jumping</i> around has made me a little thirsty! You guys want something to drink?!</p>

<p>DARREN: No, it's okay, I'm fine! <i>(Looks back at the front)</i></p>

<p>JANE: Nah, you go on and get something, pard! <i>(Looks back as well)</i></p>


     <p>Daria made her way to the rear where sodas were being sold, and stood in line for a few minutes. From her point of view, the crowd noise was starting to dissipate, but the crowd itself wasn't. In fact, she noticed something of a <i>commotion</i> from the middle of the room--where she had left Darren and Jane. A little alarmed, she decided to leave the line, and see what was going on. Daria struggled to get past the throng of humanity in front of her.</p>

     <p>In the meantime, Darren found himself looking up at the biggest man he had <i>ever</i> seen. The man, staring down at Darren, who himself was no slouch, looked to be almost <i>seven feet tall</i>. He had long, black hair that was tied in a pony-tail, a full, scraggy, black beard on his scowling face, as well as a scar on his right cheek, and had thick eyebrows and a big nose. The man also had large, muscular arms with tatoos over almost every part of both of them. He wore only a black leather vest over his bare, hairy, muscular tatooed-chest and wore black leather pants, with large black boots. Jane, standing beside Darren, narrowed her eyes up at the man and spoke.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(Sounding angry:)</i> What in the hell are you doing, <i>Rocco</i>?!</p>

<p>ROCCO: <i>(Glares at Darren, cracks his knuckles, snarls:)</i> This <i>"playboy"</i> was after my girl!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks at the man with mild disbelief:)</i> What are you talking about? <i>What</i> girl? <i>(Thought v.o.: Only someone who wants to commit <b>suicide</b> would want to go after <b>this</b> guy's girl!)</i></p>


     <p>Trent and the other band members were about to pack up their equipment when they heard the commotion in the middle of the room.</p>


<p>TRENT: <i>(Tries to look in the middle of the crowd:) Damn</i>, what's going on?</p>

<p>JESSE: <i>(In his "clueless", laid-back tone:)</i> Dunno, man--wanna find out?</p>

<p>TRENT: I guess, dude. <i>(Looks at Nick and Max:)</i> You guys keep an eye on our new stuff, okay? <i>(Tries to make his way into the crowd)</i></p>

<p>NICK: No sweat, man--we'll keep packing it up.</p>


     <p>Back in the middle of the room, Rocco's girlfriend, who had been standing by the scene, came out of the crowd, looking none too pleased at him. Darren recognized the girl as the <i>green</i>-haired one who had come up to him when he first came in the Zen, and a few times throughout the songs. She stepped in between Rocco and Darren and Jane.</p>


<p>GREEN-HAIRED YOUNG WOMAN: Crap, Rocco--<i>nothing</i> happened! <i>(Sniffs at him:)</i> Damn it! You've been <i>drinking</i>!</p>

<p>ROCCO: The <i>hell</i> it didn't, <i>Sesame</i>--and I only had <i>two</i> beers! I saw you talking to <i>"Mr. Debonair"</i> here a few times--don't <i>deny</i> it!</p>

<p>SESAME: <i>(Grudgingly admits:) Okay</i>--so I <i>tried</i> to talk to him--no <i>biggie</i>, see? <i>(Glares at Jane, then back at Rocco:) She</i> and her friend kept me from talking to him, so <i>nothing</i> happened, you big ape!</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Looks at Rocco, frowns:)</i> Yeah, she's right--I was around him the <i>whole</i> evening! So why don't you find a <i>banana tree</i> and make your <i>home</i> there, Rocco? Darren's with <i>me</i>!</p>

<p>ROCCO: <i>(Narrows his eyes at Darren:)</i> You sayin' he's your <i>boyfriend</i>, Lane? <i>(Darren looks stunned when he hears this) (Rocco sneers:)</i> I thought you liked ol' Tom-<i>what's-his-name</i>! <i>(Steps menacingly towards Darren, who at this time was <b>sizing up</b> Rocco, and Darren narrows his eyes, preparing to defend himself)</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Suddenly steps in between Rocco and Darren, while Sesame backs up on the side, terrified:)</i> That <i>loser</i>? <i>(Rolls her eyes:) Please</i>. Yeah, I'm saying Darren's <i>my</i> boyfriend! <i>(Darren looks at Jane with a look of disbelief on his face)</i> You think I'd allow him to even so much as <i>look</i> at another girl while he's with me?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Leans over to Jane, while not taking his eyes off Rocco:)</i> It's okay, Jane--you <i>don't</i> have to--</p>

<p>ROCCO: <i>(Cuts him off, in a mocking tone:)</i> --Yeah, you don't have to <i>"protect"</i> him, Jane! <i>(Darren frowns at Rocco's mocking voice)</i></p>


     <p>Daria had finally made her way to the edge of the crowd in the middle of the room, (not hearing what had just transpired, mainly that Jane had said that Darren was <i>her</i> boyfriend) and saw Darren, Jane, and the <i>jerkwad</i> Rocco all looking at each other--and <i>smirked</i>. Rocco had been somewhat of a recent <i>bully</i> around the Zen, practically doing anything he wanted, from <i>kissing</i> other guy's girls, to <i>cutting</i> into dances between couples, using his enormous size to his advantage. He even had tried to come on to <i>her</i> once, but she put him down with a typical remark. The police had looked <i>down</i> on places <i>(and people)</i> like this, and rarely would respond to a call from here when trouble broke out--basically the Zen was on its <i>own</i>. Daria suspected that Darren <i>could</i> clean Rocco's "clock"--someone <i>needed</i> to do it--if only Jane would get the <i>hell</i> out of the way. She scanned around the crowd, and became stunned over seeing <i>Tom</i> just coming in the front, and making his way into the crowd to see what was going on. He must've just come back early from his vacation to talk with Jane--about <i>damn</i> time. She looked back to the scene.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(Frowns, glares up at Rocco:)</i> Who in the <i>hell</i> says that I'm trying to <i>protect</i> Darren? If I <i>wasn't</i> his girlfriend, would I do <i>THIS</i>? <i>(Suddenly turns around, grabs a surprised-Darren's head and <b>KISSES</b> him, full on the lips, and <b>deeply</b>, wraps her arms around his neck, and pulls him close to her)</i></p>


<p>Time <i>stopped</i> for a moment.</p>
