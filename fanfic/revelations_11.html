<p>Chapter 11- Aftermath</p>



<p><i>(Scene is at the Morgendorffer's--15 minutes later)</i></p>



     <p>Darren's car pulled into the driveway, and Darren and Daria got out of the car. Daria looked over at her brother, who seemed very <i>quiet</i>--and who could <i>blame</i> him after what just happened? Both came up to the door. Before Daria was about to take out her keys, she stared at her brother for a moment, and spoke.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Sounding unsure:)</i> Um, are you <i>sure</i> you're okay, Darren? You haven't said <i>two</i> words since we got back from the Zen.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks at Daria with no expression, shrugs:)</i> Ah, I'm <i>fine</i>, sis--<i>(pauses:)</i> I'm just a little--<i>shocked</i> Jane would do that, that's all. I was just thinking about <i>nothing</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Stares at him, thought v.o.: Uh-huh, <b>right</b>--well, I guess you want to keep your thoughts to yourself, bro--too bad <b>I</b> can't.:)</i> What Jane did was a shock to <i>both</i> of us, bro. I <i>still</i> can't believe she actually <i>did</i> that.</p>

<p>DARREN: I'm--<i>sure</i> she did it to <i>protect</i> me from that Rocco guy, and it actually <i>worked</i>--he <i>didn't</i> fight me.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Frowns:)</i> But you <i>knew</i> martial arts! Jane didn't <i>have</i> to do that--and in <i>front</i> of Tom!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Ponders for a moment, then looks at Daria curiously:) You</i> said to me while you were <i>angry</i> in the car on the way back here that Tom wasn't due to arrive back until <i>Monday</i>, so Jane <i>didn't</i> know that he was there, having not seen him yet. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Did you <i>tell</i> Jane I knew martial arts <i>all those times</i> you were on the phone with her while she was on vacation?</p>


     <p>Daria's face turned <i>pale</i>, and her mouth opened slightly in <i>shock</i>.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Puts her hand on the side of her face, small gasp:)</i> Oh, <i>hell</i>--I guess I didn't because at the time, I thought it wasn't all that <i>important</i> that you laid out Quinn's <i>"admirers"</i>. I <i>did</i> tell her that Quinn was <i>"boy-less"</i>, but I forgot to mention <i>how</i> it came about. I <i>was</i> planning to do so while we were watching TV, eating pizza, and looking at <i>Sick, Sad World</i> earlier today, but the episode was <i>so</i> damn good--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Chuckles:)</i> --You got <i>carried</i> away in the moment. <i>(Grows quiet:)</i> Hey, it's okay, sis--really, I'm--<i>fine. (Hesitates:)</i> Do--do you think everything will be okay with her and <i>Tom</i>? He looked at what had happened and <i>took off</i>, at least that's what you <i>told</i> me after you saw him come in--</p>

<p>DARIA: --And Jane went <I>after</i> him when I told her. I gotta tell you, bro--he looked like Jane ripped a <i>piece</i> of his heart away. <i>(Darren looks a little troubled at this)</i> Trent was supposed to take her to his place right after what happened. Tom got into his car and left before Jane could stop him, so Trent offered to take her.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks uneasily at Daria:)</i> I just hope nothing <i>bad</i> comes from all of this. From what you told me, those two seemed to fit <i>well</i> together.</p> 

<P>DARIA: <i>(Ponders:)</i> I don't know what's gonna happen, Darren--but I hope <i>you</i> don't feel <i>guilty</i> over this. If anything, this is <i>Jane's</i>--and to a certain extent--<i>Tom's</i>, and to an even <i>lesser</i> extent, <i>my</i> fault. <i>(Darren cocks an eyebrow, while Daria looks down guiltily:)</i> You're right, I <i>didn't</i> tell her about your knowing martial arts--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Gently cuts her off, absentmindedly puts his hands lightly on both of Daria's shoulders, reassuring her, an act that makes her flinch, then relax a little:) --Hold</i> it right there. Okay, so maybe you feel a <i>little</i> guilty of forgetting something to tell your best friend--but don't blame yourself, sis--what happened, <i>happened</i>. How could you have known that something like <i>this</i> would occur? Leave it at that. <i>(Turns to door:)</i> Let's go inside.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Turns to the door also:)</i> Um--okay. <i>(Pauses:)</i> What will we say if mom and dad, and even <i>Quinn</i>, ask us about tonight? <i>(Looks up directly at Darren:)</i> Should we say <i>anything</i>?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Takes a deep breath, looks down sideways at Daria:)</i> Well, <i>I</i> don't plan on saying anything. <i>You</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Shrugs her shoulders:) Nah</i>, I guess not--no need to hear our family give their <i>sterling</i> opinions. <i>(Unlocks door and both go in)</i></p>


     <p>Jake was sleeping on the right couch in the living room with the TV on and Helen was sitting on the center one looking over some work for Monday when they saw Daria and Darren walk in. Helen got up and came up to the both of them with a smile on her face.</p>


<p>HELEN: Well, you two are back, I see. How did Trent and Mystik Spiral perform?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Deadpan:)</i> As well as could be expected--meaning that no fruits, vegetables, or beer bottles were <i>thrown</i> at them, so I suppose it was okay.</p>

<p>HELEN: Darren, did you <i>enjoy</i> yourself?</p>

<P>DARREN: <I>(Turns a little red-faced over Helen's innocuous remark:)</I> Yes--er--I <I>did</I>. Though it was a little--<I>loud</I>, I--had a good time. <I>(Looks at watch:)</I> Wow, it's late--think I'll turn in. Goodnight, everyone.</P> 

<P>HELEN: <I>(Cocks a curious eyebrow:)</I> Late? It's only ten--<I>(pauses when she sees Darren "yawning":)</I> well, if you <I>really</I> feel tired son, we'll see you tomorrow morning. Goodnight. <I>(Watches Darren leave up the stairs)</I></P>


     <P>Daria watched Darren go up the stairs like Helen did, then turned back to her mother.</P>


<P>DARIA: Where's <I>Quinn</I>? <I>(Pauses, smirks:)</I> Don't tell me she's <I>back</I> in the <I>"love-em-and-leave-em"</I> business? Big Bro's little <I>"skirmish"</I> with Joey, Jeffy, and Jamie has now lost its fearsome <I>luster</I> in the eyes of the <I>Quinn-crazy</I> boy's club?</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Glares at Daria:) Very</I> funny, Daria--she's in bed--I think being with the Fashion Club <I>wore</I> her out.</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Deadpan:)</I> You don't say. <I>(Pauses:)</I> You know, in my opinion, the Fashion Club wore out <I>something</I> in our home the <I>first</I> time I saw them here.</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Arched eyebrow:)</I> Oh? What?</P>

<P>DARIA: Their <I>welcome</I>.</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Rolls her eyes:) Daria--</I></P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Snaps her fingers, gets a faux look of concern on her face, cuts Helen off:) --Damn</I>! I knew I <I>forgot</I> something! Mom, could I <I>borrow</I> your SUV and drive over to <I>Jane's</I>? I just remembered that I left, uh--my <I>favorite writing pen</I> over at her house when I went there with Darren earlier today. I can't write anything in my <I>"diary"</I> without it. <I>(Pauses at Helen for effect:)</I> It's <I>really</I> important that I get it from her--it won't take long, okay?</P>

<P>HELEN: <I>(Hesitant:)</I> Well, Daria--I suppose if you <I>really</I> need your er--"favorite" writing pen--</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Makes haste, grabs Helen's keys:)</I> --Thanks, Mom. <I>(Leaves before Helen can say another word, slams door)</I></P>


     <P>Darren went into his room, shut his door, and immediately leaned on his back against it, still stunned over what Jane had done. He slowly bowed his head, closed his eyes, and began to think.</P>


<P>DARREN: <I>(Thought v.o.: Why didn't I try to <B>resist</B> that kiss? <B>Why</B>? She did it so <I>fast</I> before I could do anything, but <B>still</B>--I don't need to dwell on this!) (He begins to undress himself for bed, notices his dresser mirror then slowly walks up to it, sees a <B>tiny</B> amount of Jane's lipstick on his lower lip, which was not noticeable to Daria and Helen, and puts his right index and middle finger on it, stares at the mirror)</I></P>


     <P>Daria got into Helen's SUV, started it up, and pulled out into the street. She had a <I>deep</I> frown on her face as she began to drive to the Lane's.</P>


<P>DARIA: <I>(Thought v.o.: Okay, Jane--seeing Tom's given you an <B>out</B> for the moment, but that doesn't mean <B>I'm</B> going to give you one. What in the <B>hell</B> were you thinking?)</I></P>


     <P>About two minutes later, the red SUV pulled in front of the Lane's and Daria got out, leaving the SUV parked on the street. She went up to the front door, and knocked. Amanda Lane opened the door.</P>


<P>AMANDA: <I>(Surprised, talks in her soothed-over voice:) Daria</I>! This is a surprise!</P> 

<P>DARIA: <I>(Deadpan:) Tell</I> me about it. <I>(Pauses:)</I> Is Jane here yet?</P>

<P>AMANDA: Oh no, not yet, dear. She and Trent are still out. <I>(Pauses:)</I> I do hope nothing's <I>wrong</I>. I thought Jane would come with you and your brother.</P>

<P>DARIA: Well, um--<I>something</I> came up, Mrs. Lane, and Jane er, <I>opted</i> to go with Trent in the "Tank" to take care of it. Would it be all right if I waited for her here until she comes in? I <I>really</I> need to talk to her.</P>

<P>AMANDA: Of course, Daria--come in. <I>(Lets Daria in, and leads her into the living room couch where they sit down)</I> Oh, I meant to tell you that I wanted to meet your <I>brother</I> and thank him for saving my daughter's life. Jane left me a <I>note</I> and told me what he had done. I found it when I came back from the pottery seminar while you all were at Trent and his group's <I>little show</I>.</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Thought v.o.: How <B>charming</B>. Following your little <B>"bonding session"</B> with Jane, you found out by a <B>note</B> that you didn't lose your daughter to <B>death</B> because you were at some <B>dumb</B> seminar--way to go, Mrs. Lane:)</I> Uh, yeah, I see. Well, me and my family are kind of um, <I>proud</I> of him too. </P>

<P>AMANDA: <I>(In her soothing tone:)</I> Oh, I'm sure you all are, Daria. That reminds me of a <I>story</I> about a large, but gentle <I>butterfly--(Daria groans to herself, for she certainly doesn't want to hear this)</I></P>



<P><I>(Scene is in the Tank, about 10 minutes later)</I></P>


     <P>Trent had taken Jane to Tom's right after what had happened in the Zen, by which he and Jesse had <I>seen</I> the kissing scene right when it had happened. Needless to say, both were <I>stunned</I> when they saw it. While Trent was taking Jane over to Tom's, he asked her <I>why</I> she had done such a thing, and all she would say is that she was <I>protecting</I> Darren from Rocco because she thought Rocco was going to beat the <I>hell</I> out of Darren--and it had actually <I>worked</I>, for Rocco <I>did</I> back off. Trent asked if he should wait for her when he dropped her off at Tom's, and she had said <I>no</I>--she wanted to talk to Tom alone. Trent had then went back to the Zen to pick up the other members of Mystik Spiral and took them home--Daria and Darren had <I>already</I> left. He was on his way back to Tom's when he saw Jane waiting out in front of Tom's for him. She had a <I>unreadable</I> look on her face, and her arms were crossed. Trent pulled up beside her, and happened to glance at Tom's window. A light, which had been on with a silhouette that was presumably Tom's against the door's window, suddenly turned <I>off</I>. Jane got into the Tank quietly. She simply stared forward, saying nothing. Trent looked at her for a moment, then drove on.</P>


<P>TRENT: <I>(Glances sideways at Jane:)</I> Janey--you okay?</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Still stares forward with that unreadable look on her face, talking in a neutral tone:)</I> Yeah, I <I>guess</I>.</P>

<P>TRENT: So, uh--how long had you been waiting for me?</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Still looks forward, speaks in the same tone:)</I> I'd just gotten out there before you came, about a minute. Tom said he'd watch out for me until you'd come.</P>

<P>TRENT: <I>(Pauses, talks in a quiet tone:)</I> Janey, if you want to <I>talk</I> about what happened with Tom--</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Gives a quick, annoyed glance at Trent:) No. (Looks forward again:)</I> I just want to sit here and <I>think</I>, bro--okay?</P>

<P>TRENT: <I>(After a second:)</I> Uh, sure, Janey--whatever you want.</P>


     <P>For the rest of the ride, not another word was said.</P>


<P><I>(Scene is back at the Lane's, about 10 minutes later)</I></P>


     <P>Daria, after enduring Mrs. Lane's soothing and annoying <I>"butterfly stories"</I>, had called her mother and said that she was waiting for Jane to arrive with Trent. Helen, who had assumed that Jane rode back with Darren and Daria, asked Daria why didn't she say anything earlier when Daria was at home with her. Daria then said that Trent had to help Jane with something <I>important</I>, (certainly <I>not</I> a lie) and that Jane and Trent would be a little late coming in. Daria added that she had thought they'd be there by now. After a pause, and Mrs. Lane assuring Helen that Daria was perfectly all right being there in the Lane household, did Helen say it was fine for Daria to wait for Jane. Mrs. Lane then told Daria that she was going to bed, and for Daria to let in Trent and Jane. Daria sighed in relief as she saw Mrs. Lane go upstairs, for Daria could at least have a little peace while waiting to talk to Jane--and thinking about what exactly she would say when she saw her best friend. Deep in thought, Daria bent down to rub Zachary and Taylor as they came up to her in the living room.</P>

     <p>The Tank turned into the driveway of the Lane's about the same time, and both Lane siblings saw Helen's SUV out front.</p>


<P>TRENT: Whoa--isn't that <I>Mrs. M's</I> SUV? What's it doing here?</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Narrows her eyes:)</I> I <I>don't</I> think Mrs. Morgendorffer was the one that drove it, Trent.</P>

<P>TRENT: <I>(Raises an eyebrow:)</I> You mean--</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(While getting out:)</I> --Yeah, <I>Daria</I> did. She's probably <I>waiting</I> for me. <I>(Walks with Trent up to the front door, then stops:)</I> Look, Trent, could you leave me and Daria alone to talk? <I>Please</I>?</P>

<P>TRENT: Sure, Janey--no problem.</P> 


     <P>Daria had heard the Tank come into the driveway and went to open the front door. She decided to try and <I>not</I> look angry at her best friend, because Daria suspected that Jane may have had a <I>tough</I> time talking to <I>Tom</I>--no need to <I>pile</I> on Jane's feelings. Daria, however, was also <I>determined</I> to find out why Jane had done such a thing to Darren. Daria took a deep breath and opened the door before Trent could knock on it. All three of them looked at each other a little awkwardly, then Trent spoke.</P>


<P>TRENT: Uh--hey, Daria.</P>

<P>DARIA: Hey, Trent.</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(In a quiet tone, sounding sheepish:) Yo.</I></P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Tries to sound civil, keeps her expressionless face:) Jane. (Lets both in, follows them into the living room)</I></P> 

<P>TRENT: <I>(<B>Faux</B> stretch and yawn--something <B>shocking</B> for Trent to do, by the way:)</I> Man, I'm <I>beat</I>. I'll see you guys tomorrow. <I>(Begins to go upstairs, followed by Zachary and Taylor)</I></P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Smirks:) Afternoon or night</I>? <I>(Jane gives a hopeful look to her friend--maybe the talk won't be as <B>bad</B> as it was with Tom because Daria gave her usual sarcastic remark--one could only <B>hope</B>, right?)</I></P>

<P>TRENT: <I>(Chuckles, then coughs:)</I> Good one, Daria. G'night. <I>(Goes up stairs)</I></P>

<P>DARIA: Goodnight, Trent.</P>

<P>JANE: Goodnight, bro--thanks for picking me up from Tom's. <I>(Watches Trent go out of sight up the stairs)</I></P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Now gives her full attention to Jane, tries to not sound angry:)</I> You forgot to thank him for taking you there in the <I>first</I> place right after Tom had seen what you <I>did</I> to Darren.</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Sighs, resigned to her fate, now goes into the living room to sit down on the couch, followed by Daria:) Yeah</I>, yeah--I screwed up <I>big</I> time, okay? <I>(Pauses:)</I> Lemme <I>have</I> it. <I>(Sits down on the couch with Daria, shuts her eyes, <B>cringes</B> to wait for the onslaught)</I></P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Sighs herself after seeing Jane cringe:) At ease, private. (Jane cautiously opens one eye to look at Daria)</I> First things first. Some of what happened tonight was <I>my</I> fault because I should have told you that my bro was <I>proficient</I> in the martial arts--you didn't have to er--<I>"protect"</I> him against Rocco.</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Stunned, rolls her eyes:)</I> Oh, great--fantastic--<I>wonderful. (Pauses:)</I> Now I even feel <I>worse</I> for making myself look like an <I>idiot. (Looks at Daria uneasily:)</I> Um--<I>how's</I> Darren?</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Narrows her eyes:)</I> Still in <I>shock</I>, I believe--you saw <I>yourself</I> when you finished your little <I>lip-lock</I>. He was <I>completely stunned and red-faced. (Ponders:)</I> When I think about it now, <I>you</I> were the <I>same</I> way.</P> 

<P>JANE: <I>(Blushes furiously, takes a defensive tone:)</I> Uh--actually, I really <I>didn't</I> see his face--hey, <I>I</I> couldn't believe what I had done either, you know! I <I>owed</I> Darren for saving my life, and I thought that by <I>kissing</I> him, making it look--<i>(hesitates:)</i> um--<i>"convincing"</i>, Rocco would think that I was Darren's girlfriend, that Rocco would leave him alone, and--</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Cuts her off:)</I> --It <I>worked</I>. Yeah, yeah, I know all about that--I <I>was</I> there too--<I>remember</I>?</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(In an off-handed way, shrugs:)</I> Besides, <I>you</I> let it <I>slip out</I> on the way to the Zen that Darren <I>had</I> a girlfriend. It's not like she'd be <I>jealous</I> or anything, because he's no longer <I>with</I> her, right? <I>(Daria looks away, now uncomfortable) (Jane arches an eyebrow at Daria's reaction, becomes a little concerned:) Right</I>?</P>

<P>DARIA: Jane, I'll tell you about the <I>"girlfriend thing"</I> later. <I>(Pauses:)</I> First, tell me about your <I>talk</I> with Tom. Are you guys <I>back</I> together?</P>


     <P>Jane paused for a moment, expressionless, then spoke.</P>
 

<P>JANE: <I>(In a neutral, but dramatic tone:)</I> Daria, it's <I>over</I> between me and Tom. <I>Finished. Kaput</I>.</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Looks at Jane, mouth slightly agape:) Oh, boy</I>--what happened?</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Looks down, still sounding neutral:)</I> Well, Trent had just dropped me off at Tom's, and Tom had just parked in front of where he lived, and had gotten out. Tom <I>slammed</I> the door when he walked in his pad, and I came up to the door--</P>


<P><I>(Flashback--at Tom's)</I></P>


<P>JANE: <I>(Pounds on Tom's door, frantic:) Damn it</I>, Tom--open up!</P>

<P>TRENT: <I>(From the Tank, leans through the passenger side, shouts:)</I> Janey, do you want me to come in there <I>with</I> you, and--</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Turns towards her brother, frowns, shouts:) No</I>, Trent--you go back to the Zen and take the rest of the guys back home--I want to talk to Tom <I>alone</I>, all right? Don't wait here for me--<I>(sees Trent hesitant:)</I> geez, I'm <I>okay</I>, okay? <I>Go</I> already! See if Daria and--<I>(pauses for a second:) Darren</I> are still there when you get back--come back for me after you take the rest of the band home, all right? <I>(Turns back to the door, while a still-unsure Trent slowly drives away, eyeing Jane)</I> Tom, you might as well damn know I'm <I>not</I> leaving this door!</P>


     <P>There was a pause, then the door slowly opened. Tom stood there, <I>frowning</I>.</P>


<P>TOM: <I>(Sounding cold and quiet:) Come in</I>, Jane. <I>(Jane walks by him, gives him a slightly sheepish glance. She stands in the middle of Tom's living room as he shuts the door and gives a <B>cool</B> stare at her with his arms crossed)</I> Okay, you're in here, now--I guess the <I>next</I> thing you can do is give me some sort of an <I>explanation</I> as to why I came into the Zen and found you trying to <I>examine</I> Daria's brother's <I>tonsils</I> with your <I>tounge. (Jane takes a deep breath, then begins to talk)</I></P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Present v.o.:)</I> I told him about how Darren saved my life, what led up to the uh, <I>"incident"</I>, and how I felt that I had to <I>owe</I> Darren by <I>"protecting"</I> him from Rocco when Darren was confronted. Like you said Daria, I didn't know Darren knew martial arts when I did what I did.</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Present v.o.:)</I> And what did Tom say <I>after</I> you told him all of this?</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Present v.o., sounding unsure:)</I> Well--he got really quiet for a bit and said nothing. I guess he was taking in all what I said. I simply stood there, watching him, saying nothing, but for some reason, I <I>didn't</I> feel like I was in the <I>wrong</I> here. <I>(Daria gives her an <B>ever-so-slight incredulous look</B> that Jane doesn't seem to notice:)</I> Anyway, after about a minute, he spoke, and said--</P>

<P>TOM: I see. <I>(Pauses:)</I> And you felt like you were <I>"protecting"</I> him.</P>

<P>JANE: That's what I said. Rocco looked at us for a moment, <I>shocked</I>, probably feeling <I>foolish</I>, then turned to his girlfriend, who promptly walked off, feeling PO'd. Rocco went after her, trying to apologize.</P>

<P>TOM: <I>Um-hmm. (Pauses, then adds:)</I> And how did Darren <I>react</I> to what you did?</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Looks at Tom, sounding unsure:)</I> I--really didn't look at him <I>directly</I>, Tom. I was kind of--<I>stunned</I> about what I did. I <I>thought</I> I saw Daria looking at me, but she was looking <I>past</I> me to you with a <I>horrified</I> look on her face--at least what <I>passes</I> as horrified for Daria, and I turned and saw you leaving. <I>(Present: Daria rolls her eyes, and Jane shrugs)</I></P> 

<P>TOM: <I>(Gives a skeptical look, nodding slowly:) Yeah</I>--and then you came after me with Trent after I left you.</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Cocks her eyebrow:)</I> I'm <I>here</I>, aren't I? <I>(Pauses, narrows her eyes:)</I> You're saying you don't <I>believe</I> me, Tom?</P>

<P>TOM: <I>(Frowns:)</I> No--actually, I <I>do</I>. It's just that, for <I>some</I> reason, I felt that you <I>liked</I> kissing Darren--he <I>did</I> save your life--maybe you felt like you "owed" him <I>far more</I> than a simple "thank-you"--?</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Now becomes angry, frowns, stunned:)</I> What in the <I>hell</I> are you <I>implying</I>, Tom?</P>

<P>TOM: <I>(Cold tone:)</I> I don't know, Jane--why don't <I>you</I> tell <I>me</I>? It's really not that <I>difficult</I> to do, you know--just move your <I>mouth and say the words</I>.</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Walks up to Tom with a fierce scowl:)</I> Now just <I>wait one damn minute</I>! Are you saying that I <I>liked</I> that kiss?</P>

<P>TOM: <I>(Cooly:)</I> You <I>grabbed</I> his head and wrapped your arms <I>around</I> his neck, <I>French-kissing</I> him, Jane! What am I <I>supposed</I> to think? <I>(Gets a pained look on his face:)</I> How could you <I>do</I> that to me?</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Now enraged:)</I> How could <I>I</I>--? How could <I>you</I> leave on your vacation with your <I>friends</I>, let me find out on your <I>now-fixed</I> answering machine that you're <I>not</I> going to be here when I get back from <I>my</I> vacation--and this <I>after</I> you had practically <I>begged</I> me to give you <I>another</I> chance! <I>(Adds:)</I> Why in the <I>hell</I> did you think I was jogging this morning so <I>soon</I> after my mom and I had gotten back? I <I>couldn't</I> sleep well because I was thinking about what I was going to say to you when you got back, so I figured a jog could help <I>clear</I> my head!</P>

<P>TOM: <I>(Narrows his eyes:)</I> It seems to <I>me</I> that your jog <I>"clouded"</I> your head <I>more</I> instead of clearing it.</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Raised eyebrows:)</I> And just what in the hell is <I>THAT</I> supposed to mean?</P>

<P>TOM: Jane, you jogged across the <I>unstable</I> landfill--</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Cuts him off:)</I> --Which I've done <I>hundreds</I> of times, <I>do</I> go on--</P>

<P>TOM: --and you nearly <I>died. (Pauses:)</I> Maybe if you had been thinking <I>more</I> clearly, you wouldn't have fallen into that sinkhole in the <I>first</I> place. I <I>thought</I> I <I>told</I> you to <I>stay away</I> from the landfill when you jogged by there. <I>(Jane looks stunned over Tom's admonishment, especially the <B>"thought"</B> and <B>"told"</B> part)</I> Then, your <I>kissing</I> Darren. Tell me if <I>that</I> is someone who is thinking <I>clearly</I>.</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Present v.o., sounding shaky:)</I> Daria, I tell you, I was so <I>angry</I> I could've <I>screamed</I>, and I was <I>this</I> close <I>(narrows her index finger and thumb close together:)</I> to <I>smacking</I> Tom. <I>(Daria looks stunned, while Jane regains her composure:)</I> Anyway--</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Furious:) T-there</I> you go, again, Tom--<I>telling</I> me what to do! <I>Thinking</I> for me--and not one <I>freaking</I> word about my being <I>okay</I>, like, <I>"Thank God you <B>didn't</B> die, Jane!" (Pauses:)</I> Okay, maybe you <I>did</I> have a point on my <I>not</I> thinking clearly--but, <I>hell</I>, Tom--I had <I>you</I> on my mind at the time, and where'd we go from here on our relationship. <I>(Pauses:)</i> Can you <I>really</I> blame me for being like that? <I>(Tom now looks speechless, then tries to say something, but Jane holds up her hand to cut him off:) Hold it</I>. You obviously didn't think that <I>much</I> of me, Tom--or you would have been <I>relieved</I> that I was okay.</P>

<P>TOM: <I>(Now, stunned and angry:) Damn it</I>, Jane, I <I>do</I> care for you! I've <i>always</i> cared for you from that first moment I saw you in the Zen! I needed to take that vacation with my friends to clear <I>my</I> mind--</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Now turns the tables:)</I> --Which seemed to cloud <I>your</I> head even more by saying something <I>insensitive</I> as <I>berating</I> me over falling into the damn sinkhole! Tom, I could've <I>died</I>! <I>(Jane looks as if she could <B>cry</B>, something <b>rare</b> for her)</I></P>

<P>TOM: <I>(Becomes quiet:)</I> Jane--look, I'm <I>sorry</I>. It's just that I was <I>so</I> angry--</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Cuts Tom off again, turns from him, holds herself, speaks in a low tone of voice:) --What</I> were you going to <I>say</I>, Tom?</P>

<P>TOM: <I>(Confused a bit:) What</I>? Say what?</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Turns to him, sounding louder:) What</I> were you going to say to <I>me</I> when you came back from vacationing with your friends?</P>

<P>TOM: <I>(Looking unsure:)</I> That--well--uh--we should try it <I>again</I>.</P> 

<P>JANE: <I>(Arched eyebrow:) --And--</I>?</P>

<P>TOM: And--<I>what</I>?</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Rolls her eyes:) Geez</I>, Tom--you went with your friends to <I>"clear"</I> your head to figure out what to say to me, and then you simply come back and say that <I>"We should try it again"</I>?</P>

<P>TOM: <I>(Shrugs:)</I> It was the <I>best</I> I could come up with, Jane! There really was nothing <I>else</I> I could say, okay?</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Shakes her head slowly, looking sad:)</I> How about something like, <I>"I have <B>feelings</B> for you, Jane"</I>, or, <I>"We've gone through too much together, Jane, <B>don't</B> leave me"</I>? <I>(Pauses, grows quiet:)</I> I--I <I>know</I> you care for me, Tom--<I>(walks up to him, puts her hand gently on his face, looks up at him:)</I> and I <I>still</I> care for you, too--just not in the way I <I>used</I> to. <I>(Tom is about to say something, but Jane gently puts her middle and index finger on his mouth:) Shush</I>. Tom--over the past few <I>months</I>, we've seemed to--slowly drift <I>apart</I>. The argument we had over my painting of you in front of Daria only seemed to <I>confirm</I> that drifting. <I>(Turns slowly away, looks down:)</I> We <I>used</I> to understand each other, but now, because of that drifting, we're <I>so</I> far apart, it's like we've reached a point of <I>no</I> return--like--like there's <I>nothing</I> there anymore, that it seems so--so--<I>empty. (Looks back at Tom:)</I> Don't tell me that you haven't <I>felt</I> the same thing that I have recently.</P>

<P>TOM: <I>(Tries to speak, but struggles to get out his words, beginning to look pained:)</I> I--I--i-it's--really <I>over</I> between us, isn't it?</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Looks down, with the same pained look:) Yeah</I>--yeah, it is. <I>Damn</I>.</P>

<P>TOM: <I>(Looking sad, talks low:)</I> No way we can get <I>past</I> this--?</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Slowly shakes her head:)</I> Over the great <I>void</I> that's come between us? <I>Nuh-uh</I>--I can't see <I>any</I> way to <I>bridge</I> it.</P>


     <P>After a long moment, Tom reluctantly went over to Jane, and <I>hugged</I> her. Resistant at first, Jane slowly hugged him back, and her <I>quiet</I> tears began to flow freely, crying silently in Tom's shoulder. After a minute, both backed away and looked at each other. Tom spoke, trying to control his emotions.</P>


<P>TOM: I--I'll <I>always</I> be there for you, Jane--you can talk to me <I>anytime</I>.</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(While wiping her eyes:)</I> Y-yeah, I know, Tom--a-and I'll <I>always</I> be there for <I>you</I>.</P>

<P>TOM: <I>(Pauses:)</I> Jane?</P>

<P>JANE: Yeah?</P>

<P>TOM: <I>(Hesitates, smiles:)</I> I'm kind of--<I>curious</I>, I've <I>got</I> to ask--<I>did</I> you <I>like</I>--</P>


<P><I>(Back to the present)</I></P>


     <P>Jane caught herself, frowning slightly. Daria looked at her inquisitively.</P>


<P>JANE: <I>(Now changes her tone:)</I> Anyway, Tom offered to give me a ride home, but I told him that Trent was coming back to pick me up. Tom then offered me to wait with in his place with him for Trent, but, well, I told Tom I needed to get out and get some <I>fresh air</I>--privately, I needed to get away from <I>him</I> before I lost it <I>again</I>--I think he <I>knew</I> that in a way, and seemed kind of <I>relieved</I> himself. He said he'd watch out for me from his window until Trent came back to pick me up, which he did, and here I am.</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(In her usual flat tone, still hiding her shock:)</I> So that's <I>it</I>. It's really <I>over</I> between you two.</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Shrugs:)</I> Pretty much so, but we're still gonna be <I>friends</I>--though I think for a while, we'll probably <I>not</I> be around each other--the <I>memories</I> of being together are a little too <I>fresh</I> on our minds.</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Looks into space, in a rare reflective tone for her:) "It is better to have loved and lost, than not to have loved at all."</I>--Tennyson. <I>(Jane looks at Daria, curiously)</I> From <I>Mr.O'Neill's</I> class, Jane, remember? After <I>Tommy Sherman's</I> death? <I>(Jane then slowly nods, remembering)</I> Er--may I ask you a <I>personal</I> question?</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Smirks:)</I> You're about to ask me if I ever <I>loved</I> Tom, right?</P> 

<P>DARIA: <I>(Blushes slightly, looks away:)</I> Well, um--</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Takes a deep breath:)</I> I--had some <I>strong</I> feelings for him at one time, Daria--if you don't mind, I'd--kind of like to leave it at <I>that</I>, okay?</P>

<P>DARIA: Um--<I>sure</I>.</P>

<P>JANE: Ooookay. <I>(Pauses:)</I> So, does this mean that I'm <I>off</I> the hook?</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Ponders, looks directly at Jane:)</I> Provided that you answer <I>one</I> more question.</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Looks at Daria hesitantly:)</I> Er--proceed.</P>

<P>DARIA: <I>(Looks for words:)</I> Did you--um, well, <I>like</I> that kiss that you gave to my brother? You didn't <I>quite</I> finish what Tom had said at the end of the conversation between you two.</P>


     <P>Jane <I>blushed</I> furiously, her eyes were slightly wide open, and her mouth was trying to form <I>cohesive</I> words. Daria stared at her best friend expressionlessly, then knowingly nodded slowly.</P>


<P>DARIA: <I>(Realizes:)</I> Oh, my <I>God</I>--you <I>did</I> like it.</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Tries to cover herself frantically:) NO</I>! I-I did it to <I>help</I> Darren! I <I>just</I> met your brother this morning! How could I--<i>(pauses, regains her composure:)</i> I didn't <I>feel</I> anything--<I>(then sheepishly adds:) at all</I>.</P>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:)</i> You <i>sure</i> about that, Lane?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Narrows her eyes:)</i> W-what do you <i>mean</i>, Daria?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sighs:)</i> Jane, I saw how you were <i>behaving</i> around Darren after he had saved you--all the <i>signs</i>. I tried to contribute it to your being <i>friendly</i> to him for saving your life, but then I saw that you were--well--being a tad <i>too</i> friendly talking to him and such. <i>(Jane frowns slightly at Daria)</i> Hey, you <i>were</i> pretty <i>gregarious</i> to him at just about <i>every</i> opprtunity, hooking your arm <i>with</i> his--don't <i>deny</i> it--and just, well--<i>(pauses, sees Jane's look of confusion:)</i> look, maybe you weren't <i>aware</i> that you were like <i>that</i> to him, you know--?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Now looks stunned beyond words:)</i> Daria, Darren and I are just--<i>friends</i>! <i>(Pauses:)</i> You--think--that I--<i>like</i> your brother?</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Looks for words:)</i> Well--uh--hey, what's <i>not</i> to like about him? He's <i>nice</i>, maybe a little <i>too</i> nice for his own good, he's <i>honest</i>, and he's well--ah--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:) --Handsome</i>?</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Blushes, frowns a bit:)</i> Hey, <i>I</i> don't have <i>insects</i>!</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Now with a perplexed frown:) Huh</i>?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Shakes her head, with her eyes closed:)</i> Never mind--an--<i>inside joke</i> I share with <i>Quinn. (Thought v.o.: And I never thought I'd share <b>anything</b> with Quinn except the same last name--and even <b>that's</b> something she tries to use <b>against</b> me with the 'ol "cousin" thing.)</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Trying to sound nonchalant, shrugs:) Yeeeah</i>. Hey, Darren's--<i>cool</i>, okay? Nothing more, nothing less. <i>(Blushes again, thought v.o.: He's just a <b>friend</b>, just a friend, just a fr--<b>damn</b>!)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Stares at Jane quietly for an instant, looking for any sort of emotional sign of <b>betrayal</b>:)</i> Okay, then. <i>(Gets up with Jane:)</i> Well, it's late. I guess I'd better go to that <i>insane asylum</i> that I call home. I'll be seeing you--</p>

<p>JANE: --Not so fast. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Um--you told me something about the <i>"girlfriend thing"</i> with Darren? You know, about the one he <i>"had"</i>? Methinks you guys are <i>hiding</i> something about that, am I right?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Looks surprised, then arches an eyebrow:)</i> What's the <i>big deal</i> about the <i>"girlfriend thing"? (Realizes:)</i> Are you telling me--?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Again tries to cover herself, waves Daria off:) No </i>! Daria, c'mon--I'm just--<i>curious</i> about it, that's all. After all, I don't want there to be any <i>misunderstanding</i> between Darren and his girlfriend over this--<i>(then adds as an afterthought:) if</i> he still <i>has</i> one--?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Looks uncomfortable:)</i> Um, Jane--I don't know if I should <i>say</i> anything about <i>that</i> now. It's really <i>personal</i> with Darren.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Rolls her eyes:) Geez</i>, Daria--I just poured my <i>heart</i> out to you over what happened with Tom, and you can't even tell me about the <i>"girlfriend thing"</i> with Darren? <i>(Snorts:)</i> It's not like she <i>died</i> or anything, and he's trying to get over her <i>death</i>, right? <i>(Daria turns slightly pale, and Jane looks stunned)</i> Aw, hell, tell me that's <i>not</i> it--?</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Gives out a long sigh:)</i> You have an <i>uncanny</i> sense of <i>stumbling</i> over things, <i>"Partner In Crime"</i>, you know that? <i>(Pauses:)</i> I'll tell you what happened, <i>(narrows her eyes at Jane:)</i> but you've got to <i>promise</i> that you won't say <i>anything</i> to Darren unless he says something to you about it <i>first</i>, got it?</p>

<p>JANE: Okay--sure, I promise. <i>(Sits back down on the couch with Daria, who reluctantly begins to explain)</i></p>



<p><i>(Scene changes to Gerald Woo's office, the conference room, Los Angeles, the same time)</i></p>



     <p>Gerald Woo sat at the head of the table with David on one side, and another one of Woo's employees, a thin, but tall African-American man with a crew-cut and a trimmed black mustache, sitting across from David. There were several files that were scattered on the table, as well as some empty cartons of Chinese food, and some empty soda cans. Woo let out a small <i>burp</i>, got up, and began to slowly pace around the table with his hands behind his back, all the while talking.</p>


<p>WOO: Okay, let's go over this <i>again</i>--following my talk with Leonard Potter this morning, I discovered that William Appleton had sent Potter out here to get Potter out of the way so William Appleton could make all of the Appleton conglomerate's business decisions free and clear of Potter's <i>so-called</i> "legal interference", even putting in Appleton's <i>own</i> man for the new legal head--</p>

<p>DAVID: <i>(Cuts in, nods his head:)</i> --And while doing so, you discovered from Potter that William Appleton had started to have something of an <i>attitude</i> change following a stockholder's meeting last year in the Florida Keys--</p>

<p>MAN: <i>(Now cuts in on David:)</i> --Because William Appleton <i>knew</i> something that only a <i>few</i> other people knew of on his brother Arthur Appleton Sr. and Lucille Appleton <i>from</i> that meeting, <i>(looks over at Woo:)</i> at least that's what Woo believes, and it <i>may</i> have something to do with the <i>murder</i> of Darren Appleton's parents--</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Takes it up from man:)</i> --It's a stretch, <i>Leroy</i>, I admit. When Darren Appleton first called me to talk about finding his birth parents, he mentioned in <i>passing</i> the meeting in which his aunt found out from her sister-in-law about Darren being adopted. Darren also pointed out that his <i>uncle</i> said that Darren's <i>father</i> told William about the adoption at the <i>same</i> meeting as well--</p>

<p>DAVID: --Which was kind of <i>strange</i> because Arthur Sr. couldn't figure out why William was suddenly behaving in an <i>odd</i> way following that meeting. If Arthur Sr. <i>had</i> told William about the adoption while there, there would be <i>no</i> need for William to <i>behave</i> in the way that he did, with all of the <i>"hints"</i> William was giving out--</p>

<p>LEROY: <i>(Eyebrow cocked, looks between the others:) --Conclusion</i>--?</p> 

<p>WOO: That maybe William Appleton <i>wasn't</i> told by his brother, rather William had <i>overheard</i> Millie and Lucille Appleton talking--</p>

<p>DAVID: --And heard that he had a nephew that was <i>adopted. (Pauses:)</i> If that's the case, then why didn't William try to simply <i>blackmail</i> Arthur Sr. and Lucille, telling them he <i>knew</i> Darren was adopted? You know, like a cash payoff, or something?</p> 

<p>WOO: <i>Compare</i> the two David--the control of the <i>conglomerate</i>, and all that corporate <i>power</i> verses giving out <i>"little"</i> payments of <i>"hush"</i> money? There <i>is</i> no comparison. The only missing piece here is that William Appleton was <i>not</i> next in line to get the Chairmanship--<i>Darren</i> was.</p> 

<p>LEROY: But William wasn't <i>sure</i> that he was next in power at the time because only <i>Potter</i> was the executor of the business will, and only he, Arthur Sr., and Lucille Appleton knew of who would next be in power. <i>(Pauses:)</i> But since William Appleton and Potter <i>hated</i> each other, a possible <i>collusion</i> between the two over who was next in power after the Appletons died was probably out of the question.</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Nods his head quickly:)</i> Yes, Leroy--I certainly don't think Potter had <i>anything</i> to do with this. The key is this <i>Sanchez</i> fellow. Someone--<i>possibly</i> William Appleton, or someone working <i>with</i> Appleton, <i>had</i> to hire Sanchez to do this. We can't <i>prove</i> anything because the <i>motive</i> is still <i>weak</i>, having no possible connection as of yet. Darren Appleton <i>chose</i> William Appleton to head the conglomerate. Unless we find Sanchez--we <i>can't</i> do much, and taking this information to the police would only serve to <i>alert</i> whoever did hire Sanchez, and probably <i>move</i> them to <i>silence</i> him. <i>(Looks around to both men with an <b>urgent</b> look on his face:) Find</i> Sanchez, gentleman, but try to keep it as <i>low</i>-key as possible--no need to bring <i>attention</i> to what we're doing.</p> 

<p>DAVID: <i>(Hesitant:)</i> Woo, what about <i>Darren Appleton</i>? You told him of what you found, and for him to keep all of this to <i>himself</i> until we found Sanchez. Do you think <i>he</i> might be in <i>danger</i>?</p>

<p>WOO: Not at the moment. Darren Appleton is <i>relatively</i> safe where he is--with his birth family in Lawndale. If anything <i>changes</i>, I'll contact him <i>immediately</i>, but remember, I want to hold <i>off</i> saying that his <i>uncle</i> is on my list of suspects until we can find Sanchez and see what he knows--no need to <i>tip</i> William Appleton off if Darren Appleton <i>confronted</i> him over this, and we turned out to be <i>wrong</i>--could you imagine the <i>mess</i> that would occur if that happened? Now, while his uncle <i>does</i> know where Darren is, I don't think he'll go <i>after</i> him because Darren's <i>not</i> interfering with William Appleton's running of the company--that and the fact that William Appleton <i>doesn't</i> know that Darren's hired us to investigate what happened to cause the crash outside of the NTSB's official investigation. If William Appleton knew <i>that</i>, I'd <i>shudder</i> to think what he'd do if he found out that his <i>nephew</i> was behind our hiring, particularly if that William Appleton was <i>indeed</i> the culprit. <i>(Pauses, looks down at the table, shuffles the files and papers:)</i> Now, if there's not anything else--</p>


     <p>At that moment, the door buzzer sounded at the front door. Woo, Leroy, and David looked at each other inquisitively, and Woo went out to answer it. He came up to the glass door, seeing a man with a red <i>goatee</i> wearing small, dark, sunglasses, a white tee-shirt, a red cap, black slacks, and white tennis shoes balancing a small box of pizza on his shoulder. The man, also chewing gum, was looking through the glass door back at Woo, who opened the door for the man.</p>


<p>WOO: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:)</i> Yes?</p>

<p>MAN: Pizza delivery for a--<i>(pulls out a receipt with his free hand, looks down at it:)</i> fellow named <i>"Whu". (Looks at Woo, smirks:) You</i> Whu?</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Glances down at the man's receipt, rolls his eyes:)</i> You've just made a <i>lame</i> rhyme there, fellow--<i>most</i> amusing. My name <i>is</i> Woo, but the name on your receipt is <i>misspelled</i>. My name is spelled W-O-O, <i>not</i> W-H-U, and I did <i>not</i> order a pizza.</p>

<p>MAN: <i>(Looks stunned, pauses:)</i> Uh, you <i>sure</i>?</p>

<p>WOO: I am <i>quite</i> positive, sir.</p>

<p>MAN: <i>(Looks around, unsure:)</i> Oh, man--they must've wrote down the <i>wrong</i> name when the person called. Geez, this is my <i>first</i> day on the job, and I don't want to go back to my <i>boss</i> and tell him I couldn't deliver a <i>hot and gooey</i> pizza. What should I do? <i>(David and Leroy walk in the lobby from the conference room at this time)</i></p>

<p>WOO: I am sorry, but there's nothing that I can do. Perhaps--</p>

<p>DAVID: <i>(Walks up to Woo and the man:)</i> --Hey, what <i>kind</i> of pizza is that?</p>

<p>MAN: Huh? Oh, pepperoni and cheese. <i>(Looks a little distraught:)</i> Man, I wish I could get <i>rid</i> of this pizza--guess I'll have to call my boss--<i>(begins to turn away)</i></p>

<p>DAVID: <i>(Motions the man in:) I'll</i> take it. I'm <i>still</i> hungary, anyway. <i>(The man walks in, smiles, while David digs into his pocket:)</i> How much?</p>

<p>MAN: $9.00, sir. <i>(David pulls out his wallet:)</i> I <i>really</i> appreciate, this, sir. <i>(The man takes the pizza to David, while Leroy goes up beside Woo, and both are rolling their eyes)</i></p>

<p>LEROY: Man, I still can't believe you're hungary after <i>all</i> that Chinese food!</p>

<p>WOO: <i>(Smirks:)</i> I guess the <i>old</i> saying holds true--and I'm <i>not</i> saying that because <i>I'm</i> Chinese. <i>(Looks at Leroy:)</i> Come on and help me clean up the conference room. <i>(Both go back)</i></p>


     <p>David gave his money (plus a generous tip) to the man, and took the pizza, which David put on Carla's desk. While David opened the box to savour the smell of the pizza, thus turning his back from the man, the man quickly, but quietly, pulled out something from his pocket, and <i>slipped</i> it under Carla's desk, beneath the front <i>lip</i>. David took out a slice and began to eat it while the man waved at him, smiling, and left. David went to the door, and locked it back.</p>

     <p>The man gave a quick glance back at Woo's office, and seeing no one watching him, walked unto the next street, and got into a small, white sportscar. He took off his cap to reveal his <i>red</i> hair--yes, it was the <i>same</i> man who had been outside Potter's office and had seen Woo come out of it. He pulled out a cell phone, and dialed some numbers. The sound of ringing could be heard from the other end, and then it stopped.</p>


<p>MAN: It was successful, Mr. <i>Lodell</i>. The bug I planted is <i>sensitive</i> enough to pick up a <i>fly</i> buzzing in there from <i>500 feet away. (Pauses:)</i> Yessir, it looks like they're closing up shop tonight, but I can listen in on them when they come in Monday morning. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Right, yessir--what's that? You want me to come by here <i>Sunday</i> morning? Yessir, I can do that--<i>(starts up his car, and drives off while still talking on the phone)</i></p>


<p><i>(Scene is back at the Lanes, the same time)</i></p>


     <p>Daria had just finished telling Jane about Stephanie Reardon. Jane simply <i>slumped</i> back in the couch, taking in all Daria had said, and then shook her head slowly in disbelief. This boy had <i>hell-upon-hell</i> put on him, all in the span of a little over two months.</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Gets up from the couch with Jane, goes to the front door with her:)</i> --And with that, I'll take my leave. <i>(Pauses, hesitates:)</i> Um--you <i>sure</i> you're going to be all right, Jane?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Arches an eyebrow:)</i> Hey, why <i>shouldn't</i> I be, Daria? After what you just told me, if anything, it's <i>Darren</i> who we should be worried about. I'll be--<i>fine</i>.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Okay. See you tomorrow?</p>

<p>JANE: No sweat--I'll call you. <i>(Opens door, Daria goes out:)</i> Later.</p>


     <p>Jane shut the door and leaned back against it, sighing. She slowly put her index and middle finger on her mouth, and stared forward into space, thinking.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(Thought v.o.: Well, at least I don't have to worry about Darren <b>having</b> a girlfriend, or in his case, a <b>fiancee</b> get the wrong idea about my kissing him--poor guy.) (Pauses, thought v.o.: Problem is, <b>was</b> it the wrong idea? <b>Did</b> I <b>like</b> that kiss? <b>Damn</b> it--why can't I <b>answer</b> those two questions?) (Turns off downstairs light, goes upstairs to her room)</i></p>


     <p>Daria was deep in thought while driving back home. What had happened earlier tonight was obviously still on her mind--she couldn't help but wonder if what Jane had done somehow was the final <i>catalyst</i> that drove her and Tom apart once and for all. Was it <i>really</i> over between them both? Should she <i>talk</i> to Tom <i>herself</i> to make <i>absolutely</i> sure if it was over? Daria closed her eyes and shook her head quickly--<i>damned</i> if she was going to get involved in this anymore--Jane and Tom were on their <i>own</i>. Daria then began to think about her brother, who had said, even <i>insisted</i>, that he was okay with what Jane had done--he said that Jane thought she was only <i>"protecting"</i> him from Rocco. Daria sighed to herself. Could Darren really just <i>shake off</i> all of what had happened? She felt <i>sure</i> that Jane was <i>hiding</i> more about that kiss than Jane wanted her to know about--was <i>Darren</i> doing possibly the <i>same</i> thing?</p>

     <p>The SUV drove up into the driveway of the Morgendorffer home, and Daria got out after turning off the headlights. A light was still on in the living room, and Daria groaned to herself. She had hoped that no one was up and that she could slip up quietly to her room, but it was now <i>obvious</i> that that little thought had gone out of the window--too bad she couldn't sneak <i>into</i> one of the filed-off bar ones to her room to escape detection. Oh well--just give whoever it is a little <i>sarcasm</i>, and they'd leave her be. Daria quickly made a mental note to herself to give an <i>excuse</i> for not having the <i>"lucky pen"</i> if her mother was the one who met her in the living room. Her <i>dad</i>? <i>Please</i>. She unlocked the door and went in.</p>

     <p>When she entered the living room, she was surprised to see <i>Darren</i>, who had put down the book he was reading, and get up off the couch to meet her. He was wearing his pajamas and housecoat, and he looked--<i>concerned</i>?</p>


<p>DARIA: <i>(Raised eyebrows:) Darren</i>? What are you doing up? I thought you were gone to bed--?</p>

<p>DARREN: I--couldn't sleep, so I got up to read my book. I came downstairs to make some warm milk, and came across <i>Helen</i>, who was about to follow <i>Jake</i> to bed. I told her I couldn't rest, and she asked if I could wait up for you when you got back from <i>(looks at Daria pointedly, then emphasizes the name:) Jane's</i>, so, of <i>course</i> I said yes.</p> 

<p>DARIA: <i>(Sighs:)</i> Okay, yeah--I went over to Jane's, and before you ask, she's <i>fine</i>. Unfortunately, her relationship with Tom is--well, <i>over. (Darren looks shocked)</i></p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Talks in a quiet tone, closes his eyes:) Oh, God. (Looks down guiltily, has a pained look on his face, sounding sarcastic:)</i> This is just <i>great. Another</i> thing on my mind to <i>worry</i> about. <i>(Sighs heavily, looks away)</i></p>


     <p>Before she had even realized it, Daria had walked up to her brother and gently put her hand on his <i>chest</i>, now with a <i>concerned</i> look on <i>her</i> face, looking up at him, trying to <i>reassure</i> him. Darren looked down at her, slightly startled by her action. Daria became wide-eyed for a moment, <i>shocked</i> at what she had done, and backed off quickly, <i>red-faced</i>. She immediately recovered, and spoke.</p>


<p>DARIA: Darren, we've gone over this--you had <i>nothing</i> to do with Jane and Tom
breaking up. Don't feel <i>guilty</i>, okay? This apparently had been <i>building up</i> for awhile--even I was <i>shocked</i> over Jane telling me that she and Tom's relationship had deteriorated <i>steadily</i> over the last few months.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looking surprised:) Really</i>? <i>(Pauses, cocks an eyebrow:)</i> But it certainly didn't <i>help</i> their relationship concerning with what happened tonight, you've <i>got</i> to admit that, Daria.</p>

<p>DARIA: True, but you're <i>still</i> not at fault here, bro. <i>(Looks at Darren, who seems to be now looking off into space:)</i> Darren?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Snaps out of his stare:)</i> Eh? Oh, I'm just thinking about what's going to happen the <i>next</i> time Jane and I meet, presumably tomorrow.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Pauses to consider her next few words, then proceeds:)</i> Darren, I want to ask you a question right out of the <i>blue</i>. Is that <i>okay</i> with you?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks at Daria uneasily for a moment:)</i> Sure, I guess--what?</p> 

<p>DARIA: Did you--did you <i>like</i> Jane's kiss?</p>


     <p>Darren's eyes widened for a second, then he turned red-faced. He stared at Daria for moment more, then spoke.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks uncomfortable, searches for words he can <b>believe</b> himself:)</i> O--of course <i>not</i>, sis--I mean, that's--well--<i>(chuckles uneasily:) crazy</i>! Sure, it was a <i>kiss</i>--but, well--she's your <i>best friend</i>! I couldn't <i>possibly</i> bring myself to do <i>anything</i> with Jane! <i>(Thought v.o.: <b>Could</b> I? NO! That's <b>ridiculous--isn't it</b>? I mean, sure, Daria <b>kind of</b> likes Jane's brother Trent--I <b>think</b>, but that's different--<b>right</b>?)</i></p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Stares at her brother for a moment to look for any sort of emotional <b>betrayal</b>, cocks an eyebrow, smirks:)</i> Hey, <i>all</i> I asked was whether or not you liked Jane's kiss, <i>not</i> if you could have a <i>relationship</i> with her--you didn't have to go the <i>extra</i> mile, bro.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Narrows his eyes playfully at Daria, somewhat relieved:) Heh--amusing</i>, sis--<i>very</i> amusing. <i>(Quickly changes his tone:)</i> So, ah--well, since you're here now, I'll turn in--I'm pretty tired for <i>real</i> this time. <i>(Starts to go upstairs:)</i> Goodnight.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Follows Darren up the stairs, clicks off the living room light:)</i> I'm coming behind you, bro--goodnight. <i>(Thought v.o.: <b>Crap</b>--damn it--I'm <b>sure</b> they're both <b>hiding</b> their feelings about that kiss--what in the hell is gonna happen tomorrow, I wonder? If something <b>is</b> there between them, how would <b>I</b> respond to it?) (Goes out of sight upstairs behind Darren)</i></p>



     <p>The next morning, Darren had gotten out of bed, stretching with his barbells in a red sweatsuit. Jake <i>wasn't</i> there this time--Darren had suddenly remembered that Daria said the night before that she had heard Helen and Jake talk in Darren's room while he was gone jogging yesterday morning. More than likely, Helen had caught Jake sleeping in Darren's bed once <i>again</i>, and had admonished him for sitting there and watching over him. Darren chuckled to himself over visualizing <i>that</i> particular scene for a moment, finished stretching, then went quietly downstairs, and then outside.</p>

     <p>As he began jogging in the morning light, he thought about the <i>dream</i> he had last night--of he and <i>Stephanie</i> kissing passionately in a kaleidoscope of wild colors and lights--and when he had opened his eyes after the kiss, it was <i>Jane's</i> face he saw. <i>Whoa--get over that, Darren--she's just a <b>friend</b>--your <b>sister's</b> best friend. On top of that, she's just had a <b>break-up</b> with Tom. So what if she's <b>attractive</b>, and is <b>fun</b> to be around with, has those <b>luscious lips, grayish-blue eyes</b>, and--and--<b>WHAT IN THE WORLD AM I THINKING</b>?</i> After taking a quick, deep breath to clear <i>that</i> thought from his mind, Darren kept jogging, slightly changing his route, (he had <i>three</i> of them to help himself get to know all of Lawndale) and this time, he took the route that came from the Morgendorffer's, around and behind Cranberry Commons Mall, past the <i>"Big Strawberry"</i> (the so-called roadside tourist attraction), past what Jake called <i>"The Speed Trap"</i>, Lawndale High (where he then turned around to go back), and then back to the Morgendorffer's by way of the small central business area, <i>Dega Street</i>.</p>

     <p>Darren frowned to himself for an instant when he started his jog back--it had just occurred to him that this route was the <i>farthest</i> from the Lane's residence. Did he <i>subconsciously</i> and <i>deliberately</i> do that to <i>avoid</i> meeting Jane, who he suspected was probably jogging this morning, too? Maybe--maybe not. Darren had thought about <i>what</i> to say when he met Jane today--he stepped up the jog, considered for a second, and decided to go with a <i>standard reply</i>--do not let Jane feel <i>guilty</i> if possible--she had enough things on <i>her</i> mind, just as he did on <i>his</i>.</p>


     <p>Jane was well into her jog when she started to think about Darren. She, too, had had a dream about him, only it was a bit more--<i>erotic</i>. She had dreamed of bathing in a <i>waterfall</i> (with her swimsuit on, mind you) on one of those tropical islands when she saw Darren come out from behind the waterfall, (in his swimming trunks, mind you) and they started to kiss while standing <i>in</i> the waterfall--<i>deeply</i> kissed. Jane thought about her hands feeling his hard, wet, <i>muscles and chest</i>--his thick, wavy, wet, reddish-brown <i>hair</i>--his handsome, wet, <i>face</i>--his--his--<i>DAMN! Get a grip, Lane! What-in-the-hell-is-the-matter <b>WITH</b> you? <b>Why</b> did you kiss Darren like <b>that</b>? Are you really and <b>completely</b> over Tom to now just think about Darren that <b>fast</b>?</i> Jane <i>tried</i> to tell herself it was because she <i>owed</i> Darren for saving her life yesterday morning, and that she had thought that <i>bastard</i> Rocco was going to beat the <i>hell</i> out of Darren last night in the Zen. Jane kept telling herself <i>that</i> reason over and over again--<i>yeah, that's it--<b>had</b> to be it. Nothing else, girl. He's Daria's (and I <b>suppose</b> Quinn's) Big Bro--remember that. Yeah, you've tried to get your Big Bro to be with your "Partner In Crime", but that's <b>different</b>. Darren's still trying to get over his fiancee's death. Me? I'm trying to put Tom <b>behind</b> me--you're not ready for <b>another</b> relationship. He wouldn't be <b>ready</b> for you anyw--damn it, there you go <b>again</b>!</i> Jane tried to erase the thoughts from her mind as she continued to jog.</p>

     <p>Jane's jog had started from the Lane's, past the abandoned quarry, through the <i>"Crewe Neck"</i> neighborhood, and High Hills Park. She turned and started towards a street that ran back towards Dega Street--near the small central area of Lawndale. She wondered what would happened when she would see Darren today--what would <i>she</i> say--and <i>him</i>?</p>

     <p>Jane wouldn't have to wait long to find out. Both she and Darren were deep in jogging and thinking when they literally ran <i>into</i> each other around the corner of a building near Dega Street. Jane was about to fall backwards from the collision when an alert Darren reached out and grabbed around her lower back, keeping her from falling, and inadvertently pulling her into his <i>arms</i>. Jane found herself leaning <i>against</i> Darren, with her hands on his <i>chest</i>. Both looked in each other's eyes for a second, wide-eyed and surprised, their blushing faces only <i>inches</i> from one another, sweating and breathing <i>hard</i> from jogging (Or perhaps something <i>else</i>? Don't go there!). Darren then <i>slowly</i> let Jane go, backing away from her slightly, and speaking first.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks for words:)</i> Are--you okay, Jane? I, ah--</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Gently cuts him off:)</i> --Oh, I'm fine--I should've been watching where I was, um, going, Darren. <i>(Blushes again:)</i> Uh, are <i>you</i> okay?</p>

<p>DARREN: Er, yes, I am. <i>(Chuckles uneasily:)</i> It was <i>my</i> fault. I should've seen where I was going.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Herself chuckling uneasily, then smirks:)</i> Well, er--how about if we <i>both</i> just take the blame, okay?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Smiles:)</i> Seems fair. <i>(Pauses, looks for something to talk about:)</i> So--how long have you been jogging this morning? I've been out for an hour.</p>

<p>JANE: Oh, let's see--<i>(looks up, ponders:)</i> um, about 45 minutes. I was heading back home.</p>

<p>DARREN: Same here.</p>


     <p>Jane and Darren looked at each other uncomfortably. Darren was about to say something when Jane spoke out.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(Blushes, looks away, speaks quietly:)</i> I'm--<i>sorry</i> about last night, Darren. I had <i>no</i> right--</p>  

<p>DARREN: <i>(Hesitant, then decides to go into his planned statement for when he met Jane today:)</i> --Look, Jane--you were only trying to <i>protect</i> me from that "Rocco" guy, okay? Daria told me last night that she <i>forgot</i> to tell you about me knowing some martial arts, and you didn't know, so don't <i>worry</i> about it--<i>(shrugs:) I'm</i> not. <i>(Thought v.o.: <b>More</b> lies.)</i></p> 

<p>JANE: <i>(Looks at Darren for an instant, then smirks:)</i> Nice <i>"speech"</i> there, Darren. <i>(Darren looks surprised)</i> I guess you went through a <i>hell</i> of a lot of <i>preparation</i> to get it down <i>pat</i>, so I guess I shouldn't <i>disappoint</i> you by <i>accepting</i> your <i>"comforting words of understanding". (Pauses:)</i> Okay, so I <i>didn't</i> know about the "martial arts thing"--that was still <i>no</i> excuse to do what I did. I--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Cuts her off, in an assuring tone:)</i> --Tell me, Jane--what would've happened if you <i>hadn't</i> done what you did? <i>Think</i> about it for a moment.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Ponders, shrugs:)</i> Isn't it <i>obvious</i>? You and Rocco would've gotten into a fight, <i>(sighs:)</i> and I would've seen you in <i>"action"</i>--</p>

<p>DARREN: --And possibly draw everyone <i>else</i> into the fray, maybe <i>you, Trent, Jesse</i>, and a whole host of <i>other</i> people, and we may have ended up with a full-scale <i>brawl</i>, and someone could've gotten hurt--or <i>worse</i>. Instead, you--<i>(pauses:) kissed</i> me, and Rocco backed <i>off</i>. There was no <i>harm</i> done, and <i>no</i> one got <i>hurt</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(In a quiet tone, looks down:)</i> Save for <i>Tom. (Darren looks grim, forgetting that "little" detail, and Jane notices his reaction:)</i> Hey, now it's <i>my</i> turn to make a <i>planned</i> speech. You didn't do <i>anything</i>, Darren--<i>I</i> did. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Did Daria tell you that I <i>talked</i> to Tom after he saw us?</p>

<p>DARREN: She didn't go into any <i>great</i> detail about it, but she said that you two weren't seeing each other anymore. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Look, I think I <i>know</i> what you're going to say, but for some reason, I still feel <i>awful</i> about the whole thing--I <i>really</i> do. Tom seemed to be a <i>nice</i> guy.</p> 

<p>JANE: He was--<i>is</i>. It's just that he and I started to go <i>downhill</i> in our relationship. <i>(Starts to walk toward the business district, and Darren walks beside her:)</i> We had a long talk last night, and decided to end it on <i>good</i> terms.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks contrite, talks in a quiet voice:)</i> I'm--<i>sorry</i>, Jane. I kind of--<i>understand</i> how it is to--<i>lose</i> someone that really meant a <i>lot</i> to you. <i>(Stares forward blankly, sighs)</i></p>


     <p>Jane stopped in her tracks, and Darren stopped beside her, looking at her curiously. She turned to him, staring up at Darren for a moment, then spoke in her own quiet voice.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(Hesitates:)</i> Darren, please don't get <i>angry</i> with Daria over what I'm about to say, but she told me last night about <i>Stephanie Reardon. (Darren looks at Jane with no expression)</i> Daria made me promise not to say anything to you unless you said something to me about it <i>first</i>, and in a way, I suppose that you just <i>did. (Darren then smiles weakly)</i> God, I'm <i>so</i> sorry for your loss. At least Tom and I are <i>still</i> friends, and he's said that he'll be there for <i>me</i>, and I'd be there for <i>him. Your</i> loss was far <i>greater</i> than mine.</p>


     <p>Darren stared down at Jane, took a deep breath, and spoke.</p>


<p>DARREN: It's okay, Jane--I <i>won't</i> get angry at my sister for telling you about Stephanie. I suppose that you would've found out about it sooner or later, I guess. <i>(Pauses:)</i> I know I have to get on with my life--Stephanie would've <i>wanted</i> me to. <i>(Looks up grimly, clenched teeth:)</i> I'm just--I'm just trying to figure out <i>how</i> to go on without her. <i>(Looks back down at Jane:)</i> Being here with my birth family is <i>helping</i> me do that--<i>(hesitates:)</i> that and talking to--<i>you</i> about it. <i>(Now it's Jane's turn to smile weakly) (Changes subject, grins:)</i> I don't know about <i>you</i>, but I'm <i>famished</i>. You want something for breakfast? <i>My</i> treat.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks:)</i> How can I refuse <i>that</i> offer? <i>(Pauses:)</i> What about Daria and her family? Won't they be kind of <i>worried</i> if they don't see you come back on time? <i>(Starts walking with Darren)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: No--Daria said that they all sleep <i>late</i> on Sunday mornings--I've seen that <i>first</i> hand since I've been here. Besides, I'll call them after I've eaten breakfast with you. Choose the place you want.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Ponders:)</i> How about <i>Do Me A Donut?</i> It's a couple of blocks from here. They've got a <i>mean</i> ham and cheese omelet.</p>

<p><i>(Note to reader: I believe this was the name of a cafe/restaurant where Daria and Jane met in the episode "Monster"--you know, the one where Daria imitated Quinn by saying something like, "Which is my best side, I know they both look good", and embarassed herself in front of Trent?)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Yes, I've been in there before once since I've been here. <i>Do Me A Donut</i> it is, then. <i>(Both go down the street)</i></p>


<p><i>(Fast forward to "Do Me A Donut", a little later)</i></p>


     <p>Darren and Jane were sitting in a booth beside a row of glass windows and talking casually, while the cafe was about half-full of patrons. The plates that had the ham and cheese omelets and sausages on them were long gone by now. Both had half-full glasses of orange juice on the table in front of them, and Jane was talking about Daria.</p>


<P>JANE: --And Daria in the end said, <I>(in a "Daria-type" voice:) "Never mind glasses. You can see things that other people can't. You can see better than other people. So to <B>hell</B> with them and what they think of you and your glasses."</I> So she went back to her glasses.</P>

<P><I>(Note to reader: This, of course, was said near the end of the episode "Through A Lens Darkly")</I></P>

<P>DARREN: So Daria had worn contact lenses for a day, and then went back to her glasses--but the <I>real</I> point here was that it didn't matter <I>either</I> way because Daria is just Daria with or without her glasses--it's what's on the <I>inside</I> that counts, and not what people on the <I>outside</I> may think.</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Before finishing up her glass of orange juice:)</I> Yep--that pretty much sums it up, hombre.</P> 

<P>DARREN: <I>(Arches an eyebrow:)</I> Any idea what she <I>did</I> with them? You know--maybe kept them as some sort of <I>momento</I> or something, <I>(smirks:)</I> reminding her that it's okay to be <I>human</I>?</P>

<P>JANE: <I>(Shrugs, smirks:)</I> I don't know. After that day, she never said anything about them again. I know she drives <I>without</I> them--she and Quinn came to bail me and Mystik Spiral out of jail for crossing the center line in Fremont. <I>(Note to reader: See "Speedtrapped") (Pauses:)</I> You know about that little <I>"episode"</I>, Darren?</P>

<P>DARREN: <I>(Chuckles:)</I> Actually, I do. <I>Quinn</I> told me about it sometime last week. <I>(Smirks:)</i> You weren't <i>drunk</i>, were you?</p> 

<p>JANE: <i>(Rolls her eyes, smirks:)</i> Oh, <i>that's</i> funny--maybe you're not such a <i>stick-in-the-mud guy</i> after all. <I>(Darren chuckles)</i> Nah--just that a <i>backwoods deputy</i> got <i>lucky</i> that day, and we happened to help fill his <i>quota</i>, that's all. <i>(Pauses:)</i> It seems Quinn <i>loves</i> to see we outcasts get "ours". <i>(Grins sinisterly:)</i> I really <i>laughed</i> when I heard from Daria about your saying that Quinn was <i>your</i> "cousin" to the Fashion Club, and not Daria. Boy, I bet that really rubbed Quinn the wrong way, huh?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Gives a heavy sigh:)</i> And I assumed that Daria told you how I felt <i>afterwards</i>?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Snorts:)</i> Just because Quinn threw a <i>"temper tantrum"</i>? C'mon, Darren--the only thing you did wrong was feeling <i>bad</i> about it--Daria's right--you're <i>too</i> nice. <i>(Darren cocks a quick eyebrow at that remark)</i> It's about <i>time</i> that Quinn got a piece of her <i>own</i> medicine--God <i>knows</i> how she's done <i>Daria</i> after all of these years. Maybe Quinn will finally learn that she's <i>no</i> better than anyone else.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Narrows his eyes:)</i> Jane, she's my <i>sister</i>. Though I can't condone all Quinn has done, she <i>is</i> trying to take her future <i>seriously</i> now with going to the Fashion Institute--</p>

<p>JANE: --Only because you beat the <i>crap</i> out of Joey, Jeffrey, and Jamie, which led them to spread the <i>word</i> about you, and that kept the other boys <i>away</i> from Quinn, which in turn took her mind <i>off</i> of them, and more towards her <i>studies</i>--at least that's what <i>Daria</i> said to me over the phone. <i>(Snorts:)</i> As if anyone who knows Quinn can actually <i>believe</i> that.</p> 

<p>DARREN: <i>(Cocks an eyebrow:)</i> --And you <i>don't</i>--?</p> 

<p>JANE: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Let's just say that I'm gonna need some <i>"convincing"</i>, Darren--look, Daria <i>deserves</i> to have a sister that should look up <i>to</i> her, and not down <i>on</i> her because of the way Daria <i>acts</i> and <i>looks. (Pauses, hesitates:)</i> Daria told me over the phone while I was on vacation that you said you were <i>proud</i> to be her brother. I could tell over the phone that your saying that <i>really</i> got to her, because she sounded--well, in a <i>"Daria-style"</i> emotional tone of voice--and believe me, I <i>can</i> tell--<i>happy. (Darren frowns slightly, deep in thought, then gives a quiet smile) (Jane then smirks:)</i> Of course if you <i>repeat</i> anything I just said about her <i>to</i> her, I'll <i>deny</i> it, and then <i>hunt</i> you down, and <i>kill</i> you--<i>(winks:) union</i> rules, you understand.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Chuckles:)</i> Don't worry, Jane--mum's the word. <i>(Looks at his watch as an afterthought, and his eyes go wide:) Oooboy</i>-- We've been here for almost <i>two hours</i>! I'd better call and tell everyone I'm fine. I'll be back. <i>(Slips out of the booth to a payphone on the side wall)</i></p>


     <p>Jane watched Darren go to the phone, and put her elbows on the booth table, looking around at nothing in particular. This "little" talk with Darren about her and Daria's "adventures" in Lawndale had actually gone well--both she and Darren were getting past the kissing incident, feeling <i>less</i> uncomfortable around each other, though Jane still found herself occasionally <i>staring</i> at Darren when she thought he didn't notice her doing so--Jane couldn't be sure, but she also felt Darren staring at <i>her</i> when <i>she</i> wasn't looking, either. She glanced down on the booth table and noticed the <i>tip</i> that Darren had left for the waitress sticking out from under the napkin holder on the side nearest the glass window, and cocked an <i>inquisitive</i> eyebrow at the <i>amount</i>.</p> 

     <p>In the meantime, Darren had contacted the Morgendorffers, and Daria, who was dressed in her <i>Mark Twain</i> pullover nightshirt, and eating some cereal while writing on her notepad, had answered the phone in the kitchen.</p>


<p>VOICE OF DARREN: Hey, it's me, Daria--I just wanted to call and say I was okay. I didn't mean for the time to slip by without notifying you guys.</p>

<p>DARIA: It's okay. Mom and dad are still in the sack, and as you know, Quinn doesn't come out of her beauty <i>coma</i> until the crack of noon on Sundays. <i>(Pauses:) Where</i> are you?</p>

<p>DARREN: I'm--with <i>Jane</i>. We had breakfast together and we're now just talking here at the <i>Do Me A Donut</i> cafe. I sort of--<i>"ran"</i> into her while jogging.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(After recovering from her intial shock of hearing her brother saying he was with Jane:)</i> I--see. <i>(Lowers her voice:)</i> So, um--have you two kind of--well--</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Sounding slightly <b>irritated</b>:)</i> --We talked about what happened last night, if <i>that's</i> what you're asking, and it's passed. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Jane's <i>pretty</i>--er, I mean, pretty <i>good</i> at--<i>conversing</i>. We talked about <i>general</i> stuff, and the time just <i>flew</i> by.</p>

<p>DARIA: <i>(Not totally convinced:)</i> Umm--<i>yeah</i>. So, when will you be returning so I can tell our <i>genetically-shared</i> parents when they wake up, and not to <i>sick</i> the <i>tracking dogs</i> on you, bro?</p>

<P>DARREN: Maybe about 30 minutes or so, Daria--I'll see you then. <i>(Hangs up)</i></p>


     <p>Darren went back to the booth to Jane, and remained standing.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>(Looks down at Jane:)</i> Everything's okay, Jane--I don't have to worry about Jake <i>"scouring"</i> the streets for me. You ready to go?</p> 

<p>JANE: <i>(While getting up:)</i> Ready and rarin'. <i>(Looks at tip, motions her head at it:)</i> Uh, <i>$20</i> is a lot of money to leave as a <i>tip</i> for a meal that costs about <i>$12</i>, don't you think?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Eyes slightly wide, looks for words, tries to feign surprise:) $20</i>? <i>(Reaches to get the tip, replaces it with <b>$5</b> from his pouch while Jane slides out:)</i> Whew--er, thanks for <i>noticing</i> that, Jane--I guess I was <i>so</i> into our talk, I didn't see it. <i>(Thought v.o.: <b>Old</b> habits die hard--<b>stupid</b>, Darren.)</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> No sweat. <i>(Goes with Darren to the cashier, then leaves with him)</i></p>


     <p>About 15 minutes later, Darren and Jane came up to the Lane's front porch. Jane went to the door, and looked up at Darren.</p>


<p>JANE: Well, thanks for escorting me back here, Darren. <i>(Pauses:)</i> Um--you want to come <i>in</i>? <i>(Darren slightly raises an eyebrow, which Jane adds quickly:)</i> My mom told me when I left this morning that she wanted to meet and <i>thank you</i> for saving my life. It won't take but a few minutes.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Shrugs, privately <b>relieved</b> for some reason:)</i> Sure.</p>


     <p>Both came into the living room, where Mrs. Lane happened to walk by. She stopped, stared at Darren, and cocked an eyebrow.</p>


<p>JANE: Mom, this is Darren Coverton, Daria's brother, and the guy that saved my life yesterday morning.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Reaches out to shake her hand:)</i> How do you do, Mrs. Lane.</p>


     <p>Amanda Lane simply <i>stared</i> at this <i>very</i> handsome young man, her mouth slightly agape. Darren looked at his outstretched hand, Amanda Lane, and then over at Jane a little uneasily, having seen <i>this</i> before. Jane looked at her mother and couldn't help but put her hand over mouth and surpress a <i>laugh</i>. Amanda cast a quick, rare <i>glare</i> at her daughter before regaining her composure and shook Darren's hand, smiling.</p>


<p>AMANDA: <i>(Slightly red-faced:)</i> Oh my--I'm sorry for my reaction, Darren--Jane didn't tell me you were so <i>handsome</i>.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Now himself slightly red-faced:)</i> Uh--thanks, Mrs. Lane, it's quite all right--believe me, I've had the <i>same</i> reactions from <i>other</i> women as well.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Smirks with a raised eyebrow:)</i> Oh, are we <i>flattering</i> ourselves, Darren? <i>(Thought v.o.: <b>I</b> can attest to the <b>"reactions"</b> thing.)</i></p>

<p>AMANDA: <i>(Gives her soothing, but surprised scolding voice, scowling a little at Jane:) Jane</i>!</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Laughs:) Hardly</i>, Jane. I'm merely stating a <i>fact. (Sighs:)</i> Believe me when I say that <i>"looking good"</i> isn't all that it's <i>cracked</i> up to be. It can get on one's <i>nerves</i> after a while.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Chuckles:)</i> You mind telling your sister <i>Quinn</i> that?</p>

<p>AMANDA: Now Jane dear, that's <i>enough. (Looks at Darren sincerely:)</i> I wish to thank you, Darren, for saving my daughter's life. If there's anything me or my family can ever do for you, please don't hesitate to ask. <i>(Looks at Jane:)</i> I've tried to contact your <i>father</i>, Jane, but I haven't <i>located</i> him yet, or <i>Wind, Summer, and Penny.</i></p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Mutters under her breath, rolls her eyes:)</i> So what <i>else</i> is new?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Catches a little of Jane's bitter-sounding words:)</i> Well, uh, thanks, Mrs. Lane--but that's okay. Your daughter and I have had breakfast and a long talk before we came back here--<i>(looks at Jane, gives a quick smile:)</i> just knowing I was there to help her out when she fell in that sinkhole is <i>more</i> than enough for me. <i>(Jane shows a quiet smile, gives Darren a grateful look)</i></p>

<p>AMANDA: <i>(Smiles quietly, suddenly realizes something, then gasps in her soothing voice, puts her fingers on her mouth:) Oh</i>, Jane! Does <i>Tom</i> know about what Darren <i>did</i> for you? <i>(Jane and Darren look at each other a little uncomfortably)</i> I meant to tell you that he called here last night just when I came in, and I remembered that Trent told us when he picked us up from the airport that Trent and his band was going to play at that "Zen" place later that same night. <i>I</i> told Tom that you were probably there--he said that he would <i>try</i> to go down and <i>see</i> you. <i>(Jane and Darren look red-faced) (Pauses:)</i> I then saw the <i>note</i> you left me that said that Darren had saved your life. <i>(Sighs:)</i> I just wished that I could've told Tom about <i>that</i>. Did you <i>see</i> Tom at the Zen?</p> 

<p>JANE: <i>(Sounding quiet while Darren looks away:)</i> Um, Mom--yeah, I--<i>saw</i> him--uh--I want to talk to you about that a little <i>later</i>, okay?</p>

<p>AMANDA: <i>(Waves her off, not noticing the way Jane spoke:)</i> Very well, dear--but please do it as <i>quickly</i> as possible. I have to go to an <i>"Art In Pottery"</i> show in Bannonburg in about two hours, and I won't be back until <i>very</i> late tonight. <i>(Jane sighs in an exasperated manner while Darren gives her a sympathetic look)</i> It was wonderful meeting you, Darren. Jane, I'm going to take a shower. <i>(Leaves to go upstairs)</i></p>

<p>DARREN: Same here, Mrs. Lane. <i>(Watches her leave, looks back to Jane:)</i> Er, Daria said that your family--<i>travels</i> a lot.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>Oooooh</i> yeah--this place that I call <i>"home"</i> is a regular <i>"revolving door"</i>. In one minute, out the next. It seems to me at times that Mom and dad are real <i>blurs</i>. I have to <i>strain</i> my eyes sometimes to just see either one <i>still</i> for a second. <i>You</i> ever had that sort of thing happen in <i>your</i> home with your adop--I mean, <i>parents</i>?</p>

<p>DARREN: Actually, <i>no</i>--and it's okay if <i>you</i> think of my parents as "adopted", Jane--<i>I</i> just don't. <i>(Jane smiles, sheepishly:)</i> My (adopted) parents worked <i>hard</i>, but they <i>made</i> time for me--me being what I <i>thought</i> an only child and all--they <i>showered</i> me with attention, but they didn't <i>spoil</i> me. Our off time was <i>really</i> off--they had a <i>rule</i> that any business calls <i>not</i> be made after <i>10:00 p.m.</i>, and not a minute more. I guess I was <i>lucky</i>.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Looks down:)</i> Yeah, I guess.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Changes the subject:)</i> So, uh--have you told <i>Trent</i> about what happened with Tom yet?</p>


     <p>Jane stared at Darren and gave look that said, <i>"Are you kidding</i>?", and smirked. Darren frowned slightly at Jane for a moment, perplexed, and then remembered.</p>


<p>DARREN: Oh, that's right--he's <i>still</i> asleep, isn't he?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>Bingo</i>. I'll tell 'em after he's been up for a <i>few</i> hours--it takes him a while to get <i>going</i> without his customary cup of coffee, you understand.</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Chuckles:)</i> Ah, yes, of course. Well, I'd better get going, Jane--<i>(is about to go out the front door)</i></p>

<p>JANE: --Um, Darren?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Turns to her quickly:)</i> Yes?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Looks everywhere but at Darren, a little red-faced:)</i> Er--well--I--just--wanted--to--know--if, well, uh, if that <i>kiss</i> made you feel, well--<i>(adds quickly:)</i> look, it's okay if you don't want to say <i>anything. (Her voice trails off:)</i> I didn't want to <i>embarass</i> you or something or another. <i>(Thought v.o.: Or <b>myself</b>.)</i> 


     <p>Darren's eyes slowly grew wide, and his mouth was slightly open--was Jane asking him if he <i>liked</i> that kiss? Daria tried to ask, of course, but Darren couldn't really <i>tell</i> her because he wasn't quite sure how <i>Jane</i> felt--and <i>himself</i> as well. That and the fact he could not make himself believe that something <i>did</i> happen between the two in the Zen last night--or maybe even <i>earlier</i> when they first met--was that <i>possible</i>? Darren then took on a <i>determined</i> look, and stared down at Jane. He <i>willed</i> himself to get out the words.</p>


<p>DARREN: I--well--<i>(long pause:) yes</i>, I--<i>liked</i> that kiss you gave me. <i>(Jane looks shocked beyond words)</i> I--I'm <i>sorry</i> for <i>feeling</i> that way, Jane--I didn't want to put you on the <i>spot</i> like that. <i>(Turns back to the door:)</i> I'll <i>go</i> now.</p>


     <p>Just as Darren was about to put his hand on the door handle, he saw a <i>hand</i> come from his right side, and it quickly <i>rested</i> on his. With his heart beating at a <i>furious</i> pace, he slowly turned back to Jane, who was looking up at him with a slight <i>frown</i> on her face.</p> 


<p>JANE: <i>(Tries to control her shaky voice:)</i> D-don't you <i>dare</i> leave here until you <i>hear</i> me out, Darren! Just who in the <i>hell</i> are you to tell me that you <i>liked</i> that kiss, and then try to leave me <i>hanging</i> like that--just like what you said you <i>didn't</i> want <i>me</i> to feel on the <i>"spot"</i>? Don't you want to hear how <i>I</i> felt about it?</p>

<p>DARREN: <i>(Looking contrite:)</i> I-I'm sorry, Jane--you're <i>right</i>. I'll listen to you.</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Closes her eyes, looks pained, then stares straight up into Darren's eyes:)</i> I--I <i>liked</i> that kiss too--a <i>lot. (Now it's Darren's turn to look shocked) Damn it</i>--I can't believe this is happening
--I mean, I <i>just</i> met you directly for the <i>first</i> time yesterday, and I'm--well, <i>(long pause:) attracted</i> to you! <i>(Turns and walks away from a now-dumbfounded Darren, stops in the middle of the living room, hugs herself, starts to sniffle:) Crap, crap, CRAP</i>! It was just a <i>damn</i> kiss, that's all! Why can't I get it <i>out</i> of my mind? <i>(Laughs bitterly:)</i> I told Daria that Tom had a <i>"pattern"</i> that he seemed to follow when it came to our relationship--that he tried to <i>control</i> me at times. <i>(Chokes back tears while trying to get out her words:)</i> Well, it now seems that <i>I'm</i> the one who's in a pattern. <i>(Darren looks confused)</i> You see, I seem to be the type of girl who falls for a guy on the <i>first</i> look. <i>(Snaps her fingers:)</i> Just like <i>that</i>. I tried to <i>play</i> the field to just cover my <i>loneliness</i> until <i>Daria</i> came into the picture. I then realized that I found a <i>true</i> friend in your sister--she would be there for me and vice versa--I just wanted to have a <i>friend</i>, that's all. I fell for Tom at the <i>first</i> instant--I <i>really</i> thought it was <i>right</i>. When I saw <i>you</i> the first time, without all that <i>damn</i> mud on us, I did it <i>again. (Depressed, Jane's shoulders slump, and she looks down)</i></p>


     <p>Darren reluctantly walked up behind Jane. He hesitantly put a reassuring hand on Jane's shoulder, but she seemed to not notice him, for she kept talking.</p>


<p>JANE: <i>(While still looking away from Darren:)</i> Tom and I were on the <i>skids</i> for a while, you know? We didn't even kiss all that much in the last <i>two months</i> or so. <i>(Pauses:)</i> When I kissed you, I put <i>all</i> of myself into it because I hadn't done it like <i>that</i> for awhile--<i>(becomes sarcastic:)</i> that and the fact that you saved my <i>life</i> kind of <i>contributed</i> to it, too! <i>(Turns to him, a slight <b>tear</b> coming down her cheek:)</i> I was so damn <i>selfish</i> to kiss you in that manner! What would've happened if your girlfriend--<i>fiancee</i>, was <i>alive</i>? <i>How</i> would've she <i>reacted</i>? I could've maybe <i>pecked</i> you on the <i>cheek</i> when Rocco wanted to fight you! But noooo--I <i>wanted</i> to kiss you like that!</p> 

<p>DARREN:<i>(In a completely calm manner:)</i> Jane, when you kissed me, it--well, kind of brought back memories of <i>Stephanie</i>--but I also know that Stephanie is <i>gone</i>. So what I'm saying is, is that the kiss I felt came from--<i>you</i>, and you only--<i>not</i> Stephanie. <i>(Jane looks at him, deep in thought, and Darren chuckles quietly:)</i> I had the <i>same</i> feelings that you did concerning <i>Tom</i>--I mean, how would <i>he</i> react to it? <i>(Jane's about to say something, but Darren gently holds up his finger to cut her off:)</i> Let <i>me</i> finish, now. I know <i>now</i> that the relationship you two shared is <i>over</i> following your conversation last night, and while it's true that I didn't see what you did coming, I <i>allowed</i> you to <i>continue</i> the kiss--I didn't--I didn't <i>push</i> you away. <i>(Pauses, sighs:)</i> Truth is, I guess I <i>wanted</i> you to do it for my own <i>selfish</i> reasons, too. <i>(Looks down at Jane after a moment:)</i> You say that you're <i>attracted</i> to me, right?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(After a moment, wipes her eye:)</i> Yeah, I did--<i>so</i>?</p>

<p>DARREN: Are you <i>afraid</i> that the <i>same</i> thing might happen if you and I get--well--<i>involved</i>--you know, falling for a guy on the <i>"first"</i> look?</p>

<p>JANE: <i>(Shrugs:)</i> Maybe--maybe not. <i>(Hesitates:)</i> Are you--well--are you saying that you <i>want</i> to get involved with me? <i>(Darren frowns slightly, thinks:)</i> What about <i>Daria</i> and the other members of the Morgendorffer clan? How will <i>they</i> react? <i>(Pauses, carefully chooses her next words to speak:)</i> Are--are you attracted to <i>me</i>, Darren?</p>


     <p>Darren paused for a moment, then gave a weak smile.</p>


<p>DARREN: <i>Yes</i>, I am, Jane. <i>(Jane's mouth slightly opens--she's <b>heard</b> it with her own two ears, silently <b>delighted</b>)</i> I don't know what Daria and the other members of my birth family might say, but it's <i>my</i> life, and <i>not</i> their's. <i>(Pauses:)</i> What--what do we do <i>now</i>?</p>


     <p>Jane stared up at Darren, and gave a <i>wicked</i> smirk. Darren's eyes grew slightly wide, and he suddenly knew the answer as soon as he had asked it. She put her arms around his neck, and pulled him down to her, and started to <i>kiss</i> him. Darren at first reluctantly put his arms around Jane's lower back, then held her tighter, and <i>returned</i> the kiss. This time, there was <i>no</i> reluctance--no, none at <i>all</i>.</p>
